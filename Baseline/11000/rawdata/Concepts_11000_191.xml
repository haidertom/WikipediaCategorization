The '''Ahimsa Award''' is an annual award given by Institute of Jainology in recognition of individuals who embody and promote the principles of [[Ahimsa]] ([[Non-violence]]). It was established in 2006 and has since been awarded at the annual “Ahimsa Day” event, on October 2, the birth anniversary of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banks|first=Marcus|title=Organizing Jainism in India and England|journal=Oxford Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology series|date=1992|volume=3|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is normally held at the [[Palace of Westminster]] - [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in London where various members of Parliament are invited to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Ashworth MP spoke at the Ahimsa Day celebrations in London|url=http://www.jonashworth.org/jon_ashworth_news_10_12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bestowed by the Directors of the Institute of Jainology, an international body based in UK, representing the [[Jainism]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directors of the Institute of Jainology|url=http://www.jainology.org/contact-us/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event takes place in early October to commemorate the birth anniversary of [[Mahatma Gandhi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rao |first=M.S. |title=Messenger of Non-Violence and World Peace |url=http://www.unpost.org/gandhi-messenger-non-violence-world-peace/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005023547/http://www.unpost.org/gandhi-messenger-non-violence-world-peace/ |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who amongst other great leaders was inspired by the Jain philosophy of 'ahimsa'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jainism - Only One Way Out|url=http://www.india-religion.net/jainism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the United Nations declared that the [[International Day of Non-Violence]] would take place on 2 October, the birth date of Mahatma Gandhi. This annual event highlights the principle of non-violence and the worldwide desire for peace.

== History &amp; Background ==

[[Ahimsa]], (The principle of non-violence), is a concept adopted by most Indic traditions, primarily [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] and [[Jain]] philosophy . The political and social application of Ahimsa was given universal recognition by Mahatma Gandhi who fought the campaign for the independence of India with the doctrine of ahimsa as the cornerstone.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pare, Lexington Books, 2000 "Gandhi, Freedom, and Self-Rule"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahimsa in Jainism]], is a well-established core principle even before the time of [[Mahavira]], the 24th [[Thirthankara]] in the 5th century BC,.&lt;ref&gt;Goyala, Śrīrāma (1987). "A history of Indian Buddhism". Kusumanjali Prakashan. pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of [[Ahimsa in Jainism]] states that one should do no harm by word, thought or deed, nor ask others to, and nor condone that which is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaini|first=Padmanbh S|title=The Jaina Path of Purification|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas|isbn=8120815785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annie Lee Wilkerson Cooper''' (June 2, 1910 – November 24, 2010) was an African-American [[civil rights activist]] in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery march|Selma Voting Rights Movement]] who is best known for punching [[Dallas County, Alabama]] Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]].

==Life and work==
Annie Lee Cooper was born on June 2, 1910 as Annie Lee Wilkerson in Selma, Alabama, one of ten children of Lucy Jones and Charles Wilkerson Sr. By the seventh grade, Cooper dropped out of school, and moved to [[Kentucky]] to live with an older sister.&lt;ref name="Cooper100"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20100602/NEWS02/6020357/Woman-known-run-sheriff-turns-100-today|title=Woman known for run-in with sheriff turns 100 today |work=[[Montgomery Advertiser]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=June 2, 2010|accessdate=November 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107203740/http://archive.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20100602/NEWS02/6020357/Woman-known-run-sheriff-turns-100-today|archivedate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Cooper returned to Selma to care for her elderly mother.&lt;ref name="Jet Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|title=none|last1=Britton|first1=John H.|work=Jet Magazine|date=February 11, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appalled by the fact that although she had been a registered voter in Pennsylvania and Ohio she was unable to register to vote in Alabama, Cooper began to participate in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selmatimesjournal.com/2010/12/03/annie-l-cooper-huff-2/|title=Annie L. Cooper Huff Obituary|newspaper=[[Selma Times-Journal]]|date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her attempt to register to vote in 1963 resulted in her being fired from her job as a nurse at a rest home.&lt;ref name="Jet Magazine"/&gt; She then worked as a clerk at the Torch Motel.

In January 1965, Cooper stood in line for hours outside the [[Dallas County Courthouse (Alabama)|Dallas County Courthouse]] to register to vote until Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]] ordered her to vacate the premises. Clark prodded Cooper in the neck with a [[billy club]] until Cooper turned around and hit the sheriff in the jaw, knocking him down. Deputies then wrestled Cooper to the ground as Clark continued to beat her repeatedly with his club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/06/AR2007060602455.html | title=Ala. Sheriff James Clark; Embodied Violent Bigotry |last=Bernstein |first=Adam |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=June 7, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper was charged with "criminal provocation" and was escorted to the county jail, and then held for 11 hours before being allowed to leave. She spent the period of her incarceration singing spirituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=May|first1=Gary|title=Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy|date=2013|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some in the sheriff's department wanted to charge her with attempted murder.&lt;ref name="Cooper death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selmatimesjournal.com/2010/11/24/annie-lee-cooper-civil-rights-legend-dies/ |title=Annie Lee Cooper, civil rights legend, dies |publisher=''Selma Times-Journal'' |date=November 24, 2010 |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this incident, Cooper became a registered voter in her home state.&lt;ref name="Cooper100" /&gt;

On June 2, 2010, Annie Lee Cooper became a [[centenarian]]. Reflecting on her longevity, she stated, "My mother lived to be 106, so maybe I can live that long, too."&lt;ref name="Cooper100" /&gt; She died on November 24, 2010, at the Vaughan Regional Medical Center in Selma, Alabama.&lt;ref name="Cooper death" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 2014 film ''[[Selma (film)|Selma]]'', Cooper was portrayed by [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/oprah-winfrey-star-civil-rights-drama-selma-article-1.1825391 | title=Oprah Winfrey to play Annie Lee Cooper in civil rights drama 'Selma' | last=Rivera | first=Zayda | publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]'' | date=20 June 2014 | accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winfrey said that she took the role "because of the magnificence of Annie Lee Cooper and what her courage meant to an entire movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/609922/oprah-winfrey-opens-up-about-her-violent-scene-in-selma-watch-now|author= Marc Malkin|title=Oprah Winfrey Opens Up About Her Violent Scene in Selma|publisher=E!

The earliest classical Sanskrit works on Ayurveda describe medicine as being divided into eight components (Skt.

The central theoretical ideas of Ayurveda developed in the mid-first millennium BCE, and show parallels with [[Sāṅkhya]] and [[Vaiśeṣika]] philosophies, as well as with [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Studies on Indian Medical History|last = Comba|first = Antonella|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Delhi|pages = 39–55|editor-last = Meulenbeld|editor-first = G.

Ayurveda names seven basic tissues ([[Dhatu (Ayurveda)|dhatu]]), which are plasma (''rasa''), blood (''rakta''), muscles (''māmsa''), fat (''meda''), bone (''asthi''), [[Bone marrow|marrow]] (''majja''), and semen (''shukra''). Like the medicine of classical antiquity, Ayurveda has historically divided bodily substances into five [[Classical element#Classical elements in Hinduism|classical elements]], (Sanskrit) ''[[panchamahabhuta]]'', viz. [[Prithvi|earth]], [[Ap (water)|water]], [[Agni|fire]], [[Vayu|air]] and [[ether (classical element)|ether]].&lt;ref name="Underwood&amp;Rhodes(2008)" /&gt; There are also twenty [[guna]]s (qualities or characteristics) which are considered to be inherent in all matter. These are organized in ten pairs: heavy/light, cold/hot, unctuous/dry, dull/sharp, stable/mobile, soft/hard, non-slimy/slimy, smooth/coarse, minute/gross, and viscous/liquid.&lt;ref name="Chopra76"&gt;{{harvnb|Chopra|2003|p=76}}, citing Sushrutasamhita 25.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ama (a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning "uncooked" or "undigested" ) is used to refer to the concept of anything that exists in a state of incomplete transformation. With regards to [[oral hygiene]], it is claimed to be a toxic byproduct generated by improper or incomplete [[digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ayurvedic Tongue Diagnosis |chapter=Ama and Disease |last=Kacera |first=Walter |pages=159–176 |year=2007 |publisher=Lotus Press |isbn=978-0-940985-77-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijdr.in/article.asp?issn=0970-9290;year=2008;volume=19;issue=1;spage=52;epage=61;aulast=Amruthesh Dentistry and Ayurveda - IV: Classification and management of common oral diseases]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=09709290&amp;AN=26214672&amp;h=GMGOeADM0ninrhhxr%2fSXhfQeebinOTF7ejtyDiosA5NtRLAqkL5aoJRGYL%2f6N7kdeYs%2fKaM6HfhKIV1OtQA2eA%3d%3d&amp;crl=c Dentistry and Ayurveda--III (basics - ama, immunity, ojas, rasas, etiopathogenesis and prevention)]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has no equivalent in [[standard medicine]]. 

Ayurveda also names three elemental bodily humors, the ''doshas'' (called Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and states that a balance of the doshas results in health, while imbalance results in disease. One Ayurvedic view is that the doshas are balanced when they are equal to each other, while another view is that each human possesses a unique combination of the doshas which define this person's temperament and characteristics. In either case, it says that each person should modulate their behavior or environment to increase or decrease the doshas and maintain their natural state.

In medieval taxonomies of the Sanskrit knowledge systems, Ayurveda is assigned a place as a subsidiary [[Veda]] ([[upaveda]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madhusūdanasarasvatī|title=प्रस्थानभेदः श्रीमधुसूदनसरस्वत्या विरचितः|date=1912|publisher=श्रीवाणिविलासमुद्रायन्त्रालय|location=श्रीरङ्गम्|page=14|url=https://archive.org/stream/Prasthanabheda.by.Madhusudana.Sarasvati#page/n15/mode/2up|accessdate=16 October 2015|language=Sanskrit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medicinal plant names  from the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' and other Vedas can be found in subsequent Ayurveda literature.&lt;ref name="zysk-veda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zysk|first1=Kenneth G.|title=Medicine in the {Veda}: Religious Healing in the {Veda} with Translations and Annotations of Medical Hymns from the {Rgveda and the Atharvaveda} and Renderings from the Corresponding Ritual Texts|date=2010|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8120814011}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded theoretical statements about the canonical models of disease in Ayurveda occur in the earliest [[Buddhist Canon]].&lt;ref name="zysk-asce"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zysk|first1=Kenneth G.|title=Asceticism and Healing in Ancient {India}: Medicine in the {Buddhist} Monastery|date=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-208-1507-0}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Ayurvedic doctors regard physical existence, mental existence, and personality as a unit, with each element being able to influence the others.{{clarify|date=January 2015}} This is a [[Holism#Medicine|holistic]] approach used during diagnosis and therapy, and is a fundamental aspect of Ayurveda. Another part of Ayurvedic treatment says that there are channels (''srotas'') which transport fluids, and that the channels can be opened up by massage treatment using oils and [[Swedana]] (fomentation). Unhealthy, or blocked, channels are thought to cause disease.&lt;ref name="WujastykXIX-XX"&gt;{{harvnb|Wujastyk|2003|pages=XIX–XX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnosis ===
Ayurveda has eight ways to diagnose illness, called [[Nadi (yoga)|Nadi]] (pulse), Mootra (urine), [[Malas (Ayurveda)|Mala]] (stool), Jihva (tongue), Shabda (speech), Sparsha (touch), Druk (vision), and Aakruti (appearance).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Treatment and prevention ===
Two of the eight branches of classical Ayurveda deal with surgery (''Śalya-cikitsā'' and ''Śālākya-tantra''), but contemporary Ayurveda tends to stress attaining vitality by building a healthy [[metabolism|metabolic system]] and maintaining good [[digestion]] and [[excretion]].&lt;ref name="Chopra76" /&gt; Ayurveda also focuses on exercise, [[yoga]], and [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="encarta-ayurveda"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Encarta]]|year=2008|url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761596196/Ayurveda.html |publisher=[[Microsoft]]|location=Redmond, WA|title=Ayurveda|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028105549/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761596196/Ayurveda.html|archivedate=28 October 2009|author= Microsoft Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of prescription is a [[Sattvic diet]].

Ayurveda follows the concept of [[Dinacharya]], which says that natural cycles (waking, sleeping, working, meditation etc.) are important for health. Hygiene, including regular bathing, cleaning of teeth, [[tongue scraping]], skin care, and eye washing, is also a central practice.&lt;ref name="Underwood&amp;Rhodes(2008)" /&gt;

===Substances used===
Plant-based treatments in Ayurveda may be derived from roots, leaves, fruits, bark, or seeds such as [[cardamom]] and [[cinnamon]]. In the 19th century, William Dymock and co-authors summarized hundreds of plant-derived medicines along with the uses, microscopic structure, chemical composition, toxicology, prevalent myths and stories, and relation to commerce in [[British India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/36345#page/1/mode/1up Pharmacographia Indica], A history of principal drugs of vegetable origin in British India - Volume 1, William Dymock et al. (1890), London&lt;/ref&gt; Animal products used in Ayurveda include milk, bones, and [[gallstone]]s. In addition, fats are prescribed both for consumption and for external use. Consumption of minerals, including [[sulphur]], [[arsenic]], lead, [[copper sulfate]] and gold, are also prescribed.&lt;ref name="Underwood&amp;Rhodes(2008)" /&gt; The addition of minerals to herbal medicine is called ''[[rasa shastra]]''.

Ayurveda uses alcoholic beverages called ''Madya'',&lt;ref name="IJTNJAN07"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sekar, S. |year=2007|title=Traditional alcoholic beverages from Ayurveda and their role on human health |journal=Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge |volume=6|issue=1|pages=144–149 |url=http://www.niscair.res.in/sciencecommunication/ResearchJournals/rejour/ijtk/Fulltextsearch/2007/January%202007/IJTK-Vol%206%281%29-January%202007-pp%20144-149.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218110751/http://www.niscair.res.in/sciencecommunication/ResearchJournals/rejour/ijtk/Fulltextsearch/2007/January%202007/IJTK-Vol%206%281%29-January%202007-pp%20144-149.htm |archivedate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are said to adjust the doshas by increasing Pitta and reducing Vatta and Kapha.&lt;ref name="IJTNJAN07" /&gt; Madya are classified by the raw material and fermentation process, and the categories include: sugar-based, fruit-based, cereal-based, cereal-based with herbs, fermentated with vinegar, and tonic wines. The intended outcomes can include causing purgation, improving digestion or taste, creating dryness, or loosening joints. Ayurvedic texts describe Madya as non-viscid and fast-acting, and say that it enters and cleans minute pores in the body.&lt;ref name="IJTNJAN07" /&gt;

In this drug, the respiratory depressant action of opium is counteracted by the respiratory stimulant property of Camphor.&lt;ref name="IJHS051981" /&gt; Later books have included the narcotic property for use as analgesic pain reliever.&lt;ref name="IJHS051981" /&gt;

''[[Cannabis indica]]'' is also absent from the ancient Ayurveda books, and is first mentioned in the ''Sarngadhara Samhita'' as a treatment for diarrhea.&lt;ref name="IJHS051981" /&gt; In the ''Bhaisajya Ratnavali'' it is named as an ingredient in an aphrodisiac.&lt;ref name="IJHS051981" /&gt;

Ayurveda says that both oil and tar can be used to stop bleeding,&lt;ref name="Underwood&amp;Rhodes(2008)" /&gt; and that traumatic bleeding can be stopped by four different methods: [[ligature (medicine)|ligation]] of the [[blood vessel]], [[cauterisation]] by heat, use of preparations to facilitate [[Blood clot|clotting]], and use of preparations to [[Vasoconstriction|constrict]] the blood vessels. Oils are also used in a number of ways, including regular consumption, anointing, smearing, head massage, application to affected areas,&lt;ref name="WujastykXX"&gt;{{harvnb|Wujastyk|2003|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2015}} and [[oil pulling]]. Liquids may also be poured on the patient's forehead, a technique called [[shirodhara]].

Traditional medicine, including Ayurveda,  contributes significantly to the health status of many communities, and is increasingly used within certain communities in developed countries. Traditional medicine has a long history of use in health maintenance and in disease prevention and treatment, particularly for chronic diseases.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Suitable recognition of traditional medicine is an important element of national health policies and has as well important basis for new products with significant export potential.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; WTO, WIPO and WHO ask for respect for both the economic value and the social and cultural significance of traditional knowledge and supports documentation of traditional medical knowledge and enhanced regulation of quality, safety and efficacy of such products.

The Sri Lankan tradition of Ayurveda is similar to the Indian tradition. Practitioners of Ayurveda in Sri Lanka refer to Sanskrit texts which are common to both countries. However, they do differ in some aspects, particularly in the herbs used.

In 1980, the Sri Lankan government established a Ministry of Indigenous Medicine to revive and regulate Ayurveda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayurveda.gov.lk/dept.html |title=Ministry of Indigenous Medicine |accessdate=2 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214094513/http://www.ayurveda.gov.lk/dept.html |archivedate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Indigenous Medicine (affiliated to the [[University of Colombo]]) offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and MD degrees in Ayurveda Medicine and Surgery, and similar degrees in unani medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iim.cmb.ac.lk/ |title=Institute of indigenous Medicine |publisher=Iim.cmb.ac.lk |accessdate= 21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the public system, there are currently 62 Ayurvedic hospitals and 208 central dispensaries, which served about 3 million people (about 11% of Sri Lanka's population) in 2010.

According to the [[Mahavamsa]], an ancient chronicle of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] royalty from the sixth century C.E., King [[Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka]] (reigned 437 BCE to 367 BCE) had lying-in-homes and Ayurvedic hospitals (Sivikasotthi-Sala) built in various parts of the country.

Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine developed during antiquity and the medieval period, and as such is comparable to pre-modern [[traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese]] and [[Medieval medicine of Western Europe|European]] systems of medicine. However, beginning in the 1960s, Ayurveda has been advertised as [[alternative medicine]] in the Western world. Due to different laws and medical regulations in the rest of the world, the unregulated practice and commercialisation of Ayurveda have raised ethical and legal issues. In some instances, Ayurvedic practices or terminology have also been adapted specifically for Western consumption, notably in the case of "[[Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health|Maharishi Ayurveda]]" in the 1980s. In some cases, this involved active fraud on the part of proponents of Ayurveda in an attempt to falsely represent the system as equal to the standards of modern [[medical research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Skolnick, Andrew A. | year = 1991 | title=The Maharishi Caper: Or How to Hoodwink Top Medical Journals | journal = ScienceWriters: The Newsletter of the National Association of Science Writers | issue = Fall | format = print | url = http://www.aaskolnick.com/naswmav.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716041551/http://www.aaskolnick.com/naswmav.htm | archivedate=16 July 2008 |authorlink=Andrew A.

[[Baba Hari Dass]] was an early proponent who helped bring Ayurveda to the US in the early 1970s. He taught classes derived from the ''Suśrutha Saṃhitā'' and the ''Charaka Saṃhitha'', leading to the establishment of the [[Mount Madonna Institute]], College of Ayurveda, Ayurveda World, and Ayurvedic pharmacy.{{clarify|date=January 2015}} He invited several notable Ayurvedic teachers, including [[Vasant Lad]], Sarita Shrestha, and Ram Harsh Singh. The Ayurvedic practitioner Michael Tierra wrote that "[t]he history of Ayurveda in North America will always owe a debt to the selfless contributions of Baba Hari Dass."&lt;ref&gt;Karta Purkh Singh Khalsa and Michael Tierra: "Independently, we both first learned Ayurvedic medicine from our respective spiritual mentors – myself with Baba Hari Dass and K.P., with Yogi Bhajan."

In the United States, the practice of Ayurveda is not licensed or regulated by any state. Practitioners of Ayurveda can be licensed in other healthcare fields such as [[massage therapy]] or [[midwifery]], and a few states have approved schools teaching Ayurveda.&lt;ref name="nihintro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/ayurveda/introduction.htm|title=Ayurvedic Medicine: An Introduction|work=NCCIH|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayurvedic practitioners argue that the toxicity of [[bhasma]]s comes from improper manufacturing processes, contaminants, improper use of Ayurvedic medicine, quality of raw materials and that the end products and improper procedures are used by charlatans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Main texts===
There are three principal early texts on Ayurveda, the [[Charaka Samhita]], the [[Sushruta Samhita]] and the Bhela Samhita. The Sushruta Samhita is based on an original from the 6th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pharmacognosy: An Indian perspective|page=2|author=K.

The [[Bower Manuscript]] includes of excerpts from the Bheda Samhita&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Science and Technology in Ancient India: Formation of the theoretical fundamentals of natural science|page=153|author=Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its description of concepts in Central Asian Buddhism. In 1987, A. F. R. Hoernle identified the scribe of the medical portions of the manuscript to be a native of India using a northern variant of the Gupta script, who had migrated and become a Buddhist monk in a monastery in Kucha. The Chinese pilgrim [[Fa Hsien]] (c. 337–422 AD) wrote about the healthcare system of the Gupta empire (320–550) and described the institutional approach of Indian medicine. This is also visible in the works of Charaka, who describes  hospitals and how they should be equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA543&amp;dq=Charaka+hospital#v=onepage&amp;q=Charaka%20hospital&amp;f=false|author=Upinder Singh|publisher=Pearson|year=2008|isbn=9788131711200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of colonial British rule of India, the practice of Ayurveda was neglected by the British Indian Government, in favor of modern medicine. After Indian independence, there was more focus on Ayurveda and other traditional medical systems. Ayurveda became a part of the Indian National health care system, with state hospitals for Ayurveda established across the country. However, the treatments of traditional medicines were not always integrated with others.&lt;ref name="who01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review| publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO)|url= http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2943e/8.4.html|accessdate=June 24, 2014|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive psychology ==
In [[cognitive psychology]], a '''basic category''' is a category at a particular level of the category inclusion hierarchy (i.e., a particular level of generality) that is preferred by humans in  learning and memory tasks.  The term is associated with the work of psychologist [[Eleanor Rosch]], who demonstrated basic category preferences in a number of classic experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://commonweb.unifr.ch/artsdean/pub/gestens/f/as/files/4610/9778_083247.pdf|title=Principles of Categorization|last=Rosch|first=Elizabeth|date=1978|website=Unifr.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics ==
In 2016, Tom Leinster published the '''Basic Category Theory''' which seeks for universal properties that govern in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |arxiv= 1612.09375 |title= Basic Category Theory |last=Leinster |first=Tom |date= 30 December 2016 |archive-url=|archive-date= |dead-url= }} Accessed 5 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Butterfly-FFT.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Signal-flow graph]] connecting the inputs ''x'' (left) to the outputs ''y'' that depend on them (right) for a "butterfly" step of a radix-2 Cooley–Tukey FFT.  This diagram resembles a [[butterfly]] (as in the [[Morpho (butterfly)|morpho butterfly]] shown for comparison), hence the name, although in some countries it is also called the hourglass diagram.]] In the context of [[fast Fourier transform]] algorithms, a '''butterfly''' is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller [[discrete Fourier transform]]s (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms).  The name "butterfly" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case, as described below.&lt;ref name=Oppenheim89&gt;Alan V. Oppenheim, Ronald W. Schafer, and John R. Buck, ''Discrete-Time Signal Processing'', 2nd edition (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest occurrence in print of the term is thought to be in a 1969 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] technical report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=C. J. Weinstein |date=1969-11-21 |title=Quantization Effects in Digital Filters |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0706862 |publisher=[[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]] |page=42 |accessdate=2015-02-10 |quote=This computation, referred to as a 'butterfly' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathoverflow.net/a/98804 |title=FFT and Butterfly Diagram|last= Cipra  |first= Barry A.  |author-link = Barry A. Cipra|date=2012-06-04 |website=mathoverflow.net |access-date=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same structure can also be found in the [[Viterbi algorithm]], used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.

Most commonly, the term "butterfly" appears in the context of the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]], which [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of [[composite number|composite]] size ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''rm'' into ''r'' smaller transforms of size ''m'' where ''r'' is the "radix" of the transform.  These smaller DFTs are then combined via size-''r'' butterflies, which themselves are DFTs of size ''r'' (performed ''m'' times on corresponding outputs of the sub-transforms) pre-multiplied by [[root of unity|roots of unity]] (known as [[twiddle factor]]s).  (This is the "decimation in time" case; one can also perform the steps in reverse, known as "decimation in frequency", where the butterflies come first and are post-multiplied by twiddle factors.  See also the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT]] article.)

==Radix-2 butterfly diagram==
In the case of the radix-2 Cooley–Tukey algorithm, the butterfly is simply a DFT of size-2 that takes two inputs (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) (corresponding outputs of the two sub-transforms) and gives two outputs (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) by the formula (not including [[twiddle factor]]s):

:&lt;math&gt;y_0 = x_0 + x_1 \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = x_0 - x_1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

If one draws the data-flow diagram for this pair of operations, the (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) to (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) lines cross and resemble the wings of a [[butterfly]], hence the name (see also the illustration at right).

[[Image:DIT-FFT-butterfly.png|thumb|300px|right|A decimation-in-time radix-2 FFT breaks a length-''N'' DFT into two length-''N''/2 DFTs followed by a combining stage consisting of many butterfly operations.]]
More specifically, a radix-2 decimation-in-time FFT algorithm on ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; inputs with respect to a primitive ''n''-th root of unity &lt;math&gt;\omega^k_n = e^{-\frac{2\pi i k}{n}}&lt;/math&gt; relies on O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') butterflies of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;y_0 = x_0 + x_1 \omega^k_n \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_1 = x_0 - x_1 \omega^k_n, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is an integer depending on the part of the transform being computed. Whereas the corresponding inverse transform can mathematically be performed by replacing ''&amp;omega;'' with ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (and possibly multiplying by an overall scale factor, depending on the normalization convention), one may also directly invert the butterflies:

:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = \frac{1}{2} (y_0 + y_1) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = \frac{\omega^{-k}_n}{2} (y_0 - y_1), \, &lt;/math&gt;

corresponding to a decimation-in-frequency FFT algorithm.

==Other uses==
The butterfly can also be used to improve the randomness of large arrays of partially random numbers, by bringing every 32 or 64 bit word into causal contact with every other word through a desired hashing algorithm, so that a change in any one bit has the possibility of changing all the bits in the large array.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation | last1=Press | first1=WH | last2=Teukolsky | first2=SA | last3=Vetterling | first3=WT | last4=Flannery | first4=BP | year=2007 | title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press |  publication-place=New York | isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 | chapter=Section 7.2 Completely Hashing a Large Array | chapter-url=http://apps.nrbook.com/empanel/index.html#pg=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9086">'''Chu spaces''' generalize the notion of [[topological space]] by dropping the requirements that the set of [[open sets]] be closed under [[Union (set theory)|union]] and finite [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], that the open sets be extensional, and that the membership predicate (of points in open sets) be two-valued. The definition of [[continuous function]] remains unchanged other than having to be worded carefully to continue to make sense after these generalizations.

The name is due to Po-Hsiang Chu, who originally constructed a verification of autonomous categories as a graduate student under the direction of [[michael Barr (mathematician)|Michael Barr]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/papers/chu-hist.pdf ''The Chu Construction: History of an Idea] Michael Barr McGill University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Understood statically, a Chu space (''A'', ''r'', ''X'') over a set ''K'' consists of a set ''A'' of points, a set ''X'' of states, and a function ''r'' : ''A'' &amp;times; ''X'' → ''K''. This makes it an ''A'' &amp;times; ''X'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with entries drawn from ''K'', or equivalently a ''K''-valued [[binary relation]] between ''A'' and ''X'' (ordinary binary relations being 2-valued).

Understood dynamically, Chu spaces transform in the manner of topological spaces, with ''A'' as the set of points, ''X'' as the set of open sets, and ''r'' as the membership relation between them, where ''K'' is the set of all possible degrees of membership of a point in an open set.  The counterpart of a continuous function from (''A'', ''r'', ''X'') to (''B'', ''s'', ''Y'') is a pair (''f'', ''g'') of functions ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'', ''g'' : ''Y'' → ''X'' satisfying the ''adjointness condition'' ''s''(''f''(''a''), ''y'') = ''r''(''a'', ''g''(''y'')) for all ''a'' ∈ ''A'' and ''y'' ∈ ''Y''.  That is, ''f'' maps points forwards at the same time as ''g'' maps states backwards.  The adjointness condition makes ''g'' the inverse image function ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the choice of ''X'' for the [[codomain]] of ''g'' corresponds to the requirement for continuous functions that the inverse image of open sets be open.  Such a pair is called a Chu transform or morphism of Chu spaces.

A topological space (''X'', ''T'') where ''X'' is the set of points and ''T'' the set of open sets, can be understood as a Chu space (''X'',∈,''T'') over {0,&amp;nbsp;1}.  That is, the points of the topological space become those of the Chu space while the open sets become states and the membership relation "&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;" between points and open sets is made explicit in the Chu space. The condition that the set of open sets be closed under arbitrary (including empty) union and finite (including empty) intersection becomes the corresponding condition on the columns of the matrix.  A continuous function ''f'':&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''X''' between two topological spaces becomes an adjoint pair (''f'',''g'') in which ''f'' is now paired with a realization of the continuity condition constructed as an explicit witness function ''g'' exhibiting the requisite open sets in the domain of ''f''.

==Categorical structure==

The category of Chu spaces over ''K'' and their maps is denoted by '''Chu'''('''Set''', ''K'').  As is clear from the symmetry of the definitions, it is a [[self-dual category]]: it is equivalent (in fact isomorphic) to its dual, the category obtained by reversing all the maps.  It is furthermore a [[*-autonomous category]] with dualizing object (''K'', λ, {*}) where λ : ''K'' &amp;times; {*} → ''K'' is defined by λ(''k'', *) = ''k'' (Barr 1979).  As such it is a model of [[Jean-Yves Girard]]'s [[linear logic]] (Girard 1987).

==Variants==

The more general [[enriched category]] '''Chu'''(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''k'') originally appeared in an appendix to Barr (1979).  The Chu space concept originated with [[Michael Barr (mathematician)|Michael Barr]] and the details were developed by his student Po-Hsiang Chu, whose master's thesis formed the appendix.  Ordinary Chu spaces arise as the case ''V'' = '''Set''', that is, when the [[monoidal category]] ''V'' is specialized to the [[cartesian closed category]] '''Set''' of sets and their functions, but were not studied in their own right until more than a decade after the appearance of the more general enriched notion.  A variant of Chu spaces, called [[dialectica space]]s, due to {{harvtxt|de Paiva|1989}} replaces the map condition (1) with the map condition (2):

# ''s''(''f''(''a''), ''y'') = ''r''(''a'', ''g''(''y'')).
# ''s''(''f''(''a''), ''y'') ≤ ''r''(''a'', ''g''(''y'')).

==Universality==

The category '''Top''' of topological spaces and their continuous functions embeds in '''Chu'''('''Set''',&amp;nbsp;2) in the sense that there exists a full and faithful functor ''F'' : '''Top''' → '''Chu'''('''Set''',&amp;nbsp;2) providing for each topological space (''X'', ''T'') its ''representation'' ''F''((''X'', ''T'')) = (''X'', ∈, ''T'') as noted above.  This representation is moreover a ''realization'' in the sense of Pultr and Trnková (1980), namely that the representing Chu space has the same set of points as the represented topological space and transforms in the same way via the same functions.

Chu spaces are remarkable for the wide variety of familiar structures they realize.  Lafont and Streicher (1991) point out that Chu spaces over 2 realize both topological spaces and [[coherent space]]s (introduced by J.-Y. Girard (1987) to model linear logic), while Chu spaces over ''K'' realize any category of vector spaces over a field whose cardinality is at most that of ''K''.  This was extended by [[Vaughan Pratt]] (1995) to the realization of ''k''-ary relational structures by Chu spaces over 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.  For example, the category '''Grp''' of groups and their homomorphisms is realized by '''Chu'''('''Set''',&amp;nbsp;'''8''') since the group multiplication can be organized as a [[triadic relation|ternary relation]].  '''Chu'''('''Set''',&amp;nbsp;2) realizes a wide range of ``logical`` structures such as semilattices, distributive lattices, complete and completely distributive lattices, Boolean algebras, complete atomic Boolean algebras, etc.  Further information on this and other aspects of Chu spaces, including their application to the modeling of concurrent behavior, may be found at ''[http://chu.stanford.edu/ Chu Spaces]''.

==Applications==

===Automata===
Chu spaces can serve as a model of concurrent computation in [[automata theory]] to express branching time and true [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]. Chu spaces exhibit the quantum mechanical phenomena of complementarity and uncertainty. The complementarity arises as the duality of information and time, automata and schedules, and states and events. Uncertainty arises when a measurement is defined to be a [[morphism]] such that increasing structure in the observed object reduces the clarity of observation. This uncertainty can be calculated numerically from its form factor to yield the usual [[Heisenberg uncertainty]] relation. Chu spaces correspond to [[wavefunctions]] as vectors of [[Hilbert space]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=363682&amp;isnumber=8339&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]], the '''comprehension''' of an object is the totality of [[intension]]s, that is, attributes, characters, marks, properties, or qualities, that the object possesses, or else the totality of intensions that are [[relevance|pertinent]] to the  context of a given discussion.  This is the correct technical term for the whole collection of intensions of an object, but it is common in less technical usage to see 'intension' used for both the composite and the primitive ideas.

==United Kingdom==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2018}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] disability benefits are covered by [[Department for Work and Pensions]], and include:

* [[Disability Living Allowance]]
* [[Disability pension|Attendance Allowance]]
* [[Personal Independence Payment]]
* [[Carer's Allowance]]
* [[Employment and Support Allowance]]

==United States==
In the [[United States]], disability benefits for most Americans are covered and paid for by the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Administration]] (a government agency). There are two main programs administered by the SSA; Social Security Disability Insurance program (SSDI) and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. There is also a specific program for children with disabilities.

[[Social Security Disability Insurance]] provides benefits to individuals who have worked and paid Social Security taxes. Insurance eligibility is dependent upon Quarters of Coverage (QCs), commonly called "work credits". These are allotted based on the earnings for each [[Calendar year#Quarters|quarter]] the individual has worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quarter of Coverage |url=https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/QC.html |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work credits ensure  coverage until they "expire" on the individual's Date Last Insured (DLI). Medical evidence must prove that the onset of disability was before their DLI to receive benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Program Operations Manual System (POMS): DI 25501.320 - Date Last Insured (DLI) and the Established Onset Date (EOD) |url=https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0425501320 |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSDI recipients become eligible for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] after two years of SSDI eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Original Medicare (Part A and B) Eligibility and Enrollment |url=https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Eligibility-and-Enrollment/OrigMedicarePartABEligEnrol/ |website=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services |language=en-us |date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) provides benefits to low-income individuals who are disabled and unable to work, regardless of whether they have worked in the past. Individuals must meet income and resource requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-- SSI Eligibility |url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-eligibility-ussi.htm |website=Social Security Administration |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSI also provides benefits to children under 18 years old, who are disabled and whose parents or guardians have limited income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-- SSI for Children |url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-child-ussi.htm |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly SSI payment is calculated based upon the Federal Benefit Rate (FBR), and the individual's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-- SSI Income |url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-income-ussi.htm |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most SSI recipients are immediately eligible for [[Medicaid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Disability &amp; Medicaid coverage |url=https://www.healthcare.gov/people-with-disabilities/ssi-and-medicaid/ |website=HealthCare.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SNAP Special Rules for the Elderly or Disabled |url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/snap-special-rules-elderly-or-disabled |website=Food and Nutrition Service |publisher= United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though program requirements vary by state. 

Some individuals are eligible for both SSI and SSDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Red Book - Overview of Our Disability Programs |url=https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==


In Canada, there are a variety of public [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/disability.html Disability Benefit Programs]. The largest programs are the [[Canada Pension Plan]] and Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits, and provincial [[workers' compensation]] and [[social assistance]] programs. Some individuals, in addition, have private disability insurance coverage, purchased either individually, or through an employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/living-disability/disability-benefits.html|title=Disability benefits  - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Financial Consumer Agency of|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different programs use different rules to decide whether or not someone is eligible for benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/living-disability/disability-benefits.html|title=Disability benefits  - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Financial Consumer Agency of|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada Pension Plan (CPP) / Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) Disability Benefits ====

To access [[Canada Pension Plan]] or the Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits, an individual needs to have a disability that is "severe and prolonged", and which prevents them from working on a regular basis. As of 2018, CPP disability benefits are a minimum of $485.20 a month. Individuals who have contributed more to CPP or QPP during their working career receive higher benefits. The average monthly CPP disability benefit was $971.23 in 2018 and the maximum monthly amount was $1,335.83.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit/benefit-amount.html|title=Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit – How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

People receiving CPP disability benefits may earn up to $5,500 a year without losing their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit/while-receiving.html |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits stop when an individual has the ability to work regularly, or is no longer disabled. When an the individual reaches the age of 65, CPP Disability Benefits are replaced by a [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp.html Retirement Pension].

==== Employment Insurance Sickness Benefit (EI Insurance) ====
[https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.html Employment Insurance] is a benefit plan that offers temporary financial assistance to those individuals who cannot work due to sickness, injury, or quarantine. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Overview - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be eligible to receive EI sickness benefits:

* The individual’s earnings have been reduced by at least 40% 
* He/She is employed in insurable employment
* A minimum of 600 hours has been accumulated in the qualifying period &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|date=|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People are only eligible for these benefits if they are unable to work due to their sickness, injury, or quarantine, but would be able to work otherwise. To receive EI sickness benefit a medical certificate signed by the doctor is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify for EI you must have a required amount of insurable employment hours, which are used to calculate your benefit period, these insurable employment hours must be accumulated throughout the qualifying period. 

The qualifying period: 

* 52 week period before the EI claim date 
* Start date of previous EI benefit period to the start of the new date &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that each individual’s case is different and requirements may vary from case to case. But a general way of calculating EI benefits is 55% of the average insurable weekly earnings. The maximum amount you can be eligible for as of January 1 2018 is $51,700. Typically EI sickness benefits can only be paid for up to 15 weeks, but can vary depending on how long the individual is unable to work. 

Weekly EI sick benefits are calculated based on income before its been deducted during the individuals “best weeks”. Best weeks are the weeks in which the individual earned the most amount of amount, including any tips and commissions, the best weeks are chosen out of the qualifying period. 

In Canada areas with high rates of unemployment will use the best 14 weeks, and in areas with low unemployment rates will use the best 22 weeks. 

The weekly amount is calculated: 

* Calculating total earnings amount from the accumulated best weeks 
* Based on the region the individual is in the number of best weeks to use will be decided 
* Divide the total earnings by the number of best weeks 
* The result is multiplied by 55% to get the weekly benefit &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/benefit-amount.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are considered a low income family you may be eligible to receive the EI Family Supplement. An individual can be considered to be a part of this category if the yearly family net income is $25, 921 or less, has children, and if the individual or their spouse receives Canada child tax benefit. If both the individual and their spouse claims EI sickness benefits only one of them can be eligible for the family supplement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/benefit-amount.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2332">'''The doctrine of non-derogation from grants''' is a principle of the [[law of England and Wales]]. As the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] explained in ''[[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]]'', it states that a seller of [[realty]] or goods is not permitted to take any action (such as bringing an infringement action) that will lessen the value to the buyer of the thing sold. 

[[United States federal law]] recognises similar doctrines such as the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]] or doctrine of [[implied license]].&lt;ref&gt;A recent decision of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]], ''Transcore, LP v. Electronic Transaction Consultants Corp.'' (F.3d), April 8, 2009, not yet officially reported, conflates these doctrines in the following terms: "TransCore sought to enforce the ’946 patent in derogation of the rights it granted under the TransCore–Mark IV settlement agreement. That attempted derogation is prevented by legal estoppel, which gives rise to the implied license." ''Id''. at -- n.4.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar effect has also been realised in [[United States patent law]] under the doctrine of repair and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.]]'', 365 U.S. 336 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between the doctrine of non-derogation from grants and other doctrines, particularly implied license, that are used to accomplish similar results is that the doctrine of non-derogation from grants is "inherent" as a matter of property law and apparently cannot be avoided by a seller's use of language attempting to negative application of the doctrine or by trial counsel's pointing to evidence of intent not to relinquish patent rights or copyright. In contrast, the other doctrines may be vulnerable to contractual disclaimers or evidence of intent not to grant intellectual property rights. The issue is discussed to some extent in the courts' opinions in ''British Leyland'' and ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]''

{{Violence against women}}
{{Violence against men}}
'''Domestic violence''' (also named '''domestic abuse''' or '''family violence''') is [[violence]] or other [[abuse]] by one person against another in a domestic setting, such as in [[marriage]] or [[cohabitation]]. It may be termed ''[[intimate partner violence]]'' when committed by a [[spouse]] or partner in an [[intimate relationship]] against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[Domestic violence in same-sex relationships|same-sex]] relationships, or between former spouses or partners. Domestic violence can also involve violence against children, parents, or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[economic abuse|economic]], [[Religious abuse|religious]], [[Reproductive coercion|reproductive]], and [[sexual abuse]], which can range from subtle, coercive forms to [[marital rape]] and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, [[female genital mutilation]], and [[acid throwing]] that results in [[disfigurement]] or death. Domestic murders include [[stoning]], [[bride burning]], [[honor killing]]s, and [[dowry death]]s.

Globally, the victims of domestic violence are overwhelmingly women, and women tend to experience more severe forms of violence.&lt;ref name="McQuigg"&gt;{{citation | last = McQuigg | first = Ronagh J.A. | contribution = Potential problems for the effectiveness of international human rights law as regards domestic violence| editor-last = McQuigg | editor-first = Ronagh J.A. | title = International human rights law and domestic violence: the effectiveness of international human rights law | page = 13 | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | location = Oxford New York| year = 2011 | isbn = 9781136742088 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ltJxlsoMV4wC&amp;pg=PR13 | quote = This is an issue that affects vast numbers of women throughout all nations of the world.

Domestic violence often occurs when the abuser believes that abuse is an entitlement, acceptable, justified, or unlikely to be reported. It may produce an [[intergenerational cycle of abuse]] in children and other family members, who may feel that such violence is acceptable or condoned. Many people do not recognize themselves as abusers or victims because they may consider their experiences as family conflicts that got out of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10896-013-9555-4 |title=Stay with or Leave the Abuser?

Traditionally, domestic violence (DV) was mostly associated with physical violence. Terms such as ''wife abuse'', ''wife beating'', and ''wife'' ''battering'' were used, but have declined in popularity due to efforts to include unmarried partners, abuse other than physical, female perpetrators, and same-sex relationships.{{refn|Terms such wife abuse, wife beating, and battering are descriptive terms that have lost popularity recently for several reasons:

In most legal systems around the world, domestic violence has been addressed only from the 1990s onwards; indeed, before the late-20th century, in most countries there was very little protection, in law or in practice, against DV.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Smith | first = Bonnie G. | contribution = Domestic violence: overview | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = Bonnie G. | title = The Oxford encyclopedia of women in world history | page = 94 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195148909}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the UN published ''Strategies for Confronting Domestic Violence: A Resource Manual''.&lt;ref name=Strategies_UNODC&gt;{{cite book | last = UNODC | author-link = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | title = Strategies for confronting domestic violence: a resource manual | url = https://www.unodc.org/pdf/youthnet/tools_strategy_english_domestic_violence.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)]] | location = New York | isbn = 9789211301588 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205040711/https://www.unodc.org/pdf/youthnet/tools_strategy_english_domestic_violence.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  | year = 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication urged countries around the world to treat DV as a criminal act, stated that the right to a private family life does not include the right to abuse family members, and acknowledged that, at the time of its writing, most legal systems considered DV to be largely outside the scope of the law, describing the situation at that time as follows: "Physical discipline of children is allowed and, indeed, encouraged in many legal systems and a large number of countries allow moderate physical chastisement of a wife or, if they do not do so now, have done so within the last 100 years. Again, most legal systems fail to criminalize circumstances where a wife is forced to have sexual relations with her husband against her will. [...] Indeed, in the case of violence against wives, there is a widespread belief that women provoke, can tolerate or even enjoy a certain level of violence from their spouses."&lt;ref name=Strategies_UNODC /&gt;

In recent decades, there has been a call for the end of legal impunity for domestic violence, an impunity often based on the idea that such acts are private.&lt;ref name="who.intB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt; The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] is the first legally binding instrument in Europe dealing with domestic violence and violence against women.&lt;ref name="oas.org"/&gt; The convention seeks to put an end to the toleration, in law or in practice, of violence against women and DV. In its explanatory report it acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring, ''de jure'' or ''de facto'', these forms of violence.&lt;ref name=CofE_CETS210&gt;{{cite web | last = Council of Europe | author-link = Council of Europe | title = Explanatory Report to the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210) | url = http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm | website = conventions.coe.int | publisher = [[Council of Europe]] | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150720234156/http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/210.htm | archivedate = 20 July 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At para 219, it states: "There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator."&lt;ref name=CofE_CETS210 /&gt;

There has been increased attention given to specific forms of domestic violence, such as honor killings, dowry deaths, and forced marriages. India has, in recent decades, made efforts to curtail dowry violence: the [[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005|Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act]] (PWDVA) was enacted in 2005, following years of advocacy and activism by the women's organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Confronting dowry-related violence in India: women at the center of justice | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | website = unwomen.org | publisher = [[UN Women]] | date = 24 December 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141107103046/http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | archivedate = 7 November 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crimes of passion]] in Latin America, a region which has a history of treating such killings with extreme leniency, have also come to international attention. In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, argued that there are similarities between the dynamics of crimes of passion and honor killings, stating that: "crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Thousands of women killed for family "honor" | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | work = [[National Geographic News]] | publisher = [[National Geographic Society]] | date = 28 October 2010 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019011522/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | archivedate = 19 October 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, children had few protections from violence by their parents, and in many parts of the world, this is still the case. For example, in Ancient Rome, a father could legally kill his children. Many cultures have allowed fathers to sell their children into [[slavery]]. [[Child sacrifice]] was also a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Szasz | first = Thomas | title = Cruel compassion: psychiatric control of society's unwanted | publisher = [[Syracuse University Press]] | location = Syracuse, New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780815605102 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2pduB22E43oC | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018130406/https://books.google.com/books?id=2pduB22E43oC | archivedate = 2015-10-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Child maltreatment began to garner mainstream attention with the publication of "The Battered Child Syndrome" by pediatric psychiatrist [[C. Henry Kempe]]. Prior to this, injuries to children—even repeated bone fractures—were not commonly recognized as the results of intentional trauma. Instead, physicians often looked for undiagnosed [[bone disease]]s or accepted parents' accounts of accidental mishaps such as falls or assaults by neighborhood bullies.&lt;ref name=Childism&gt;{{cite book |author=Young-Bruehl, Elisabeth |date=2012 |title=Childism: Confronting Prejudice Against Children |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-17311-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|100–103}}

Limitations of [[methodology]], such as the [[conflict tactics scale]], that fail to capture injury, homicide, and sexual violence rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamby|first=Sherry|date=2014-05-28|title=Measuring Intimate Partner Violence: A Multi-Study Investigation of Gender Patterns|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268125313}}&lt;/ref&gt; context (e.g., motivations, fear), disparate [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] procedures, respondent reluctance to self-report, and differences in [[operationalization]] all pose challenges to existing research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamby|first=Sherry|date=2017-04-01|title=On defining violence, and why it matters|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315967513|journal=Psychology of Violence|volume=7|issue=2|pages=167–180|doi=10.1037/vio0000117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chan2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ko Ling | title = Gender differences in self-reports of intimate partner violence: a review | journal = [[Aggression and Violent Behavior]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–175 | doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2011.02.008 | date = March–April 2011 | url = http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208161311/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ko Ling | title = Gender symmetry in the self-reporting of intimate partner violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 263–286 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511416463 | pmid = 21920874 | date = January 2012 | url = http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152121/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Rose | first = Susan D. | contribution = Gender violence: the problem | editor-last = Rose | editor-first = Susan D. | title = Challenging global gender violence: the global clothesline project | pages = 12–13 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781137388483 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HZsKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160501065849/https://books.google.com/books?id=HZsKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12 | archivedate = 2016-05-01 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Normalization (sociology)|Normalization]] of domestic violence in those who experience covert forms of abuse, or have been abused by multiple partners, for long periods of time, reduces the likelihood of recognizing, and therefore reporting, domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Boundless | author-link = Boundless (company) | contribution = Spousal abuse | editor-last = Boundless | editor-link = Boundless (company) | title = Sociology | pages = 898–899 | publisher = [[Boundless (company)|Boundless]] | location = Boston, Massachusetts | isbn = 9781940464374}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=kbLpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA899 Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022140457/https://books.google.com/books?id=kbLpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA899 |date=2015-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations have made efforts to use gender-neutral terms when referring to perpetration and victimization.

Researchers have also found different outcomes for men and women in response to intimate partner violence. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered disproportionately as a result of intimate partner violence, especially in terms of injuries, fear, and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026296 |title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes |journal=Psychology of Violence |volume=2 |pages=42–57 |year=2012 |last1=Caldwell |first1=Jennifer E |last2=Swan |first2=Suzanne C |last3=Woodbrown |first3=V. Diane }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that 70% of female victims in one study were "very frightened" in response to IPV from their partners, but 85% of male victims reported "no fear", and that IPV mediated the satisfaction of the relationship for women but not for men.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Hamberger's (2005) review found that men tend to respond to female partner-initiated IPV with laughter and amusement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamberger|first=L.

A 2013 review examined studies from five [[continents]] and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Esquivel-Santovena |first1=Esteban Eugenio | last2=Lambert | first2=Teri | last3=Hamel | first3=John | title = Partner abuse worldwide | journal = Partner Abuse | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1891/1946-6560.4.1.e14 |url =http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables14.Revised.pdf| date = January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws on domestic violence vary by country. While it is generally outlawed in the [[Western world]], this is not the case in many [[developing countries]]. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = CNN Wire Staff | title = Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325143850/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM%3AWORLD | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | url = https://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM:WORLD | website = cnn.com | publisher = CNN | date = 19 October 2010 | access-date = 24 January 2014 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social acceptability of domestic violence also differs by country. While in most developed countries domestic violence is considered unacceptable by most people, in many regions of the world the views are different: according to a [[UNICEF]] survey, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example: 90% in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Jordan]], 87% in [[Mali]], 86% in [[Guinea]] and [[Timor-Leste]], 81% in [[Laos]], 80% in [[Central African Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Childinfo | title = Attitudes towards wife beating: percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband/partner is justified in hitting or beating his wife/partner under certain circumstances | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140704112113/http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php | archive-date = 4 July 2014 | url = https://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php | website = childinfo.org | publisher = Childinfo: monitoring the situation of children and women | accessdate = 8 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Refusing to submit to a husband's wishes is a common reason given for justification of violence in developing countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214095207/http://www.measuredhs.com/ | archive-date = 14 February 2014 | url = https://www.measuredhs.com/ | publisher = Measure DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys): Quality information to plan, monitor and improve population, health, and nutrition programs | date = 4 April 2013 | accessdate = 8 September 2013 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance 62.4% of women in [[Tajikistan]] justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Takistan | title = Tajikistan multiple indicator cluster survey 2005, final report | publisher = State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Takistan | url = http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Tajikistan_FinalReport_2005_Eng.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213608/http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Tajikistan_FinalReport_2005_Eng.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2015-09-23| location = Dushanbe, Tajikistan | date = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] (1993) states that "[[violence against women]] is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which has led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men".&lt;ref name="UN GA Res" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = UNFPA strategy and framework for action to addressing gender-based violence 2008–2011 | url = http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/2009_add_gen_vio.pdf | publisher = United Nations Population Fund | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780897149518 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://perma-archives.org/warc/20160112155127/http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/2009_add_gen_vio.pdf | archivedate = 2016-01-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women classifies violence against women into three categories: that occurring in the family (DV), that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State.&lt;ref name="UN GA Res" /&gt;

The Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women defines violence against women as "any act or conduct, based on gender, which causes death or physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, whether in the public or the private sphere".&lt;ref name=Treaties&gt;{{cite web | title = Multilateral treaties: Inter-American convention on the prevention, punishment and eradication of violence against women "Convention of Belém do Pará" | url = http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html | website = oas.org | publisher = Department of International Law, [[Organization of American States]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160413001826/http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html | archivedate = 2016-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, it classifies violence against women into three categories; one of which being DV – defined as violence against women which takes place "within the family or domestic unit or within any other interpersonal relationship, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the woman".&lt;ref name=Treaties /&gt;

The [[Maputo Protocol]] adopted a broader definition, defining violence against women as: "all acts perpetrated against women which cause or could cause them physical, sexual, psychological, and economic harm, including the threat to take such acts; or to undertake the imposition of arbitrary restrictions on or deprivation of fundamental freedoms in private or public life in peace time and during situations of armed conflicts or of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = ACHPR | author-link = African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights | title = Protocol to the African charter on human and peoples' rights on the rights of women in Africa | url = http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/ | publisher = [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] | date = 11 July 2003 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151202092756/http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol | archivedate = 2 December 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Femicide]] is usually defined as the gender-based killing of women by men, although the exact definitions vary.  Femicides often occur in the context of DV, such as honor killings or dowry killings. For statistical purposes, femicide is often defined as any killing of a woman. The top countries by rate of femicide are [[El Salvador]], [[Jamaica]], [[Guatemala]], [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]] (data from 2004–09).&lt;ref name="smallarmssurvey.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Small Arms Survey | author-link = Small Arms Survey | title = Femicide: a global problem — research note 14 | journal = [[Small Arms Survey|Small Arms Survey Research Notes]] | date = February 2012 | url = http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/about-us/highlights/highlight-rn14.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035809/http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/about-us/highlights/highlight-rn14.html | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in El Salvador and Colombia, which have a very high rate of femicide, only three percent of all femicides are committed by a current or former intimate partner, while in [[Cyprus]], [[France]], and [[Portugal]] former and current partners are responsible for more than 80% of all cases of femicide.&lt;ref name="smallarmssurvey.org"/&gt;

While the general literature indicates that adolescent boys and girls engage in IPV at about equal rates, females are more likely to use less dangerous forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males are more likely to punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males are also more likely to use sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are four times more likely to respond as having experienced rape and are more likely to suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse. Females are more likely to consider IPV a serious problem than are their male counterparts, who are more likely to disregard female-perpetrated IPV.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poet&gt;{{citation | last1 = Poet | first1 = Andrea | last2 = Swiderski | first2 = Catherine R. | last3 = McHugh | first3 = Maureen C. | contribution = Developing teen relationships: the role of violence | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 1, Part III.

There is a strong link between domestic violence and child abuse. Since domestic violence is a pattern of behavior, these incidences may increase in severity and frequency, resulting in an increased probability the children themselves will become victims. The estimated overlap between domestic violence and child abuse ranges from 30 to 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/PCAA_DVandChild.pdf|date=September 1996|title=The Relationship Between Domestic Violence and Child Abuse|publisher=Prevent Child Abuse America|accessdate=2016-04-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207171540/http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/PCAA_DVandChild.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay and lesbian relationships have been identified as a risk factor for abuse in certain populations.&lt;ref name="Siemieniuk 2010 763–770"/&gt; LGBT people in some parts of the world have very little legal protection from DV, because engaging in homosexual acts is itself prohibited by the "[[sodomy laws]]" of those jurisdictions (as of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by imprisonment in 70 countries and by death in another 5 countries)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Rodgers | first1 = Lucy | last2 = Gutierrez Martin | first2 = Pablo Gutierrez Martin | last3 = Rees | first3 = Martyn | last4 = Connor | first4 = Steven | title = Where is it illegal to be gay? | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595 | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = BBC | date = 10 February 2014 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150812100906/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595 | archivedate = 12 August 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these legal prohibitions prevent LGBT victims of DV from reporting the abuse to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Serra | first = Natalie E. | title = Queering international human rights: LGBT access to domestic violence remedies | journal = Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 583–607 | date = 2013 | url = http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1611&amp;context=jgspl | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082107/http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1611&amp;context=jgspl | archivedate = 2014-08-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of the 2003 Supreme Court decision, 13 US states have refused to remove sodomy laws from legislation as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Chen 2013"/&gt;

People in same-sex relationships face special obstacles in dealing with the issues that some researchers have labeled "the double closet". A 1997 Canadian study by Mark W. Lehman suggests similarities include frequency (approximately one in every four couples); manifestations (emotional, physical, financial, etc.); co-existent situations (unemployment, substance abuse, low self-esteem); victims' reactions (fear, feelings of helplessness, hypervigilance); and reasons for staying (love, can work it out, things will change, denial).&lt;ref name="Lehman 1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lehman | first = Mark Warren | title = At the end of the rainbow: a report on gay male domestic violence and abuse | publisher = Minnesota Center Against Violence and Abuse | location = St. Paul, Minnesota | date = 1997 | url = http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/rainbow/At%20The%20End%20Of%20The%20Rainbow.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 December 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216045419/http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/rainbow/At%20The%20End%20Of%20The%20Rainbow.pdf | archivedate = 16 February 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies conducted by Emory University in 2014 identified 24 trigger for partner violence through web-based surveys, ranging from drugs and alcohol to safe-sex discussions.&lt;ref name="Finneran 2014"/&gt; A general theme of power and control seems to underlie abuse in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Chen 2013"/&gt;

At the same time, significant differences, unique issues, and deceptive myths are typically present.&lt;ref name="Lehman 1997"/&gt; Lehman, regarding his 1997 survey, points to added discrimination and fears that gay and lesbian individuals may face. This includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of support from peers, fear of attracting negative stigma toward the [[gay community]], the impact of [[HIV/AIDS]] status in keeping partners together (due to health care insurance/access, or guilt), threat of [[outing]], and encountering supportive services that are targeted, or structured for the needs of heterosexual women, and may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians. This service structure can make LGBTQ victims feel even more isolated and misunderstood than they may already because of their minority status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-sex abuse|url=https://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=13586&amp;state_code=PG&amp;open_id=all|website=womenslaw.org|publisher=National Network to End Domestic Violence, Inc.|accessdate=24 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320065837/http://womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=13586&amp;state_code=PG&amp;open_id=all|archivedate=20 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehman, however, stated that "due to the limited number of returned responses and non-random sampling methodology the findings of this work are not generalizable beyond the sample" of 32 initial respondents and final 10 who completed the more in-depth survey.&lt;ref name="Lehman 1997"/&gt; Particularly, sexual stressors and HIV/AIDS status have emerged as significant differences in same-sex partner violence.&lt;ref name="Finneran 2014"/&gt;

===Underreporting===
DV is among the most underreported crimes worldwide for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning"/&gt;&lt;ref name=concannon/&gt; A 2011 review article by intimate partner violence researcher Ko Ling Chan found men tended to under-report their own perpetration of domestic violence while women were more likely to under-report their victimization and over-estimate their own violence perpetration.&lt;ref name=chan2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ko Ling | title = Gender symmetry in the self-reporting of intimate partner violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 263–286 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511416463 | pmid = 21920874 | date = January 2012 | url = http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208152121/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134462/1/Content.pdf | archivedate = 2015-12-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial or familial dependence, normalization of violence, and [[Self-blame|self-blaming]] were found to reduce the likelihood of self-reporting victimization in women. By contrast, fear and avoidance of legal consequences, the tendency to blame their partner, and a narrative focus on their own needs and emotions reduced the likelihood of self-reporting perpetration in men.&lt;ref name=chan2011/&gt;

A 2014 study conducted across the 28 member states of the [[European Union]] found that only 14% of women reported their most serious incident of intimate partner violence to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Facts and figures: ending violence against women | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures | website = unwomen.org | publisher = UN Women | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150827022736/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures | archivedate = 27 August 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 report on DV in [[Northern Ireland]] found that "under-reporting is a concern and domestic abuse is the least likely of all violent crimes to be reported to the police".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Domestic call 'every 23 minutes' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960591.stm | work = [[BBC news]] | publisher = BBC | location = Northern Ireland | date = 24 March 2009 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211064421/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7960591.stm | archivedate = 11 December 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men face additional gender related barriers in reporting, due to social stigmas regarding male victimization, and an increased likelihood of being overlooked by healthcare providers.&lt;ref name="Riviello 129"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finley 163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Criminal Investigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;

===Social views===
[[File:Advertisement for Littleton Butter (31 December 1903).jpg|thumb|In this 1903 advertisement for Littleton Butter, domestic violence is portrayed as embarrassing but normal.]]

Social views on domestic violence vary from person to person, and from region to region, but in many places outside the West, the concept is very poorly understood. This is because in most of these countries the relation between the husband and wife is not considered one of equals, but instead one in which the wife must submit herself to the husband. This is codified in the laws of some countries – for example, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Yemen's dark side: discrimination and violence against women and girls | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/014/2009/en/ | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = November 2009 | access-date = 11 April 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210214138/https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/014/2009/en/ | archivedate = 10 December 2015 | df =  }} [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326165645/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf |date=2016-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Violence against Women in Families and Relationships'', "Globally, wife-beating is seen as justified in some circumstances by a majority of the population in various countries, most commonly in situations of actual or suspected infidelity by wives or their "disobedience" toward a husband or partner." &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | last2 = Pease | first2 = Robert | last3 = Taylor | first3 = Natalie | last4 = Webster | first4 = Kim | author-link = Michael Flood | contribution = Reshaping attitudes towards violence against women | editor-last1 = Buzawa | editor-first1 = Eve S. | editor-last2 = Stark | editor-first2 = Evan | title = Violence against women in families and relationships, Volume IV: the media and cultural attitudes | page = 184 | publisher = Praeger/ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780275998547}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EE8dkgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Violence+against+women+9780275998547 Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110213354/https://books.google.com/books?id=EE8dkgEACAAJ&amp;dq=Violence+against+women+9780275998547 |date=2017-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These violent acts against a wife are often not considered a form of abuse by society (both men and women) but are considered to have been provoked by the behavior of the wife, who is seen as being at fault. While beatings of wives are often a response to "inappropriate" behaviors, in many places extreme acts such as [[honor killing]]s are approved by a high section of the society. In one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in  [[Jordan]]'s capital city, [[Amman]], approved of honor killings. This survey was carried in the capital of Jordan, which is much more liberal than other parts of the country; the researchers said that "We would expect that in the more rural and traditional parts of Jordan, support for honor killings would be even higher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maher |first=Ahmed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22992365 |title=Many Jordan teenagers 'support honour killings' |work=[[BBC news]] |publisher=BBC |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=9 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921234334/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22992365 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 news story, ''The Washington Post'' reported, "The Reuters TrustLaw group named [[India]] one of the worst countries in the world for women this year, partly because domestic violence there is often seen as deserved. A 2012 report by UNICEF found that 57 percent of Indian boys and 53 percent of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 think wife-beating is justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Khazan | first1 = Olga | last2 = Lakshmi | first2 = Rama | title = 10 reasons why India has a sexual violence problem | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/29/india-rape-victim-dies-sexual-violence-proble/ | work = [[The Washington Post]] | publisher = [[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings LLC]] | date = 29 December 2012 | access-date = 9 December 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150512153618/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/29/india-rape-victim-dies-sexual-violence-proble/ | archivedate = 12 May 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conservative cultures, a wife dressing in attire deemed insufficiently modest can suffer serious violence at the hands of her husband or relatives, with such violent responses seen as appropriate by most of the society: in a survey, 62.8% of women in [[Afghanistan]] said that a husband  is justified in beating his wife if she wears inappropriate clothes.&lt;ref name="cso.gov.af"&gt;[https://cso.gov.af/Content/files/AMICS.pdf Monitoring the Situation of Women &amp; Children.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205040032/http://cso.gov.af/Content/files/AMICS.pdf |date=2016-02-05 }} Afghanistan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2010/2011.

According to [[Antonia Parvanova]], one of the difficulties of dealing legally with the issue of DV is that men in many male dominated societies do not understand that inflicting violence against their wives is against the law. She said, referring to a case that occurred in Bulgaria, "A husband was tried for severely beating his wife and when the judge asked him if he understood what he did and if he's sorry, the husband said "But she's my wife". He doesn't even understand that he has no right to beat her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Seven women die in EU each day due to domestic violence | url = http://www.novinite.com/articles/158764/Seven+Women+Die+in+EU+Each+Day+Due+to+Domestic+Violence | work = [[Novinite]] | publisher = One Click Media Group | location = Bulgaria | date = 8 March 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405141612/http://www.novinite.com/articles/158764/Seven+Women+Die+in+EU+Each+Day+Due+to+Domestic+Violence | archivedate = 5 April 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNFPA]] writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = Taking a stand against practices that harm women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150404082023/http://web.lb.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm | archive-date = 4 April 2015 | url = http://web.lb.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm | publisher = United Nations Population Fund | date = April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"In some developing countries, practices that subjugate and harm women – such as wife-beating, killings in the name of honour, female genital mutilation/cutting and dowry deaths – are condoned as being part of the natural order of things".

Strong views among the population in certain societies that reconciliation is more appropriate than punishment in cases of domestic violence are also another cause of legal impunity; a study found that 64% of public officials in Colombia said that if it were in their hands to solve a case of intimate partner violence, the action they would take would be to encourage the parties to reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Álvarez | first = Camilo Segura | title = Colombia sigue legitimando la violencia contra la mujer | url = http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-sigue-legitimando-violencia-contra-mujer-articulo-547754 | work = [[El Espectador]] | publisher = [[Fidel Cano Correa]] | date = 5 March 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150510123028/http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-sigue-legitimando-violencia-contra-mujer-articulo-547754 | archivedate = 10 May 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victim blaming]] is also prevalent in many societies, including in Western countries: a 2010 [[Eurobarometer]] poll found that 52% of respondents agreed with the assertion that the "provocative behaviour of women" was a cause of violence against women; with  respondents in Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia being most likely to agree with the assertion (more than 70% in each of these countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = TNS | author-link = Taylor Nelson Sofres | contribution = Annexes: Tables: QC4.11 Please tell me whether you consider each of the following to be a cause of domestic violence against women, or not?: The provocative behaviour of women. | editor-last = TNS | editor-link = Taylor Nelson Sofres | title = Special Eurobarometer 344: Domestic violence against women | url = https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/dataset/S816_73_2_EBS344 | publisher = [[European Commission]] | location = Brussels, Belgium | date = September 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211000741/https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/dataset/S816_73_2_EBS344 | archivedate = 2015-12-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===

===Custom and tradition===
[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]
Local customs and traditions are often responsible for maintaining certain forms of DV. Such customs and traditions include son preference (the desire of a family to have a boy and not a girl, which is strongly prevalent in parts of Asia), which can lead to abuse and neglect of girl children by disappointed family members; child and forced marriages; [[dowry]]; the hierarchic [[caste]] system which stigmatizes "lower castes" and "untouchables", leading to discrimination and restricted opportunities of the females and thus making them more vulnerable to abuse; strict dress codes for women that may be enforced through violence by family members; strong requirement of female virginity before the wedding and violence related to non-conforming women and girls; taboos about [[menstruation]] leading to females being isolated and shunned during the time of menstruation; [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM); ideologies of marital 'conjugal rights' to sex which justify marital rape; the importance given to '[[family honor]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNESCAP | author-link = United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific | title = Harmful traditional practices in three counties of South Asia: culture, human rights and violence against women | url = http://www.unescap.org/resources/harmful-traditional-practices-three-countries-south-asia-culture-human-rights-and-violence | publisher = [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] | date = November 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211144247/http://www.unescap.org/resources/harmful-traditional-practices-three-countries-south-asia-culture-human-rights-and-violence | archivedate = 2015-12-11 | df =  }} Gender and Development Discussion Paper Series No. 21.

According to a 2003 report by Human Rights Watch, "Customs such as the payment of '[[bride price]]' (payment made by a man to the family of a woman he wishes to marry), whereby a man essentially purchases  his wife’s sexual favors and reproductive capacity, underscore men’s socially sanctioned entitlement to dictate the terms of sex, and to use force to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Human Rights Watch | author-link = Human Rights Watch | title = Policy paralysis: a call for action on HIV/AIDS-related human rights abuses against women and girls in Africa | url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf | publisher = Human Rights Watch | date = December 2003 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131419/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf | archivedate = 2016-03-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization has stated that women in abusive relations are at significantly higher risk of HIV/AIDS. WHO states that women in violent relations have difficulty negotiating [[safer sex]] with their partners, are often forced to have sex, and find it difficult to ask for appropriate testing when they think they may be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Violence against women and HIV/AIDS: critical intersections: intimate partner violence and HIV/AIDS | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf | series = Information Bulletin Series | id = Bulletin no. 1 | date = November 2004 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025220637/http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf | archivedate = 2013-10-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade of cross-sectional research from Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa, and India, has consistently found women who have experienced partner violence to be more likely to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Facts and figures: ending violence against women | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures#notes | website = unwomen.org | publisher = UN Women | date = October 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150827022736/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures#notes | archivedate = 2015-08-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO stated that:&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a compelling case to end intimate partner violence both in its own right as well as to reduce women and girls vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The evidence on the linkages between violence against women and HIV/AIDS highlights that there are direct and indirect mechanisms by which the two interact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Same-sex relationships are similarly affected by HIV/AIDS status in domestic violence. Research by Heintz and Melendez found that same-sex individuals may have difficulty breaching the topic of safe-sex for reasons such as "decreased perception of control over sex, fear of violence, and unequal power distributions..."&lt;ref name="Heintz 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heintz | first1 = Adam J. | last2 = Melendez | first2 = Rita M. | title = Intimate partner violence and HIV/STD risk among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–208 | doi = 10.1177/0886260505282104 | pmid = 16368761 | date = February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those who reported violence in the study, about 50% reported forced sexual experiences, of which only half reported the use of safe sex measures. Barriers to safer-sex included fear of abuse, and deception in safe-sex practices. Heintz and Melendez's research ultimately concluded that sexual assault/abuse in same-sex relationships provides a major concern for HIV/AIDS infection as it decreases instances of safe-sex. Furthermore, these incidents create additional fear and stigma surrounding safe-sex conversations and knowing ones STD status.&lt;ref name="Heintz 2006"/&gt;

===Legislation===
Lack of adequate legislation which criminalizes domestic violence, or, alternatively legislation which prohibits consensual behaviors, may hinder the progress in regard to reducing the incidence of DV. Amnesty International’s Secretary General has stated that: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity – even punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Women and girls: sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06 | website = amnesty.org | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = 6 March 2014 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141206225115/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06 | archivedate = 6 December 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to WHO, "one of the most common forms of violence against women is that performed by a husband or male partner." The WHO notes that such violence is often ignored because often "legal systems and cultural norms do not treat as a crime, but rather as a 'private' family matter, or a normal part of life."&lt;ref name="who.intB"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Gender, equity, human rights: gender based violence | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150423143519/http://www.who.int/gender/violence/gbv/en/ | archive-date = 23 April 2015 | url = http://www.who.int/gender/violence/gbv/en/ | accessdate = 22 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminalization of [[adultery]] has been cited as inciting violence against women, as these prohibitions are often meant, in law or in practice, to control women's and not men's behavior; and are used to rationalize acts of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = OHCHR | author-link = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights | title = Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice | url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672 | publisher = [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | date = 18 October 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235132/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672 | archivedate = 26 April 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Decriminalization of adultery and defenses | url = http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html%29 | website = endvawnow.org | publisher = Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence Against Women and Girls, UN Women | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160108112544/http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html%29 | archivedate = 8 January 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Navi Pillay]]: "Some have argued, and continue to argue, that family violence is placed outside the conceptual framework of international human rights. However, under international laws and standards, there is a clear State responsibility to uphold women’s rights and ensure freedom from discrimination, which includes the responsibility to prevent, protect and provide redress – regardless of sex, and regardless of a person’s status in the family."&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = OHCHR | author-link = Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights | title = High Commissioner speaks out against domestic violence and "honour killing" on occasion of International Women's Day | url = http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E | publisher = [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | date = 8 March 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182718/http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9869&amp;LangID=E | archivedate = 14 July 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ability to leave===
The ability of victims of domestic violence to leave the relationship is crucial for preventing further abuse. In traditional communities, divorced women often feel rejected and ostracized. In order to avoid this stigma, many women prefer to remain in the marriage and endure the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Fields | first = Rona | contribution = The Negev Bedouin: a contemporary remnant of ancient tribal society | editor-last = Fields | editor-first = Rona | title = Against violence against women: the case for gender as a protected class | pages = 63–64 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Basingstoke | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781137439178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she separates from her husband or when he dies, she risks losing her home, land, household goods and other property. Failure to ensure equal property rights upon separation or divorce discourages women from leaving violent marriages, as women may be forced to choose between violence at home and destitution in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Manjoo | first = Rashida | author-link = Rashida Manjoo | title = Statement by Ms. Rashida Manjoo, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its cause and consequences | url = https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw56/statements/statement-spec-rap-manjoo.pdf | publisher = UN Women | location = New York | date = February 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170318105200/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw56/statements/statement-spec-rap-manjoo.pdf | archivedate = 2017-03-18 | df =  }} [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|CSW56]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The legal inability to obtain a divorce is also a factor in the proliferation of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Conway-Turner | first1 = Kate | last2 = Cherrin | first2 = Suzanne | contribution = Sexual harassment: can women be comfortable in the public world? | editor-last1 = Conway-Turner | editor-first1 = Kate | editor-last2 = Cherrin | editor-first2 = Suzanne | title = Women, families, and feminist politics: a global exploration | page = 198 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | location = Oxford New York | isbn = 9781560239352| date = 1998-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures where [[arranged marriage|marriages are arranged]] between families, a woman who attempts a separation or divorce without the consent of her husband and extended family or relatives may risk being subjected to "honor"- based violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mayell | first = Hillary | title = Thousands of women killed for family "honor" | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | work = [[National Geographic News]] | publisher = [[National Geographic Society]] | date = 12 February 2002 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019011522/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | archivedate = 19 October 2015 | df =  }} [http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129092131/http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf |date=2015-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hbv-awareness.com"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = FAQ: frequently asked questions about honour based violence (HBV) and honour killings | url = http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/ | website = hbv-awareness.com | publisher = [[Deeyah Khan#Honour Based Violence Awareness (HBVA)|Honour Based Violence Awareness (HBVA)]] | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150815114026/http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/ | archivedate = 15 August 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom of [[bride price]] also makes leaving a marriage more difficult: if a wife want to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price from her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Protecting the girl child: using the law to end child, early and forced marriage and related human rights violations | url = http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf | publisher = [[Equality Now]] | date = January 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150528120452/http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/Protecting_the_Girl_Child.pdf | archivedate = 2015-05-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lelieveld | first = Marlijn | title = Child protection in the Somali region of Ethiopia | url = http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf | publisher = [[Save the Children]] | date = April 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095119/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/FINALChild_Protection_in_the_Somali_Region_30511.pdf | archivedate = 2015-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Stange | first1 = Mary Z. | last2 = Oyster | first2 = Carol K. | last3 = Sloan | first3 = Jane E. | contribution = Equatorial Guinea | editor-last1 = Stange | editor-first1 = Mary Z. | editor-last2 = Oyster | editor-first2 = Carol K. | editor-last3 = Sloan | editor-first3 = Jane E. | title = Encyclopedia of women in today's world, volume 1 | page = 496 | publisher = Sage Reference | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781412976855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In advanced nations like the [[United Kingdom]] domestic violence victims may have difficulties getting alternative housing which can force them to stay in the abusive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41803342 The domestic violence victims 'left begging for a home'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031124354/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41803342 |date=2017-10-31 }} ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many domestic violence victims delay leaving the abuser because they have pets and are afraid of what will happen to the pets if they leave.  Safehouses need to be more accepting of pets, many refuse to accept pets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-46404837/the-safehouse-for-women-and-pets-to-flee-abuse The safehouse for women and pets to flee abuse] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual versus family unit rights===
The way the individual rights of a family member versus the rights of the family as a unit are balanced vary significantly in different societies. This may influence the degree to which a government may be willing to investigate family incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Human Rights Watch | author-link = Human Rights Watch | title = Uzbekistan: Sacrificing women to save the family? Domestic violence in Uzbekistan | url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uzbekistan/uzbek0701.pdf | website = hrw.org | publisher = Human Rights Watch | date = July 2001 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035651/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/uzbekistan/uzbek0701.pdf | archivedate = 5 February 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, individual members of the family are expected to sacrifice almost completely their own interests in favor of the interests of the family as a whole. What is viewed as an undue expression of personal autonomy is condemned as unacceptable. In these cultures the family predominates over the individual, and where this interacts with [[family honor|cultures of honor]], individualistic choice that may damage the family reputation in the community may result in extreme punishment, such as honor killings.&lt;ref name="hbv-awareness.com"/&gt;

===Immigration policies===
In some countries, the [[immigration policy]] is tied to whether the person desiring citizenship is married to his/her sponsor. This can lead to persons  being trapped in violent relations – such persons may risk deportation if they attempt to separate (they may be accused of having entered into a [[sham marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Douglas | first1 = Debbie | last2 = Go | first2 = Avvy | last3 = Blackstock | first3 = Sarah | title = Editorial opinion: Canadian immigration changes force women to stay with sponsoring spouse for two years | url = https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/12/05/canadian_immigration_changes_force_women_to_stay_with_sponsoring_spouse_for_two_years.html | work = [[Toronto Star|The Star]] | publisher = [[Star Media Group]], [[Torstar|Torstar Corporation]] | location = Toronto, Canada | date = 5 December 2012 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150904192500/http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/12/05/canadian_immigration_changes_force_women_to_stay_with_sponsoring_spouse_for_two_years.html | archivedate = 4 September 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic violence victims must not be trapped by deportation fears | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006110720/http://www.immigrantcouncil.ie/research-publications/publications/694-domestic-violence-victims-must-not-be-trapped-by-deportation-fears | archive-date = 6 October 2014 | url = http://www.immigrantcouncil.ie/research-publications/publications/694-domestic-violence-victims-must-not-be-trapped-by-deportation-fears | website = immigrantcouncil.ie | publisher = The Immigrant Council of Ireland (ICI) | date = May 2013 }} [http://immigrantcouncil.ie/files/publications/1a2d6-briefing_document_dv_-_longer_version_-_final_2013.pdf Briefing document by the Domestic Violence Coalition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424204545/http://immigrantcouncil.ie/files/publications/1a2d6-briefing_document_dv_-_longer_version_-_final_2013.pdf |date=2016-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = AFP in Sydney | title = Australian migrants trapped in 'slave-like' marriages | url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/01/australian-migrants-slave-marriages | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 1 August 2014 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151011091736/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/01/australian-migrants-slave-marriages | archivedate = 11 October 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Lyneham | first1 = Samantha | last2 = Richards | first2 = Kelly | title = Human trafficking involving marriage and partner migration to Australia | publisher = Australian Institute of Criminology | location = Canberra, Australia | series = Research and Public Policy Series | id = Paper no. 124 | url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/72187/3/72187.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205034638/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/72187/3/72187.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the women come from cultures where they will suffer disgrace from their families if they abandon their marriage and return home, and so they prefer to stay married, therefore remaining locked in a cycle of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Raza | first = Nusrat | title = Visa for hell | year = 2011 | publisher = Best Books Publications | location = Lahore | oclc = 772450148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigrant communities===
Domestic violence may happen in immigrant communities, and often there is little awareness in these communities of the laws and policies of the host country. A study among first generation South Asians in the UK found that they had little knowledge about what constituted criminal behavior under the English law. The researchers found that "There was certainly no awareness that there could be rape within a marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = McVeigh | first = Tracy | title = Abuse going unreported in Britain’s south Asian communities – study | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/abuse-going-unreported-in-britains-south-asian-communities-study | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 19 September 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160812152918/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/abuse-going-unreported-in-britains-south-asian-communities-study | archivedate = 12 August 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowburn | first1 = Malcolm | last2 = Gill | first2 = Aisha K. | last3 = Harrison | first3 = Karen | title = Speaking about sexual abuse in British South Asian communities: offenders, victims and the challenges of shame and reintegration | journal = Journal of Sexual Aggression, Special Issue: Community Reintegration of Sexual Offenders | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–15 | doi = 10.1080/13552600.2014.929188 | date = January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in Australia showed that among the immigrant women sampled who were abused by partners and did not report it, 16.7% did not know DV was illegal, while 18.8% did not know that they could get protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Satyen | first1 = Lata | last2 = Ranganathan | first2 = Archna | last3 = Piedra | first3 = Steve | last4 = Simon | first4 = Ben | last5 = Kocsic | first5 = Jessica | title = Family violence in migrant women in Australia: strategies for migrant men to reduce the violence | date = May 2013 }} Conference paper for the White Ribbon International Conference, Sydney, Australia, 13–15 May 2013.

==Causes==
Of the most important factors in domestic violence is a belief that abuse, whether physical or verbal, is acceptable. Other factors include [[substance abuse]], [[unemployment]], mental health problems, lack of coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 11"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Willis C. | last2 = Newman | first2 = Esmeralda | contribution = What is domestic violence?

===Cycles of violence===

====Cycle of abuse====
[[Lenore E. Walker]] presented the model of a [[cycle of abuse]] which consists of four phases. First, there is a buildup to abuse when tension rises until a domestic violence incident ensues. During the reconciliation stage, the abuser may be kind and loving and then there is a period of calm. When the situation is calm, the abused person may be hopeful that the situation will change.

====Intergenerational violence====
A common aspect among abusers is that they witnessed abuse in their childhood, in other words they were participants in a chain of [[Cycle of violence|intergenerational cycles of domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=Danieli&gt;{{citation | last1 = Simons | first1 = Ronald L. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Christine | contribution = An examination of competing explanations for the intergenerational transmission of domestic violence | editor-last = Danieli | editor-first = Yael | title = International handbook of multigenerational legacies of trauma | pages = 553–570 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Plenum Press]] | location = New York London | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780306457388 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thoNwuDmHEQC&amp;pg=PA553 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140704165827/http://books.google.com/books?id=thoNwuDmHEQC&amp;pg=PA553 | archivedate = 2014-07-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; That does not mean, conversely, that if a child witnesses or is subject to violence that they will become abusers.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 11" /&gt; Understanding and breaking the intergenerational abuse patterns may do more to reduce domestic violence than other remedies for managing the abuse.&lt;ref name=Danieli /&gt;

Responses that focus on children suggest that experiences throughout life influence an individual’s propensity to engage in family violence (either as a victim or as a perpetrator). Researchers supporting this theory suggest it is useful to think of three sources of domestic violence: childhood socialization, previous experiences in couple relationships during adolescence, and levels of strain in a person's current life. People who observe their parents abusing each other, or who were themselves abused may incorporate abuse into their behaviour within relationships that they establish as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = The effect of family structure on family violence: the case of remarriage | location = Durham, New Hampshire | year = 1984 }} Paper presented at the Second National Conference for Family Violence Researchers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kalmuss | first = Debra | title = The intergenerational transmission of marital aggression | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–19 | doi = 10.2307/351858 | jstor = 351858 | date = February 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = Continuity of marital behavior in remarriage: the case of spouse abuse | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–120 | doi = 10.2307/352234 | jstor = 352234 | date = February 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that the more children are [[corporal punishment|physically punished]], the more likely they will be as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners.&lt;ref name="Gershoff 2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page=16 |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127213730/http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= |access-date=2015-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who are [[spank]]ed more as children are more likely as adults to approve of hitting a partner, and also experience more marital conflict and feelings of anger in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health|title=Guidance for effective discipline |journal=Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=723–8 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9521967}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have found physical punishment to be associated with "higher levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses", even when controlling for other factors.&lt;ref name="Durrant &amp; Ensom"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Durrant |first=Joan |last2=Ensom |first2=Ron |date=4 September 2012 |title=Physical punishment of children: lessons from 20 years of research |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=184 |issue=12 |pages=1373–1377 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.101314 |pmid=22311946 |pmc=3447048}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these associations do not prove a [[causation (sociology)|causal]] relationship, a number of [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] suggest that the experience of physical punishment does have a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.

In some  [[patrilineal]] societies around the world, a young bride moves with the family of her husband. As a new girl in the home, she starts as having the lowest (or among the lowest) position in the family, and is often subjected to violence and abuse, and is, in particular, strongly controlled by the parents-in-law: with the arrival of the daughter-in-law in the family, the mother-in-law's status is elevated and she now has (often for the first time in her life) substantial power over someone else, and "This family system itself tends to produce a cycle of violence in which the formerly abused bride becomes the abusing mother-in-law to her new daughter-in-law".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ruether | first = Rosemary Radford | contribution = The greening of world religions | editor-last = Ruether | editor-first = Rosemary Radford | title = Integrating ecofeminism, globalization, and world religions | page = 50 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780742535305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International writes that, in [[Tajikistan]], "it is almost an initiation ritual for the mother-in-law to put her daughter-in-law through the same torments she went through herself as a young wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Violence is not just a family affair: women face abuse in Tajikistan | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | id = Paper no.

Personality traits include sudden bursts of [[anger]], poor [[impulse control]], and poor [[self-esteem]]. Various theories suggest that psychopathology is a factor, and that abuse experienced as a child leads some people to be more violent as adults. Correlation has been found between [[juvenile delinquency]] and domestic violence in adulthood.&lt;ref name=Kalra&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=M.A.|first=Michelle|last=Kalra|title=Juvenile delinquency and adult aggression against women|url=http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/570/|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University|date=1996|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502151157/http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/570/|archivedate=2012-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton has suggested a psychological profile of men who abuse their wives, arguing that they have [[borderline personality disorder|borderline personalities]] that are developed early in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dutton, Donald G.  |author2=Golant, Susan | title = The batterer: a psychological profile | publisher = Basic Books | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780465033881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dutton | first1 = Donald G. | last2 = Starzomski | first2 = Andrew J. | title = Borderline personality in perpetrators of psychological and physical abuse | journal = Violence &amp; Victims | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–337 | pmid = 8060906 | date = Winter 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these psychological theories are disputed: Gelles suggests that psychological theories are limited, and points out that other researchers have found that only 10% (or less) fit this psychological profile.

An [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychological]] explanation of domestic violence is that it represents male attempts to control female reproduction and ensure sexual exclusivity.&lt;ref name=Jealousy2&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Goetz | first = Aaron T. | title = The evolutionary psychology of violence | journal = Psicothema | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | pmid = 20100422 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.psicothema.com/english/psicothema.asp?id=3690 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130253/http://www.psicothema.com/english/psicothema.asp?id=3690 | archivedate = 2015-12-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence related to extramarital relations is seen as justified in certain parts of the world. For instance, a survey in [[Diyarbakir]], [[Turkey]], found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed [[adultery]], 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Rainsford | first = Sarah | title = 'Honour' crime defiance in Turkey | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357158.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = BBC | date = 19 October 2005 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150115054818/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357158.stm | archivedate = 15 January 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar feelings may at times be generated in a situations where one partner is more financially successful.&lt;ref name=Jealousy2/&gt;

===Social theories===

====General====
Social theories look at external factors in the offender's environment, such as family structure, stress, social learning, and includes [[rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Haugan | first1 = Grethemor Skagseth | last2 = Nøttestad | first2 = Jim Aage | title = Norway: treatment program for men who batters | url = http://www.europrofem.org/contri/2_04_en/en-viol/81en_vio.htm | publisher = Violence in intimate relationships Norway: EuroPROFEM – The European Men Profeminist Network, [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] | location = Trondheim, Norway | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042139/http://www.europrofem.org/contri/2_04_en/en-viol/81en_vio.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social learning theory]] suggests that people learn from observing and modeling after others' behavior. With [[positive reinforcement]], the behavior continues. If one observes violent behavior, one is more likely to imitate it. If there are no negative consequences (e. g. victim accepts the violence, with submission), then the behavior will likely continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hotaling | first1 = Gerald T. | last2 = Sugarman | first2 = David B. | title = An analysis of risk markers in husband to wife violence: the current state of knowledge | journal = Violence &amp; Victims | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–124 | pmid = 3154143 | date = 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Christopher M. | last2 = Meyer | first2 = Shannon-Lee | last3 = O'Leary | first3 = K.

Resource theory was suggested by William Goode (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Goode | first = William J. | title = Force and violence in the family | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 624–636 | doi = 10.2307/349435 | jstor = 349435 | date = November 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are most dependent on the spouse for economic well being (e.g. homemakers/housewives, women with handicaps, the unemployed), and are the primary caregiver to their children, fear the increased financial burden if they leave their marriage. Dependency means that they have fewer options and few resources to help them cope with or change their spouse's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra S. | last2 = Straus | first2 = Murray A. | author-link2 = Murray A.

Couples that share power equally experience lower incidence of conflict, and when conflict does arise, are less likely to resort to violence. If one spouse desires control and power in the relationship, the spouse may resort to abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kurz | first = Demie | contribution = Battering and the criminal justice system: a feminist view | editor-last1 = Buzawa | editor-first1 = Eva Schlesinger | editor-last2 = Buzawa | editor-first2 = Carl G. | title = Domestic violence: the changing criminal justice response | pages = 21–40 | publisher = Auburn House | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780865690011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may include coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, economic abuse, isolation, [[making light of]] the situation and blaming the spouse, using children (threatening to take them away), and behaving as "master of the castle".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Wallace | first = Harvey | contribution = Spousal abuse | editor-last = Wallace | editor-first = Harvey | title = Family violence: legal, medical, and social perspectives | pages = 184–185 | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780205418220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Power and control wheel | url = http://www.theduluthmodel.org/documents/PhyVio.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100601232757/http://www.theduluthmodel.org/documents/PhyVio.pdf | archivedate = 1 June 2010 | publisher = Domestic Abuse Intervention Project | accessdate= 27 November 2007 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social stress====

Stress may be increased when a person is living in a family situation, with increased pressures. Social stresses, due to inadequate finances or other such problems in a family may further increase tensions.&lt;ref name="gelles"/&gt; Violence is not always caused by stress, but may be one way that some people respond to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = Socialization and stress explanations for spouse abuse | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 473–491 | doi = 10.2307/2579191 | jstor = 2579191 | date = December 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aneshensel | first = Carol S.  | title = Social stress: theory and research | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 18 | pages = 15–38 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.18.080192.000311 | date = August 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Families and couples in poverty may be more likely to experience domestic violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other aspects.&lt;ref name="jewkes2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jewkes | first = Rachel | title = Intimate partner violence: causes and prevention | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9315 | pages = 1423–1429 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08357-5 | jstor = 11978358 | date = 20 April 2002 | pmid=11978358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man's ability to live up to his idea of "successful manhood", thus he fears losing honor and respect. Theory suggests that when he is unable to economically support his wife, and maintain control, he may turn to [[misogyny]], [[substance abuse]], and [[crime]] as ways to express masculinity.&lt;ref name="jewkes2002" /&gt;

Same-sex relationships may experience similar social stressors. Additionally, violence in same-sex relationships has been linked to internalized homophobia, which contributed to low self-esteem and anger in both perpetrator and victim.&lt;ref name="Murray 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = Christine E. | last2 = Mobley | first2 = A. Keith | last3 = Buford | first3 = Anne P. | last4 = Seaman-DeJohn | first4 = Megan M. | title = Same-sex Intimate partner violence: dynamics, social context, and counseling implications | journal = Journal of LGBT Issues in Counseling | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 7–30 | doi = 10.1300/J462v01n04_03 | date = January 2007 | url = https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/AK_Mobley_Same_2007.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035411/https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/AK_Mobley_Same_2007.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internalized homophobia also appears to be a barrier in victims seeking help. Similarly, [[heterosexism]] can play a key role in domestic violence in the LGBT community. As a social ideology that implies "heterosexuality is normative, morally superior, and better than [homosexuality],"&lt;ref name="Murray 2006"/&gt; heterosexism can hinder services and lead to an unhealthy self-image in sexual minorities. Heterosexism in legal and medical institutions can be seen in instances of discrimination, biases, and insensitivity toward sexual orientation. For example, as of 2006, seven states explicitly denied LGBT individuals the  ability to apply for protective orders,&lt;ref name="Murray 2006"/&gt; proliferating ideas of LGBT subjugation, which is tied to feelings of anger and powerlessness.

====Power and control====

[[File:(2) Cycle of abuse, power &amp; control issues in domestic abuse situations.gif|thumb|Cycle of abuse, power &amp; control issues in domestic abuse situations (double click to enlarge)]]
[[Power (social and political)|Power]] and control in abusive relationships is the way that abusers exert physical, sexual and other forms of abuse to gain control within relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Violence wheel | url = http://www.domesticviolence.org/violence-wheel/ | publisher = Domestic Abuse Violence Project (aka [[Duluth Model]]) | access-date = 18 April 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140223092347/http://www.domesticviolence.org/violence-wheel | archivedate = 23 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[causality|causalist]] view of domestic violence is that it is a strategy to gain or maintain power and control over the victim. This view is in alignment with Bancroft's "cost-benefit" theory that abuse rewards the perpetrator in ways other than, or in addition to, simply exercising power over his or her target(s). He cites evidence in support of his argument that, in most cases, abusers are quite capable of exercising control over themselves, but choose not to do so for various reasons.&lt;ref name=Bancroft&gt;{{cite book | last = Bancroft | first = Lundy | title = Why does he do that?: Inside the minds of angry and controlling men | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780425191651 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=xEZIpu3SVvcC Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101115109/https://books.google.com/books?id=xEZIpu3SVvcC |date=2015-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, one person seeks complete power and control over their partner and uses different ways to achieve this, including resorting to physical violence.

Questions of power and control are integral to the widely utilized [[Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project]]. They developed a "Power and Control Wheel" to illustrate this: it has power and control at the center, surrounded by spokes (techniques used), the titles of which include: coercion and [[threat]]s, [[intimidation]], [[emotional abuse]], [[solitude|isolation]], [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimizing]], [[denial|denying]] and blaming, using children, economic abuse, and privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Power and control wheel | url = http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence | access-date = 18 November 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150314062136/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf | archivedate = 14 March 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nonsubordination theory ===
Nonsubordination theory, sometimes called dominance theory, is an area of [[feminist legal theory]] that focuses on the power differential between men and women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonsubordination theory takes the position that society, and more especially men in society, use sex differences between men and women to perpetuate this power imbalance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Unlike other topics within [[feminist legal theory]], nonsubordination theory focuses specifically on certain sexual behaviors, including control of women’s [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[sexual harassment]], pornography, and violence against women generally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that nonsubordination theory best addresses these particular issues because they affect “almost exclusively” women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 332 citing MacKinnon, Catharine A. (1987) ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. Harvard University Press. pp. 40–41. {{ISBN|0674298748}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  MacKinnon advocates for nonsubordination theory over other theories, like formal equality, substantive equality, and difference theory, because [[sexual violence]] and other forms of [[violence against women]] are not a question of “sameness and difference,” but rather are best viewed as “more central inequalities” for women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Though nonsubordination theory has been discussed at great length in evaluating various forms of [[sexual violence]] against women, it also serves as a basis for understanding domestic violence and why it occurs.  Nonsubordination theory tackles the issue of domestic violence as a subset of the broader problem of [[violence against women]] because domestic violence victims are overwhelmingly female.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 387 citing Rennison, Callie Marie and Welchans, Sarah (May 2000) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090901024747/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov//bjs//pub/pdf/ipv.pdf ''Special Report: Intimate Partner Violence''], Bureau of Justice Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of nonsubordination theory propose several reasons why it works best to explain domestic violence.  First, there are certain recurring patterns in domestic violence that indicate it is not the result of intense anger or arguments, but rather is a form of subordination.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], pp. 389–92 citing Fischer, Karla et al. (1993) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37810125_The_Culture_of_Battering_and_the_Role_of_Mediation_in_Domestic_Violence_Cases ''The Culture of Battering and the Role of Mediation in Domestic Violence Cases''], 46 SMU L. Rev. pp. 2117, 2121–2130, 2133, 2136–2138, 2141.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is evidenced in part by the fact that domestic violence victims are typically abused in a variety of situations and by a variety of means.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  For example, victims are sometimes beaten after they have been sleeping or have been separated from the batterer, and often the abuse takes on a financial or emotional form in addition to physical abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Supporters of nonsubordination theory use these examples to dispel the notion that battering is always the result of heat of the moment anger or intense arguments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Also, batterers often employ manipulative and deliberate tactics when abusing their victims, which can “rang[e] from searching for and destroying a treasured object of hers to striking her in areas of her body that do not show bruises (e.g. her scalp) or in areas where she would be embarrassed to show others her bruises.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These behaviors can be even more useful to a batterer when the batterer and the victim share children, because the batterer often controls the family’s financial assets, making the victim less likely to leave if it would put her children at risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Martha Mahoney, of the [[University of Miami School of Law]], also points to the notion of “separation assault”—a phenomenon where a batterer further assaults a victim who is attempting or has attempted to leave an abusive relationship—as additional evidence that domestic violence is used to subordinate victims to their batterers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], pp. 392–93 citing {{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1289533 |jstor=1289533 |title=Legal Images of Battered Women: Redefining the Issue of Separation |journal=Michigan Law Review |volume=90 |pages=1 |year=1991 |last1=Mahoney |first1=Martha R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A batterer’s unwillingness to allow the victim to leave the relationship substantiates the idea that violence is being used to force the victim to continue to fulfill the batterer’s wishes that she obey him.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonsubordination theorists argue that all of these actions—the variety of abusive behaviors and settings, exploiting the victim’s children, and assault upon separation—suggest a larger problem than merely an inability to properly manage anger, though anger may be a byproduct of these behaviors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The purpose of these actions is to keep the victim, and sometimes the entire family, subordinate to the batterer, according to nonsubordination theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A second rationale for using nonsubordination theory to explain domestic violence, beyond the variety of tactics used by abusers, is that the frequency with which domestic violence occurs overpowers the idea that it is merely the result of a batterer’s anger.  Professor Mahoney explains that because of the [[sensationalism]] generated in media coverage of “big” or particularly horrific domestic violence cases, it is difficult for people to conceptualize how frequently domestic violence happens in society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, domestic violence is a regular occurrence experienced by up to one half of people in the United States, and an overwhelming number of victims are female.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The sheer number of domestic violence victims in the United States suggests that domestic violence is not merely the result of intimate partners who cannot control their anger.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonsubordination theory contends that it is the batterer’s desire to subordinate the victim, not his uncontainable anger, which explains the frequency of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonsubordination theorists argue that other forms of [[feminist legal theory]] do not offer any explanation for the phenomenon of domestic violence generally or the frequency with which it occurs.

Critics of nonsubordination theory complain that it offers no solutions to the problems it points out.  For example, proponents of nonsubordination theory criticize certain approaches that have been taken to address domestic violence in the legal system, such as mandatory arrest or prosecution policies.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;  These policies take discretion away from [[law enforcement]] by forcing police officers to arrest suspected domestic violence offenders and prosecutors to prosecute those cases.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There is a lot of discourse surrounding mandatory arrest. Opponents argue that it undermines a victim's autonomy, discourages the empowerment of women by discounting other resources available and puts victims at more risk for domestic abuse. States that have implemented mandatory arrest laws have 60% higher homicide rates which have been shown to be consistent with the decline in reporting rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlidakis|first=Alexandra|date=January 1, 2009|title=Mandatory Arrest: Past Its Prime|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=lawreview|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135236/http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=lawreview|archivedate=June 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of these policies contend that the criminal justice system is sometimes the only way to reach victims of domestic violence, and that if an offender knows he will be arrested, it will [[Deterrence (legal)|deter]] future domestic violence conduct.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  People who endorse nonsubordination theory argue that these policies only serve to further subordinate women by forcing them to take a certain course of action, thus compounding the trauma they experienced during the abuse.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  However, nonsubordination theory itself offers no better or more appropriate solutions, which is why some scholars argue that other forms of [[feminist legal theory]] are more appropriate to address issues of domestic and [[sexual violence]]. Sociologist Andrew Glover critiques non-subordination theory on the grounds that domestic violence occurs among homosexual couples at the same rate as heterosexual couples. So it cannot be caused by, or exist to perpetuate, power differentials between the sexes. &lt;ref&gt; Glover, Andrew. "Beware of Root Causes."

===Psychological===
Among victims who are still living with their perpetrators high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly reported. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is also common, as victims are made to feel [[guilt (emotion)|guilty]] for ‘provoking’ the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense [[criticism]]. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the [[Rating scales for depression|diagnostic criteria for depression]], either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide. Those who are battered either emotionally or physically often are also depressed because of a feeling of worthlessness. These feelings often persist long-term and it is suggested that many receive therapy for it because of the heightened risk of suicide and other traumatic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Barnett | first = Ola W. | title = Why battered women do not leave, part 2: external inhibiting factors — social support and internal inhibiting factors | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–35 | doi = 10.1177/1524838001002001001 | date = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to depression, victims of domestic violence also commonly experience long-term [[anxiety]] and [[panic]], and are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]] and [[Panic Disorder]]. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic violence is [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], intrusive images, exaggerated [[startle response]], [[nightmares]], and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitanza | first1 = Stephanie | last2 = Vogel | first2 = Laura C.M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = Linda L. | title = Distress and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in abused women | journal = Violence &amp; Victims | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–34 | pmid = 8555116 | date = Spring 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have indicated that it is important to consider the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite traumatized mother's best efforts, interfere with their child's response to the domestic violence and other traumatic events.&lt;ref name=care/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = Daniel S. | last2 = Coates | first2 = Susan W. | last3 = Kaminer | first3 = Tammy | last4 = Coots | first4 = Tammy | last5 = Zeanah, Jr. | first5 = Charles H. | last6 = Davies | first6 = Mark | last7 = Schonfeld | first7 = Irvin S. | last8 = Marshall | first8 = Randall D. | last9 = Liebowitz | first9 = Michael R. | last10 = Trabka | first10 = Kimberly A. | last11 = McCaw | first11 = Jaime E. | last12 = Myers | first12 = Michael M. | title = Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers | journal = Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–147 | doi = 10.1080/15299730802045666 | pmid = 18985165 | pmc = 2577290 | date = June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial===
Once victims leave their perpetrator, they can be stunned with the reality of the extent to which the abuse has taken away their autonomy. Due to economic abuse and isolation, the victim usually has very little money of their own and few people on whom they can rely when seeking help. This has been shown to be one of the greatest obstacles facing victims of DV, and the strongest factor that can discourage them from leaving their perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Stop Violence Against Women"&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic violence and housing | url = https://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Violence_and_Housing.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151002061435/http://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Violence_and_Housing.html | archive-date = 2 October 2015 | website = stopvaw.org | publisher = Stop Violence Against Women: a project of the Advocates for Human Rights | date = August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lacking financial resources, victims of DV often lack specialized skills, education, and training that are necessary to find gainful employment, and also may have several children to support. In 2003, thirty-six major US cities cited DV as one of the primary causes of homelessness in their areas.&lt;ref name="aclu.org"&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic violence and homelessness | url = https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/housing%20paper.4.pdf | website = aclu.org | publisher = American Civil Liberties Union Women's Rights Project | date = 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130812013406/http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/housing%20paper.4.pdf | archivedate = 2013-08-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been reported that one out of every three homeless women are homeless due to having left a DV relationship. If a victim is able to secure rental housing, it is likely that her apartment complex will have "zero tolerance" policies for crime; these policies can cause them to face eviction even if they are the victim (not the perpetrator) of violence.&lt;ref name="aclu.org"/&gt; While the number of shelters and community resources available to DV victims has grown tremendously, these agencies often have few employees and hundreds of victims seeking assistance which causes many victims to remain without the assistance they need.&lt;ref name="Stop Violence Against Women"/&gt;

Women and children experiencing domestic violence undergo [[occupational apartheid]]; they are typically denied access to desired occupations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cage | first = Anthea | title = Occupational therapy with women and children survivors of domestic violence: are we fulfilling our activist heritage?

An analysis in the US showed that 106 of the 771 officer killings between 1996 and 2009 occurred during domestic violence interventions.&lt;ref name=officers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer |first1=Shannon |last2=Carroll |first2=Randall H. |title=When officers die: understanding deadly domestic violence calls for service |journal=The Police Chief |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=24–27 |date=May 2011 |url=http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=2378&amp;issue_id=52011|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906013511/http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=2378&amp;issue_id=52011 |archivedate=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 51% were defined as unprovoked or as ambushes, taking place before officers had made contact with suspects. Another 40% occurred after contact and the remainder took place during tactical situations (those involving hostages and attempts to overcome barricades).&lt;ref name=officers/&gt; The [[FBI]]'s [[National Incident Based Reporting System#LEOKA segment|LEOKA]] system grouped officer domestic violence response deaths into the category of disturbances, along with "bar fights, gang matters, and persons brandishing weapons," which may have given rise to a misperception of the risks involved.&lt;ref name=officers/&gt;&lt;ref name="BuzawaBuzawa2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Buzawa | first1 = Eva Schlesinger | last2 = Buzawa | first2 = Carl G. | title = Domestic violence: the criminal justice response | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780761924487 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9jCJXOxKXoUC&amp;pg=PA80 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623192417/https://books.google.com/books?id=9jCJXOxKXoUC&amp;pg=PA80 | archivedate = 2016-06-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the gravity and intensity of hearing victims’ stories of abuse, professionals (social workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical professionals) are at risk themselves for secondary or vicarious trauma (VT), which causes the responder to experience trauma symptoms similar to the original victim after hearing about the victim’s experiences with abuse.&lt;ref name="Iliffe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iliffe | first1 = Gillian | last2 = Steed | first2 = Lyndall G. | title = Exploring the counselor's experience of working with perpetrators and survivors of domestic violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 393–412 | doi = 10.1177/088626000015004004 | date = April 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has demonstrated that professionals who experience vicarious trauma show signs of exaggerated startle response, [[hypervigilance]], nightmares, and [[intrusive thoughts]] although they have not experienced a trauma personally and do not qualify for a clinical diagnosis of PTSD.&lt;ref name="Iliffe" /&gt;

There exist several strategies that are being used to attempt to prevent or reduce DV. It is important to assess the effectiveness of a strategy that is being implemented.&lt;ref name="who.int1"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: taking action and generating evidence | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44350/1/9789241564007_eng.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205034703/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44350/1/9789241564007_eng.pdf | archivedate = 2016-02-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforming the legislation in order to ensure that domestic violence falls under the scope of the law is important. This may imply repealing existing laws which discriminate against women: according to the WHO, "when the law allows husbands to physically discipline wives, implementing a programme to prevent intimate partner violence may have little impact".&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt; [[Marriage law]]s are also important, "They [women] should also be able to enter freely into a marriage or to leave it, to obtain financial credit, and to own and administer property."&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt; Abolishing or restricting the offering and receiving of [[dowry]] and [[bride price]] and scrutinizing the impact of these transactions on the legislative decisions regarding DV is also important. UN Women has stated that the legislation should ensure that "a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Supplement to the handbook for legislation on violence against women: "harmful practices" against women | publisher = UN Women | location = New York | year = 2012 | url = http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610131259/http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2015-06-10  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender norms that promote the inferiority of women may lead to the abuse of women by intimate partners. The WHO writes that, "Dismantling hierarchical constructions of masculinity and femininity predicated on the control of women, and eliminating the structural factors that support inequalities are likely to make a significant contribution to preventing intimate partner and sexual violence".&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt;

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], "A key strategy in preventing domestic violence is the promotion of respectful, nonviolent relationships through individual, community, and societal level change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Prevent domestic violence in your community | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003152901/http://www.cdc.gov/features/intimatepartnerviolence/ | archive-date = 3 October 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/features/intimatepartnerviolence/ | website = cdc.gov | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early intervention programs, such as school-based programs to prevent [[dating violence]] are also effective.&lt;ref name="who.int1"/&gt; Children who grow up in violent homes may be led to believe that such behavior is a normal part of life, therefore it is important to challenge such attitudes when they are present among these children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dept. for Health | author-link = Department of Health (United Kingdom) | title = Responding to domestic abuse: a handbook for health professionals | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] | location = London, UK | year = 2005 | url = http://dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationspolicyandguidance/dh_4126161 | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060123125814/dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationspolicyandguidance/dh_4126161 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2006-01-23 | oclc = 278343897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emergent evolution''' was the [[hypothesis]] that, in the course of [[evolution]], some entirely new properties, such as mind and [[consciousness]], appear at certain critical points, usually because of an unpredictable rearrangement of the already existing entities. The term was originated by the psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2001"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (2001). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain''. University of Chicago Press. pp. 140-142, pp. 376-384. {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis was widely criticized for providing no mechanism to how entirely new properties emerge, and for its historical roots in [[teleology]].&lt;ref name="Bowler 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Brian P. (1992). ''The Rise and Fall of British Emergentism''. In A. Beckerman, H. Flohr, and J. Kim, eds., ''Emergence or Reduction? Essays on the Prospects of Nonreductive Physicalism''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. pp. 49–93. {{ISBN|3-11-012880-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, Charles A. (1929). ''The Philosophic Functions of Emergence''. ''[[The Philosophical Review]]''. Vol. 38, No. 4. pp. 372-384.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
The term ''[[emergence|emergent]]'' was first used to describe the concept by [[George Lewes]] in volume two of his 1875 book ''Problems of Life and Mind'' (p.&amp;nbsp;412).  [[Henri Bergson]] covered similar themes in his popular 1907 book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' on the [[Élan vital]].  Emergence was further developed by [[Samuel Alexander]] in his [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] during 1916–18 and published as ''Space, Time, and Deity'' (1920).  The related term ''emergent evolution'' was coined by [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] in his own Gifford lectures of 1921–22 at [[University of St. Andrews|St. Andrews]] and published as ''Emergent Evolution'' (1923). In an appendix to a lecture in his book, Morgan acknowledged the contributions of [[Roy Wood Sellars]]'s ''Evolutionary Naturalism'' (1922).

== Origins ==

=== Response to Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' ===

[[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s presentation of [[natural selection]], coupled to the idea of evolution in Western thought, had gained acceptance due to the wealth of observational data provided and the seeming replacement of divine law with natural law in the affairs of men.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Robert G.B.|title=Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262182572|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanism of [[natural selection]] described at the time only explained how organisms adapted to variation. The cause of genetic variation was unknown at the time.

{{quote|Darwin knew that nature had to produce variations before natural selection could act …The problem had been caught by other evolutionists almost as soon as ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was first published. [[Sir Charles Lyell]] saw it clearly in 1860 before he even became an evolutionist…(Reid, p.3)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

[[St. George Jackson Mivart|St. George Jackson Mivart's]] ''On the Genesis of Species'' (1872) and [[Edward Drinker Cope|Edward Cope]]'s ''Origin of the Fittest'' (1887) raised the need to address the origin of variation between members of a species. [[William Bateson]] in 1884 distinguished between the origin of novel variations and the action of natural selection (''Materials for the Study of Variation Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of Species'').&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

=== Wallace's further thoughts ===

Wallace throughout his life continued to support and extend the scope of Darwin's theory of evolution via the mechanism of natural selection. One of his works, ''Darwinism'', was often cited in support of Darwin's theory. He also worked to elaborate and extend Darwin and his ideas on natural selection. However, Wallace also realized that the scope and claim of the theory was limited. Darwin himself had limited it.

{{quote|the most prominent feature is that I enter into popular yet critical examination of those underlying fundamental problems which Darwin purposely excluded from his works as being beyond the scope of his enquiry. Such are the nature and cause of Life itself, and more especially of its most fundamental and mysterious powers - growth and reproduction ...

Darwin always ... adduced the "laws of Growth with Reproduction," and of "Inheritance with Variability," as being fundamental facts of nature, without which Natural Selection would be powerless or even non-existent ...

... even if it were proved to be an exact representation of the facts, it would not be an explanation... because it would not account for the forces, the directive agency, and the organising power which are essential features of growth …&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=Theory of Life|year=1911|publisher=Moffat, Yard and Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_world_of_life.html?id=M6UUAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In examining this aspect, excluded ''ab initio'' by Darwin, Wallace came to the conclusion that ''Life'' itself cannot be understood except by means of a theory that includes "an organising and directive Life-Principle." These necessarily involve a "Creative Power", a "directive Mind" and finally "an ultimate Purpose" (the development of Man). It supports the view of [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] that "life is the cause, not the consequence" of the organisation of matter. Thus, life precedes matter and when it infuses matter, forms living matter (protoplasm).

{{quote|a very well-founded doctrine, and one which was often advocated by John Hunter, that life is the cause and not the consequence of organisation ... if so, life must be antecedent to organisation, and can only be conceived as indissolubly connected with spirit and with thought, and with the cause of the directive energy everywhere manifested in the growth of living things ... endowed with the mysterious organising power we term life ...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}
Wallace then refers to the operation of another power called "mind" that utilizes the power of life and is connected with a higher realm than life or matter:

{{quote|evidence of a foreseeing mind which...so directed and organised that life, in all its myriad forms, as, in the far-off future, to provide all that was most essential for the growth and development of man's spiritual nature ...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}

Proceeding from Hunter's view that Life is the directive power above and behind living matter, Wallace argues that logically, Mind is the cause of [[consciousness]], which exists in different degrees and kinds in living matter.

{{quote|If, as John Hunter, T.H. Huxley, and other eminent thinkers have declared, "life is the cause, not the consequence, of organisation," so we may believe that mind is the cause, not the consequence, of brain development.

... So there are undoubtedly different degrees and probably also different kinds of mind in various grades of animal life&amp;nbsp;... And&amp;nbsp;... so the mind-giver&amp;nbsp;... enables each class or order of animals to obtain the amount of mind requisite for its place in nature&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;}}

== Emergent evolution ==

=== Early roots ===
The issue of how change in nature 'emerged' can be found in classical Greek thought -  order coming out of chaos and whether by chance or necessity. [[Aristotle]] spoke of wholes that were greater than the sum of their parts because of emergent properties. The second-century anatomist and physiologist [[Galen]] also distinguished between the resultant and emergent qualities of wholes. (Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;72)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

[[Hegel]] spoke of the revolutionary progression of life from non-living to conscious and then to the spiritual and Kant perceived that simple parts of an organism interact to produce a progressively complex series of emergences of functional forms, a distinction that carried over to [[John Stuart Mill]] (1843), who stated that even chemical compounds have novel features that cannot be predicted from their elements. [Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;72]&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

The idea of an emergent quality that was something new in nature was further taken up by [[George Henry Lewes]] (1874–1875), who again noted, as with Galen earlier, that these evolutionary "emergent" qualities are distinguishable from adaptive, additive "resultants." [[Henry Drummond (evangelist)|Henry Drummond]] in ''The Descent of Man'' (1894) stated that emergence can be seen in the fact that the laws of nature are different for the organic or vital compared to the inertial inorganic realm.

{{quote|When we pass from the inorganic to the organic we come upon a new set of laws - but the reason why the lower set do not seem to operate in the higher sphere is not that they are annhilated, but that they are overruled. (Drummond 1883, p. 405, quoted in Reid)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

As Reid points out, Drummond also realized that greater complexity brought greater adaptability. (Reid. p.&amp;nbsp;73)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

[[Samuel Alexander]] took up the idea that emergences had properties that overruled the demands of the lower levels of organization. And more recently, this theme is taken up by John Holland (1998):

{{quote|If we turn reductionism on its head we add levels. More carefully, we add new laws that satisfy the constraints imposed by laws already in place. Moreover these new laws apply to complex phenomena that are consequences of the original laws; they are at a new level.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=John|title=Emergence. From Chaos to Order|year=1998|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== C. Lloyd Morgan and emergent evolution ===
Another major scientist to question natural selection as the motive force of evolution was [[C. Lloyd Morgan]], a zoologist and student of [[T.H. Huxley]], who had a strong influence on Samuel Alexander. His ''Emergent Evolution'' (1923) established the central idea that an emergence might have the appearance of [[Saltation (biology)|saltation]] but was best regarded as "a qualitative change of direction or critical turning point."(quoted in Reid, p.&amp;nbsp;73-74)&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;  Morgan, due to his work in animal psychology, had earlier (1894) questioned the  continuity view of mental evolution, and held that there were various discontinuities in cross-species mental abilities. To offset any attempt to read [[anthropomorphism]] into his view, he created the famous, but often misunderstood methodological canon:
 
{{quote|In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale.|Morgan, 1894, p. 53}}
However, Morgan realizing that this was being misused to advocate reductionism (rather than as a general methodological caution), introduced a qualification into the second edition of his ''An Introduction to Comparative Psychology'' (1903):

{{quote|To this, however, it should be added, lest the range of the principle be misunderstood, that the canon by no means excludes the interpretation of a particular activity in terms of the higher processes, if we already have independent evidence of the occurrence of these higher processes in the animal under observation.|Morgan, 1903, p. 59}}

As Reid observes,

{{quote|While the so-called historiographical "rehabilitation of the canon" has been underway for some time now, Morgan's emergent evolutionist position (which was the highest expression of his attempt to place the study of mind back into such a "wider" natural history) is seldom mentioned in more than passing terms even within contemporary history of psychology textbooks.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;}}

Morgan also fought against the [[Behaviorism|behaviorist school]] and clarified even more his emergent views on evolution:

{{quote|An influential school of 'behaviorists' roundly deny that mental relations, if such there be, are in any sense or in any manner effective... My message is that one may speak of mental relations as effective no less 'scientifically' than... physical relations...|Morgan, 1930, p. 72}}

His ''Animal Conduct'' (1930) explicitly distinguishes between three "grades" or "levels of mentality" which he labeled: 'percipient, perceptive, and reflective.' (p.&amp;nbsp;42)

=== Alexander and the emergence of mind ===

Morgan's idea of a polaric relationship between lower and higher, was taken up by Samuel Alexander, who argued that the mental process is not reducible to the neural processes on which it depends at the physical-material level. Instead, they are two poles of a unity of function. Further, the neural process that expressed mental process itself possesses a quality (mind) that the other neural processes don’t. At the same time, the mental process, because it is functionally identical to this particular neural process, is also a vital one.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Samuel|title=Space, Time and Deity|year=1916–18|publisher=Gifford Lectures|location=Glasgow|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Deity.html?id=v70tAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And mental process is also "something new, "a fresh creation", which precludes a psycho-physiological parallelism. Reductionism is also contrary to empirical fact.

{{quote|All the available evidence of fact leads to the conclusion that the mental element is essential to the neural process which it is said to accompany...and is not accidental to it, nor is it in turn indifferent to the mental feature. Epiphenomenalism is a mere fallacy of observation.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

At the same time Alexander stated that his view was not one of animism or vitalism, where the mind is an independent entity action on the brain, or conversely, acted upon by the brain. Mental activity is an emergent, a new "thing" not reducible to its initial neural parts.

{{quote|All the available evidence of fact leads to the conclusion that the mental element is essential to the neural process which it is said to accompany...and is not accidental to it, nor is it in turn indifferent to the mental feature. Epiphenomenalism is a mere fallacy of observation.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

For Alexander, the world unfolds in space-time, which has the inherent quality of motion. This motion through space-time results in new “complexities of motion” in the form of a new quality or emergent. The emergent retains the qualities of the prior “complexities of motion” but also has something new that was not there before. This something new comes with its own laws of behavior. Time is the quality that creates motion through Space, and matter is simply motion expressed in forms in Space, or as Alexander says a little later, “complexes of motion.” Matter arises out of the basic ground of Space-Time continuity and has an element of “body” (lower order) and an element of “mind” (higher order), or “the conception that a secondary quality is the mind of its primary substrate.”

Mind is an emergent from life and life itself is an emergent from matter. Each level contains and is interconnected with the level and qualities below it, and to the extent that it contains lower levels, these aspects are subject to the laws of that level. All mental functions are living, but not all living functions are mental; all living functions are physico-chemical, but not all physico-chemical processes are living - just as we could say that all people living in Ohio are Americans, but not all Americans live in Ohio. Thus, there are levels of existence, or natural jurisdictions, within a given higher level such that the higher level contains elements of each of the previous levels of existence. The physical level contains the pure dimensionality of Space-Time in addition to the emergent of physico-chemical processes; the next emergent level, life, also contains Space-Time as well as the physico-chemical in addition to the quality of life; the level of mind contains all of the previous three levels, plus consciousness. As a result of this nesting and inter-action of emergents, like fluid Russian dolls, higher emergents cannot be reduced to lower ones, and different laws and methods of inquiry are required for each level.

{{quote|Life is not an epiphenomenon of matter but an emergent from it&amp;nbsp;... The new character or quality which the vital physico-chemical complex possesses stands to it as soul or mind to the neural basis.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

For Alexander, the "directing agency" or entelechy is found "in the principle or plan".

{{quote|a given stage of material complexity is characterised by such and such special features…By accepting this we at any rate confine ourselves to noting the facts…and do not invent entities for which there seems to be no other justification than that something is done in life which is not done in matter.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

While an emergent is a higher complexity, it also results in a new simplicity as it brings a higher order into what was previously less ordered (a new simplex out of a complex). This new simplicity does not carry any of the qualities or aspects of that emergent level prior to it, but as noted, does still carry within it such lower levels so can be understood to that extent through the science of such levels, yet not itself be understood except by a science that is able to reveal the new laws and principles applicable to it.
 
{{quote|Ascent takes place, it would seem, through complexity.[increasing order] But at each change of quality the complexity as it were gathers itself together and is expressed in a new simplicity.
Within a given level of emergence, there are degrees of development.
 
... There are on one level degrees of perfection or development; and at the same time there is affinity by descent between the existents belonging to the level. This difference of perfection is not the same thing as difference of order or rank such as subsists between matter and life or life and mind ...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

The concept or idea of mind, the highest emergent known to us, being at our level, extends all the way down to pure dimensionality or Space-Time. In other words, time is the “mind” of motion, materialising is the “mind” of matter, living the “mind” of life. Motion through pure time (or life astronomical, mind ideational) emerges as matter “materialising” (geological time, life geological, mind existential), and this emerges as life “living” (biological time, life biological, mind experiential), which in turn give us mind “minding” (historical time, life historical, mind cognitional). But there is also an extension possible upwards of mind to what we call Deity.

{{quote|let us describe the empirical quality of any kind of finite which performs to it the office of consciousness or mind as its 'mind.' Yet at the same time let us remember that the 'mind' of a living thing is not conscious mind but is life, and has not the empirical character of consciousness at all, and that life is not merely a lower degree of mind or consciousness, but something different. We are using 'mind' metaphorically by transference from real minds and applying it to the finites on each level in virtue of their distinctive quality; down to Space-Time itself whose existent complexes of bare space-time have for their mind bare time in its empirical variations.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

Alexander goes back to the Greek idea of knowledge being “out there” in the object being contemplated. In that sense, there is not mental object (concept) “distinct” (that is, different in state of being) from the physical object, but only an apparent split between the two, which can then be brought together by proper compresence or participation of the consciousness in the object itself.

{{quote|There is no consciousness lodged, as I have supposed, in the organism as a quality of the neural response; consciousness belongs to the totality of objects, of what are commonly called the objects of consciousness or the field of consciousness&amp;nbsp;... Consciousness is therefore "out there" where the objects are, by a new version of Berkleyanism&amp;nbsp;... Obviously for this doctrine as for mine there is no mental object as distinct from a physical object: the image of a tree is a tree in an appropriate form...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

Because of the interconnectedness of the universe by virtue of Space-Time, and because the mind apprehends space, time and motion through a unity of sense and mind experience, there is a form of knowing that is intuitive (participative) - sense and reason are outgrowths from it.
 
{{quote|In being conscious of its own space and time, the mind is conscious of the space and time of external things and vice versa. This is a direct consequence of the continuity of Space-Time in virtue of which any point-instant is connected sooner or later, directly or indirectly, with every other...

The mind therefore does not apprehend the space of its objects, that is their shape, size and locality, by sensation, for it depends for its character on mere spatio-temporal conditions, though it is not to be had as consciousness in the absence of sensation (or else of course ideation). It is clear without repeating these considerations that the same proposition is true of Time; and of motion&amp;nbsp;... I shall call this mode of apprehension in its distinction from sensation, intuition.&amp;nbsp;... Intuition is different from reason, but reason and sense alike are outgrowths from it, empirical determinations of it...&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;}}

In a sense, the universe is a participative one and open to participation by mind as well so that mind can intuitively know an object, contrary to what Kant asserted. Participation (togetherness) is something that is “enjoyed” (experienced) not contemplated, though in the higher level of consciousness, it would be contemplated.

{{quote|The universe for Alexander is essentially in process, with Time as its ongoing aspect, and the ongoing process consists in the formation of changing complexes of motions. These complexes become ordered in repeatable ways displaying what he calls "qualities." There is a hierarchy of kinds of organized patterns of motions, in which each level depends on the subvening level, but also displays qualities not shown at the subvening level nor predictable from it… On this there sometimes supervenes a further level with the quality called "life"; and certain subtle syntheses which carry life are the foundation for a further level with a new quality. "mind." This is the highest level known to us, but not necessarily the highest possible level. The universe has a forward thrust, called its "nisus" (broadly to be identified with the Time aspect) in virtue of which further levels are to be expected...&lt;ref name=Emmet&gt;{{cite web|last=Emmet |first=Dorothy |title=Whitehead and Alexander |url=http://www.religion-online/showarticle.asp?title=2834 |accessdate=23 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Robert G. B. Reid===

Emergent evolution was revived by Robert G. B. Reid, a biology professor at the [[University of Victoria]]. In his book ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis'' (1985), he stated that the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] with its emphasis on [[natural selection]] is an incomplete picture of evolution, and emergent evolution can explain the origin of genetic variation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Mary B. (1986). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''. Vol. 61, No. 2, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, John F. (1987). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]''. Vol. 20, No. 3. pp. 424-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] heavily criticized the book claiming it was a misinformed attack on natural selection. Mayr commented that Reid was working from an "obsolete conceptual framework", provided no solid evidence and that he was arguing for a [[Orthogenesis|teleological process of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. (1986). ''Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid''. [[Isis (journal)|Isis]]. Vol. 77, No. 2, pp. 358-359.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid later published the book ''Biological Emergences'' (2007) with a theory on how emergent novelties are generated in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Christopher S. (2008). ''Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment by Robert G. B. Reid''. ''[[Integrative and Comparative Biology]]''. Vol. 48, No. 6. pp. 871-873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/biological-emergences "Biological Emergences"]. [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Massimo Pigliucci]] "Biological Emergences by Robert Reid is an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate on the status of evolutionary theory, but it is hard to separate the good stuff from the more dubious claims." Pigliucci noted a dubious claim in the book is that natural selection has no role in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Pigliucci, Massimo. (2009). [http://philpapers.org/archive/MASDWN/ "Down with Natural Selection?"] ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]''. 52: 134-140.&lt;/ref&gt; It was positively reviewed by biologist Alexander Badyaev who commented that "the book succeeds in drawing attention to an under appreciated aspect of the evolutionary process".&lt;ref&gt;Badyaev, Alexander V. (2008). ''Evolution Despite Natural Selection? Emergence Theory and the Ever Elusive Link Between Adaptation and Adaptability''. ''[[Acta Biotheoretica]]'' 56: 249-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have criticized Reid's unorthodox views on emergence and evolution. Biologist Samuel Scheiner stated that Reid's "presentation is both a caricature of evolutionary theory and severely out of date."&lt;ref&gt;Scheiner, Samuel M. (2004). ''The Metamorphosis of Evo-Devo''. ''[[BioScience]]''. Vol. 54, No. 12.  pp. 1150-1151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[thermodynamics]], an '''equation of state''' is a [[thermodynamic equations|thermodynamic equation]] relating [[state variable]]s which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as [[pressure]], [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], [[temperature]] ('''PVT'''), or [[internal energy]].&lt;ref name="Perrot" &gt;{{cite book | author=Perrot, Pierre | title=A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-19-856552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of [[fluid]]s, mixtures of fluids, [[solid]]s, and the interior of [[star]]s.
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}

==Overview==
The most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures. One of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the [[ideal gas law]], which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. However, this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions.

Another common use is in modeling the interior of stars, including [[neutron star]]s, dense matter ([[quark–gluon plasma]]s) and radiation fields. A related concept is the [[perfect fluid]] [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state used in cosmology]].

Equations of state can also describe solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another.

In a practical context, equations of state are instrumental for PVT calculations in [[process engineering]] problems, such as petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. A successful PVT model based on a fitted equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the [[reservoir fluids]], and pipe sizing.

== Historical ==

=== Boyle's law (1662) ===
Boyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In 1662, the Irish physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]] performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. In mathematical form, this can be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt; pV = \mathrm{constant}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!--this V doesn't have to be molar volume--&gt;

The above relationship has also been attributed to [[Edme Mariotte]] and is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law. However, Mariotte's work was not published until 1676.

=== Charles's law or Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac (1787) ===
In 1787 the French physicist [[Jacques Charles]] found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. Later, in 1802, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Dalton's law of partial pressures (1801) ===
[[Dalton's Law]] of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.

Mathematically, this can be represented for ''n'' species as:

::&lt;math&gt;
p_\text{total} = p_1+p_2+\cdots+p_n = p_\text{total} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The ideal gas law (1834) ===
In 1834, [[Émile Clapeyron]] combined Boyle's Law and Charles' law into the first statement of the ''[[ideal gas law]]''. Initially, the law was formulated as ''pV&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R''(''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees Celsius), where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]. However, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the Celsius scale was defined with 0{{nbsp}}°C = 273.15{{nbsp}}K, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;pV_m = R \left(T_C + 273.15\ {}^\circ\text{C}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Van der Waals equation of state (1873) ===
In 1873, [[J. D. van der Waals]] introduced the first [[van der Waals equation|equation of state]] derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.&lt;ref name="van der Waals" &gt;{{cite book |author1=van der Waals |author2=J. D. | title=On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States (doctoral dissertation) | publisher=Universiteit Leiden | year=1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the [[Redlich–Kwong equation of state]] and the [[#Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong|Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong]].

== General form of an equation of state ==
For a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form

:&lt;math&gt;f(p, V, T) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

An equation used to model this relationship is called an equation of state. In the following sections major equations of state are described, and the variables used here are defined as follows. Any consistent set of units may be used, although [[International System of Units|SI]] units are preferred. [[Thermodynamic temperature|Absolute temperature]] refers to use of the [[Kelvin]] (K) or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] (°R) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.

:&lt;math&gt;\ p&lt;/math&gt;, pressure (absolute)
:&lt;math&gt;\ V&lt;/math&gt;, volume
:&lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt;, number of moles of a substance
:&lt;math&gt;\ V_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, '''[[molar volume]]''', the volume of 1 mole of gas or liquid
:&lt;math&gt;\ T&lt;/math&gt;, [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]
:&lt;math&gt;\ R&lt;/math&gt;, [[gas constant|ideal gas constant]] ≈ 8.3144621{{nbsp}}J/mol·K
:&lt;math&gt;\ p_c&lt;/math&gt;, pressure at the critical point
:&lt;math&gt;\ V_c&lt;/math&gt;, molar volume at the critical point
:&lt;math&gt;\ T_c&lt;/math&gt;, absolute temperature at the critical point

== Classical ideal gas law ==
The classical [[ideal gas law]] may be written

:&lt;math&gt;pV = nRT.&lt;/math&gt;

In the form shown above, the equation of state is thus

:&lt;math&gt;f(p, V, T) = pV - nRT = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

If the [[Perfect gas|calorically perfect]] gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho(\gamma - 1)e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;  is the density, &lt;math&gt;\gamma = C_p/C_v&lt;/math&gt; is the adiabatic index ([[heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]]), &lt;math&gt;e = C_v T&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass (the "specific internal energy"), &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant volume, and &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant pressure.

== Cubic equations of state ==
Cubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a [[cubic function]] of V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Van der Waals equation of state ===
The [[Van der Waals equation]] of state may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(p + \frac{a}{V_m^2}\right)\left(V_m - b\right) = RT&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; is [[molar volume]]. The substance-specific constants &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from the [[critical properties]] &lt;math&gt;p_c, T_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; (noting that &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; is the molar volume at the critical point) as:
:&lt;math&gt;a = 3p_c\, V_c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{V_c}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also written as
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{27(R\,T_c)^2}{64p_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{R\,T_c}{8p_c}.&lt;/math&gt;

Proposed in 1873, the van der Waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. In this landmark equation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is called the attraction parameter and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. While the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. While the van der Waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. Other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.

The van der Waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, "improved" due to two independent reasons:
# Molecules are thought as particles with volume, not material points. Thus &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; cannot be too little, less than some constant. So we get (&lt;math&gt;V_m - b&lt;/math&gt;) instead of &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt;.
# While ideal gas molecules do not interact, we consider molecules attracting others within a distance of several molecules' radii. It makes no effect inside the material, but surface molecules are attracted into the material from the surface. We see this as diminishing of pressure on the outer shell (which is used in the ideal gas law), so we write (&lt;math&gt;p +&lt;/math&gt; something) instead of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. To evaluate this ‘something’, let's examine an additional force acting on an element of gas surface. While the force acting on each surface molecule is ~&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, the force acting on the whole element is ~&lt;math&gt;\rho^2&lt;/math&gt;~&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{V_m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

With the reduced state variables, i.e. V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=P/P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=T/T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, the reduced form of the Van der Waals equation can be formulated:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(P_r + \frac{3}{V_r^2}\right)\left(3V_r - 1\right) = 8T_r&lt;/math&gt;

The benefit of this form is that for given T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's method]] for the reduced cubic form:

:&lt;math&gt;V_r^3 - \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{8T_r}{3P_r}\right)V_r^2 + \frac{3V_r}{P_r} - \frac{1}{P_r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1, the system is in a state of vapor–liquid equilibrium. The reduced cubic equation of state yields in that case 3 solutions. The largest and the lowest solution are the gas and liquid reduced volume.

=== Redlich-Kwong equation of state ===
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a}{\sqrt{T}\,V_m\left(V_m + b\right)} \\[3pt]
  a &amp;\approx 0.42748\frac{R^2\,T_c^\frac{5}{2}}{p_c} \\[3pt]
  b &amp;\approx 0.08664\frac{R\,T_c}{p_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Introduced in 1949, the [[Redlich-Kwong equation of state]] was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. It is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. While superior to the van der Waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating [[vapor–liquid equilibria]]. However, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.

The Redlich-Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the [[critical properties|critical pressure]] (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the [[critical properties|critical temperature]] (reduced temperature):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{p_c} &lt; \frac{T}{2T_c}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong ===
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_m-b} - \frac{a\,\alpha}{V_m\left(V_m+b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{0.42747\,R^2\,T_c^2}{P_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{0.08664\,R\,T_c}{P_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left(1 + \left(0.48508 + 1.55171\,\omega - 0.15613\,\omega^2\right) \left(1-T_r^{\,0.5}\right)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_r = \frac{T}{T_c}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ω is the [[acentric factor]] for the species.

This formulation for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is due to Graboski and Daubert.  The original formulation from Soave is:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left(1 + \left(0.480 + 1.574\,\omega - 0.176\,\omega^2\right) \left(1-T_r^{\,0.5}\right)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

for hydrogen:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1.202 \exp\left(-0.30288\,T_r\right).&lt;/math&gt;

We can also write it in the polynomial form, with:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{a\,\alpha\,P}{R^2\,T^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{b\,P}{R\,T}&lt;/math&gt;
then we have:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = Z^3-Z^2+Z\left(A-B-B^2\right)-AB \;&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]] and Z=PV/(RT) is the [[compressibility factor]].

In 1972 G. Soave&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0009-2509(72)80096-4|title = Equilibrium constants from a modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state| journal=Chemical Engineering Science| volume=27| issue=6| pages=1197–1203|year = 1972|last1 = Soave|first1 = Giorgio}}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the 1/{{radic|''T''}} term of the Redlich-Kwong equation with a function α(T,ω) involving the temperature and the [[acentric factor]] (the resulting equation is also known as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state; SRK EOS). The α function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.

Note especially that this replacement changes the definition of ''a'' slightly, as the &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is now to the second power.

=== Volume translation of Peneloux et alios ===
The SRK EOS may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_{m,\text{SRK}} - b} - \frac{a}{V_{m,\text{SRK}} \left(V_{m,\text{SRK}} + b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    a &amp;= a_c\, \alpha \\
  a_c &amp;\approx 0.42747\frac{R^2\,T_c^2}{P_c} \\
    b &amp;\approx 0.08664\frac{R\,T_c}{P_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and other parts of the SRK EOS is defined in the SRK EOS section.

A downside of the SRK EOS, and other cubic EOS, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume. Peneloux et alios (1982)&lt;ref name="Peneloux1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peneloux|first1=A.|last2=Rauzy|first2=E.|last3=Freze|first3=R.|year=1982|title= A Consistent Correction for Redlich-Kwong-Soave Volumes|journal= Fluid Phase Equilibria|volume=8|issue=1982|pages=7–23|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(82)80002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation

:&lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}} = V_m + c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is an additional fluid component parameter that translate the molar volume slightly. On the liquid branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure. On the gas branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch. Thus, the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small. Unfortunately, there are two versions that occur in science and industry.

In the first version only &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; is translated,&lt;ref name="Soave1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soave|first1=G.|last2=Fermeglia|first2=M.|year=1990|title= On the Application of Cubic Equation of State to Synthetic High-Pressure VLE Measurements|journal= Fluid Phase Equilibria|volume=60|issue=1990|pages=261–271|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(90)85056-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Zeberg2001"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Zéberg-Mikkelsen|first1=C.K.|year=2001|title=Viscosity study of hydrocarbon fluids at reservoir conditions - modeling and measurements|journal=Ph.D. Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark. Department of Chemical Engineering|volume=June|issue=2001|pages=1–271|isbn=9788790142742}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the EOS becomes

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_m + c - b} - \frac{a}{\left(V_m + c\right) \left(V_m + c + b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

In the second version both &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_\text{SRK}&lt;/math&gt; are translated, or the translation of &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter {{nowrap|b − c}}.&lt;ref name="Pedersen1989"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Pedersen|first1=K. S.|last2=Fredenslund|first2=Aa.|last3=Thomassen|first3=P.|year=1989|title=Properties of Oils and Natural Gases|journal=Book Published by Gulf Publishing Company, Houston|volume=1989|issue=1989|pages=1–252|isbn=9780872015883}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  b_\text{SRK} &amp;= b + c \quad \text{or} \quad b - c \curvearrowright b \\
             p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a}{\left(V_m + c\right) \left(V_m + 2c + b\right)}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sum_{i=1}^n z_i c_i&lt;/math&gt;

The c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation

:&lt;math&gt;c_i \approx 0.40768\ \frac{RT_{ci}}{P_{ci}} \left(0.29441 - Z_{\text{RA},i}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the Rackett compressibility factor &lt;math&gt;Z_{text{RA},i}&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated by

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{RA},i} \approx 0.29056 - 0.08775\ \omega_i&lt;/math&gt;

A nice feature with the volume translation method of Peneloux et alios (1982) is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations.&lt;ref name="Knudsen1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knudsen|first1=K.|year=1992|title=Phase Equilibria and Transport of Multiphase Systems|journal=Ph.D. Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark. Department of Chemical Engineering|issue=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that this method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic EOSs if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected EOS.

=== Peng–Robinson equation of state ===

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a\,\alpha}{V_m^2 + 2bV_m - b^2} \\[3pt]
       a &amp;\approx 0.45724 \frac{R^2\,T_c^2}{p_c} \\[3pt]
       b &amp;\approx 0.07780 \frac{R\,T_c}{p_c} \\[3pt]
  \alpha &amp;= \left(1 + \kappa \left(1 - T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)^2 \\[3pt]
  \kappa &amp;\approx 0.37464 + 1.54226\,\omega - 0.26992\,\omega^2 \\[3pt]
     T_r &amp;= \frac{T}{T_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In polynomial form:
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{\alpha a p}{R^2\,T^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{bp}{RT}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z^3 - (1 - B)Z^2 + \left(A - 2B - 3B^2\right)Z - \left(AB - B^2 - B^3\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[acentric factor]] of the species, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]] and &lt;math&gt;Z = PV/nRT&lt;/math&gt; is [[compressibility factor]].

The Peng–Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) was developed in 1976 at The [[University of Alberta]] by [[Ding Yu Peng|Ding-Yu Peng]] and Donald Robinson in order to satisfy the following goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A New Two-Constant Equation of State | journal = Industrial and Engineering Chemistry: Fundamentals | volume = 15 | year = 1976 | pages = 59–64 |author1=Peng, D. Y. |author2=Robinson, D. B. | doi = 10.1021/i160057a011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The parameters should be expressible in terms of the [[critical properties]] and the [[acentric factor]].
# The model should provide reasonable accuracy near the critical point, particularly for calculations of the [[compressibility factor]] and liquid density.
# The mixing rules should not employ more than a single binary interaction parameter, which should be independent of temperature, pressure and composition.
# The equation should be applicable to all calculations of all fluid properties in natural gas processes.

For the most part the Peng–Robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the Soave equation, although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials, especially nonpolar ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Essentials of Reservoir Engineering | volume = 1 | year = 2007 | pages = 151 | author = Pierre Donnez  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[departure function]]s of the Peng–Robinson equation are given on a separate article.

The analytic values of its characteristic constants are:

: &lt;math&gt;Z_c = \frac{1}{32} \left( 11 - 2\sqrt{7} \sinh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{asinh}(\frac{13}{7 \sqrt{7}})) \right) \approx 0.307401&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b' = \frac{b}{V_{m,c}} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \sqrt{8} \sinh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{asinh}(\sqrt{8}) ) - 1 \right) \approx 0.253077 \approx \frac{0.07780}{Z_c} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{P_c V_{m,c}^2}{a\,b'} = \frac{3}{8} \left( 1 + \cosh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{acosh}(3) ) \right) \approx 0.816619 \approx \frac{Z_c^2}{0.45724 \, b'} &lt;/math&gt;

A modification to the attraction term in the Peng–Robinson equation of state published by Stryjek and Vera in 1986 (PRSV) significantly improved the model's accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the [[acentric factor]].&lt;ref name="PRSV1"&gt;{{cite journal | title = PRSV: An improved Peng–Robinson equation of state for pure compounds and mixtures | journal = The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | year = 1986 | pages = 323–333 |author1=Stryjek, R.  |author2=Vera, J. H. | doi = 10.1002/cjce.5450640224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modification is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \kappa &amp;= \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 \left(1 + T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(0.7 - T_r\right) \\
  \kappa_0 &amp;= 0.378893+1.4897153\,\omega - 0.17131848\,\omega^2 + 0.0196554\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1&lt;/math&gt; is an adjustable pure component parameter.  Stryjek and Vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article. At reduced temperatures above 0.7, they recommend to set &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and simply use &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \kappa_0 &lt;/math&gt;. For alcohols and water the value of &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1 &lt;/math&gt; may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures.&lt;ref name="PRSV1" /&gt;

====PRSV2====
A subsequent modification published in 1986 (PRSV2) further improved the model's accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification.&lt;ref name="PRSV2"&gt;{{cite journal | title = PRSV2: A cubic equation of state for accurate vapor—liquid equilibria calculations | journal = The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | year = 1986 | pages = 820–826 |author1=Stryjek, R.  |author2=Vera, J. H. | doi = 10.1002/cjce.5450640516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modification is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \kappa &amp;= \kappa_0 + \left[\kappa_1 + \kappa_2\left(\kappa_3 - T_r\right)\left(1 - T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\left(1 + T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(0.7 - T_r\right) \\
  \kappa_0 &amp;= 0.378893 + 1.4897153\,\omega - 0.17131848\,\omega^2 + 0.0196554\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_3&lt;/math&gt; are adjustable pure component parameters.

PRSV2 is particularly advantageous for [[vapor–liquid equilibrium|VLE]] calculations.  While PRSV1 does offer an advantage over the Peng–Robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations.&lt;ref name="PRSV1" /&gt;  The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors.  It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design.  However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.&lt;ref name="PRSV2" /&gt;

One thing to note is that in the PRSV equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.

=== Elliott, Suresh, Donohue equation of state ===
The Elliott, Suresh, and Donohue (ESD) equation of state was proposed in 1990.&lt;ref name="ESD" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Richard, Jr. Elliott |author2=S. Jayaraman Suresh |author3=Marc D. Donohue | year=1990 | title=A Simple Equation of State for Nonspherical and Associating Molecules | journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. |volume=29 | pages=1476–1485 | doi=10.1021/ie00103a057 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the Peng–Robinson EOS in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der Waals repulsive term. The EOS accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term (not shown). The EOS itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size, shape, and hydrogen bonding.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p V_m}{RT}=Z=1 + Z^{\rm{rep}} + Z^{\rm{att}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{\rm{rep}} = \frac{4 c \eta}{1-1.9 \eta}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{\rm{att}} = -\frac{z_m q \eta Y}{1+ k_1 \eta Y}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a "shape factor", with &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules
:For non-spherical molecules, the following relation is suggested:

:&lt;math&gt;c=1+3.535\omega+0.533\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[acentric factor]]

:The reduced number density &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{v^* n}{V}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;v^*&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic size parameter
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of molecules
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the container
The characteristic size parameter is related to the shape parameter &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; through
:&lt;math&gt;v^*=\frac{kT_c}{P_c}\Phi&lt;/math&gt;
where

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=\frac{0.0312+0.087(c-1)+0.008(c-1)^2}{1.000+2.455(c-1)+0.732(c-1)^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

Noting the relationships between Boltzmann's constant and the [[Universal gas constant]], and observing that the number of molecules can be expressed in terms of [[Avogadro's number]] and the [[molar mass]], the reduced number density &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of the molar volume as

:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{R T_c}{P_c}\Phi\frac{1}{V_m}.&lt;/math&gt;

The shape parameter &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; appearing in the Attraction term and the term &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are given by
:&lt;math&gt;q=1+k_3(c-1)&lt;/math&gt; (and is hence also equal to 1 for spherical molecules).

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\exp\left(\frac{\epsilon}{kT}\right) - k_2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the square-well potential and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon}{k} =\frac{1.000+0.945(c-1)+0.134(c-1)^2}{1.023+2.225(c-1)+0.478(c-1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt; are constants in the equation of state:
:&lt;math&gt;z_m = 9.49&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_1 = 1.7745&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_2 = 1.0617&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_3 = 1.90476.&lt;/math&gt;

The model can be extended to associating components and mixtures of nonassociating components. Details are in the paper by J.R. Elliott, Jr. ''et al.'' (1990).&lt;ref name="ESD"/&gt;

=== Cubic-Plus-Association ===
The Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state combines the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation with an association term from Wertheim theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kontogeorgis|first1=Georgios M.|last2=Michelsen|first2=Michael L.|last3=Folas|first3=Georgios K.|last4=Derawi|first4=Samer|last5=von Solms|first5=Nicolas|last6=Stenby|first6=Erling H.|title=Ten Years with the CPA (Cubic-Plus-Association) Equation of State.

== Non-cubic equations of state ==

=== Dieterici equation of state ===
: &lt;math&gt;p(V - b) = RTe^{-\frac{a}{RTV}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is associated with the interaction between molecules and ''b'' takes into account the finite size of the molecules, similar to the Van der Waals equation.

The reduced coordinates are:
: &lt;math&gt;T_c = \frac{a}{4Rb},\ p_c = \frac{a}{4b^2 e^2},\ V_c = 2b.&lt;/math&gt;

== Virial equations of state ==

=== Virial equation of state ===
{{main|Virial expansion}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{pV_m}{RT} = A + \frac{B}{V_m} + \frac{C}{V_m^2} + \frac{D}{V_m^3} + \dots&lt;/math&gt;

Although usually not the most convenient equation of state, the virial equation is important because it can be derived directly from [[statistical mechanics]]. This equation is also called the [[Kamerlingh Onnes]] equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the [[virial coefficient|coefficients]]. ''A'' is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The second virial coefficient ''B'' corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, ''C'' to triplets, and so on. Accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms.  The coefficients ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', etc. are functions of temperature only.

One of the most accurate equations of state is that from Benedict-Webb-Rubin-Starling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fluid Properties for Light Petroleum Systems |last=Starling |first=Kenneth E. |publisher=Gulf Publishing Company |year=1973 |page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown next. It was very close to a virial equation of state. If the exponential term in it is expanded to two Taylor terms, a virial equation can be derived:
:&lt;math&gt;p=\rho RT + \left(B_0 RT-A_0 - \frac{C_0}{T^2} + \frac{D_0}{T^3} - \frac{E_0}{T^4}\right) \rho^2 + \left(bRT-a-\frac{d}{T} + \frac{c}{T^2}\right) \rho^3 + \alpha\left(a+\frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^6 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this virial equation, the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero. The second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered. The third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered.

=== The BWR equation of state ===
{{main|Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;
  p = \rho RT +
      \left(B_0 RT - A_0 - \frac{C_0}{T^2} + \frac{D_0}{T^3} - \frac{E_0}{T^4}\right) \rho^2 +
      \left(bRT - a - \frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^3 +
      \alpha\left(a + \frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^6 +
      \frac{c\rho^3}{T^2}\left(1 + \gamma\rho^2\right)\exp\left(-\gamma\rho^2\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''p'' is pressure
:''ρ'' is molar density

== SAFT equations of state ==
[[Statistical associating fluid theory]] (SAFT) equations of state use [[Statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] methods (in particular [[perturbation theory]]) to describe the interactions between molecules in a system.&lt;ref name="ChapmanGubbins1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=Walter G.|last2=Gubbins|first2=K.E.|last3=Jackson|first3=G.|last4=Radosz|first4=M.|title=SAFT: Equation-of-state solution model for associating fluids|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=1 December 1989|volume=52|year=1989|pages=31–38|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(89)80308-5 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378381289803085 |accessdate=31 August 2018 |language=en |issn=0378-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a SAFT equation of state was first proposed by Chapman et al. in 1989,&lt;ref name="ChapmanGubbins1989" /&gt; but since then many different SAFT equations of state have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1063/1.473101|title = Statistical associating fluid theory for chain molecules with attractive potentials of variable range| journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics| volume=106| issue=10| pages=4168–4186|year = 1997|last1 = Gil-Villegas|first1 = Alejandro| last2=Galindo| first2=Amparo| last3=Whitehead| first3=Paul J.| last4=Mills| first4=Stuart J.| last5=Jackson| first5=George| last6=Burgess| first6=Andrew N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often SAFT equations represent molecules as collections of spherical particles that interact with one another.&lt;ref name="ChapmanGubbins1989" /&gt; One popular SAFT equation represents molecules as chains composed of spherical segments ([[PC-SAFT]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/ie0003887|title = Perturbed-Chain SAFT:  An Equation of State Based on a Perturbation Theory for Chain Molecules| journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research| volume=40| issue=4| pages=1244–1260|year = 2001|last1 = Gross|first1 = Joachim| last2=Sadowski| first2=Gabriele}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, SAFT equations give more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state, especially for systems containing liquids or solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/ie010954d|title = Application of the Perturbed-Chain SAFT Equation of State to Associating Systems| journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research| volume=41| issue=22| pages=5510–5515|year = 2002|last1 = Gross|first1 = Joachim| last2=Sadowski| first2=Gabriele}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2014.08.035|title = A modified continuous flow apparatus for gas solubility measurements at high pressure and temperature with camera system| journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria| volume=382| pages=150–157|year = 2014|last1 = Saajanlehto|first1 = Meri| last2=Uusi-Kyyny| first2=Petri| last3=Alopaeus| first3=Ville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multiparameter equations of state ==

=== Helmholtz Function form ===
Multiparameter equations of state (MEOS) can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy, in both the liquid and gaseous states. MEOS's represent the Helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. Both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a(T, \rho)}{RT} = 
  \frac{a^o(T, \rho) + a^r(T, \rho)}{RT} =
  \alpha^o(\tau, \delta) + \alpha^r(\tau, \delta)
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac{T_r}{T}, \delta = \frac{\rho}{\rho_r}&lt;/math&gt;

The reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.

Other thermodynamic functions can be derived from the MEOS by using appropriate derivatives of the Helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the MEOS is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms. Typical MEOS use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. MEOS are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. Mixture models also exist.

== Other equations of state of interest ==

===Stiffened equation of state===

When considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as [[Underwater explosion|underwater nuclear explosions]], [[Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy|sonic shock lithotripsy]], and [[sonoluminescence]], the stiffened equation of state is often used:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho(\gamma - 1)e - \gamma p^0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and &lt;math&gt;p^0&lt;/math&gt; is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. The magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).

The equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by &lt;math&gt;c^2 = \gamma\left(p + p^0\right)/\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is ''already'' under about 20,000 atmospheres (2&amp;nbsp;GPa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100&amp;nbsp;kPa to 200&amp;nbsp;kPa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1&amp;nbsp;MPa to 2000.2&amp;nbsp;MPa).

This equation mispredicts the [[specific heat capacity]] of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.

===Ultrarelativistic equation of state===

An [[ultrarelativistic fluid]] has equation of state

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho_m c_s^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure, &lt;math&gt;\rho_m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density, and &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of sound]].

===Ideal Bose equation of state===

The equation of state for an ideal [[Bose gas]] is

:&lt;math&gt;pV_m =
  RT~\frac{\text{Li}_{\alpha+1}(z)}{\zeta(\alpha)}
  \left(\frac{T}{T_c}\right)^\alpha
&lt;/math&gt;

where α is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field, α = 3/2), ''z'' is exp(''μ''/''kT'') where ''μ'' is the [[chemical potential]], Li is the [[polylogarithm]], ζ is the [[Riemann zeta function]], and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical temperature at which a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] begins to form.

===Jones–Wilkins–Lee equation of state for explosives (JWL equation)===
The '''equation of state from Jones–Wilkins–Lee''' is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.

:&lt;math&gt;p = A \left( 1 - \frac{\omega}{R_1 V} \right) \exp(-R_1 V) + B \left( 1 - \frac{\omega}{R_2 V} \right) \exp\left(-R_2 V\right) + \frac{\omega e_0}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio &lt;math&gt; V = \rho_e / \rho &lt;/math&gt; is defined by using &lt;math&gt; \rho_e &lt;/math&gt; = density of the explosive (solid part) and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; = density of the detonation products. The parameters &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; R_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; R_2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; are given by several references.&lt;ref name="Dobratz" &gt;{{Cite journal |author1=B.

[[File:Term evolution used in 1889.jpeg|thumbnail|The term ''evolution'' in a book published in 1889]]

The English noun '''''evolution''''' (from [[Latin]]  {{lang|la|ēvolūtiō}} "unfolding, unrolling") refers to any kind of accumulation of change, or gradual directional change. It is the 3,117th most commonly used word in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/worddata/evolution|website=Word Data|accessdate=24 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117021424/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/worddata/evolution|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term primarily refers to [[biology|biological]] [[evolution]], there are various types of [[Chemistry|chemical]] evolution and it is also found in economics, historical linguistics, and many other technical fields where [[system]]s develop or change gradually over time, e.g.  [[stellar evolution]], [[cultural evolution]],  the [[evolution of an idea]], [[evolution (philosophy)|metaphysical evolution]], [[spiritual evolution]], etc.

The English term prior to the late 19th century was confined to referring to goal-directed, pre-programmed processes such as [[embryological development]]. A pre-programmed task, as in a military [[:wikt:maneuver|maneuver]], using this definition, may be termed an "evolution."  

The term ''evolution'' (from its literal meaning of "unfolding" of something into its true or explicit form) carries a connotation of gradual improvement or directionality from a beginning to an end point. This contrasts with the more general [[:wikt:development|development]], which can indicate change in any direction, or [[revolution]], which implies recurring, periodic change. The term  [[biological devolution]] is coined as an antonym to ''evolution'', indicating such degeneration or decrease in quality or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=evolution&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36764">{{about|flight dynamics for spacecraft|aircraft flight dynamics|Flight dynamics (aircraft) |attitude control of spacecraft|Attitude control (spacecraft)}}

'''Spacecraft flight dynamics''' is the science of [[space vehicle]] performance, stability, and control. It requires analysis of the [[six degrees of freedom]] of the vehicle's flight, which are similar to those of aircraft: [[translation (geometry)|translation]] in three dimensional axes; and its [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] about the vehicle's center of mass in these axes, known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw'', with respect to a defined [[frame of reference]].

[[dynamics (physics)|Dynamics]] is the modeling of the changing position and orientation of a vehicle, in response to external forces acting on the body. For a spacecraft, these forces are of three types: [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsive]] force (usually provided by the vehicle's engine thrust); [[gravitation]]al force exerted by the Earth or other celestial bodies; and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic lift and drag]] (when flying in the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere of the Earth]] or other body, such as Mars or Venus). The vehicle's attitude must be taken into account because of its effect on the aerodynamic and propulsive forces.&lt;ref&gt;Depending on the vehicle's mass distribution, the effects of gravitational force may also be affected by attitude (and vice versa), but to a much lesser extent. See [[Gravity-gradient stabilization]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are other reasons, unrelated to flight dynamics, for controlling the vehicle's attitude in non-powered flight (e.g., thermal control, [[Solar power|solar power generation]], communications, or [[astronomical observation]]).

The principles of flight dynamics are normally used to control a spacecraft by means of an [[inertial navigation system]] in conjunction with an [[attitude control system]]. Together, they create a subsystem of the spacecraft bus often called &lt;abbr title="Attitude Determination and Control System"&gt;ADCS&lt;/abbr&gt;.

==Basic principles==
A spacecraft's flight is determined by application of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[second law of motion]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F''' is the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] sum of all forces exerted on the vehicle, m is its current mass, and '''a''' is the acceleration vector, the instantaneous rate of change of velocity ('''v'''), which in turn is the instantaneous rate of change of displacement. Solving for '''a''', acceleration equals the force sum divided by mass. Acceleration is integrated over time to get velocity, and velocity is in turn integrated to get position.

For powered atmospheric flight, the three main forces which act on a vehicle are [[propulsion|propulsive force]], [[aerodynamic force]], and [[gravity|gravitation]]. Other external forces such as [[centrifugal force]] and [[Coriolis force]], are generally insignificant due to the relatively short time of powered flight, and may generally neglected in simplified performance calculations.{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11-154}}

===Propulsion===

===Atmospheric force===
Aerodynamic forces, present near a body with significant atmosphere such as [[Earth]], [[Mars]] or [[Venus]], are analyzed as: [[lift (force)|lift]], defined as the force component perpendicular to the direction of flight (not necessarily upward to balance gravity, as for an airplane); and [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], the component parallel to, and in the opposite direction of flight. Lift and drag are modeled as the products of a coefficient times [[dynamic pressure]] acting on a reference area:{{sfnp|Anderson| pp=257–261}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = C_L q A_\text{ref}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = C_D q A_\text{ref}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly linear with ''α'', the angle of attack between the vehicle axis and the direction of flight (up to a limiting value), and is 0 at ''α'' = 0 for an axisymmetric body;
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; varies with ''α''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; vary with [[Reynolds number]] and [[Mach number]];
*''q'', the dynamic pressure, is equal to 1/2 ''ρv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''ρ'' is atmospheric density, modeled for Earth as a function of altitude in the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] (using an assumed temperature distribution, [[hydrostatic pressure]] variation, and the [[ideal gas law]]); and
*''A''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is a characteristic area of the vehicle, such as cross-sectional area at the maximum diameter.

===Gravitation===
&lt;!--The force that a celestial body exerts on a spacecraft is given by:--&gt;

==Powered flight==
[[File:Space launch flight diagram improved.png|thumb|right|Velocity, position, and force vectors acting on a space vehicle during launch]]
Flight calculations are made quite precisely for space missions, taking into account such factors as the Earth's [[oblateness]] and non-uniform mass distribution; gravitational forces of all nearby bodies, including the Moon, Sun, and other planets; and three-dimensional flight path. For preliminary performance analysis, some simplifying assumptions can be made: the planet is spherical and uniform; the vehicle can be simulated as a point mass; flight path assumes a two-body [[patched conic approximation]]; and the  local flight path lies in a single plane) with reasonably small loss of accuracy.{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

The general case of a launch from Earth must take engine thrust, aerodynamic forces, and gravity into account. The acceleration equation can be reduced from vector to scalar form by resolving it into its tangential (speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) and angular (flight path angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; relative to local vertical) time rate-of-change components relative to the launch pad. The two equations thus become:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{v} = \frac{F\cos\alpha} m - \frac D m - g\cos\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = \frac{ F\sin\alpha }{mv} + \frac L {mv} + \left( \frac g v - \frac v r \right) \sin\theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''F'' is the engine thrust;
:''α'' is the angle of attack;
:''m'' is the vehicle's mass;
:''D'' is the vehicle's [[drag (physics)|aerodynamic drag]];
:''L'' is its [[lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]];
:''r'' is the radial distance to the planet's center; and
:''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]], which varies with the inverse square of the radial distance:
::&lt;math&gt;g = g_0\left(\frac{r_0}r\right)^2\,&lt;/math&gt;{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

Mass decreases as propellant is consumed and [[multistage rocket|rocket stages]], engines or tanks are shed (if applicable).

[[Numerical integration]] of the two rate equations from time zero (when both ''v'' and ''θ'' are 0) gives planet-fixed values of v and θ at any time in the flight:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \int_{t_0}^t \dot{v}\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \int_{t_0}^t \dot{\theta}\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

[[Finite element analysis]] can be used to integrate the equations, by breaking the flight into small time increments.

For most launch vehicles, relatively small levels of lift are generated, and a [[gravity turn]] is employed, depending mostly on the third term of the angle rate equation. At the moment of liftoff, when angle and velocity are both zero, the theta-dot equation is [[indeterminate form|mathematically indeterminate]] and cannot be evaluated until velocity becomes non-zero shortly after liftoff. But notice at this condition, the only force which can cause the vehicle to pitch over is the engine thrust acting at a non-zero angle of attack (first term) and perhaps a slight amount of lift (second term), until a non-zero pitch angle is attained. In the gravity turn, pitch-over is initiated by applying an increasing angle of attack (by means of [[gimbaled thrust|gimbaled engine thrust]]), followed by a gradual decrease in angle of attack through the remainder of the flight.{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}{{sfnp|Glasstone|1965|p=209|loc=§4.97}}

Once velocity and flight path angle are known, altitude &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and downrange distance &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are computed as:{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

[[File:Gravity turn - landing - phase 2.svg|thumb|right|Velocity and force vectors acting on a space vehicle during powered descent and landing]]
:&lt;math&gt;h = \int_{t_0}^t v \cos \theta\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = r_0+h\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = r_0 \int_{t_0}^t \frac v r \sin \theta\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

The planet-fixed values of ''v'' and ''θ'' are converted to space-fixed (inertial) values with the following conversions:{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

:&lt;math&gt;v_s = \sqrt{v^2 + 2\omega r v \cos\varphi \sin\theta \sin A_z + (\omega r \cos\theta)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is the planet's rotational rate in radians per second, ''φ'' is the launch site latitude, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is the launch [[azimuth]] angle.
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_s = \arccos\left(\frac{ v \cos\theta}{v_s} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Final ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r'' must match the requirements of the target orbit as determined by orbital mechanics (see [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Orbital flight|Orbital flight]], below), where final ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is usually the required periapsis (or circular) velocity, and final ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is 90 degrees. A powered descent analysis would use the same procedure, with reverse boundary conditions.

==Attitude control==
{{main|Attitude control}}
{{Technical|section|date=December 2011}}

Attitude control is the exercise of control over the orientation of an object with respect to an inertial frame of reference or another entity (the celestial sphere, certain fields, nearby objects, etc.).  The attitude of a craft can be described using three mutually perpendicular axes of rotation, generally referred to as roll, pitch, and yaw angles respectively (with the roll axis in line with the primary engine direction of thrust).  Orientation can be determined by calibration using an external guidance system, such as determining the angles to a reference star or the Sun, then internally monitored using an inertial system of mechanical or optical [[gyroscopes]].  Orientation is a vector quantity described by three angles for the instantaneous direction, and the instantaneous rates of roll in all three axes of rotation.  The aspect of control implies both awareness of the instantaneous orientation and rates of roll and the ability to change the roll rates to assume a new orientation using either a [[reaction control system]] or other means.
 
Newton's second law, applied to rotational rather than linear motion, becomes:{{sfnp|Beer &amp; Johnston| 1972| p=499}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau} = I_x\mathbf{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''τ''' is the net [[torque]] (or ''moment'') exerted on the vehicle, I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is its [[moment of inertia]] about the axis of rotation, and '''α''' is the angular acceleration vector in radians per second per second. Therefore, the rotational rate in degrees per second per second is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha} = (180/\pi)\mathbf{T}/I_x,&lt;/math&gt;

and the angular rotation rate '''ω''' (degrees per second) is obtained by integrating '''α''' over time, and the angular rotation '''θ''' is the time integral of the rate, analogous to linear motion. The three principal moments of inertia I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; about the roll, pitch and yaw axes, are determined through the spacecraft's center of mass.

Attitude control torque, absent aerodynamic forces, is frequently applied by a [[reaction control system]], a set of thrusters located about the vehicle. The thrusters are fired, either manually or under automatic guidance control, in short bursts to achieve the desired rate of rotation, and then fired in the opposite direction to halt rotation at the desired position. The torque about a specific axis is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau} = \sum_{i=1}^N(r_i \times \mathbf{F_i} ), &lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' is its distance from the center of mass, and '''F''' is the thrust of an individual thruster (only the component of '''F''' perpendicular to '''r''' is included.)

For situations where propellant consumption may be a problem (such as long-duration satellites or space stations), alternative means may be used to provide the control torque, such as [[reaction wheel]]s or [[control moment gyroscope]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Orbital flight==
{{Further|Orbital mechanics}}

Orbital mechanics are used to calculate flight in orbit about a central body. For sufficiently high orbits (generally at least {{convert|100|nmi|km|disp=flip|sp=us|abbr=off}} in the case of Earth), aerodynamic force may be assumed to be negligible for relatively short term missions (though a small amount of drag may be present which results in decay of orbital energy over longer periods of time.) When the central body's mass is much larger than the spacecraft, and other bodies are sufficiently far away, the solution of orbital trajectories can be treated as a two-body problem.{{sfnp |Perry | p=11:151}}

This can be shown to result in the trajectory being ideally a [[conic section]] (circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola){{sfnp| Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | pp=11-40}} with the central body located at one focus. Orbital trajectories are either circles or ellipses; the parabolic trajectory represents first escape of the vehicle from the central body's gravitational field. Hyperbolic trajectories are escape trajectories with excess velocity, and will be covered under [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Interplanetary flight|Interplanetary flight]] below.

Elliptical orbits are characterized by three elements.{{sfnp |Perry | p=11:151}} The semi-major axis ''a'' is the average of the radius at [[apsis|apoapsis and periapsis]]:
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{r_a + r_p} 2 &lt;/math&gt;

The [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] ''e'' can then be calculated for an ellipse, knowing the apses:
:&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{r_a} a - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The [[orbital period|time period for a complete orbit]] is dependent only on the semi-major axis, and is independent of eccentricity:{{sfnp | Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | p=33 }}

: &lt;math&gt; TP = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3} \mu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravitational parameter]] of the central body.

[[File:Orbit1.svg|thumb|200px|right|The angular [[orbital elements]] of a spacecraft orbiting a central body, defining orientation of the orbit in relation to its fundamental reference plane]]
The orientation of the orbit in space is specified by three angles:
*The ''inclination'' ''i'', of the orbital plane with the fundamental plane (this is usually a planet or moon's equatorial plane, or in the case of a solar orbit, the Earth's orbital plane around the Sun, known as the [[ecliptic]].) Positive inclination is northward, while negative inclination is southward.
*The ''longitude of the ascending node'' Ω, measured in the fundamental plane counter-clockwise looking southward, from a reference direction (usually the [[vernal equinox]]) to the line where the spacecraft crosses this plane from south to north. (If inclination is zero, this angle is undefined and taken as 0.)
*The ''argument of periapsis'' ''ω'', measured in the orbital plane counter-clockwise looking southward, from the ascending node to the periapsis. If the inclination is 0, there is no ascending node, so ''ω'' is measured from the reference direction. For a circular orbit, there is no periapsis, so ''ω'' is taken as 0.

The orbital plane is ideally constant, but is usually subject to small perturbations caused by planetary oblateness and the presence of other bodies.

The spacecraft's position in orbit is specified by the ''true anomaly,'' &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, an angle measured from the periapsis, or for a circular orbit, from the ascending node or reference direction. The ''semi-latus rectum'', or radius at 90 degrees from periapsis, is:{{sfnp | Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | p=24}}
:&lt;math&gt;p = a(1-e^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;

The radius at any position in flight is:
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac p {1+e\cos\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the velocity at that position is:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{\mu\left(\frac 2 r - \frac 1 a\right)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Types of orbit===
====Circular====
For a circular orbit, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'', and eccentricity is 0. Circular velocity at a given radius is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_c = \sqrt{\frac\mu r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Elliptical====
For an elliptical orbit, ''e'' is greater than 0 but less than 1. The periapsis velocity is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt{\frac{\mu(1+e)}{a(1-e)}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the apoapsis velocity is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_a = \sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The limiting condition is a '''parabolic escape orbit''', when ''e'' = 1 and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; becomes infinite. Escape velocity at periapsis is then
:&lt;math&gt;v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{r_p}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Flight path angle===
The ''specific angular momentum'' of any conic orbit, ''h'', is constant, and is equal to the product of radius and velocity at periapsis. At any other point in the orbit, it is equal to:{{sfnp| Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=18}}
:&lt;math&gt;h = r v\cos\varphi,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''φ'' is the flight path angle measured from the local horizontal (perpendicular to&amp;nbsp;''r''.) This allows the calculation of ''φ'' at any point in the orbit, knowing radius and velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \arccos\left(\frac{r_p v_p}{r v}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that flight path angle is a constant 0 degrees (90 degrees from local vertical) for a circular orbit.

===True anomaly as a function of time===
It can be shown that the angular momentum equation given above also relates the rate of change in true anomaly to ''r'', ''v'', and ''φ'', thus the true anomaly can be found as a function of time since periapsis passage by integration:{{sfnp| Bate, Mueller, and White |1971| pp=31-32}}
:&lt;math&gt;\nu = r_p v_p \int_{t_p}^t \frac 1 {r^2} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, the time required to reach a given anomaly is:
: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac 1 {r_p v_p} \int_0^\nu r^2 \, d\nu&lt;/math&gt;

===Orbital maneuvers===
{{see also|Orbital maneuver}}
Once in orbit, a spacecraft may fire rocket engines to make in-plane changes to a different altitude or type of orbit, or to change its orbital plane. These maneuvers require changes in the craft's velocity, and the [[classical rocket equation]] is used to calculate the propellant requirements for a given [[delta-v]]. A [[delta-v budget|delta-''v'' budget]] will add up all the propellant requirements, or determine the total delta-v available from a given amount of propellant, for the mission.

====In-plane changes====
{{Expand section|date=November 2011}}

====Change of plane====
Plane change maneuvers can be performed alone or in conjunction with other orbit adjustments. For a pure rotation plane change maneuver, consisting only of a change in the inclination of the orbit, the specific angular momentum, ''h'', of the initial and final orbits are equal in magnitude but not in direction. Therefore the change in specific angular momentum can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta h = 2h\sin\left(\frac {|\Delta i|}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the specific angular momentum before the plane change, and Δ''i'' is the desired change in the inclination angle. From this it can be shown{{sfnp|Hintz|2015|p=112}} that the required delta-''v'' is:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = \frac {2h\sin\frac {|\Delta i|}{2}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of ''h'', this can also be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = 2v\cos \varphi\sin\left(\frac {\left|\Delta i\right|} 2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the magnitude of velocity before plane change and ''φ'' is the flight path angle. Using the [[small-angle approximation]], this becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = v \cos(\varphi) \left|\Delta i\right|&lt;/math&gt;

The total delta-''v'' for a combined maneuver can be calculated by a vector addition of the pure rotation delta-''v'' and the delta-''v'' for the other planned orbital change.

==Translunar flight==
[[File:Tli.svg|thumb|200px|right|A typical translunar trajectory]]
Vehicles sent on lunar or planetary missions are generally not launched by direct injection to departure trajectory, but first put into a low Earth [[low Earth orbit|parking orbit]]; this allows the flexibility of a bigger [[launch window]] and more time for checking that the vehicle is in proper condition for the flight. A popular misconception is that escape velocity is required for flight to the Moon; it is not. Rather, the vehicle's apogee is raised high enough to take it to a point (before it reaches apogee) where it enters the Moon's gravitational [[sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of influence]] (though the required velocity is close to that of escape.) This is defined as the distance from a satellite at which its gravitational pull on a spacecraft equals that of its central body, which is

: &lt;math&gt;r_\text{SOI} = D\left(\frac{m_s}{m_c}\right)^{2/5},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the mean distance from the satellite to the central body, and
''m''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; are the masses of the central body and satellite, respectively. This value is approximately {{convert|66300|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} from Earth's Moon.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller and White| 1971| pp=333–334}}

A significant portion of the vehicle's flight (other than immediate proximity to the Earth or Moon) requires accurate solution as a [[three-body problem]], but may be preliminarily modeled as a [[patched conic approximation]].

===Translunar injection===
{{Main|Translunar injection}}
This must be timed so that the Moon will be in position to capture the vehicle, and might be modeled to a first approximation as a Hohmann transfer. However, the rocket burn duration is usually long enough, and occurs during a sufficient change in flight path angle, that this is not very accurate, requiring instead integration of a simplified version of the velocity and angle rate equations given above in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Powered flight|Powered flight]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{v} = \frac{F\cos\alpha}m - g\cos\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = \frac{F\sin\alpha}{mv} + \left(\frac g v - \frac v r\right) \sin\theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Mid-course corrections===
A simple lunar trajectory stays in one plane, resulting in lunar flyby or orbit within a small range of inclination to the Moon's equator. This also permits a "free return", in which the spacecraft would return to the appropriate position for reentry into the Earth's atmosphere if it were not injected into lunar orbit. Relatively small velocity changes are usually required to correct for trajectory errors. Such a trajectory was used for the [[Apollo 8]], [[Apollo 10]], [[Apollo 11]], and [[Apollo 12]] manned lunar missions.

Greater flexibility in lunar orbital or landing site coverage (at greater angles of lunar inclination) can be obtained by performing a plane change maneuver mid-flight; however, this takes away the free-return option, as the new plane would take the spacecraft's emergency return trajectory away from the Earth's atmospheric re-entry point, and leave the spacecraft in a high Earth orbit. This type of trajectory was used for the last five Apollo missions (13 through 17).

===Lunar orbit insertion===
{{Expand section|date=November 2011}}

==Interplanetary flight==
In order to completely leave one planet's gravitational field to reach another, a [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] trajectory relative to the departure planet is necessary, with excess velocity added to (or subtracted from) the departure planet's orbital velocity around the Sun. The desired heliocentric transfer orbit to a [[superior planet]] will have its [[perihelion]] at the departure planet, requiring the hyperbolic excess velocity to be applied in the posigrade direction, when the spacecraft is away from the Sun. To an [[inferior planet]] destination, [[aphelion]] will be at the departure planet, and the excess velocity is applied in the retrograde direction when the spacecraft is toward the Sun. For accurate mission calculations, the orbital elements of the planets must be obtained from an [[ephemeris]],{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=359}} such as [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|that published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].

For the purpose of preliminary mission analysis and feasibility studies, certain simplified assumptions may be made to enable delta-v calculation with very small error:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| pp=359, 362}}
*All the planets' orbits except [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] have very small eccentricity, and therefore may be assumed to be circular at a constant orbital speed and mean distance from the Sun.
*All the planets' orbits (except Mercury) are nearly coplanar, with very small inclination to the [[ecliptic]] (3.39 degrees or less; Mercury's inclination is 7.00 degrees).
*The perturbating effects of the other planets' gravity is negligible.
*The spacecraft will spend most of its flight time under only the gravitational influence of the Sun, except for brief periods when it is in the [[sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of influence]] of the departure and destination planets.

Since interplanetary spacecraft spend a large period of time in [[heliocentric orbit]] between the planets, which are at relatively large distances away from each other, the patched-conic approximation is much more accurate for interplanetary trajectories than for translunar trajectories.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| pp=359, 362}} The patch point between the hyperbolic trajectory relative to the departure planet and the heliocentric transfer orbit occurs at the planet's sphere of influence radius relative to the Sun, as defined above in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Orbital flight|Orbital flight]]. Given the Sun's mass ratio of 333,432 times that of Earth and distance of {{convert|149,500,000|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}, the Earth's sphere of influence radius is {{convert|924,000|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} (roughly 1,000,000 kilometers).{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White|1971|p=368}}

===Heliocentric transfer orbit===
The transfer orbit required to carry the spacecraft from the departure planet's orbit to the destination planet is chosen among several options:
* A [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] requires the least possible propellant and delta-v; this is half of an elliptical orbit with [[apsis|aphelion and perihelion]] tangential to both planets' orbits, with the longest outbound flight time equal to half the period of the ellipse. This is known as a [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]]-class mission.{{sfnp|Mattfeld, Stromgren, et al|2015 |p=3}}{{sfn|Drake, Baker, et al}} There is no "free return" option, because if the spacecraft does not enter orbit around the destination planet and instead completes the transfer orbit, the departure planet will not be in its original position. Using another Hohmann transfer to return requires a significant loiter time at the destination planet, resulting in a very long total round-trip mission time.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White|1971 |pp=362–363}} Science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] wrote in his 1951 book ''The Exploration of Space'' that an Earth-to-Mars round trip would require 259 days outbound and another 259 days inbound, with a 425-day stay at Mars.
* Increasing the departure apsis speed (and thus the semi-major axis) results in a trajectory which crosses the destination planet's orbit non-tangentially before reaching the opposite apsis, increasing delta-v but cutting the outbound transit time below the maximum.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White|1971 |pp=362–363}}
* A [[gravity assist]] maneuver, sometimes known as a "slingshot maneuver" or ''Crocco mission'' after its 1956 proposer [[Gaetano Crocco]], results in an [[astronomical opposition|opposition]]-class mission with a much shorter dwell time at the destination.{{sfnp|Mattfeld, Stromgren, et al|2015 |pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Drake, Baker, et al}} This is accomplished by swinging past another planet, using its gravity to alter the orbit. A round trip to Mars, for example, can be significantly shortened from the 943 days required for the conjunction mission, to under a year, by swinging past Venus on return to the Earth.

===Hyperbolic departure===
The required hyperbolic excess velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (sometimes called ''characteristic velocity'') is the difference between the transfer orbit's departure speed and the departure planet's heliocentric orbital speed. Once this is determined, the injection velocity relative to the departure planet at periapsis is:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=369}}

:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{r_p} + v_\infty^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The excess velocity vector for a hyperbola is displaced from the periapsis tangent by a characteristic angle, therefore the periapsis injection burn must lead the planetary departure point by the same angle:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=371}}

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \arcsin\frac 1 e\,&lt;/math&gt;

The geometric equation for eccentricity of an ellipse cannot be used for a hyperbola. But the eccentricity can be calculated from dynamics formulations as:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=372}}

:&lt;math&gt;e = \sqrt{1+\frac{2\varepsilon h^2}{\mu^2}},&lt;/math&gt;

where h is the specific angular momentum as given above in the [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Flight path angle|Orbital flight]] section, calculated at the periapsis:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=371}}
:&lt;math&gt;h = r_p v_p,\,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''ε'' is the specific energy:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=371}}
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \frac{v^2}2 - \frac \mu r\,&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the equations for r and v given in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Orbital flight|Orbital flight]] depend on the semi-major axis, and thus are unusable for an escape trajectory. But setting radius at periapsis equal to the r equation at zero 
anomaly gives an alternate expression for the semi-latus rectum:

:&lt;math&gt;p = r_p(1 + e),\,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives a more general equation for radius versus anomaly which is usable at any eccentricity:

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{r_p(1 + e)}{1+e\cos\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the alternate expression for p also gives an alternate expression for a (which is defined for a hyperbola, but no longer represents the semi-major axis). This gives an equation for velocity versus radius which is likewise usable at any eccentricity:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{\mu\left (\frac{2}{r}-\frac{(1-e^2)}{r_p(1+e)}\right)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The equations for flight path angle and anomaly versus time given in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Flight path angle|Orbital flight]] are also usable for hyperbolic trajectories.

===Launch windows===
There is a great deal of variation with time of the velocity change required for a mission, because of the constantly varying relative positions of the planets. Therefore, optimum launch windows are often chosen from the results of [[porkchop plot]]s that show contours of characteristic energy (v&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) plotted versus departure and arrival time.

==Atmospheric entry==
{{main|Atmospheric entry}}
''Atmospheric entry'' is the movement of human-made or natural objects as they enter the [[atmosphere]] of a [[celestial body]] from [[outer space]]—in the case of [[Earth]] from an [[altitude]] above the [[Kármán Line]], (100&amp;nbsp;km).  This topic is heavily concerned with the process of controlled ''re''entry of [[spacecraft|vehicles]] which are intended to reach the planetary surface intact, but the topic also includes uncontrolled (or minimally controlled) cases, such as the intentionally or circumstantially occurring, destructive deorbiting of [[Artificial satellites|satellites]] and the falling back to the planet of "[[Space debris|space junk]]" due to [[orbital decay]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">In mathematics, '''Fraïssé's theorem''', named after [[Roland Fraïssé]], states that a [[class (set theory)|class]] ''K'' of finite [[relational structure]]s is the [[age (model theory)|age]] of a [[countable set|countable]] homogeneous relational structure if and only if it satisfies the following four conditions:

* ''K'' is closed under [[isomorphism]];
* ''K'' is closed under taking induced substructures;
* ''K'' has only countably many members up to isomorphism;

{{Campaignbox Norman Conquest}}



The '''Harrying of the North''' was a number of campaigns 
waged by [[William the Conqueror]] in the winter of 1069–70 to subjugate [[northern England]], where the presence of the last [[House of Wessex|Wessex]] claimant, [[Edgar the Atheling|Edgar Atheling]], had encouraged Anglo-Danish rebellions. William paid the Danes to go home, but the remaining rebels refused to meet him in battle, and he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires, especially the city of [[York]], before installing a Norman aristocracy throughout the region.

Contemporary chronicles vividly record the savagery of the campaign, the huge scale of the destruction and the widespread famine caused by looting, burning and slaughtering. Some present-day scholars have labelled the campaigns a [[genocide]] although others doubt whether William could have assembled enough troops to inflict so much damage and they have concluded that the records may have been exaggerated or misinterpreted.

==Background==
{{see also|Gwynedd in the High Middle Ages#Mathrafal ascendency and English alliances; 1063–1081|l1=Gwynedd's alliance with Mercia and Northumbria}}
At the time of the Norman Conquest ''the North'' consisted of what became [[Yorkshire]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], and [[Northumberland]] in the east and [[Lancashire]] with the southern parts of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] in the west.&lt;ref name=kapell5&gt;William E. Kapelle, The Norman Conquest of the North. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the north pre-conquest can be described as "[[Anglo-Scandinavian]]" carrying a cultural continuity from a mixing of [[Viking]] and Anglo-Saxon traditions. The dialect of [[Old English|English]] spoken in Yorkshire may well have been unintelligible to people from the south of England, and the aristocracy was primarily [[Danish people|Danish]] in origin.&lt;ref name=kapelle11&gt;Kapelle, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, communications between the north and south were difficult, partly due to the terrain but also because of the poor state of the roads. The more popular route between York and the south was by ship.&lt;ref name=kapelle7&gt;Kapelle, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 962 [[Edgar the Peaceful]] had granted legal autonomy to the northern earls of the [[Danelaw]] in return for their loyalty; this had limited the powers of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kings who succeeded him north of the [[Humber]]. The earldom of Northumbria stretched from the [[River Tees|Tees]] to the [[River Tweed|Tweed]].&lt;ref name=kapelle11/&gt;

After the defeat of the English army and death of [[Harold Godwinson]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]], English resistance to the conquest was centred on [[Edgar Ætheling]], the grandson of [[Edmund Ironside]]. Ironside was half-brother to [[Edward the Confessor]].&lt;ref name="horspool5"&gt;Horspool. ''The English Rebel'', pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said the English conceded defeat, not at [[Hastings]], but at [[Berkhamsted]] two months later when Edgar and his supporters submitted to William in December 1066.&lt;ref name="horspool5"/&gt; However, of all the men who submitted to William at Berkhamsted it was only [[Ealdred (bishop)|Ealdred]], [[Bishop of York]], who would remain loyal to the Norman king.&lt;ref name=horspool7&gt;Horspool, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; William faced a series of rebellions and border skirmishes in [[Dover]], [[Exeter]], [[Hereford]], [[Nottingham]], Durham, [[York]] and [[Peterborough]].&lt;ref name=horspool8&gt;Horspool, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baile Hill - geograph.org.uk - 765177.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte]] at [[Baile Hill, York]] 1068–69.]]
[[Copsi]], a supporter of [[Tostig]] (a previous Anglo-Saxon earl of Northumbria who had been banished by Edward the Confessor), was a native of Northumbria and his family had a history of being rulers of [[Bernicia]], and at times Northumbria. Copsi had fought in [[Harald Hardrada]]'s army with Tostig, against Harold Godwinson at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066. He had managed to escape after Harald's defeat. When Copsi offered homage to William at [[Barking, London|Barking]] in 1067, William rewarded him by making him earl of Northumbria.&lt;ref name=kapelle103&gt;Kapelle, pp. 103–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

After just five weeks as earl, Copsi was murdered by [[Osulf, Earl of Bamburgh|Osulf]], son of Earl [[Eadulf III of Bernicia]]. When, in turn, the usurping Osulf was also killed, his cousin, [[Cospatrick of Northumbria|Cospatrick]], bought the earldom from William. He was not long in power before he joined [[Edgar Ætheling]] in rebellion against William in 1068.&lt;ref name=kapelle103/&gt;

With two earls murdered and one changing sides, William decided to intervene personally in Northumbria.&lt;ref name=horspool10&gt;Horspool, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He marched north and arrived in York during the summer of 1068. The opposition melted away, with some of them&amp;nbsp;– including Edgar&amp;nbsp;– taking refuge at the court of the [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Scottish king Malcolm III]].&lt;ref name=stenton606&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pg. 606&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Northumbria, William changed tack and appointed a Norman, [[Robert de Comines]], as earl, rather than an Anglo-Saxon. Despite warnings from the [[bishop of Durham|bishop]], [[Ethelwin]], that a rebel army was mobilised against him, Robert rode into Durham with a party of men on 28 January 1069, where he and his men were surrounded and slaughtered.&lt;ref name=asc1068&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' 1068. English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html Project Gutenberg]; accessdate 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels then turned their attention to York where they killed the guardian of the [[York Castle|castle]] there plus a large number of his men.&lt;ref name=horspool10/&gt;&lt;ref name=asc1068/&gt; William's response was swift and brutal: he returned to York, where he fell on the besiegers, killing or putting them to flight.&lt;ref name=horspool11&gt;Horspool, ''The English Rebel'', pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly emboldened by the fighting in the north, rebellions broke out in other parts of the country. William sent earls to deal with problems in [[Dorset]], [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Devon]], while he dealt with rebels in the [[The Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Stafford]].&lt;ref name=horspool12&gt;Horspool. ''The English Rebel''. pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgar Ætheling had sought assistance from the [[king of Denmark]], [[Sweyn Estridson|Sweyn II]], a nephew of [[Canute the Great|King Canute]]. Sweyn assembled a fleet of ships under the command of his sons. The fleet sailed up the east coast of England raiding as they went. The [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] with their English allies retook the city of York.&lt;ref name=asc1069&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' 1069. English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html Project Gutenberg]; accessdate 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in the winter of 1069, William marched his army from Nottingham to York with the intention of engaging the rebel army. However, by the time William's army had reached York, the rebel army had fled, with Edgar returning to Scotland. As they had nowhere suitable on land to stay for the winter, the Danes decided to go back to their ships in the [[Humber Estuary]]. After negotiation with William, it was agreed that, if he made payment to them, then they would go home to [[Denmark]] without a fight.&lt;ref name=kapelle117&gt;Kapelle, pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt; With the Danes having returned home, William's patience with the rebels seems to have run out. As they were not prepared to meet his army in [[pitched battle]], he employed a strategy that would attack the rebel army's sources of support and their food supply.&lt;ref name=horspool12/&gt;

==The Harrying==
William's strategy, implemented during the winter of 1069–70 (he spent Christmas 1069 in York), has been described by [[William E. Kapelle]] and some other modern scholars as an act of [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=kapelle3&gt;Kapelle, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rex108&gt;Rex.

Contemporary biographers of William considered it to be his cruelest act and a "stain upon his soul".&lt;ref name=dalton298&gt;Dalton. ''Conquest, Anarchy and Lordship: Yorkshire, 1066–1154''. pg. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the Harrying of the North, over fifty years later, the Anglo-Norman chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]] wrote (summarized):{{quote|The King stopped at nothing to hunt his enemies. He cut down many people and destroyed homes and land. Nowhere else had he shown such cruelty. This made a real change.
To his shame, William made no effort to control his fury, punishing the innocent with the guilty. He ordered that crops and herds, tools and food be burned to ashes. More than 100,000 people perished of starvation.&lt;br&gt;I have often praised William in this book, but I can say nothing good about this brutal slaughter.

The land was ravaged on either side of William's route north from the [[River Aire]]. His army destroyed crops and settlements and forced rebels into hiding. In the New Year of 1070 he split his army into smaller units and sent them out to burn, loot, and terrify.&lt;ref name=dalto11&gt;Dalton, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence of Worcester]] said  that from the Humber to the [[Tees]], William's men burnt whole villages and slaughtered the inhabitants. Food stores and livestock were destroyed so that anyone surviving the initial [[massacre]] would succumb to starvation over the winter. The survivors were reduced to [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=forester174&gt;Forester, Thomas. ''The Chronicle of Florence of Worcester'', pg. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1086, Yorkshire and the North Riding still had large areas of waste territory. The Domesday Book entries indicate ''wasteas est'' or ''hoc est vast'' (''it is wasted'') for estate after estate; in all a total of 60% of all holdings were waste. It states that 66% of all villages contained wasted manors. Even the prosperous areas of the county had lost 60% of its value compared to 1066. Only 25% of the population and plough teams remained with a reported loss of 80,000 oxen and 150,000 people.&lt;ref name=muir120&gt;Muir.

''Armies, chivalry and warfare in medieval Britain and France: proceedings of the 1995 Harlaxton Symposium'' (p. 273).&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent archaeological evidence supports the massive destruction and displacement of people. The archaeologist [[Richard Ernest Muir]] wrote that there was evidence for the "violent disruption [that] took place in Yorkshire in 1069–71, in the form of hoards of coins which were buried by the inhabitants."&lt;ref name=muir120/&gt; B.K. Roberts in his book ''The Making of the English Village'', suggests the reason that large numbers of villages have been laid out in regular pattern in Durham and  Yorkshire, was through a restructuring at a single point in time, as opposed to natural settlement growth. He goes on to say that it is highly unlikely that such plans could have resulted from piecemeal additions and must have been necessary after the Harrying of the North.  The dating is thought to be secure as it is known that Norman lords used similar regular plans in founding new towns in the 'plantation' of rural settlements in other conquered parts of the British Isles.&lt;ref name=oup126&gt;Hey. ''The Oxford Companion to family and local history''. pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roberts178&gt;Roberts. ''The Making of the English Village'', pp. 212–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eh5&gt;Stamper.

However, although the Domesday Book records large numbers of manors in the north as waste, some historians have posited it was not possible for William's relatively small army to be responsible for such wide-scale devastation imputed to him, so perhaps raiding Danes {{efn|name=Florence|According to Florence of Worcester ".. [William] sent messengers to the Danish earl and promised to pay him secretly a large sum of money, and to grant permission for the Danish army to forage freely along the sea coast, on condition that the Danes would depart without fighting when the winter was over." &lt;ref name=forester173&gt;Forester, Thomas.

The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' MS E for 1079 said that Malcolm "ravaged Northumberland as far as the Tyne and killed many hundreds of people and took home much money and people into captivity".}} may have contributed to some of the destruction. It has been variously argued that ''waste'' signified manorial re-organisation, some form of tax break, or merely a confession of ignorance by the Domesday commissioners when unable to determine details of population and other manorial resources.&lt;ref name=thoms95&gt;Thomas.

According to Paul Dalton,&lt;ref name=dalto23/&gt; it was questionable whether the Conqueror had the time, manpower or good weather necessary to reduce the north to a desert. It was evident, from the chroniclers, that William did harry the north but as the bulk of William's troops, Dalton suggests, were guarding castles in southern England and Wales, and as William was only in the north for a maximum of three months, the amount of damage he could do was limited.&lt;ref name=dalto23/&gt;

Mark Hagger&lt;ref name=hagger100/&gt; suggests that in the words of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', William's Harrying of the North was "stern beyond measure"&lt;ref name=asc1087&gt;ASC 1087 - English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html Project Gutenberg]. Accessdate 21 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; but we should not describe it as genocide as William was acting by the [[Genocides in history|rules of his own time]], not ours.{{efn|name=moses28}}&lt;ref name=hagger100&gt;Hagger. ''William King and Conqueror'', pp. 100–01.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetius, the Latin writer, wrote his treatise ''[[De Re Militari]]'' in the fourth century about Roman warfare, and posits that this still would have provided the basis for military thinking in the eleventh century.&lt;ref name=hagger100/&gt; Vegetius said ''The main and principal point in war is to secure plenty of provisions and to destroy the enemy by famine'', so Hagger's conclusion is that the Harrying of the North was no worse than other similar conflicts of the time.&lt;ref name=hagger100/&gt;&lt;ref name=vegetius&gt;Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus.

Other historians have questioned the figures supplied by Orderic Vitalis, who was born in 1075 and would have been writing his ''Ecclesiastical History'' around 55 years after the event. The figure of 100,000 deaths was perhaps used in a rhetorical sense, as the estimated population for the whole of England, based on the 1086 Domesday returns was about 2.25 million; thus, a figure of 100,000 represented a large proportion of the entire population of the country at that time (~4.5%).&lt;ref name=horspool13/&gt;&lt;ref name=muir120/&gt;&lt;ref name=bartlett291&gt;Bartlett. ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'', pg. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Horspool]] concludes that despite the Harrying of the North, being regarded with some "shock" in Northern England for some centuries after the event, the destruction may have been exaggerated and the number of dead not as high as previously thought.&lt;ref name=horspool13/&gt;

In 1071 William appointed another Earl of Northumbria. This time it was [[William Walcher]], a [[Lotharingian]], who was the first non-English [[Bishop of Durham]].&lt;ref name=Handbook241&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asc1072&gt;ASC 1072.

Having effectively subdued the population, William carried out a complete replacement of Anglo-Saxon leaders with Norman ones in the North. The new aristocracy in England was predominately of Norman extraction; however, one exception was that of [[Alan Rufus]], a trusted [[Breton people|Breton]] lord, who obtained in 1069–1071 a substantial fiefdom in North Yorkshire, which the [[Domesday Book]] calls "the Hundred of the Land of Count Alan", later known as [[Richmondshire]].&lt;ref name=barlow114&gt;Frank Barlow, ''The Feudal Kingdom of England, 1042–1216'' (London; New York: Longmans, Green, 1955), pg. 114, [https://www.questia.com/read/91383886 Questia.com] accessdate 27 August 2013.

Here Alan governed, as it were, his own principality: the only location held by the King in this area was [[Ainderby Steeple]] on its eastern edge, while Robert of Mortain held one village on its southern fringe; the other Norman lords were excluded, whereas Alan retained the surviving Anglo-Danish lords or their heirs. Alan also exercised patronage in York, where he founded [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's Abbey]] in 1088. By 1086 Alan was one of the richest and most powerful men in England.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Keats-Rohan "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52358 Alan Rufus (died 1093)]", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''; retrieved 27 August 2013.{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]], Malcolm married the Ætheling's sister, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], in 1071.&lt;ref name="stenton606"/&gt; Edgar sought Malcolm's assistance in his struggle against William.&lt;ref name=horspool10 /&gt; The marriage of Malcolm to Edgar's sister profoundly affected the history of both England and Scotland. The influence of Margaret and her sons brought about the Anglicisation of the Lowlands and provided the Scottish king with an excuse for forays into England, which he could claim were to redress the wrongs against his brother-in-law.&lt;ref name=poole265&gt;Poole. ''From Domesday Book to Magna Carta, 1087–1216'' 2nd ed. (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 1993), pg. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal link between the royal house of Scotland and [[Wessex]] was a threat to William, who marched up to Scotland in 1072 to confront the Scottish king. The two kings negotiated the [[Treaty of Abernethy]] (1072), through which, according to the ''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'', Malcolm became William's vassal; among the other provisions was the expulsion of Edgar Ætheling from the Scottish court.&lt;ref name=asc1072/&gt;&lt;ref name=huscroft61&gt;Huscroft. ''Ruling England, 1042–1217'', pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar finally submitted to William in 1074. William's hold on the crown was then theoretically uncontested.&lt;ref name="huscroft61"/&gt;&lt;ref name=horspool14&gt;Horspool, pg. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1080 [[Walcher]], the Bishop of Durham, was murdered by the local Northumbrians. In response, William sent his half-brother [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]] north with an army to harry the Northumbrian countryside. Odo destroyed much land north of the Tees, from York to Durham, and stole valuable items from Durham monastery. Many of the Northumbrian nobility were driven into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Rollason. ''Libellus de Exordio.'' pp. 218–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the depopulation, Norman landowners sought settlers to work in the fields. Evidence suggests that such barons were willing to rent lands to any men not obviously disloyal. Unlike the [[Vikings]] in the centuries before, Normans did not settle wholesale in the shire, but only occupied the upper ranks of society. This allowed an Anglo-Scandinavian culture to survive beneath Norman rule. Evidence for continuity can be seen in the retention of many cultural traits:{{quote|Many personal names of a pre-conquest character appear in charters that date from the 11th to the 13th century. The vigorous northern literary tradition in the Middle English period and its distinctive dialect also suggest the survival of an Anglo-Scandinavian population. The relative scarcity of Norman place-names implies that the new settlers came in only at the top rank. Domesday Book shows that at this level, however, Norman takeover in Yorkshire was virtually complete.&lt;ref name=hey19&gt;Hey. ''Yorkshire from AD 1000.'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Normans used the church as an agent of colonisation and, post-1070, founded several monasteries in the north. There had been no monasteries north of [[Burton upon Trent]] before the harrying.&lt;ref name=harper171/&gt; Of the monasteries built, Fountains Abbey became one of the largest and richest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Fountains Abbey History|url=http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/fountains/|publisher=University of Sheffield|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the foundation of the northern monasteries, the Normans increased the number of [[motte-and-bailey castle]]s they built there.&lt;ref name=harper171/&gt;

From the Norman point of view, the Harrying of the North was a successful strategy, as large areas, including [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and [[Staffordshire]] were devastated, and the Domesday Book confirms this, although in those counties it was not as complete as in Yorkshire. The object of the harrying was to prevent further revolts in [[Mercia]] and Northumbria; however, it did not prevent rebellions elsewhere.&lt;ref name=stenton605&gt;Stenton.

Similar to the [[Cadet Honor Code]]s of the [[United States Military Academy]] and [[United States Air Force Academy]], the Concept formalizes the requirement for midshipmen to demonstrate integrity while refusing to lie, cheat or steal.&lt;ref name=USNAConcept&gt;''Honor Concept'', USNA Brigade Honor Program website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treatise adopts the use of first-person point of view, becoming a personal call to obey the letter and spirit of the Concept amongst midshipmen of the brigade.&lt;ref name=USNATreatise&gt;''Honor Treatise'', USNA Brigade Honor Program website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] utilizes a similar Honor Concept to impart the same call to integrity for its corps of cadets.&lt;ref name=USCGAConcept&gt;''Honor Concept'', USCGA website, Cadet Life section&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other service academies' honor codes, the Honor Concept allows a midshipman to confront someone committing an honor violation without formally reporting it.  At the other academies, failure to formally report an honor violation is construed as tolerating it, which is itself a violation of the code.

Penalties for violating the Honor Concept can be severe, up to and including expulsion from the Academy.

{{quote|Midshipmen are persons of integrity: We stand for that which is right.

We tell the truth and ensure that the full truth is known. We do not lie.

We embrace fairness in all actions. We ensure that work submitted as our own is our own, and that assistance received from any source is authorized and properly documented. We do not cheat.

We respect the property of others and ensure that others are able to benefit from the use of their own property. We do not steal.|Honor Concept|USNA Brigade Honor Program&lt;ref name=USNAConcept/&gt;}}

==History==
The principles of the Honor Concept are as old as the Academy itself, revolving around the principle that an officer's word is his bond.  However, examination of the past academy honor practices by 1953 USNA class president [[Ross Perot]] discovered "no uniform policy for dealing with midshipmen who had violated their class's conception of honor."&lt;ref name=Gelfand191&gt;Gelfand, ''Sea change at Annapolis'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; While admitting to ''irreverence'' as an "inescapable trait of midshipmen," brigade leaders like Perot, [[William P. Lawrence]] and [[James Sagerholm]] worked with Brigade Captain [[Charles Dobony]] and academy superintendent [[Harry W. Hill]] to create the Honor Concept.&lt;ref name=Gelfand192&gt;Gelfand, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

In medicine, the '''hygiene hypothesis''' states a lack of early childhood exposure to [[infectious agents]], [[symbiotic]] microorganisms (such as the [[gut flora]] or [[probiotic]]s), and [[parasite]]s increases susceptibility to [[allergy|allergic]] diseases by suppressing the natural development of the [[immune system]]. In particular, the lack of exposure is thought to lead to defects in the establishment of [[immune tolerance]].

The hygiene hypothesis has also been called the "[[biome]] depletion theory" and the "lost friends theory".&lt;ref name=parker&gt;{{cite web| url=http://evmedreview.com/?p=457/ |author=William Parker |title=Reconstituting the depleted biome to prevent immune disorders|publisher=The Evolution &amp; Medicine Review |date=2010-10-13| accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The original formulation of the hygiene hypothesis dates from 1989 when David Strachan proposed that lower incidence of [[infection]] in early childhood could be an explanation for the rapid 20th century rise in allergic diseases such as [[asthma]] and [[hay fever]].&lt;ref name=strachan2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strachan | first1 = D. | title = Family size, infection and atopy: The first decade of the 'hygiene hypothesis' | doi = 10.1136/thorax.55.suppl_1.S2 | journal = Thorax | volume = 55 | issue = 90001 | pages = S2–S10 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = 1765943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now also recognised that the "reduced microbial exposure" concept applies to a much broader range of [[chronic inflammatory disease]]s than asthma and hay fever, which includes diseases such as [[type 1 diabetes]]&lt;ref name=stene2001&gt;Stene LC, Nafstad P. Relation between occurrence of type 1 diabetes and asthma" ''Lancet'' 2001;357:607&lt;/ref&gt; and multiple sclerosis,&lt;ref name=raison2010&gt;Raison CL, Lowry CA, Rook GAW.

In 2003 Graham Rook proposed the "old friends hypothesis" which some claim offers a more rational explanation for the link between microbial exposure and inflammatory disorders.&lt;ref name=rook2003&gt;Rook GA, Martinelli R, Brunet LR. Innate immune responses to mycobacteria and the downregulation of atopic responses" ''Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol'' 2003 Oct;3(5) 337-42.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the vital microbial exposures are not colds, influenza, measles and other common childhood infections which have evolved relatively recently over the last 10,000 years, but rather the microbes already present during mammalian and human evolution, that could persist in small hunter gatherer groups as microbiota, tolerated latent infections or carrier states. He proposes that humans have become so dependent on these "old friends" that their immune systems neither develop properly nor function properly without them.

Strachan's original formulation of the hygiene hypothesis also centred around the idea that smaller families provided insufficient microbial exposure partly because of less person-to-person spread of infections, but also because of "improved household amenities and higher standards of personal cleanliness".&lt;ref name=strachan2000 /&gt; It seems likely that this was the reason he named it the "hygiene hypothesis". Although the "hygiene revolution" of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries may have been a major factor, it now seems more likely that, although public health measures such as [[sanitation]], [[potable water]] and [[garbage collection]] were instrumental in reducing our exposure to [[cholera]], [[typhoid]] and so on, they also deprived people of their exposure to the "old friends" that occupy the same environmental habitats.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith&gt;{{cite web |authors=Stanwell-Smith R, Bloomfield SF, Rook GA. |title=The hygiene hypothesis and its implications for home hygiene, lifestyle and public health. |publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene. |url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-review/hygiene-hypothesis-and-its-implications-home-hygiene-lifestyle-and-public-0 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomfield &gt;Bloomfield SF, Stanwell-Smith R, Rook GA.

The rise of [[autoimmune disease]]s and [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] in young people in the developed world was linked to the hygiene hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = M.

== History ==

=== Hygiene ===

Although the idea that exposure to certain infections may decrease the risk of allergy is not new, Strachan was one of the first to formally propose it, in an article published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.299.6710.1259 |title=Hay fever, hygiene, and household size |year=1989 |last1=Strachan |first1=D. P. |journal=BMJ |volume=299 |issue=6710 |pages=1259–60 |pmid=2513902 |pmc=1838109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article proposed to explain the observation that [[hay fever]] and [[eczema]], both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were presumably exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child.

The hypothesis was extensively investigated by [[immunology|immunologists]] and [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] and has become an important theoretical framework for the study of chronic inflammatory disorders. It explains the increase in allergic diseases that has been seen since industrialization and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. Epidemiological studies continue to confirm the protective effect of large family size and of growing up on a farm. However, exposure to common childhood infections such as chickenpox or measles is not thought to be protective.

=== Old friends ===

The "old friends hypothesis" proposed in 2003&lt;ref name=rook2003/&gt; may offer a better explanation for the link between microbial exposure and inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref name=rook2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=rook2003/&gt; This hypothesis argues that the vital exposures are not common childhood and other recently evolved infections, which are no older than 10,000 years, but rather microbes already present in hunter-gatherer times when the human immune system was evolving. Conventional childhood infections are mostly "[[crowd infections]]" that kill or immunise and thus cannot persist in isolated hunter-gatherer groups. Crowd infections started to appear after the [[neolithic agriculture|neolithic agricultural]] revolution, when human populations increased in size and proximity. The microbes that co-evolved with mammalian immune systems are much more ancient. According to this hypothesis, humans became so dependent on them that their immune systems can neither develop nor function properly without them.

Rook proposed that these microbes most likely include:

* Ambient species that exist in the same environments as humans
* Species that inhabit human skin, gut and respiratory tract, and that of the animals we live with
* Organisms such as [[virus]]es and [[helminth]]s (worms) that establish chronic infections or carrier states that humans can tolerate and so could co-evolve a specific immunoregulatory relationship with the immune system.

The modified hypothesis later expanded to include exposure to [[symbiotic]] bacteria and parasites.&lt;ref name=grammatikos2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grammatikos Alexandros P | year = 2008 | title = The genetic and environmental basis of atopic diseases | url = | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 7| pages = 482–95 | doi = 10.1080/07853890802082096 | pmid = 18608118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Evolution turns the inevitable into a necessity." This means that the majority of mammalian evolution took place in mud and rotting vegetation and more than 90 percent of human evolution took place in isolated hunter-gatherer communities and farming communities. Therefore, the human immune systems have evolved to anticipate certain types of microbial input, making the inevitable exposure into a necessity. The organisms that are implicated in the hygiene hypothesis are not proven to cause the disease prevalence, however there are sufficient data on lactobacilli, saprophytic environment mycobacteria, and helminths and their association. These bacteria and parasites have commonly been found in vegetation, mud, and water throughout evolution.&lt;ref name=rook2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=rook2003/&gt;

Multiple possible mechanisms have been proposed for how the 'Old Friends' microorganisms prevent autoimmune diseases and asthma.  They include: 
# Reciprocal inhibition between immune responses directed against distinct antigens of the Old Friends microbes which elicit stronger immune responses than the weaker autoantigens and allergens of autoimmune disease and allergy respectively.
# Competition for cytokines, MHC receptors and growth factors needed by the immune system to mount an immune response.
# Immunoregulatory interactions with host TLRs.&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt;

=== Microbial diversity ===

The "microbial diversity" hypothesis, proposed by Paolo Matricardi&lt;ref name=matricardi2010&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matricardi PM | year = 2010 | title = 99th Dahlem conference on infection, inflammation and chronic inflammatory disorders: controversial aspects of the 'hygiene hypothesis' | url = | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 160 | issue = 1| pages = 98–105 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04130.x| pmid = 20415858 | pmc = 2841842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed by von Hertzen,&lt;ref name=vonhertzen2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Hertzen L, Hanski I, Haahtela T | year = 2011 | title = Natural immunity.

It is not clear whether diversity per se, or that a diverse population will include certain organisms without which the immune system fails to develop. Rook likened the embryonic immune system to a computer that contains programmes but little data. During gestation and infancy exposure to diverse organisms builds a "database" that allows the immune system to identify and respond to harmful agents and normalize once the danger is eliminated.

For allergic disease, the most important times for exposure are: early in development; later during pregnancy; and the first few days or months of infancy. Exposure needs to be maintained over a significant period. This fits with evidence that delivery by [[Caesarean section]] may be associated with increased allergies, whilst breastfeeding can be protective.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt; The extent to which exposures need to be maintained after infancy and whether these conditions could be managed by on-going exposure is as yet unknown.

== Evolution of the adaptive immune system ==

Humans and the microbes they harbor have co-evolved for thousands of centuries; however, it is thought that the human species has gone through numerous phases in history characterized by different pathogen exposures.  For instance, in very early human societies, small interaction between its members has given particular selection to a relatively limited group of pathogens that had high transmission rates.  When societies became larger, the introduction of agriculture some 10,000 years ago made the spreading of new pathogens more likely, and thus exposures to pathogens that favored high population densities to thrive.  Furthermore, pastoralism has made zoonotic pathogen transmissions even more favorable.  It is considered that the human immune system is likely subjected to a selective pressure from pathogens that are responsible for down regulating certain alleles and therefore phenotypes in humans, the thalassemia genes that are shaped by the ''Plasmodium'' species expressing the selection pressure being a model for this theory.

Recent comparative genomic studies have shown that immune response genes (protein coding and non-coding regulatory genes) have less evolutionary constraint, and are rather more frequently targeted by positive selection from pathogens that coevolve with the human subject.  Of all the various types of pathogens known to cause disease in humans, helminths warrant special attention, because of their ability to modify the prevalence or severity of certain immune-related responses in human and mouse models.  In fact recent research has shown that parasitic worms have served as a stronger selective pressure on select human genes encoding interleukins and interleukin receptors when compared to viral and bacterial pathogens.  Helminths are thought to have been as old as the [[adaptive immune system]], suggesting that they may have co-evolved, also implying that our immune system has been strongly focused on fighting off helminthic infections, insofar as to potentially interact with them early in infancy.  The host-pathogen interaction is a very important relationship that serves to shape the immune system development early on in life.&lt;ref&gt;Sironi, Manuela, and Mario Clerici.

== Biological basis ==

Allergic conditions are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless [[antigens]] driven by a [[t helper cell|T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2]]-mediated immune response, T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells produce [[interleukin 4]], [[interleukin 5]], [[interleukin 6]], [[interleukin 13]] and predominantly [[immunoglobulin E]].&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt; Many [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es elicit a [[t helper cell|T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1]]-mediated immune response, which down-regulates T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses. T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 immune responses are characterized by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as [[interleukin 2]], [[IFNγ]], and [[TNFα]]. Factors that favor a predominantly T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 phenotype include: older siblings, large family size, early day care attendance, infection (TB, measles, or hepatitis), rural living, or contact with animals. A T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2-dominated phenotype is associated with high antibiotic use, western lifestyle, urban environment, diet, and sensitivity to dust mites and cockroaches. T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses are reciprocally inhibitory, so when one is active, the other is suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kramer| year = 2013 | title = Maintaining Health by Balancing Microbial Exposure and Prevention of Infection: the Hygiene Hypothesis versus the Hypothesis of Early Immune Challenge | url = | journal = Journal of Hospital Infection | volume = 83 | issue = | page = 51 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was insufficient stimulation of the T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 arm, stimulating the cell defence of the immune system and leading to an overactive mother T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 arm, stimulating the antibody-mediated immunity of the immune systems, which in turn led to allergic disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0167-5699(00)01582-6 |title=Do common childhood infections 'teach' the immune system not to be allergic? |year=2000 |last1=Folkerts |first1=Gert |last2=Walzl |first2=Gerhard |last3=Openshaw |first3=Peter J.M. |journal=Immunology Today |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=118–20 |pmid=10777250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This explanation however, cannot explain the rise in incidence (similar to the rise of allergic diseases) of several T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1-mediated [[autoimmunity|autoimmune diseases]], including [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type I diabetes]]. [Figure 1Bach] However, the North South Gradient seen in the prevalence of multiple sclerosis has been found to be inversely related to the global distribution of parasitic infection.[Figure 2Bach] Additionally, research has shown that MS patients infected with parasites displayed T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 type immune responses as opposed to the proinflammatory T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 immune phenotype seen in non-infected multiple sclerosis patients.[Fleming] Parasite infection has also been shown to improve inflammatory bowel disease and may act in a similar fashion as it does in multiple sclerosis.[Lee]

An alternative explanation is that the developing immune system must receive stimuli (from infectious agents, symbiotic bacteria, or parasites) to adequately develop [[regulatory T cell]]s. Without that stimuli it becomes more susceptible to autoimmune diseases and allergic diseases, because of insufficiently repressed T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.iac.2005.03.005 |title=The Hygiene Hypothesis Revisited |year=2005 |last1=Bufford |first1=Jeremy D. |last2=Gern |first2=James E. |journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=247–62, v–vi |pmid=15878454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all chronic inflammatory disorders show evidence of failed immunoregulation.&lt;ref name=rockgaw&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rook GAW | date = Apr 2010 | title = 99th Dahlem conference on infection, inflammation and chronic inflammatory disorders: darwinian medicine and the 'hygiene' or 'old friends' hypothesis | url = | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 160 | issue = 1| pages = 70–9 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04133.x| pmid = 20415854 | pmc = 2841838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, helminths, non-pathogenic ambient pseudocommensal bacteria or certain gut [[commensal]]s and [[probiotics]], drive immunoregulation.

== Epidemiological evidence ==
{{medref|section|date=May 2016}}

The hygiene hypothesis is supported by epidemiological data. Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world.&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt; This is true for asthma&lt;ref name="pmid12910582"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ppul.10323 |title=Migration to a western country increases asthma symptoms but not eosinophilic airway inflammation |year=2003 |last1=Gibson |first1=Peter G. |last2=Henry |first2=Richard L. |last3=Shah |first3=Smita |last4=Powell |first4=Heather |last5=Wang |first5=He |journal=Pediatric Pulmonology |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=209–15 |pmid=12910582}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other chronic inflammatory disorders.&lt;ref name=rook2013 /&gt;

Antibiotic usage, which reduces the diversity of gut microbiota, is another cited factor. Although several studies have shown associations between antibiotic use and later development of asthma or allergy, other studies suggest that the effect is due to more frequent antibiotic use in asthmatic children. Trends in vaccine use may also be relevant, but epidemiological studies provide no consistent support for a detrimental effect of vaccination/immunization on [[atopy]] rates.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt; In support of the old friends hypothesis, the intestinal microbiome was found to differ between allergic and non-allergic Estonian and Swedish children (although this finding was not replicated in a larger cohort), and the biodiversity of the intestinal flora in patients with Crohn’s disease was diminished.&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt;

In 2015, a study found that washing dishes by hand as opposed to using a dishwasher, along with eating food directly from a farm or fermented food, might lead to reduced risk of certain conditions, including asthma, eczema, and possibly hay fever, though the data found on hay fever was not regarded as [[Statistical significant|statistically significant]].

== Public health trends ==

Since allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases are largely diseases of the last 100 years or so, the "hygiene" revolution of the last 200 years came under scrutiny as a possible cause. During the 1800s radical improvements to sanitation and water quality occurred in Europe and North America. The introduction of toilets and sewer systems and the cleanup of city streets, and cleaner food were part of this program. This in turn led to a rapid decline in infectious diseases, particularly during the period 1900-1950, through reduced exposure to infectious agents.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomfield /&gt;

Public health activities have also played a part in affecting diet and lifestyle, such as physical activity levels and locations.

It has been suggested that public awareness of the initial form of the "hygiene hypothesis" has led to an "increased disregard" for hygiene in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713513003745 | doi=10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.07.026 | volume=35 | title=Hygiene in the home kitchen: Changes in behaviour and impact of key microbiological hazard control measures | journal=Food Control | pages=392–400| year=2014 | last1=Taché | first1=J. | last2=Carpentier | first2=B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

While no hygiene-related treatments are part of the standard of care, various approaches are under investigation. Helminth therapy is one alternative.&lt;ref name= fleming2011/&gt; [[Probiotic]]s (drinks or foods) have never been shown to reintroduce microbes to the gut. As yet, therapeutically relevant microbes have not been specifically identified.&lt;ref name=sanders2013&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sanders ME, Guarner F, Guerrant R, Holt PR, Quigley EM, Sartor RB, Sherman PM, Mayer EA | date = May 2013 | title = An update on the use and investigation of probiotics in health and disease | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 62 | issue = 5| pages = 787–96 | doi=10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504| pmid = 23474420 | pmc = 4351195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle changes could increase microbial exposure, but whether this on balance improves the balance of risks remains the subject of research. Proposals include natural childbirth, sustained breast feeding and physical interaction between siblings, and encouraging children to spend more time in "uncleaned" outdoor environments.

Should these therapies become accepted, public policy implications include providing green spaces in urban areas or even providing access to agricultural environments for children.&lt;ref name="gaw in press"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rook GA | date = Oct 2013 | title = Regulation of the immune system by biodiversity from the natural environment: an ecosystem service essential to health | url = | journal = PNAS | volume =  110| issue = 46| pages =  18360–18367| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1313731110 | bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018360R| pmc = 3831972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Helminthic therapy ===
{{Main article|Helminthic therapy}}

Helminthic therapy is the treatment of [[autoimmune disease]]s and [[immune disorder]]s by means of deliberate infestation with a [[helminth]] [[larva]] or [[Ovum|ova]]. Helminthic therapy is currently being studied as a promising treatment for several (non-viral) [[autoimmune disease]]s including [[Crohn's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0269-2813.2004.01803.x |title=Helminths as therapeutic agents for inflammatory bowel disease |year=2004 |last1=Hunter |first1=M.

The anti-inflammatory effects of helminth infection are prompting interest and research into diseases that involve inflammation but that are not currently considered to include autoimmunity or immune dysregulation as a causative factor. Heart disease and arteriosclerosis both have similar epidemiological profiles as autoimmune diseases and both involve inflammation. Their increased incidence cannot be solely attributed to environmental factors. Recent research explored the eradication of helminths as contributing to this discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.09.028 |title=Can worms defend our hearts?

== Cleanliness ==
No evidence supports the idea that reducing modern practices of cleanliness and hygiene would have any impact on rates of chronic inflammatory and allergic disorders, but a significant amount of evidence that it would increase the risks of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith/&gt;

If home and personal cleanliness contributes to reduced exposure to vital microbes, its role is likely to be small. The idea that homes can be made “sterile” through excessive cleanliness is implausible. The evidence shows that, as fast as they are removed by cleaning, microbes are replaced, via dust and air from outdoors, by shedding from the body and other living things as well as from food.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith/&gt;&lt;ref name= Bloomfield /&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomfield2012&gt;Bloomfield SF. Exner M, Signorelli C, Nath KJ, Scott EA. 2012.

International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene. http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-review/hygiene-procedures-home-and-their-effectiveness-review-scientific-evidence-base&lt;/ref&gt; The key point may be that the microbial content of urban housing has altered, not because of home and personal hygiene habits, but because they are part of urban environments. Diet and lifestyle changes also affects the gut, skin and respiratory microbiota.

At the same time that concerns about allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases have been increasing, so also have concerns about infectious disease.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt;&lt;ref name= Bloomfield /&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomfield2009&gt;Bloomfield SF, Exner M, Fara GM, Nath KJ, Scott, EA; Van der Voorden C.

Edited by William A. Rutala and David J. Weber&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious diseases continue to exert a heavy health toll. Preventing [[pandemics]] and reducing [[antibiotic resistance]] are global priorities. Hygiene is a cornerstone of containing these threats.

=== Infection risk management ===

The International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a risk management approach to reducing home infection risks. This approach uses microbiological and epidemiological evidence to identify the key routes of infection transmission in the home. These data indicate that the critical routes involve the hands, hand and food contact surfaces and cleaning utensils. Clothing and household linens involve somewhat lower risks. Surfaces that contact the body, such as baths and hand basins, can act as infection vehicles, as can surfaces associated with toilets. Airborne transmission can be important for some pathogens. A key aspect of this approach is that it maximises protection against pathogens and infection, but is more relaxed about visible cleanliness in order to sustain normal exposure to other human, animal and environmental microbes.&lt;ref name= bloomfield2012/&gt;

== Alternative hypotheses ==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}

There are other hypotheses that try to explain the increase in [[Allergy|allergies]] in developed nations. Major areas of focus include infant feeding, over-exposure and exposure to certain pollutants.

Infant feeding topics includes breastfeeding, when babies begin to eat solid foods and the type of these foods, cow's milk vs other milks and variations in milk processing.

Over-exposure to allergens in occupational situations can cause allergic responses, such as [[Laboratory animal allergy]], [[Bird fancier's lung|bird lung]], [[farmer's lung]] and bakers lung (See [[Wheat allergy]]).

The [[pool chlorine hypothesis]] was proposed by Albert Bernard and his colleagues as an alternative hypothesis based on [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/oem.60.6.385 |title=Lung hyperpermeability and asthma prevalence in schoolchildren: Unexpected associations with the attendance at indoor chlorinated swimming pools |year=2003 |last1=Bernard |first1=A |journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=385–94 |pmid=12771389 |last2=Carbonnelle |first2=S |last3=Michel |first3=O |last4=Higuet |first4=S |last5=De Burbure |first5=C |last6=Buchet |first6=JP |last7=Hermans |first7=C |last8=Dumont |first8=X |last9=Doyle |first9=I |displayauthors=3|pmc=1740550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15690">'''Hylozoism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] point of view that [[matter]] is in some sense alive. The concept dates back at least as far as the [[Milesian school]] of [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers. The term was introduced to [[English language|English]] by [[Ralph Cudworth]] in 1678.

==Distinction from similar theories==
Although there is a distinction between possessing a mind ([[panpsychism|hylopsychism]]) and possessing life (hylozoism); in practice this division is difficult to maintain, because the ancient hylozoists not only regarded the spirits of the [[matter|material]] universe and plant world as alive, but also as more or less [[Consciousness|conscious]]. Whereas [[animism]] tends to view life as taking the form of discrete [[soul|spirits]], and panpsychism tends to refer to strictly philosophical views like that of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], hylozoism refers largely to views such as those of the earliest Greek philosophers (6th and 5th centuries BC), who treated the magnet as alive because of its attractive powers ([[Thales]]), or air as divine ([[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]), perhaps because of its apparently spontaneous power of movement, or because of its essentiality for life in animals. Later this primitive hylozoism reappeared in modified forms.  Some scholars {{who|date=June 2015}} have since claimed that the term ''hylozoism'' should properly be used only where body and soul are explicitly distinguished, the distinction then being rejected as invalid.  Nevertheless, hylozoism remains logically distinct both from early forms of animism, which personify nature, and from panpsychism, which attributes some form of consciousness or sensation to all matter.

== Ancient hylozoism ==
Some of the ancient [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers taught a version of hylozoism, as they, however vaguely, conceived the elemental matter as being in some sense animate if not actually conscious and {{not a typo|[[conative]]}} (a directed effort, a striving or tendency; a ''[[wikt:nisus|nisus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=(CD-ROM ver. 3.0) 2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |quote=1. An effort, endeavour, striving. 2. ''transf''. A force, impulse, or tendency simulating human effort; a nisus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thales]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], and [[Heraclitus]] all taught that there is a form of life in all material objects,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|J.Burnet]], [http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/egp.htm?chapter=introduction#8 ''Early Greek Philosophy'', Introduction, VIII, note 29]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed that a ''[[Anima mundi|world soul]]'' was the vital force of the universe. Note that these philosophies did not necessarily hold that material objects had ''separate life'' or ''identity'', only that they had life, either as part of an overriding entity or as living but insensible entities.

== In Renaissance and early Modernity ==
In the [[Renaissance]], [[Bernardino Telesio]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Cardanus]],  and [[Giordano Bruno]] revived the doctrine of hylozoism.  The latter, for example, held a form of [[Christian]] [[pantheism]], wherein [[God]] is the source, cause, medium, and end of all things, and therefore all things are participatory in the ongoing Godhead.  Bruno's ideas were so radical that he was entirely rejected by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as excommunicated from a few Protestant groups, and he was eventually burned at the stake for various heresies. Telesio, on the other hand, began from an [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] basis and, through radical [[empiricism]], came to believe that a living force was what informed all matter.  Instead of the intellectual universals of Aristotle, he believed that life generated form.

In [[England]], some of the [[Cambridge Platonists]] approached hylozoism as well. Both [[Henry More]] and [[Ralph Cudworth]] (''the Younger'', 1617–1688), through their reconciliation of Platonic [[idealism]] with Christian doctrines of deific generation, came to see the divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, but not nearly to the extreme, they saw God's generative impulse as giving life to all things that exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he took to be the two principal forms of atheism—materialism and hylozoism.

Cudworth singled out Hobbes not only as a defender of the hylozoic atheism "which attributes life to matter", but also as one going beyond it and defending "hylopathian atheism, which attributes all to matter." Cudworth attempted to show that Hobbes had revived the doctrines of [[Protagoras]] and was therefore subject to the criticisms which [[Plato]] had deployed against Protagoras in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']]. On the side of hylozoism, [[Strato of Lampsacus]] was the official target. However, Cudworth's Dutch friends had reported to him the views which [[Spinoza]] was circulating in manuscript. Cudworth remarks in his ''Preface'' that he would have ignored hylozoism had he not been aware that a new version of it would shortly be published.&lt;ref&gt;''The True Intellectual System of the Universe: The First part; wherein, All the Reason and Philosophy of Atheism is Confuted; and Its Impossibility Demonstrated''. By Ralph Cudworth, D.D. London, Printed for Richard Royston, 1678&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's idealism also tends toward hylozoism.  In order to hold a balance even between matter and mind, Spinoza combined materialistic with pantheistic hylozoism, by demoting both to mere attributes of the one infinite substance.  Although specifically rejecting identity in inorganic matter, he, like the Cambridge Platonists, sees a life force within, as well as beyond, all matter.

== Contemporary hylozoism ==
[[Immanuel Kant]] presented arguments against hylozoism in the third chapter of his ''Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaften'' ("First Metaphysical Principles of Natural Science," 1786) and also in his famous ''Kritik der reinen Vernunft'' ("Critique of Pure Reason," 1783).  Yet, in our times, scientific hylozoism – whether modified, or keeping the trend to make all beings conform to some uniform pattern, to which the concept was adhered in [[modernity]] by [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Hermann Lotze]], and [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel|Ernst Haeckel]] – was often called upon as a protest against a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] worldview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/phil/kantkongress/14/look.html Hylozoism and Dogmatism in Kant, Leibniz, and Newton]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Haeckel developed a [[materialism|materialist]] form of hylozoism, specially against [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s mechanical views of humans and nature.  In his ''Die Welträtsel'' of 1899 (''The Riddle of the Universe'' 1901), Haeckel upheld a unity of organic and inorganic nature and derived all actions of both types of matter from natural causes and laws.  Thus, his form of hylozoism reverses the usual course by maintaining that living and nonliving things are essentially the same, and by erasing the distinction between the two and stipulating that they behave by a single set of laws.

In contrast, the Argentine-German [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] tradition terms ''hylozoic hiatus'' all of the parts of nature which can only behave lawfully or nomically and, upon such a feature, are described as lying outside of minds and amid them – i.e. extramentally.  Thereby the hylozoic hiatus becomes contraposed to minds deemed able of behaving semoviently, i.e. able of inaugurating new causal series ([[semovience]]).  Hylozoism in this contemporary neurobiological tradition is thus restricted to the portions of nature behaving nomically inside the minds, namely the minds' sensory reactions ([[Christfried Jakob]]'s "sensory intonations") whereby minds react to the stimuli coming from the hylozoic hiatus or extramental realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electroneubio.secyt.gov.ar/commentl.htm Comment l’ hylozoïsme scientifique contemporain aborde-t-il la sélection naturelle du parenchyme neurocognitif?] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogprints.org/4662|title=On Minds' Localization|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Buber]] too takes an approach that is quasi-hylozoic.  By maintaining that the essence of things is identifiable and separate, although not pre-existing, he can see a soul within each thing.

The French Pythagorean and Rosicrucian alchemist, Francois Jollivet-Castelot (1874-1937), established a hylozoic esoteric school which combined the insight of spagyrics, chemistry, physics, transmutations and metaphysics. He published many books, one of which was called "L’Hylozoïsme, l’alchimie, les chimistes unitaires" (1896). In his view there was no difference between spirit and matter except for the degree of frequency and other vibrational conditions.

The [[Mormon theology|Mormon theologian]] [[Orson Pratt]] taught a form of hylozoism.

[[Alice A. Bailey]] wrote a book called ''The Consciousness of the Atom''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Consciousness of the Atom''—1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Alice A. Bailey, [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], and their predecessor [[Madame Blavatsky]], [[Henry T. Laurency]] produced voluminous writings describing a hylozoic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to the Works of Henry T. Laurency". ''The Official Website of the Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation''. Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation. 12 July 2009 &lt;http://www.laurency.com/introduc.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[George Ivanovich Gurdjieff]], the English philosopher and mathematician [[John Godolphin Bennett]], in his four-volume work ''The Dramatic Universe'' and his book ''Energies'', developed a six-dimensional framework in which matter-energy takes on 12 levels of hylozoic quality.

[[Ken Wilber]] embraces hylozoism to explain  [[subjective experience]] and provides terms describing the ladder of subjective experience experienced by entities from [[atom]]s up to [[Human being]]s in the ''upper left quadrant'' of his [[Integral (philosophy)|Integral philosophy]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber Ken ''A Brief History of Everything'', 1st ed. 1996, 2nd ed. 2001: {{ISBN|1-57062-740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist Thomas Brophy, in The Mechanism Demands a Mysticism, embraces hylozoism as the basis of a framework for re-integrating modern physical science with perennial spiritual philosophy.  Brophy coins two additional words to stand with hylozoism as the three possible ontological stances consistent with modern physics.  Thus: hylostatism (universe is deterministic, thus “static” in a four-dimensional sense); hylostochastism (universe contains a fundamentally random or stochastic component); hylozoism (universe contains a fundamentally alive aspect).

Architect [[Christopher Alexander]] has put forth a theory of the living universe, where life is viewed as a pervasive patterning that extends to what is normally considered non-living things, notably buildings.  He wrote a four-volume work called ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' which explicates this theory in detail.

Philosopher and ecologist [[David Abram]] articulates and elaborates a form of hylozoism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''Becoming Animal'' and ''The Spell of the Sensuous,'' Abram suggests that matter is never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that material things actively "solicit our attention" or "call our focus," coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science as well as the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it calls us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruno Latour]]'s [[actor-network theory]], in the sociology of science, treats non-living things as active agents and thus bears some metaphorical resemblance to hylozoism.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno ''Pandora's Hope: Essays on the reality of Science Studies'', 1999: {{ISBN|0-674-65335-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
'''[[Art]]'''
*''[[Hylozoic Series: Sibyl (2012)|Hylozoic Series: Sibyl]]'', an interactive installation of Canadian artist and architect [[Philip Beesley]], was presented in the [[Biennale of Sydney#18th Biennale of Sydney .282012.29|18th Biennale of Sydney]] and was on display until September, 2012.  Using sensors, LEDs, and shape memory alloy, Beesley constructed an interactive environment that responded to the actions of the audience, offering a vision of how buildings in the future might move, think and feel.&lt;ref name="Sibyl by Philip Beesley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspir3d.net/2012/07/02/sibyl-by-philip-beesley/ |title=Sibyl by Philip Beesley |work=Inspir3d |accessdate=20 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427111521/http://inspir3d.net/2012/07/02/sibyl-by-philip-beesley/ |archivedate=27 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''[[Literature]]'''
*In mathematician and writer [[Rudy Rucker]]'s novels ''Postsingular'' and ''Hylozoic'', the emergent sentience of all material things is described as a property of the [[technological singularity]].
*The ''Hylozoist'' is one of the Culture ships mentioned in Iain M. Banks's novel ''[[Surface Detail]]'' – appropriately, this ship is a member of the branch of Contact dealing with [[Hegemonising swarm|smart matter]] outbreaks.
'''[[MMORPG]]s''' 
*The monster "Hylozoist" (sometimes spelled "Heirozoist") in the MMORPG ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'' is a plush rabbit doll with its mouth sewn shut, possessed by the spirit of a child. Although hylozoism has nothing to do with possession, it is clear that the name was derived from this ancient philosophy.
'''[[Music]]'''
*The [[Hylozoists (band)|Hylozoists]] are a Canadian band.

An '''indiscrete category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' in which every [[hom-set]] ''C''(''X'', ''Y'') is a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]. Every [[class (set theory)|class]] ''X'' gives rise to an indiscrete category whose objects are the elements of ''X'' with exactly one [[morphism]] between any two objects. Any two nonempty indiscrete categories are [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to each other. The [[functor]] from '''Set''' to '''Cat''' that sends a set to the corresponding indiscrete category is [[adjoint functors|right adjoint]] to the functor that sends a small category to its set of objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9854">In mathematics, a '''J-structure''' is an [[algebraic structure]] over a [[field (algebra)|field]] related to a [[Jordan algebra]].  The concept was introduced by {{harvtxt|Springer|1973}} to develop a theory of Jordan algebras using [[linear algebraic group]]s and axioms taking the Jordan inversion as basic operation and [[Hua's identity]] as a basic relation.  There is a classification of simple structures deriving from the classification of [[semisimple algebraic group]]s.  Over fields of [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] not equal to 2, the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras.

==Definition==
Let ''V'' be a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] over a field ''K'' and ''j'' a [[rational map]] from ''V'' to itself, expressible in the form ''n''/''N'' with ''n'' a [[polynomial map]] from ''V'' to itself and ''N'' a polynomial in ''K''[''V''].  Let ''H'' be the subset of GL(''V'') × GL(''V'') containing the pairs (''g'',''h'') such that ''g''∘''j'' = ''j''∘''h'': it is a closed [[subgroup]] of the product and the projection onto the first factor, the set of ''g'' which occur, is the ''structure group'' of ''j'', denoted ''G'''(''j'').

A ''J-structure'' is a triple (''V'',''j'',''e'') where ''V'' is a vector space over ''K'', ''j'' is a [[birational map]] from ''V'' to itself and ''e'' is a non-zero element of ''V'' satisfying the following conditions.&lt;ref name=Spr10&gt;Springer (1973) p.10&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''j'' is a homogeneous birational [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] of degree −1
* ''j'' is regular at ''e'' and ''j''(''e'') = ''e''
* if ''j'' is regular at ''x'', ''e'' + ''x'' and ''e'' + ''j''(''x'') then
:&lt;math&gt; j(e+x) + j(e+j(x)) = e &lt;/math&gt;
* the orbit ''G'' ''e'' of ''e'' under the structure group ''G'' = ''G''(''j'') is a [[Zariski open]] subset of ''V''.

The ''norm'' associated to a J-structure (''V'',''j'',''e'') is the numerator ''N'' of ''j'', normalised so that ''N''(''e'') = 1.  The ''degree'' of the J-structure is the degree of ''N'' as a homogeneous polynomial map.&lt;ref name=Spr11&gt;Springer (1973) p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''quadratic map'' of the structure is a map ''P'' from ''V'' to End(''V'') defined in terms of the [[Differential (mathematics)#Algebraic geometry|differential]] d''j'' at an invertible ''x''.&lt;ref name=Spr16&gt;Springer (1973) p.16&lt;/ref&gt;  We put
:&lt;math&gt;P(x) = - (d j)_x^{-1} . &lt;/math&gt;

The quadratic map turns out to be a quadratic polynomial map on ''V''.

The subgroup of the structure group ''G'' generated by the invertible quadratic maps is the ''inner structure group'' of the J-structure.  It is a closed connected normal subgroup.&lt;ref name=Spr18&gt;Springer (1973) p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==J-structures from quadratic forms==
Let ''K'' have [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] not equal to 2. Let ''Q'' be a [[quadratic form]] on the vector space ''V'' over ''K'' with associated [[bilinear form]] ''Q''(''x'',''y'') = ''Q''(''x''+''y'') − ''Q''(''x'') − ''Q''(''y'') and distinguished element ''e'' such that ''Q''(''e'',.) is not trivial.  We define a reflection map ''x''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt; x^* = Q(x,e)e - x &lt;/math&gt;

and an inversion map ''j'' by

:&lt;math&gt; j(x) = Q(x)^{-1} x^* . &lt;/math&gt;

Then (''V'',''j'',''e'') is a J-structure.

===Example===
Let ''Q'' be the usual sum of squares quadratic function on ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; for fixed integer ''r'', equipped with the [[standard basis]] ''e''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,...,''e''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then (''K''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Q'', ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;) is a J-structure of degree 2.  It is denoted O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Spr33&gt;Springer (1973) p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Link with Jordan algebras==
In [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] not equal to 2, which we assume in this section, the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras.

Let ''A'' be a finite-dimensional commutative [[non-associative algebra]] over ''K'' with identity ''e''.   Let ''L''(''x'') denote multiplication on the left by ''x''.  There is a unique birational map ''i'' on ''A'' such that ''i''(''x'').''x'' = ''e'' if ''i'' is regular on ''x'': it is homogeneous of degree −1 and an involution with ''i''(''e'') = ''e''.  It may be defined by ''i''(''x'') = ''L''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.''e''.  We call ''i'' the ''inversion'' on ''A''.&lt;ref name=Spr66&gt;Springer (1973) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

A Jordan algebra is defined by the identity&lt;ref name=Sch91&gt;Schafer (1995) p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oku13&gt;Okubo (2005) p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x(x^2 y) = x^2 (x y) . &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative characterisation is that for all invertible ''x'' we have

:&lt;math&gt; x^{-1}(x y) = x (x^{-1} y) . &lt;/math&gt;

If ''A'' is a Jordan algebra, then (''A'',''i'',''e'') is a J-structure.  If (''V'',''j'',''e'') is a J-structure, then there exists a unique Jordan algebra structure on ''V'' with identity ''e'' with inversion ''j''.

==Link with quadratic Jordan algebras==
In general characteristic, which we assume in this section, J-structures are related to [[quadratic Jordan algebra]]s.  We take a quadratic Jordan algebra to be a finite dimensional vector space ''V'' with a quadratic map ''Q'' from ''V'' to End(''V'') and a distinguished element ''e''.  We let ''Q'' also denote the bilinear map ''Q''(''x'',''y'') = ''Q''(''x''+''y'') − ''Q''(''x'') − ''Q''(''y'').  The properties of a quadratic Jordan algebra will be&lt;ref name=Spr72&gt;Springer (1973) p.72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McC83&gt;McCrimmon (2004) p.83&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Q''(''e'') = id&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Q''(''x'',''e'')''y'' = ''Q''(''x'',''y'')''e''
* ''Q''(''Q''(''x'')''y'') = ''Q''(''x'')''Q''(''y'')''Q''(''x'')
* ''Q''(''x'')''Q''(''y'',''z'')''x'' = ''Q''(''Q''(''x'')''y'',''x'')''z''

We call ''Q''(''x'')''e'' the ''square'' of ''x''.  If the squaring is [[dominant morphism|dominant]] (has [[Zariski dense]] image) then the algebra is termed ''separable''.&lt;ref name=Spr74&gt;Springer (1973) p.74&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a unique birational involution ''i'' such that ''Q''(''x'')''i'' ''x'' = ''x'' if ''Q'' is regular at ''x''.  As before, ''i'' is the ''inversion'', definable by ''i''(''x'') = ''Q''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''.

If (''V'',''j'',''e'') is a J-structure, with quadratic map ''Q'' then (''V'',''Q'',''e'') is a quadratic Jordan algebra.  In the opposite direction, if (''V'',''Q'',''e'') is a separable quadratic Jordan algebra with inversion ''i'', then (''V'',''i'',''e'') is a J-structure.&lt;ref name=Spr76&gt;Springer (1973) p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

===H-structure===
McCrimmon proposed a notion of ''H-structure'' by dropping the density axiom and strengthening the third (a form of Hua's identity) to hold in all [[Mutation (algebra)|isotopes]].  The resulting structure is categorically equivalent to a quadratic Jordan algebra.&lt;ref name=McC1977&gt;McCrimmon (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McC1978&gt;McCrimmon (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peirce decomposition==
A J-structure has a [[Peirce decomposition]] into subspaces determined by idempotent elements.&lt;ref name=Spr90&gt;Springer (1973) p.90&lt;/ref&gt;  Let ''a'' be an idempotent of the J-structure (''V'',''j'',''e''), that is, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''.  Let ''Q'' be the quadratic map.  Define

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_a(t,u) = Q(ta + u(e-a)) . &lt;/math&gt;

This is invertible for non-zero ''t'',''u'' in ''K'' and so φ defines a morphism from the [[algebraic torus]] GL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × GL&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the inner structure group ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  There are subspaces

:&lt;math&gt; V_a = \left\lbrace{ x \in V : \phi_a(t,u) x = t^2 x }\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V'_a = \left\lbrace{ x \in V : \phi_a(t,u) x = tu x }\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V_{e-a} = \left\lbrace{ x \in V : \phi_a(t,u) x = u^2 x }\right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;

and these form a [[direct sum]] decomposition of ''V''.  This is the Peirce decomposition for the idempotent ''a''.&lt;ref name=Spr92&gt;Springer (1973) p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalisations==
If we drop the condition on the distinguished element ''e'', we obtain "J-structures without identity".&lt;ref name=Spr21&gt;Springer (1973) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;  These are related to [[isotope (Jordan algebra)|isotope]]s of Jordan algebras.&lt;ref name=Spr22&gt;Springer (1973) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''legal debate''' is a discussion between [[lawyers]], [[legal academics]], [[jurists]], [[politicians]], and others who might have an interest or expertise in the [[law]], about a particular legal issue.

== Overview ==
Legal debates can take many forms, and do not necessarily need to be face-to-face debates.  Most legal debates take place on paper—judges within a court, for example, might debate each other most effectively when the court publishes a decision.  Legal debates include (but are not limited to) the following:

*'''Debates between judges.'''  These debates, as well, will often occur face to face during judicial conferences, but they find their most prominent voice in written opinions.  Splintered U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions present a prominent example.  [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissents with the majority epitomize the nature of judicial legal debate—a debate that often centers around the proper means of interpreting federal statutes or the Constitution.
*'''Debate between politicians.'''  An example of this debate is that between the [[President of the United States]] and the [[United States Congress]] over the ability of the executive power to issue clandestine wiretaps without seeking a warrant.  The legal debate at issue is the scope of executive power vis-a-vis the other branches of government.
*'''General debate within society.'''  Societies always debate the legal order.  The process of electing politicians and lobbying is a form of legal debate: the majority tends to become part of a coalition that agrees on the laws that will be implemented.

== Contemporary issues in legal debates ==
Debates in Western societies often follow broad themes, including

*The balance between state power and civil liberties
*The proper breadth of civil liberties relative to social norms and moral expectations

In the United States, legal debates over the past decade have concerned the following important topics:

*The [[right to privacy]], including the right to have an [[abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Editors |title= The Abortion Debate: Finding a Forum |journal=Policy Today  |date=2006-06-01 |url=http://www.policytoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=2 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The balance between civil rights and the need for greater security after September 11, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Godoy |first=Maria |title=NSA Wiretapping: The Legal Debate |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2008-02-23 |url=https://www.npr.org/news/specials/nsawiretap/legality.html |accessdate= 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The proper method of interpreting the Constitution
*[[Affirmative Action]]
*[[Welfare reform]]#
*The right to a child

In general, the variety of debates—ranging from basic social policy to grander theory about constitutional design and democratic theory—suggests that legal debates overlap with several other social institutions and expectations.

'''Logic models''' are hypothesized descriptions of the chain of causes and effects (see [[Causality]]) leading to an outcome of interest (e.g. prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, annual traffic collision, etc). While they can be in a narrative form, logic model usually take form in a graphical depiction of the "if-then" (causal) relationships between the various elements leading to the outcome. However, the logic model is more than the graphical depiction: it is also the theories, scientific evidences, assumptions and beliefs that support it and the various processes behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Renger R |date=2002|title=A Three-Step Approach to Teaching Logic Models |journal=The American Journal of Evaluation |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=493–503 |doi=10.1016/s1098-2140(02)00230-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Frechtling_2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frechtling|first=Joy A. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Logic Models|date=2015 |work=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|pages=299–305|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-097086-8.10549-5|isbn=978-0-08-097087-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the logic model ==

===Program planning===
One of the most important uses of the logic model is for program planning. It is suggested to use the logic model to focus on the intended outcomes of a particular program. The guiding questions change from "what is being done?" to "what needs to be done"? McCawley suggests that by using this new reasoning, a logic model for a program can be built by asking the following questions in sequence:

# What is the current situation that we intend to impact?
# What will it look like when we achieve the desired situation or outcome?
# What behaviors need to change for that outcome to be achieved?
# What knowledge or skills do people need before the behavior will change?
# What activities need to be performed to cause the necessary learning?
# What resources will be required to achieve the desired outcome?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~kgilbert/educ5165-731/Readings/The%20Logic%20Model.pdf|title=The logic model for program planning and evaluation|last=McCawley|first=Paul F. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=University of Idaho Extension|year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By placing the focus on ultimate outcomes or results, planners can ''think backward'' through the logic model to identify how best to achieve the desired results. Here it helps managers to 'plan with the end in mind', rather than just consider inputs (e.g. budgets, employees) or the tasks that must be done.

===Evaluation===
The logic model is often used in [[government]] or not-for-profit organizations, where the mission and vision are not aimed at achieving a financial benefit. Traditionally, government programs were described only in terms of their [[budget]]s.  It is easy to measure the amount of money spent on a program, but this is a poor indicator of outcomes. Likewise it is relatively easy to measure the amount of work done (e.g. number of workers or number of years spent), but the workers may have just been 'spinning their wheels' without getting very far in terms of ultimate results or outcomes.

However, nature of outcomes varies. To measure the progress toward outcomes, some initiatives may require an ad hoc measurement instrument. In addition, in programs such as in [[education]] or [[social program]]s, outcomes are usually in the long-term and may requires numerous intermediate changes (attitudes, social norm, industry practices, etc.) to advance progressively toward the outcomes.

By making clear the intended outcomes and the causal pathways leading to them, a program logic model provides the basis upon which planners and evaluators can develop a measurement plan and adequate instruments. Instead of only looking at the outcome progress, planners can open the "black box" and examine if the intermediate outcomes progress as planned. In addition, the pathways of numerous outcomes are still largely misunderstood due their complexity, their unpredictability and lack of scientific / practical evidences. Therefore, with proper research design, one may not only assess the progress of intermediate outcomes, but evaluate as well if the program theory of change is accurate, i.e. is successful change of an intermediate outcomes provokes the hypothesized subsequent effects in the causal pathway. Finally, outcomes may easily be achieved through processes independent of the program and an evaluation of those outcomes would suggest program success when in fact external outputs were responsible for the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Peter H | last1 = Rossi | first2 = Mark W | last2 = Lipsey | first3 = Howard E | last3 = Freeman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evaluation : a systematic approach |date=2004|publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-0894-4|edition=7th |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |oclc=52706526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Various types of logic models ==

=== The Inputs --&gt; Activities --&gt; Outputs --&gt; Outcomes template ===
Many authors and guides use the following template when speaking about logic model:&lt;ref name="Frechtling_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LM_EE" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McLaughlin |first=John A. |last2=Jordan |first2=Gretchen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Using Logic Models |date=2015-10-14 |work=Handbook of Practical Program Evaluation |pages=62–87 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi=10.1002/9781119171386.ch3 |isbn=978-1-119-17138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" | style="width: 75%;"
|-

! style="width: 25%;" | Activities
! style="width: 25%;" | Outputs
! style="width: 25%;" | Outcomes/impacts

| align="center" |  e.g. number of booklets produced, workshops held, people trained
| align="center" |  e.g. increased skills/ knowledge/ confidence, leading in longer-term to promotion, new job, etc.
|}

Many refinements and variations{{Which|date=October 2018}} have been added to the basic template. For example, many versions of logic models set out a series of outcomes/impacts, explaining in more detail the logic of how an intervention contributes to intended or observed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Weiss CH | date = 1972 | title = Evaluation Research. Methods for Assessing Program Effectiveness. | publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc. | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others often distinguish short-term, medium-term and long-term results, and between direct and indirect results.

=== Intervention Mapping logic models ===
[[File:Logic_Model_of_the_Problem_for_Management_information_Decision_Support_Epilepsy_Tool.jpg|thumb|Logic Model of the Problem for Management information Decision Support Epilepsy Tool (MINDSET program) from Ruiter, DeSmet and Schneider (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shegog R, Begley CE | title = Clinic-Based Mobile Health Decision Support to Enhance Adult Epilepsy Self-Management: An Intervention Mapping Approach | journal = Frontiers in Public Health | volume = 5 | pages = 256 | date = 2017 | pmid = 29043247 | pmc = 5632356 | doi = 10.3389/fpubh.2017.00256 | quote = The full intervention mapping based protocol is available in the full article }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Bartholomew et al. [[Intervention mapping|Intervention Mapping]] approach&lt;ref name="Eldredge_2016" /&gt; makes an extensive use of logic model through the whole life-cycle of a health promotion program. Since this method can start from as far as a vague desired outcomes (authors example is a city whose actors decide to address "health issues" of the city), planners goes through various steps in order to develop effective interventions and properly evaluate them (see [[Intervention Mapping]] entry for a more detailed account). Distinguishable but closely interweave logic models with different purposes are being developed through the process:

* '''Logic model of the problem''', which is a graphical depiction of at-risk population and its social environment behaviours (factors) leading to the health problem and their respective causal pathways (attitudes, beliefs, skills, etc.). This may include as well at-risk population physical environment related causes such as polluants or lack of physical activity infrastructure and their respective causes, i.e. environmental agents behaviours leading to the physical environment causes and their respective causal pathways;
* Once the most relevant behaviours and causal pathways are identified, planners develop a '''logic model of change'''. This is a model of behavioural changes (performance objective) that should happen and their corresponding necessary changes higher in the cause-effects chain.
* Finally, a '''logic model of the intervention''' is developed. This model describe the various activities that will happen and the cascades of effects they are expected to cause toward the desired outcome.

Evaluators thereafter use the logic model of the intervention to design a proper evaluation plan to assess [[Program evaluation#Assessing implementation|implementation]], [[Program evaluation#Assessing the impact (effectiveness)|impact]] and [[Program evaluation#Assessing efficiency|efficiency]].

==Advantages==
By describing work in this way, managers have an easier way to define the work and measure it.  [[Performance measurement|Performance measures]] can be drawn from any of the steps.  One of the key insights of the logic model is the importance of measuring final outcomes or results, because it is quite possible to waste time and money (inputs), "spin the wheels" on work activities, or produce outputs without achieving desired outcomes.  It is these outcomes (impacts, long-term results) that are the only justification for doing the work in the first place.  For commercial organizations, outcomes relate to [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].  For [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] or [[governmental organization]]s, outcomes relate to successful achievement of mission or program goals.

==Disadvantages==
There are some potential disadvantages of logic models due to tendencies toward oversimplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The logic model guidebook : better strategies for great results | first1 = Lisa Wyatt | last1 = Knowlton | first2 = Cynthia C | last2 = Phillips | last3 =Phillips | first3 = Cynthia | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013|publisher=SAGE C.|isbn=978-1-4522-1675-1|edition=2nd|location=Los Angeles|oclc=791492618}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
#Program logic is no guarantee of actual logic in how the program may work. The world is complex, and some situations cannot be ascertained before they are implemented, so some programs may even progress against the "logic" of the model.
#It is a partial representation of a complex system.
#It is a representation of reality, not reality itself. Programs are not linear
#Normally, it does not include effects besides those initially expected.
#They do not necessarily establish causality. Many factors exert influence upon the effects.

'''Military expression''' is an area of [[military law]] pertaining to the [[United States military]] that relates to the [[free speech]] rights of its service members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vagts|first=Detlev F.|title=Free Speech in the Armed Forces|journal=[[Columbia Law Review]]|date=February 1957|volume=57|issue=12|pages=187–218|issn=0010-1958|oclc=4895173605}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "military free speech" was the term used during the [[Vietnam War]] era, "military expression" has become a niche area of [[military law]] since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.yaleconservativeparty.com/stm Yale Conservative Party] lecture for 2009 titled "Military Expression in the Modern Armed Forces"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2011}} Besides media references relating to specific cases, the term was used at military [[whistleblower]] committee hearings with members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and Senate on May 14, 2008. Transcripts of the hearings show that attorney [[Mike Lebowitz]] was identified as testifying as a legal expert in "military expression".&lt;ref&gt;transcripts for May 14, 2008, see also [[C-SPAN]] coverage of hearings&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=November 2012}} That hearing also included references by U.S. Representative [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-TX) who also referred to the area of law as "military expression".{{Elucidate|date=February 2011}}

== Limitations on military expression ==

While the civilian population of the United States is afforded the right to free expression under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has affirmed the notion that service members have a reduced level of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/135/550 ''United States v. Voorhees''] 135 U.S. 550 (10 S.Ct. 841, 34 L.Ed. 258)&lt;/ref&gt; While the Court acknowledged that service members do have First Amendment rights, these rights are limited:

{{quote|They do, in fact, have the same first amendment rights as their civilian brothers. They are, however, not absolute...The difference is that the military has peculiar needs and interests apart from those of the civilian community it serves, and they preclude the exercise of the right of free speech on as broad a basis as is the practice in the civilian community. No [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] or man in the armed forces has a right, be it constitutional, statutory or otherwise, to publish any information (or make any statement) which will imperil his unit or its cause.&lt;ref name="airpower.maxwell.af.mil"&gt;http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1980/may-jun/moran.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123235218/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1980/may-jun/moran.html |date=November 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=February 2011}}}}

== After September 11, 2001 ==

With the advent of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003, the issue of military expression was again in the public eye as a relatively small amount of service members and veterans began demonstrating. One case revolved around a former Marine (still under contract with the [[Individual Ready Reserve|IRR]]) who was photographed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wearing a partial uniform during an anti-war demonstration in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=David|title=Antiwar to the Corps: Marine Reservist-Protesters Face Discipline|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/30/AR2007053002627_pf.html|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual faced disciplinary action for his participation in this demonstration, as well as for a politically charged email he sent to a Marine officer.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Koff, "Corps accused of 'muzzle' tactics", ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=November 2012}} However, in this case, the service member avoided the other than honorable discharge being sought by the military due to the First Amendment arguments posed on his behalf.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; That case, which was argued by attorney [[Mike Lebowitz]] in representation of anti-war and political activist [[Adam Kokesh]], is regarded as the first military expression case of its kind to result generally favorably for the service member.&lt;ref name=justine&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharrock|first=Justine|title=Zip It, Soldier!: What happens to Iraq veterans who speak out against the war?|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/09/iraq-veterans-speak-out-against-war|newspaper=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mortality salience''' is the awareness by an individual that his or her [[death]] is inevitable.

The term derives from [[terror management theory]], which proposes that mortality salience causes existential [[anxiety]] that may be buffered by an individual's cultural worldview and/or sense of [[self-esteem]].

==Terror management theory==

{{Main|Terror management theory}}

Mortality salience engages the conflict that humans have to face both their instinct to avoid death completely, and their intellectual knowledge that avoiding death is ultimately futile.  According to terror management theory, when human beings begin to contemplate their mortality and their vulnerability to death, feelings of terror emerge because of the simple fact that humans want to avoid their inevitable death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitley |first=Bernard |last2=Kite |first2=Mary |date=2010 |title=The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination (2 ed.) |url= |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth |pages=251–254 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality salience comes into effect, because humans contribute all of their actions to either avoiding death or distracting themselves from the contemplation of it. Thus, terror management theory asserts that almost all human activity is driven by the [[fear of death]].

Most research done on terror management theory revolves around the mortality salience paradigm. It has been found that religious individuals as well as religious [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] are less vulnerable to mortality salience manipulations, and so religious believers engage in cultural worldview defense to a lesser extent than nonreligious individuals.&lt;ref name="Wojtkowiak"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wojtkowiak |first=Joanna |last2=Rutjens |first2=Bastiaan T. |date=2011 |title=The postself and terror management theory: Reflecting on after death identity buffers existential threat |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508619.2011.557008 |journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion |publisher=Routledge |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=137–144 |doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.557008 |access-date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-esteem==

Mortality salience is highly manipulated by one's self-esteem. Individuals with low self-esteem are more apt to experience the effects of mortality salience, whereas individuals with high self-esteem are better able to cope with the idea that their death is uncontrollable. As an article states, "according to terror management theory, increased self-esteem should enhance the functioning of the cultural anxiety buffer and thereby provide protection against death concerns".&lt;ref name=terror&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon-Jones |first=Eddie |last2=Simon |first2=Linda |last3=Greenberg |first3=Jeff |last4=Pyszczynski |first4=Tom |last5=Solomon |first5=Sheldon |last6=McGregor |first6=Holly |date=1997 |title=Terror management theory and self-esteem: Evidence that increased self-esteem reduces mortailty salience effects |url=http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_etal97tm.pdf |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=24–36 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.24|access-date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Potential to cause worldview defense==

Mortality salience has the potential to cause worldview defense, a psychological mechanism that strengthens people's connection with their [[in-group]] as a [[defense mechanism]]. Studies also show that mortality salience can lead people to feel more inclined to punish minor moral transgressions. One such study divided a group of judges into two groups—one that was asked to reflect upon their own mortality, and one group that was not. The judges were then asked to set a bond for an alleged prostitute. The group that had reflected on mortality set an average bond of $455, while the control group's average bond was $50.&lt;ref name="wakeof911"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pyszczynski|first=Thomas|author2=Jeff Greenberg |author3=Sheldon Solomon |title=In the Wake of 9/11: The Psychology of Terror |publisher=American Psychological Association|date=2003|isbn= 9781557989543|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IaCgHQAACAAJ&amp;dq=in+the+wake+of+9/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that mortality salience could cause an increase in support for martyrdom and military intervention. It found that students who had reflected on their mortality showed preference towards people who supported martyrdom, and indicated they might consider martyrdom themselves. They also found that, especially among students who were politically conservative, mortality salience increased support for military intervention, but not among students who were politically liberal.&lt;ref name="martyrdom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pyszczynski|first=Tom|author2=Abdolhossein Abdollahi |author3=Sheldon Solomon |author4=Jeff Greenberg |author5=Florette Cohen |author6=David Weise |title=Mortality Salience, Martyrdom, and Military Might: The Great Satan Versus the Axis of Evil |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|publisher=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=32|issue=4|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/4/525|accessdate=2009-04-07|pmid=16513804|doi=10.1177/0146167205282157|year=2006|pages=525–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender, emotion and sex==

A study tested "the hypothesis that mortality salience intensifies gender differences in reactions to sexual and emotional infidelity". In the study, participants were asked to work through packets that had mortality salience manipulation questions in each. In the results, they found that "sex is more relevant to the self-esteem of men than women and being in a committed relationship is relatively more important to women than for men". Therefore, when linking mortality salience to [[gender]], [[emotion]], and [[sex]], men are more likely to suffer from sexual infidelity, and women are more likely to suffer from emotional infidelity. The results of this study showed that there is a logistic regression revealing a significant three-way interaction between gender, sex value, and mortality salience for the item pitting "passionate sex" against "emotional attachment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldenberg |first=Jamie |last2=Landau |first2=Mark J. |last3=Pyszczynski |first3=Tom |last4=Cox |first4=Cathy R. |last5=Greenberg |first5=Jeff |last6=Solomon |first6=Sheldon |last7=Dunnam |first7=Heather |date=December 2003 |title=Gender-Typical Response to Sexual and Emotional Infidelity as a Function of Mortality Salience Induced Self-Esteemed Striving |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/29/12/1585.abstract |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=1585–1595 |doi=10.1177/0146167203256880 |access-date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individuals exposed to near-death experiences==

With mortality salience, humans who have encountered [[near-death experiences]] develop a greater sense of self and meaning to life. It has been shown that individuals who face these experiences tend to invest more into relationships, political beliefs, religious beliefs, and other beliefs over material things. As a patient with AIDS shared, "Because of my illness I have nothing to hide. It has freed me because now I am completely honest".{{citation need|date=October 2015}} Developing a cultural worldview provides humans with comfort from the thought of their own inevitable death. This coping mechanism has shown to highly improve the self-worth of humans and highly alleviates existential anxiety.

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
'''Madutā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "malleability", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāyamadutā'' - malleability of mental body (or pliancy of cetisakas)
* ''Cittamadutā'' - malleability of consciousness (or pliancy of citta)

These two mental factors have the characteristic of the subsiding of rigidity (''thambha'') in the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2367-2369}}
:The twofold malleability has the characteristic of the subsiding of rigidity (''thambha'') in the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush rigidity. It is manifested as non-resistance, and its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to such defilements as wrong views and conceit, which create rigidity.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=226}}
:According to the ''Dhammasangani'' (par 44, 45) this pair of cetasikas consist in suavity, smoothness and absence of rigidity.

The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 130) states:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=226}}
: They have the characteristic of suppressing the rigidity of mental factors and of consciousness; the function of crushing the same in both; the manifestation or effect of setting up no resistance; and have mental factors and consciousness as proximate cause. They are the opponents of the corruptions, such as opinionatedness (''diṭṭhi'') and conceit which cause mental rigidity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4044">The '''National Library of Medicine (NLM) classification system''' is a [[Library classification|library indexing system]] covering the fields of [[medicine]] and preclinical basic sciences. The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] classification is patterned after the [[Library of Congress Classification|Library of Congress (LC) Classification system]]: [[Alphabet|alphabetical letters ]]  denote broad subject categories which are subdivided by numbers.&lt;ref name=NLM_Factsheet&gt;{{cite web | title =Fact Sheet: NLM Classification | work = | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/nlmclassif.html | date = 2005-07-15 | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''QW 279'' would indicate a book on an aspect of [[microbiology]] or [[immunology]].

The one- or two-letter alphabetical codes in the NLM classification use a limited range of letters: only QS–QZ and W–WZ. This allows the NLM system to co-exist with the larger LC coding scheme as neither of these ranges are used in the LC system. There are, however, three pre-existing codes in the LC system which overlap with the NLM: ''Human Anatomy'' (QM), ''Microbiology'' (QR), and ''Medicine'' (R). To avoid further confusion, these three codes are not used in the NLM.

The headings for the individual ''schedules'' (letters or letter pairs) are given in brief form (e.g., QW - ''Microbiology and Immunology''; WG - ''Cardiovascular System'') and together they provide an outline of the subjects covered by the NLM classification. Headings are interpreted broadly and include the [[Physiology|physiological]] system, the specialties connected with them, the regions of the body chiefly concerned and subordinate related fields. The NLM system is [[hierarchical]], and within each schedule, division by [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] usually has priority. Each main schedule, as well as some sub-sections, begins with a group of form numbers ranging generally from 1–49 which  classify materials by publication type, e.g., [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[atlas]]es, laboratory manuals, etc.

The main schedules QS-QZ, W-WY, and WZ (excluding the range WZ 220–270)  classify works published after 1913; the 19th century schedule is used for works published 1801-1913; and WZ 220-270 is used to provide century groupings for works published before 1801.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9492">'''Naïve physics''' or '''folk physics''' is the untrained human [[perception]] of basic physical [[phenomena]]. In the field of [[artificial intelligence]] the study of naïve [[physics]] is a part of the effort to formalize the [[common knowledge]] of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Hayes|first=Pat|title= The naive physics manifesto|journal=Expert systems in the micro-electronic age|editor=Michie, Donald|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-85224-381-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ideas of folk physics are simplifications, misunderstandings, or misperceptions of well-understood phenomena, incapable of giving useful predictions of detailed experiments, or simply are contradicted by more thorough observations. They may sometimes be true, be true in certain limited cases, be true as a good first approximation to a more complex effect, or predict the same effect but misunderstand the underlying mechanism.

Naïve physics can also be defined as an intuitive understanding all humans have about objects in the physical world.&lt;ref name="goswami"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goswami |first=U. |year=2008 |title=Cognitive Development: the learning brain |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Psychology Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychologists are delving deeper into these phenomena with promising results.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Psychological studies indicate that certain notions of the physical world are innate in all of us.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Examples==
Some examples of naïve physics include commonly understood, intuitive, or everyday-observed rules of nature:

* What goes up must come down
* A dropped object falls straight down
* A solid object cannot pass through another solid object
* A [[vacuum]] sucks things towards it
* An object is either at rest or moving, in an absolute sense
* Two events are either simultaneous or they are not

Many of these and similar ideas formed the basis for the first works in formulating and systematizing physics by [[Aristotle]] and the medieval [[scholasticism|scholastics]] in [[Western civilization]]. In the modern science of physics, they were gradually contradicted by the work of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and others. The idea of [[absolute simultaneity]] survived until 1905, when the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] and its supporting experiments discredited it.

==Psychological research==
The increasing sophistication of technology make possible more research on knowledge acquisition.  Researchers measure physiological responses (like [[heart rate]] or [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]) to quantify reaction to a particular stimulus.  Concrete physiological data is helpful when observing infant behavior, because infants cannot use words to explain things (such as their reactions) the way most adults or older children can.

Research in naïve physics relies on technology to measure eye gaze and reaction time in particular. Through observation, researchers know that infants get [[bored]] looking at the same stimulus after a certain amount of time.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt; That boredom is called [[habituation]]. When an infant is sufficiently habituated to a stimulus, he or she will typically look away, alerting the experimenter to his or her boredom. At this point, the experimenter will introduce another stimulus. The infant will then dishabituate by attending to the new stimulus. In each case, the experimenter measures the time it takes for the infant to habituate to each stimulus.

Researchers infer that the longer the infant takes to habituate to a new stimulus, the more it violates his or her expectations of physical phenomena.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt; When an adult observes an optical illusion that seems physically impossible, he or she will attend to it until it makes sense. Until recently,{{When|date=August 2013}} psychologists believed that our understanding of physical laws emerges strictly from experience. But research shows that infants, who do not yet have such expansive knowledge of the world, have the same extended reaction to events that defy what is physically possible. Such studies conclude that all people are born with an innate ability to understand the physical world.

Smith and Cassati (1994) have reviewed the early history of naïve physics, and especially the role of the Italian psychologist [[Paolo Bozzi]].&lt;ref name="smith&amp;casati"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith//articles/naivephysics.html |last1=Smith |first1=B. | author1link = Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|last2=Casati |first2=R. |year=1994 |title=Naive Physics: An Essay in Ontology |journal=[[Philosophical Psychology]] |volume=7 |number=2 |pages=225–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of experiments===
The basic experimental procedure of a study on naïve physics involves three steps: prediction of the infant's expectation, violation of that expectation, and measurement of the results. As mentioned above, the physically impossible event holds the infant's attention longer, indicating surprise when expectations are violated.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt;

====Solidity====
An experiment that tests an infant's knowledge of solidity involves the impossible event of one solid object passing through another. First, the infant is shown a flat, solid square moving from 0˚ to 180˚ in an arch formation. Next, a solid block is placed in the path of the screen, preventing it from completing its full range of motion. The infant habituates to this event, as it is what anyone would expect. Then, the experimenter creates the impossible event, and the solid screen passes through the solid block. The infant is confused by the event and attends longer than in probable event trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baillargeon | first1 = R. | authorlink = Renee Baillargeon | year = 1994 | title = How Do Infants Learn About the Physical World? | url = | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 133–140 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occlusion====
An occlusion event tests the knowledge that an object exists even if it is not immediately visible. [[Jean Piaget]] originally called this concept [[object permanence]]. When Piaget formed [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|his developmental theory]] in the 1950s, he claimed that object permanence is learned, not innate. The children's game [[Peekaboo|peek-a-boo]] is a classic example of this phenomenon, and one which obscures the true grasp infants have on permanence. To disprove this notion, an experimenter designs an impossible occlusion event. The infant is shown a block and a transparent screen. The infant habituates, then a solid panel is placed in front of the objects to block them from view. When the panel is removed, the block is gone, but the screen remains. The infant is confused because the block has disappeared indicating that he/she understands that objects maintain location in space and do not simply disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baillargeon | first1 = R | year = 2004 | title = Infants' Physical World | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 89–94 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00281.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Containment====
A containment event tests the infant's recognition that an object that is bigger than a container cannot fit completely into that container. [[Elizabeth Spelke]], one of the psychologists who founded the naïve physics movement, identified the continuity principle, which conveys an understanding that objects exist continuously in time and space.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt; Both occlusion and containment experiments hinge on the continuity principle. In the experiment, the infant is shown a tall cylinder and a tall cylindrical container. The experimenter demonstrates that the tall cylinder fits into the tall container, and the infant is bored by the expected physical outcome. The experimenter then places the tall cylinder completely into a much shorter cylindrical container, and the impossible event confuses the infant. Extended attention demonstrates the infant's understanding that containers cannot hold objects that exceed them in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baillargeon | first1 = R. | last2 = Hespos | first2 = S.J. | year = 2001 | title = Infant's Knowledge About Occlusion and Containment Events: A Surprising Discrepancy | url = | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 141–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baillargeon's research===
The published findings of [[Renee Baillargeon]] brought innate knowledge to the forefront in psychological research. Her research method centered on the visual preference technique. Baillargeon and her followers studied how infants show preference to one stimulus over another. Experimenters judge preference by the length of time an infant will stare at a stimulus before habituating. Researchers believe that preference indicates the infant's ability to discriminate between the two events.&lt;ref name="goswami"/&gt;

{{italic title}}'''''Négritude''''' is a framework of critique and literary theory, developed mainly by [[francophone]] intellectuals, writers, and politicians of the [[African diaspora]] during the 1930s. Its initiators included [[Martinique|Martinican]] poet [[Aimé Césaire]], [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] (the first [[President]] of [[Senegal]]), and [[Léon Damas]] of [[French Guiana]]. ''Négritude'' intellectuals disavowed [[colonialism]], and argued for the importance of a [[Pan-African]] racial identity among people of African descent worldwide. The intellectuals employed [[Marxism|Marxist]] political philosophy, in the black radical tradition. The writers generally used a realist literary style, and some say they were also influenced somewhat by the [[Surrealist]] stylistics. In 1932, the manifesto "Murderous Humanitarianism" was signed by prominent Surrealists, including the Martinicans Pierre Yoyotte and J. M. Monnerot.

==Etymology==
''{{wiktfr|Négritude}}'' is a constructed noun from the 1930s based upon the French word ''nègre'', which, as its English counterpart was derogatory and had a different meaning from "black man". The movement's use of the word négritude is a way of re-imagining the word as an [[emic]] form of empowerment. The term was first used in its present sense by Césaire, in the third issue of ''[[L'Étudiant noir]]'', a magazine which he had started in [[Paris]] with fellow students Léopold Senghor and Léon Damas, as well as [[Gilbert Gratiant]], [[Leonard Sainville]], [[Louis T. Achille]], [[Aristide Maugée]], and [[Paulette Nardal]]. ''L'Étudiant noir'' also includes Césaire's first published work, ''Conscience Raciale et Révolution Sociale'' with the heading "Les Idées" and the rubric "Négreries", which is notable for its disavowal of [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] as a valid strategy for resistance and for its use of the word ''{{wiktfr|nègre}}'' as a positive term. The problem with assimilation was that one assimilated into a culture that considered African culture to be barbaric and unworthy of being seen as "civilized". The assimilation into this culture would have been seen as an implicit acceptance of this view. ''Nègre'' previously had been used mainly in a pejorative sense. Césaire deliberately incorporated this derogatory word into the name of his philosophy.

==Influences==
In 1885, [[Haiti]]an [[anthropologist]] [[Anténor Firmin]] published an early work ''De l'Égalité des Races Humaines'' (On the Equality of Human Races), which was published as a rebuttal to [[France|French]] writer Count [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''Essai sur l'inegalite des Races Humaines'' (''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]''). Firmin influenced [[Jean Price-Mars]], the initiator of Haitian [[ethnology]] and developer of the concept of [[Indigenism]], and 20th-century American anthropologist [[Melville Herskovits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Fluehr-Lobban|first=Carolyn|year=2005|title=Anténor Firmin and Haiti’s contribution to anthropology|url=http://gradhiva.revues.org/302|journal=Gradhiva&amp;nbsp;– musée du quai Branly|issue=2005: Haïti et l'anthropologie|pages=95–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black intellectuals have historically been proud of Haiti due to its [[slave revolution]] commanded by [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] during the 1790s. Césaire spoke, thus, of Haiti as being "where négritude stood up for the first time".

Other diverse thinkers include [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[André Breton]], [[René Maran]], and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Ngo-Ngijol Banoum, Bertrade, [http://exhibitions.nypl.org/africanaage/essay-negritude.html "Négritude"], Africana Age.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Harlem Renaissance]], a literary style developed in Harlem in Manhattan during the 1920s and 1930s, influenced the Negritude philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Murphey, David [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=28628450&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site "Birth of a Nation? The Origins of Senegalese Literature in French"], ''Research in African Literature'' 39.1 (2008): 48–69. Web. 9 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Harlem Renaissance]]'s writers, including [[Langston Hughes]] and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], addressed the themes of "noireism" and race relations.

==Development during the 20th century==
During the 1920s and 1930s, young black students and scholars, primarily from France's colonies and territories, assembled in Paris, where they were introduced to writers of the [[Harlem Renaissance]] by [[Paulette Nardal]] and her sister Jane. The Nardal sisters contributed to the Negritude discussions in their writings and also owned the Clamart Salon, a tea-shop venue of the French-Black intelligentsia where Negritude philosophy was often discussed. Paulette Nardal and the Haitian Dr. Leo Sajou initiated ''La revue du Monde Noir'' (1931–32), a literary journal published in English and French, which attempted to appeal to African and Caribbean intellectuals in Paris. This Harlem association was shared by the parallel development of ''[[negrismo]]'' in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking Caribbean region.

Although each of the initiators had his own ideas about the purpose and styles of la Négritude, the philosophy was characterized generally by opposition to colonialism, denunciation of Europe's alleged inhumanity, and rejection of Western domination and ideas. The movement also appears to have had some [[Heidegger]]ian strands in the sense that its goal was to achieve blacks' "being-in-the-world", to emphasize that blacks did have a history and a worthy culture capable of standing alongside the cultures of other countries as equals. Also important was the acceptance of and pride in being black and a celebration of African history, traditions, and beliefs. Their literary style was [[realism (arts)|realistic]] and they cherished [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas.

Motivation for the Negritude movement was a result of [[Aimé Césaire]]’s, [[Leopold Senghor]]’s, and [[Leon Damas]]’s dissatisfaction, disgust, and personal conflict over the state of black French experience in France. All three shared a personal sense of revolt for the racism and colonial injustices that plagued their world and their French education. Senghor refused to believe that the purpose of his education was "to build Christianity and civilization in his soul where there was only paganism and barbarism before". Césaire's disgust came as embarrassment when he was accused by some of the people of the Caribbean as having nothing to do with the people of Africa—whom they saw as savages. They separated themselves from Africa and proclaimed themselves as civilized. He denounced the writers from the Caribbean as "intellectually... corrupt and literarily nourished with white decadence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2014|title = Négritude|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/negritude/|date = 2014|first = Souleymane Bachir|last = Diagne|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damas believed this because of the pride these writers would take when a white person could read their whole book and not be able to tell the author's complexion.

Césaire was a poet, playwright, and politician from [[Martinique]]. He studied in Paris, where he discovered the black community and "rediscovered Africa". He saw la Négritude as the fact of being black, acceptance of this fact, and appreciation of the history and culture, and of black people. It is important to note that for Césaire, this emphasis on the acceptance of the fact of "blackness" was the means by which the "decolonization of the mind" could be achieved. According to him, western imperialism was responsible for the inferiority complex of blacks. He sought to recognize the collective colonial experience of Blacks—the slave trade and plantation system. Césaire's ideology was especially important during the early years of la Négritude.

Neither Césaire—who after returning to Martinique after his studies was elected mayor of [[Fort de France]], the capital, and a representative of Martinique in France's Parliament—nor Senghor in Senegal envisaged political independence from France. Négritude would, according to Senghor, enable Blacks in French lands to have a "seat at the give and take [French] table as equals". However the French eventually presented Senegal and its other African colonies with independence.

Poet and the later first president of Sénégal, Senghor used la Négritude to work toward a universal valuation of African people. He advocated a modern incorporation of the expression and celebration of traditional African customs and ideas. This interpretation of la Négritude tended to be the most common, particularly during later years.

Damas was a [[French Guiana|French Guianese]] poet and National Assembly member. He had a militant style of defending ''"black qualities"'' and rejected any kind of reconciliation with caucasians. Two particular anthologies were pivotal to the movement, which would serve as manifestos for the movement. One was published by Damas in 1946, Poètes d'expression française 1900–1945. Senghor would then go on to publish ''Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache de langue française'' in 1948. Damas’s introduction to the anthology and the anthology was meant to be a sort of manifesto for the movement, but Senghor's own anthology eventually took that role. Though it would be the “Preface” written by French philosopher and public intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre for the anthology which would propel Negritude into the broader intellectual conversation.

As a manifesto for the Negritude movement Damas’ introduction was more political and cultural in nature. A distinctive feature of Damas’s anthology and beliefs was that Damas felt that his message was one for the colonized in general, and included poets from Indochina and Madagascar. This is sharply in contrast to Senghor’s anthology which would be published two years later. In the introduction Damas proclaimed that now was the age where "the colonized man becomes aware of his rights and of his duties as a writer, as a novelist or a storyteller, an essayist or a poet." Damas explicitly outlines the themes of the anthology. He says, "Poverty, illiteracy, exploitation of man by man, social and political racism suffered by the black or the yellow, forced labor, inequalities, lies, resignation, swindles, prejudices, complacencies, cowardice, failure, crimes committed in the name of liberty, of equality, of fraternity, that is the theme of this indigenous poetry in French." Damas’ introduction was indeed a calling and affirmation for a distinct cultural identification.

==Reception==
In 1948, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] analyzed the ''négritude'' philosophy in an essay called "Orphée Noir" ("[[Black Orpheus (essay)|Black Orpheus]]")&lt;ref&gt;The title subsequently inspired the name of the Nigerian magazine ''[[Black Orpheus (magazine)|Black Orpheus]]'' — see Peter Benson, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5gIQK1isP6cC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=black+orpheus+magazine+title+sartre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PPgtk5Wa0H&amp;sig=Jhzn6SKrNxrU9pdtPcUhues6o2E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidpI23nenNAhULKMAKHVzxA4gQ6AEITDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20orpheus%20magazine%20title%20sartre&amp;f=false ''Black Orpheus, Transition, and Modern Cultural Awakening in Africa''], University of California Press, 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; that served as the introduction to a volume of francophone poetry named ''Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache'', compiled by Léopold Senghor. In this essay, Sartre characterizes ''négritude'' as the opposite of colonial racism in a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] [[dialectic]] and with it he helped to introduce Négritude issues to French intellectuals. In his opinion, ''négritude'' was an "anti-racist racism" (''racisme antiraciste''), a strategy with a final goal of racial unity.

Négritude was criticized by some black writers during the 1960s as insufficiently militant. [[Keorapetse Kgositsile]] said that the term Négritude was based too much on blackness according to a caucasian aesthetic, and was unable to define a new kind of perception of African-ness that would free black people and black art from caucasian conceptualizations altogether.

The Nigerian dramatist, poet, and novelist [[Wole Soyinka]] opposed Négritude. He believed that by deliberately and outspokenly being proud of their ethnicity, black people were automatically on the defensive. According to some, he said: ''"Un tigre ne proclame pas sa tigritude, il saute sur sa proie"'' (French: A tiger doesn't proclaim its tigerness; it jumps on its prey).[[Citation needed|&lt;sup&gt;Citation needed&lt;/sup&gt;]] But in fact, Soyinka wrote in a 1960 essay for the ''Horn'', “the duiker will not paint ‘duiker’ on his beautiful back to proclaim his duikeritude; you’ll know him by his elegant leap.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maduakor|first=Obiajuru|date=1986|title=Soyinka as a Literary Critic|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3819421|journal=Research in African Literatures|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jimsligh.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/tigritude/|title=Tigritude|date=2013-08-05|work=This Analog Life|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long period of silence there has been a renaissance of Negritude developed by scholars such as [[Souleymane Bachir Diagne]] (Columbia), Donna Jones (Berkeley),&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.berkeley.edu/profiles/42 "Donna V. Jones"], English Department, University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cheikh Thiam]] (Ohio State) who all continue the work of [[Abiola Irele]]. Cheikh Thiam's book is the only book-length study of Negritude as philosophy. It develops Diagne's reading of Negritude as a philosophy of art, and Jones' presentation of Negritude as a [[lebensphilosophie]].

==Other uses==

American physician [[Benjamin Rush]], a signer of the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|United States Declaration of Independence]] and early abolitionist, used the term ''negritude'' to imagine a rhetorical "disease" which he said was a mild form of leprosy, the only cure of which was to become white. This early use of the term may not have been known by the Francophone blacks who developed the philosophy of Negritude during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Novelist [[Norman Mailer]] used the term to describe boxer [[George Foreman]]'s physical and psychological presence in his book ''The Fight'', a journalistic treatment of the legendary Ali vs. Foreman "[[Rumble in the Jungle]]" bout in [[Kinshasa]], [[Zaire]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) in October 1974.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''''Peace dividend''''' is a political slogan popularized by US President [[George H.W. Bush]] and UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the early 1990s, purporting to describe the [[economics|economic]] benefit of a decrease in defense spending.  It is used primarily in discussions relating to the [[guns versus butter theory]].  The term was frequently used at the end of the [[Cold War]], when many [[Western world|Western nations]] significantly cut [[military spending]] (such as Britain's [[Options for Change]] defence review).

While economies do undergo a [[recession]] after the end of a major conflict as the economy is forced to adjust and retool, a "peace dividend" refers to a potential long-term benefit as budgets for defense spending are assumed  to be at least partially redirected to social programs and/or a decrease in taxation rates.  The existence of a peace dividend in real economies is still debated, but some research points to its reality.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjeev Gupta, Benedict Clements, Rina Bhattacharya, and Shamit Chakravarti (2002), [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2002/12/gupta.htm "The Elusive Peace Dividend"] at ''[[Finance &amp; Development]]'', a quarterly magazine of the IMF.&lt;/ref&gt;

A political discussion about the peace dividend resulting from the end of the [[Cold War]] involves a debate about which countries have actually scaled back military spending and which have not. The scale back in defense spending was mainly noticeable in [[Western Europe]] and in the [[Russian Federation]]. The [[United States]], whose military spending was rapidly reducing between 1985 and 1993 and remained flat between 1993 and 1999,&lt;ref name="priorities"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalpriorities.org/u_s_military_spending|title=U.S. military spending|publisher=[[National Priorities Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; has dramatically increased it after [[September 11, 2001]] to fund conflicts like the [[War on Terror]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[War in Iraq]].

==Other uses==
"Peace dividend" can also refer to the improved economy in [[Northern Ireland]] after the signing of the [[Good Friday Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/06/us-irish-economy-idUSL0283780420080506 |title=Northern Ireland looks to make peace dividend pay |first=Jonathan |last=Saul |work=Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=22 October 2012 |quote=Northern Ireland's authorities hope that era, which claimed over 3,600 lives and was known as [[The Troubles]], is now closed, and they say they are already reaping a peace dividend. In the past 10 years, over 100,000 jobs have been created, and the unemployment rate now stands at around 4.2 percent, below the UK average of about 5.2 percent. Economic growth in Northern Ireland averaged around 2.9 to 3 percent from 1996 to 2007, which was above the United Kingdom's average of around 2.8 percent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Les princesses combinées''''' ("the combined princesses") was a group of French aristocrats during the reign of [[Louis XVI of France]].
Some authors named two, three or four members of the [[clique|coterie]].
They were:
* [[Adelaïde-Felicité-Henriette d'Hénin]], [[princess of Hénin]] (1750-1820?)
* [[Anne Louise Marie de Beauvau]], [[princess of Poix]]
* the [[duchess of Lauzun]], later [[duchess of Biron]]
* the [[princess of Bouillon]]
* the [[countess of Simiane]]

They were close friends since childhood.
They followed [[Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]] and the [[Encyclopedistes]], supported each other and were discreet in their love affairs, contrasting with other ladies of the court.
Their social circle included the [[De Lameth]] brothers, the [[duke of Guines]] and [[Henriette-Lucy, Marquise de La Tour du Pin Gouvernet]].

'''Reality tunnel''' is a theory that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from [[belief]]s and [[experience]]s, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence "[[Truth]] is in the eye of the beholder".  It is similar to the idea of [[representative realism]], and was coined by [[Timothy Leary]] (1920–1996). It was further expanded on by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (1932-2007), who wrote about the idea extensively in his 1983 book ''Prometheus Rising''.

Wilson and Leary co-wrote a chapter in Leary's 1988 book ''Neuropolitique'' (a revised edition of the 1977 book ''Neuropolitics''), in which they explained further: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The gene-pool politics which monitor power struggles among terrestrial humanity are transcended in this info-world, i.e. seen as static, artificial charades. One is neither coercively manipulated into another's territorial reality nor forced to struggle against it with reciprocal game-playing (the usual soap opera dramatics). One simply elects, consciously, whether or not to share the other's reality tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;Neuropolitique, New Falcon Publications, 2006, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

==Considerations==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every kind of ignorance in the world all results from not realizing that our perceptions are gambles. We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don't even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality. – Robert Anton Wilson&lt;ref name="youtube video"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Real Reality|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZBDUJ0yiVg|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ambud-raw&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Robert Anton|title=Maybe Logic: The Lives And Ideas Of Robert Anton Wilson -- Illustrated Interview|url=http://www.american-buddha.com/maybelogictranscript.htm|publisher=American Buddha|year=2003|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea does not necessarily imply that there is no [[objective truth]]; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]], prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the [[fundamentalist Christian]] reality tunnel or the [[metaphysical naturalism|ontological naturalist]] reality tunnel.

A parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of [[confirmation bias]]—the human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the "one true objective reality", Robert Anton Wilson emphasizes that each person's reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not.

Wilson—like [[John C. Lilly]] and many others—relates that through various techniques one can break down old reality tunnels and impose new reality tunnels by removing old filters and replacing them with new ones, with new perspectives on reality—at will. This is attempted through various processes of deprogramming using [[neuro-linguistic programming]], [[cybernetics]], [[hypnosis]], [[biofeedback]] devices, [[meditation]], controlled use of [[hallucinogens]], and forcibly acting out other reality tunnels. Thus, it is believed one's reality tunnel can be widened to take full advantage of human potential and experience reality on more positive levels. Robert Anton Wilson's ''[[Prometheus Rising]]''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Anton Wilson, ''Prometheus Rising''. New Falcon Publications, 1983, 262pp. {{ISBN|1-56184-056-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is (among other things) a guidebook to the exploration of various reality tunnels.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We don't see things as they are; we see them as we are. – [[Anaïs Nin]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] used the word ''gloss'' to describe how the mind perceives reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nagualism.com/carlos-castaneda-interview-psychology-today.html Sam Keen, Castaneda interview, Psychology Today, Dec. 1972]&lt;/ref&gt; We are taught, he theorised, how to "put the world together" by others who subscribe to a [[consensus reality]]. "The curious world of Talcott Parsons was where society was a system, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} interactive subsystems adhering to a certain set of unwritten rules."&lt;ref&gt;Roger A. Salerno, ''Beyond the enlightenment: lives and thoughts of social theorists''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p.179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons, The Social System. New York: The Free Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[meme]] is another source of ''gloss''; it is "transmitted from one mind to another through speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena." Because we're social creatures, there are reasons for us to adopt some [[social currency|social currencies]].

In line with [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] thought,&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Alper, ''The "God" Part of the Brain: A Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God''. Sourcebooks, Inc., 2008, p.50f.&lt;br/&gt;
"The human mind, Kant contended, must be born, not as a clean slate, but with built-in 'modes of perception' that work to organize the multitude of information our sense organs are constantly imparting to us. Without such built-in processing mechanisms, we would experience reality as an unintelligible jumble of [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s."
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the work of [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], studies have indeed shown&lt;ref&gt;[http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/how_do_brains_filter_data/ Seed, ''How do brains filter data?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "nspc"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14096-party-chat-brain-filter-discovered.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&amp;nsref=news7_head_dn14096 New Scientist: ''{{'}}Party chat' brain filter discovered'']
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7132829.stm BBC, ''Brain 'irrelevance filter' found''], 10 Dec 2007. Retrieved 10-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} that our brains "filter" the data coming from our senses. This "filtering" is largely unconscious and may be influenced—more-or-less in many ways, in societies and in individuals—by biology,&lt;ref&gt;Example, [[autism]]. Autistics are unable "to understand the social communication of neurotypicals", and "Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1792 Bryn Mawr: Serendip, ''Through Different Eyes: How People with Autism Experience the World'']

An everyday example of such filtering is our ability to follow a conversation, or read, without being distracted by surrounding conversations, once called the [[cocktail party effect]].&lt;ref name= "nspc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, E. C. (1953) Some experiments on the recognition of speech, with one and with two ears. Journal of Acoustical Society of America 25(5), 975-979.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1986 book ''Waking Up'',&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tart, ''Waking Up: Overcoming the Obstacles to Human Potential''. iUniverse, Inc., 2001, 344pp. {{ISBN|0-595-19664-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rheingold.com/texts/reviews/waking.html] Review by [[Howard Rheingold]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Tart]]—an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] and [[parapsychologist]] known for his psychological work on the nature of consciousness—introduced the phrase "consensus trance" to the lexicon. Tart likened normal waking consciousness to hypnotic trance. He discussed how each of us is from birth inducted to the trance of the society around us.&lt;ref&gt;J. Jeffrey Means, Mary Ann Nelson, ''Trauma &amp; evil: healing the wounded soul''. Fortress Press, 2000, p.30-32. {{ISBN|0-8006-3270-2}}.&lt;br/&gt;
"Awakening from the consensus trances in which we are stuck as a result of living in a violent society is rare."&lt;/ref&gt; Tart noted both similarities and differences between hypnotic trance induction and consensus trance induction. (See [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]).

Some disciplines—[[Zen]] for example, and monastic schools such as [[Sufism]]—seek to overcome such conditioned realities by returning to less thoughtful and channeled states of mind.

[[Constructivism (psychological school)|Constructivism]] is a modern psychological response to reality-tunneling.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Eriksen, Garrett McAuliffe, ''Teaching counselors and therapists: constructivist and developmental course design''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. pp. 366. {{ISBN|0-89789-795-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For Wilson, a fully functioning human ought to be aware of their reality tunnel, and be able to keep it flexible enough to accommodate, and to some degree empathize with, different reality tunnels, different "game rules", different cultures.... Constructivist thinking is the exercise of metacognition to become aware of our reality tunnels or labyrinths and the elements that "program" them. Constructivist thinking should, ideally, decrease the chance that we will confuse our map of the world with the actual world.... [This philosophy] is currently expressed in many Eastern consciousness-exploration techniques.&lt;ref&gt;R. Elliott Ingersoll and Cecile Brennan, in Eriksen, McAuliffe 2001, p.336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is Lacan's distinction between "[[The Real]]" and the "Symbolic". Lacan argued that the Real is the imminent unified reality which is mediated through symbols that allow it to be parsed into intelligible and differentiated segments. The symbolic, which is primarily subconscious, is further abstracted into the Imaginary (our actual beliefs and understandings of reality). These two orders ultimately shape the way we come to perceive reality.

[[File:Rosa Peace 1945.jpg|thumb|250px|''Rosa'' 'Madame A. Meilland' (Peace)]]

The '''Peace''' [[rose]], formally '''''Rosa'' 'Madame A. Meilland'''', is a well-known and successful [[garden rose]]. By 1992, over one&amp;nbsp;hundred&amp;nbsp;million plants of this [[hybrid tea rose|hybrid tea]] had been sold. The [[cultivar]] has large flowers of a light yellow to cream color, slightly flushed at the petal edges with crimson-pink. It is hardy and vigorous and relatively resistant to disease, making it popular in gardens as well as in the floral trade.

It was developed by [[France|French]] horticulturist [[Francis Meilland]] in the years 1935 to 1939. When Meilland foresaw the German invasion of France, he sent cuttings to friends in Italy, Turkey, Germany, and the United States to protect the new rose. It is said that it was sent to the US on the last plane available before the German invasion, where it was safely propagated by the [[Conard Pyle Co.]] during the war.&lt;ref name=meilland&gt;{{cite book|title=Meilland, a Life in Roses |last1=Meilland |first1=Alain |last2=Lambert |first2=Gilles |pages=65–71 |date=April 1984 |publisher=Southern Illinois Univ Pr |isbn=0809311119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Gloria Dei Bamberg.jpg|thumb|250px]]
The cultivar was hybridized in 1935, receiving the number 3-35-40 (the third hybridization in 1935, and the 40th cultivar selected for test proliferation). As those first tests produced beautiful flowers in autumn of 1936, the first no. 3-35-40 were grown in Meilland's rose fields in June 1939. That summer, cuttings were sent to partners in other countries. According to Meilland's records, 'Madame A. Meilland' was hybridized from the hybrid tea 'Margaret McGredy' and an unnamed seedling.&lt;ref name=blv&gt;{{cite book |title=Die BLV Rosen Enzyklopädie |publisher= BLV |author= Robert Markley |page=27 |ISBN= 978-3-8354-0272-0 |language= German |trans-title=The BLV Encyclopedia of Roses|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==
Because Meilland had sent out his cuttings just before the war, communication between the cultivators was not possible, which is why the rose received different names. In France, Francis and Alain Meilland decided to call the cultivar 'Madame A. Meilland', in honor of Francis' deceased mother, Alain Meilland's wife Claudia.&lt;ref name=blv /&gt; This is the formal cultivar name. Other names are considered by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants as trade or [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants#Trade designations|selling name]]s. In Italy it was called {{tdes|Gioia}} (Italian for "joy"), in Germany {{tdes|Gloria Dei}} (Latin for "glory of God") and in the US, Sweden, and Norway {{tdes|Peace}}.

The rose eventually became known as {{tdes|Peace}}. In early 1945 rose grower Meilland wrote to Field Marshal Alan Brooke (later Viscount [[Alanbrooke]]) to thank him for his key part in the liberation of France and to ask if Brooke would give his name to the rose. Brooke declined saying that, though he was honored to be asked, his name would soon be forgotten and a much better and more enduring name would be "Peace".

The adoption of the trade name "Peace" was publicly announced in the [[United States]] on 29 April 1945 by the introducers, [[Conard Pyle Co.]] This was the very day that Berlin fell, a day considered a turning point in the [[Second World War]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=meilland /&gt; Later that year Peace roses were given to each of the delegations at the inaugural meeting of the [[United Nations]] in [[San Francisco]], each with a note that read:

:"We hope the 'Peace' rose will influence men’s thoughts for everlasting [[world peace]]".

[[Peter Beales]], English rose grower and expert, said in his book ''Roses'':

:"'Peace', without doubt, is the finest Hybrid Tea ever raised and it will remain a standard variety forever".

== Description ==
'Mme A. Meilland' forms elegant buds that open to large, cupped flowers with a high-centered form and an average diameter of {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}}. Their color is a combination of pale yellow and crimson edges that depends on the location, the weather and changes as the flower fades. The durable flowers are very full, with 40 to 43 petals, survive rainy periods, and have a sweet and fruity fragrance that varies in its strength from mild to strong.&lt;ref name=RHS_encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen - die große Enzyklopädie |publisher= Dorling Kindersley |author= Charles and Brigid Quest-Ritson |page=263 |ISBN=978-3-8310-1734-8 |language=German |trans-title=RHS Encyclopedia of Roses |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultivar flowers continuously throughout the season up to the first frost.

The vigorous shrub grows {{convert|120|to|200|cm|ft|abbr=on|frac=2}} high and {{convert|90|to|125|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} wide, is winter hardy down to {{convert|−23|C|abbr=on|disp=or}} ([[USDA zone]] 6), half-shade tolerant, and disease resistant. The large, glossy leaves are very dark and leathery. 'Mme A. Meilland' is very versatile—it is used as cut rose and as garden rose, solitarily or in groups, as standard rose to {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high, or in containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alles über Rosen |publisher= Eugen Ulmer KG |author= Klaus-Jürgen Strobel |page=208 |ISBN= 3-8001-4471-9 |language= German |trans-title=Everything about Roses|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
'Mme A. Meilland' has been granted numerous awards, starting with the selection as ''Most Beautiful French Rose'' in Lyon in 1942, gold medals in Lyon (1942), Portland (1944), The Hague (1965) and from the [[Royal National Rose Society]] in 1947. In 1944, it was included in the All-America Rose Selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helpmefind.com/rose/pl.php?n=2203&amp;tab=18 |title='Peace' rose Awards |publisher=HelpMeFind |date= |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, it was the first cultivar to be granted the highest award a rose can be granted when it was selected as ''World's Favorite Rose'' and included into the [[Rose Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrose.org/awards/hof/hof.asp |title=Rose Hall of Fame |publisher=World Federation of Rose Societies |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports and hybrid offspring ==
As an often cultivated plant, several [[sport (botany)|sports]] of 'Mme A. Meilland' are known. 'Climbing Peace' ([[W. Kordes' Söhne|Kordes]] 1951) has slightly bigger flowers but flowers less well, 'Chicago Peace' (Johnston 1962) differs mainly in its richer colors with a mixture of crimson and apricot, while 'Kronenbourg' (syn. 'Flaming Peace', McGredy 1966) has red petals with yellow backs, creating an interesting contrast.&lt;ref name=RHS_encyclopedia /&gt;

It is also used in the hybridization of new cultivars, and played a role in the development of well known cultivars such as [[Rosa 'Garden Party'|'Garden Party']] (Swim, 1959), [[Rosa 'Super Star'|'Super Star']] (Tantau, 1960), and 'Pullman Orient Express' (Lim &amp; Twomey, 1991).

It may also refer to ''[[Northern Catalonia]]'' ({{italics correction|{{lang-ca|Catalunya Nord|links=no}}}}) or ''[[French Catalonia]]'', the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers. A 1998 survey found that 34% of respondents stated they speak Catalan, and a further 21% understand it.

==History==
Its name is derived from Ruscino (Rosceliona, Castel Rossello), a small fortified place near modern-day [[Perpignan]] where Gaulish chieftains met to consider [[Hannibal]]'s request for a conference. The region formed part of the Roman province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] from 121 BC to AD 462, when it was ceded with the rest of [[Septimania]] to the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] [[Theodoric II]]. His successor, [[Amalaric]], on his defeat by [[Clovis I]] in 531, retired to [[Hispania]], leaving a governor in [[Septimania]].

In 719, the [[Saracens]] crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and maintained political hegemony of Septimania until their final defeat in 759 by [[Pepin the Short]], who went on to occupy Roussillon after [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|conquering Narbonne]]. Roussillon was occupied by the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]] in 760. On the invasion of Hispania in 778, [[Charlemagne]] found the [[Marca Hispanica]] wasted by war and the inhabitants settled in the mountains. He granted some lands in the plains to Visigothic refugees from [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Hispania]] and founded several monasteries. In 792, the Saracens again invaded France, but they were repulsed by Count [[William of Gellone|Guillaume]] of [[County of Toulouse|Toulouse]] - regent of the child [[Louis the Pious]], King of [[Kingdom of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] - whose hegemony extended into [[History of Catalonia|Catalonia]].

The different portions of his kingdom in time grew into [[Allod|allodial fiefs]] and, in 893, [[Sunyer II]] became the first hereditary [[Count]] of [[County of Roussillon|Roussillon]]. But his rule only extended over the eastern part of what became the later province. The western part, the [[Cerdanya]] (French, Cerdagne), was ruled in 900 by [[Miro the Elder|Miró]] as first count, and one of his grandsons, Bernat, became the first hereditary count of the middle portion, or [[Besalú]]. The Counts of Roussillon were allied to their cousins the Counts of [[County of Empúries|Empúries]] in a centuries-long conflict with the surrounding great nobles. Count [[Girard I]] participated in the [[First Crusade]] in the following of [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond IV]] of [[Count of Toulouse|Toulouse]], and was one of the first to set foot in [[Jerusalem]] when it was stormed by the Crusaders in 1099. At the beginning of the 12th century, the prestige of the [[County of Barcelona|Counts of Barcelona]] began to rise to such a height that the Counts of Roussillon had no choice but to swear fealty to them.

In 1111, [[Ramon Berenguer III]], Count of Barcelona, inherited the fief of Besalú, to which was added in 1117 [[Cerdanya]]. The possession of Roussillon by its last count, [[Girard II of Roussillon|Girard II]], was challenged by his illegitimate brothers. To ensure that his brothers would not inherit his territories, in his will Girard II left all his lands to [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], who took possession in 1172. Under the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese monarchs]], economic and demographic growth of the region continued, and [[Collioure]] ({{lang-ca|Cotlliure}}), the port of [[Perpignan]], became an important locus of [[Mediterranean]] trade.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

As the French and Spanish crowns grew in power, the region of Roussillon, forming part of the border between them, was frequently a site of military conflict. By the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)]], [[Louis IX of France]] formally surrendered sovereignty over Roussillon and his claim to the title of Count of Barcelona to the Crown of Aragon, recognizing a centuries-old reality.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[James I of Aragon]] had wrested the [[Balearic Isles]] from the [[Moors]] and joined these islands with Roussillon to create the [[Kingdom of Majorca]], with its capital at Perpignan. In 1276, James I granted this kingdom to his son, who became [[James II of Majorca|James II]]. The subsequent disputes of this monarch with his brother [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]] were exploited by [[Philip III of France]] in his quarrel with Peter III for the crown of the [[Two Sicilies]]. Philip III espoused James II's cause and led an army into Aragon but, retreating, died at [[Perpignan]] in 1285. Lacking the resources to continue the struggle, James then became reconciled to his brother Peter, and in 1311 the former was succeeded by his son Sanç I, or [[Sancho I of Majorca|Sancho I]], who founded the cathedral of Perpignan shortly before his death in 1324. His successor, [[James III of Majorca]], refused to do homage to [[Philip VI of France]] for the seigneury of [[Montpellier]], and applied to [[Peter IV of Aragon]] for aid. Peter not only refused, but declared war and seized [[Majorca]] and Roussillon in 1344.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The province was now reunited to the [[Crown of Aragon]], and it enjoyed peace until 1462. In that year, the disputes between [[John II of Aragon]] and [[Charles, Prince of Viana|his son]] over the [[Kingdom of Navarre|Crown of Navarre]] spurred [[Louis XI of France]] to support John against his subjects, who had risen in revolt. The province, having been pledged as collateral to Louis for 300,000 crowns, was occupied by French troops until 1493, when [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] evacuated the region as part of a settlement with the [[Catholic Monarchs]] ([[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I]] of the [[Crown of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] of the [[Crown of Aragon]], they were second-cousins, creators of the [[House of Trastámara|Trastamara]] dynasty that ruled over the two Crowns).

During a subsequent war between France and the Trastamara dynasty (1496–1498), the people suffered equally from the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] garrisons and the French invaders.

The [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] dynasty took control of both the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1516 and the two crowns were for the first time ruled by the same physical person. This was under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (called Charles I of Spain), grandson of the Catholic Monarchs.

The dislike caused by the [[Castile (historical region)|Castilians]] during the Trastamara rule was effaced in the pride of sharing the glory of the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. When [[Perpignan]] was [[Siege of Perpignan (1542)|besieged]] by the forces of [[Henry II of France|Henry]], [[Dauphin of France]] in 1542, the inhabitants were loyal to Charles V. Perpignan earned the royal sobriquet of "Fedelissima" ("Most Faithful City").

When the [[Catalans]] rose against the Spanish Crown in 1641, [[Louis XIII of France]] entered the conflict on the side of the former. After a protracted war, the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) secured [[Languedoc-Roussillon|Roussillon]] and part of the [[Cerdanya]] (Cerdagne) to the French crown, creating the French province of Roussillon.

The next fifty years saw a concerted effort by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] both to ensure the political allegiance of his new subjects and to alter their cultural identity.''' '''He was''' '''successful in the former but failed in the latter. Outside the capital of [[Perpignan]], [[Catalan language|Roussillon]] remained distinctly [[Catalonia|Catalan]] in outlook and culture until the late nineteenth century, when industrialization began to replace Catalan identity with French.

During the [[French Revolution]], the [[Ancien Régime]] province of Roussillon was abolished and a new department, the Department of Pyrénées-Orientales, was created instead. This department corresponds roughly to the old Roussillon, with the addition of the [[comarca]] of [[Fenouillèdes]]. [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] is the name by which this department is officially known in France. The old name of Roussillon did contribute to the French ''[[regions of France|région]]'' of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]].

[[File:Maria Magdalene praying.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Mary Magdalene]]'', after a painting by [[Ary Scheffer]]: the gesture now appears theatrical and inviting a sentimental response]]
'''Sentimentality''' originally indicated the reliance on feelings as a guide to truth, but current usage defines it as an appeal to shallow, uncomplicated emotions at the expense of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Serafin and Bendixen, p. 1014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moral sense theory|Sentimentalism in philosophy]] is a view in [[meta-ethics]] according to which morality is somehow grounded in moral sentiments or emotions. [[Sentimentalism (literature)|Sentimentalism in literature]] is both a device used to induce a tender emotional response disproportionate to the situation at hand,&lt;ref&gt;[[I. A. Richards]] gave just such a quantitative definition: "a response is sentimental if it is too great for the occasion." He added, "We cannot, obviously judge that any response is sentimental in this sense unless we take careful account of the situation" (Richards, p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt; (and thus to substitute heightened and generally uncritical feeling for normal ethical and intellectual judgments), and a heightened reader response willing to invest previously prepared emotions to respond disproportionately to a literary situation.&lt;ref&gt;This was essentially the defining criterion of "sentimental" discovered in a dozen basic handbooks by Wilkie (p. 564f); Wilkie appends some textbook definitions.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A sentimentalist", [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote, "is one who desires to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it."&lt;ref&gt;Wilde 1905&lt;/ref&gt; In James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Stephen Dedalus sends Buck Mulligan a telegram that reads "The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done." &lt;ref&gt;Jay Michael Dickson, "Defining the Sentamentalist in ''Ulysses''," ''James Joyce Quarterly'', Volume 44, Number 1, Fall 2006, pp. 19-37&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Baldwin]] considered that "Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion, is the mark of dishonesty, the inability to feel...the mask of cruelty".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Berlant, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[This Side of Paradise]] by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] contrasts sentimentalists and romantics with Amory Blaine telling Rosalind, “I'm not sentimental--I'm as romantic as you are. The idea, you know, is that the sentimental person thinks things will last--the romantic person has a desperate confidence that they won't.” &lt;ref&gt;F. Scott Fitzgerald, ''This Side of Paradise'', Book Two, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th-century origins==

In the mid-18th century, a querulous lady had complained to [[Samuel Richardson|Richardson]]: "What, in your opinion, is the meaning of the word ''sentimental'', so much in vogue among the polite...Everything clever and agreeable is comprehended in that word...such a one is a ''sentimental'' man; we were a ''sentimental'' party".&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; What she was observing was the way the term was becoming a European obsession&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; - part of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] drive to foster the individual's capacity to recognise virtue at a visceral level.&lt;ref&gt;Berlant, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Everywhere in the sentimental novel or the sentimental comedy, "lively and effusive emotion is celebrated as evidence of a good heart".&lt;ref name="Ousby, p. 845"&gt;Ousby, p. 845&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosophers saw sentimentality as a cure for social isolation;&lt;ref&gt;Wheen p. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adam Smith]] indeed considered that "the poets and romance writers, who best paint...domestic affections, [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Voltaire]]; Richardson, [[Marivaux|Maurivaux]] and [[Marie Jeanne Riccoboni|Riccoboni]]; are, in such cases, much better instructors than [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nicholas Phillipson, ''Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life'' (2011) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoics.

By the close of the century, however, a reaction had occurred against what had come to be considered sentimental excess, by then (and perhaps still now) seen{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} as false and self-indulgent - especially after [[Schiller]]'s 1795 division of poets into two classes, the "naive" and the "sentimental" - and regarded respectively as natural and as artificial.&lt;ref name="Ousby, p. 845"/&gt;

==Modern times==

In modern times&lt;ref&gt;''Sentimental'' began to accrue negative connotations in the 19th century. Before that it had been an adjective denoting "feeling", as in ''[[The Man of Feeling]]'' (1771), [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy'' and [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]]'s ''[[Sentimental Education]]'' (1869).&lt;/ref&gt; "sentimental" is a [[pejorative]] term that has been casually applied to works of art and literature that exceed the viewer or reader's sense of [[decorum]]—the extent of permissible emotion—and standards of [[taste]]: "excessiveness" is the criterion;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkie took the example of [[Henry Clay Work]]'s maudlin lyric of [[Temperance movement|Temperance propaganda]], "Come Home, Father".&lt;/ref&gt; "Meretricious" and "contrived" sham [[pathos]] are the hallmark of sentimentality, where the morality that underlies the work is both intrusive and pat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

'Sentimentality often involves situations which evoke very intense feelings: love affairs, childbirth, death', but where the feelings are expressed with 'reduced intensity and duration of emotional experience...diluted to a safe strength by [[idealisation]] and simplification'.&lt;ref&gt;G. Cupchik and Laszlo, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, as a social force sentimentality is a hardy perennial, appearing for example as 'Romantic sentimentality...in the 1960s slogans "flower power" and "make love not war"'.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Mullen, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s public outpouring of grief at the [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales#Funeral|death of Diana]], 'when they go on about fake sentimentality in relation to Princess Diana',&lt;ref&gt;Tony Blair, as quoted in Wheen, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; also raised issues about the 'powerful streak of sentimentality in the British character' - the extent to which 'sentimentality was a grand old national tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baudrillard]] has [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynically]] attacked the sentimentality of Western [[humanitarianism]], suggesting that 'in the New Sentimental Order, the affluent become consumers of the "ever more delightful spectacle of poverty and catastrophe, and of the moving spectacle of our own attempts to alleviate it"'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey and Wilkin, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the issue of what has been called 'indecent sentimentality...[in] [[pornographic]]al pseudo-classics', so that one might say for example that ' ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' is a ''very'' sentimental novel, a faked Eden'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Robinson, as quoted in Anderson and Mullen, p. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in [[sociology]] it is possible to see the "sentimental tradition" as extending into the present-day - to see, for example, '[[Talcott Parsons|Parsons]] as one of the great social philosophers in the sentimental tradition of [[Adam Smith]], [[Edmund Burke|Burke]], [[McLuhan]], and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]]...concerned with the relation between the rational and sentimental bases of social order raised by the market reorientation of motivation'.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Fukuyama]] takes up the theme through the exploration of 'society's stock of shared values as ''[[social capital]]'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 'subjective confession' of 1932, 'Ulysses: a Monologue', the analytic psychologist Carl Jung anticipates Baudrillard when he writes: 'Think of the lamentable role of popular sentiment in wartime! Think of our so-called humanitarianism! The psychiatrist knows only too well how each of us becomes the helpless but not pitiable victim of his own sentiments. Sentimentality is the superstructure erected upon brutality. Unfeelingness is the counter-position and inevitably suffers from the same defects.' [Carl Jung: The Spirit in Man, Art and Literature, London: Routledge, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;143]

==Dissensions==

Complications enter into the ordinary view of sentimentality, however, when changes in fashion and setting— the "climate of thought"&lt;ref name="Wilkie 1967:569"&gt;Wilkie 1967:569.&lt;/ref&gt;—intrude between the work and the reader. The view that sentimentality is relative is inherent in [[John Ciardi]]'s "sympathetic contract", in which the reader agrees to join with the writer when approaching a poem.&lt;ref&gt;Ciardi, p. 846f.&lt;/ref&gt; The example of the death of Little Nell in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' (1840–41), "a scene that for many readers today might represent a defining instance of sentimentality",&lt;ref name="Wilkie 1967:569"/&gt; brought tears to the eye of many highly critical readers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, I, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The reader of Dickens, [[Richard Holt Hutton]] observed, "has the painful impression of pathos feasting upon itself."&lt;ref&gt;LeRoy, "Richard Holt Hutton" p. 831.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Recent [[feminist theory]] has clarified the use of the term as it applies to the genre' of the sentimental novel, stressing the way that 'different cultural assumptions arising from the oppression of women gave liberating significance to the works' piety and mythical power to the ideals of the heroines'.&lt;ref&gt;Serafin and Bendixen, p. 1014.&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Sentimental fallacy&lt;!--'Sentimental fallacy' redirects here--&gt;==

The '''sentimental fallacy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is an ancient [[rhetoric]]al device that attributes human emotions, such as grief or anger, to the forces of nature{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. This is also known as the [[pathetic fallacy]], 'a term coined by [[John Ruskin]]...for the practice of attributing human emotions to the inanimate or unintelligent world'&lt;ref&gt;Ousby, p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt; - as in 'the sentimental poetic trope of the "pathetic fallacy", beloved of [[Theocritus]], [[Virgil]] and their successors'&lt;ref&gt;Fitter, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[pastoral]] tradition.

The term is also used more indiscriminately to discredit any argument as being based on a misweighting of emotion: 'sentimental fallacies...that men, that we, are better - nobler - than we know ourselves to be';&lt;ref&gt;Stott, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; 'the "sentimental fallacy" of constructing novels or plays "out of purely emotional patterns"'.&lt;ref&gt;David Daiches, in Booth, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11668">'''Signed zero''' is [[zero]] with an associated [[Plus and minus signs|sign]]. In ordinary arithmetic, the number 0 does not have a sign, so that −0, +0 and 0 are identical. However, in [[computing]], some number representations allow for the existence of two zeros, often denoted by '''−0''' ('''negative zero''') and '''+0''' ('''positive zero'''), regarded as equal by the numerical comparison operations but with possible different behaviors in particular operations. This occurs in the ''sign and magnitude'' and ''ones' complement'' [[signed number representation]]s for integers, and in most [[floating-point number]] representations. The number 0 is usually encoded as +0, but can be represented by either +0 or −0.

The [[IEEE 754]] standard for floating-point arithmetic (presently used by most computers and programming languages that support floating point numbers) requires both +0 and −0. Real arithmetic with signed zeros can be considered a variant of the [[extended real number line]] such that 1/−0 = −[[infinity|∞]] and 1/+0 = +∞; [[Division (mathematics)|division]] is only [[Indeterminate form|undefined]] for [[Plus-minus sign|±]]0/±0 and ±∞/±∞.

Negatively signed zero echoes the [[mathematical analysis]] concept of approaching 0 from below as a [[one-sided limit]], which may be denoted by ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0−, or ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;↑0.  The notation "−0" may be used informally to denote a small negative number that has been [[rounding|rounded]] to zero.  The concept of negative zero also has some theoretical applications in [[statistical mechanics]] and other disciplines.

It is claimed that the inclusion of signed zero in IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 makes it much easier to achieve numerical accuracy in some critical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], "Branch Cuts for Complex Elementary Functions, or Much Ado About Nothing's Sign Bit", in [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=59678 ''The State of the Art in Numerical Analysis''] (eds. Iserles and Powell), Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular when computing with [[complex number|complex]] elementary functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Math185/Derivative.pdf Derivatives in the Complex z-plane], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the concept of signed zero runs contrary to the general assumption made in most mathematical fields that negative zero is the same thing as zero.  Representations that allow negative zero can be a source of errors in programs, if software developers do not take into account that while the two zero representations behave as equal under numeric comparisons, they yield different results in some operations.

==Representations==
The widely used [[two's complement]] encoding does not allow a negative zero.  In a 1+7-bit [[signed magnitude|sign-and-magnitude]] representation for integers, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1000|0000}}. In an 8-bit [[one's complement]] representation, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1111|1111}}. In all three encodings, positive zero is represented by {{gaps|0000|0000}}.

[[Image:IEEE 754 Single Negative Zero.svg|thumb|right|400px|Negative zero by IEEE 754 representation in [[binary32]] ]]
In [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE 754]] binary floating point numbers, zero values are represented by the biased exponent and [[significand]] both being zero. Negative zero has the sign bit set to one.  One may obtain negative zero as the result of certain computations, for instance as the result of [[arithmetic underflow]] on a negative number, or &lt;code&gt;−1.0×0.0&lt;/code&gt;, or simply as &lt;code&gt;−0.0&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE 754]] decimal floating point encoding, a negative zero is represented by an exponent being any valid exponent in the range for the encoding, the true significand being zero, and the sign bit being one.

==Properties and handling==
The IEEE 754 floating point standard specifies the behavior of positive zero and negative zero under various operations.  The outcome may depend on the current [[floating point#Rounding modes|IEEE rounding mode]] settings.

===Notation===
In systems that include both signed and unsigned zeros, the notation &lt;math&gt;0^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0^-&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used for signed zeros.

===Arithmetic===
Addition and multiplication are commutative, but there are some special rules that have to be followed, which mean the usual mathematical rules for algebraic simplification may not apply. The &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; sign below shows the signed result of the operations.

The usual rule for signs is always followed when multiplying or dividing:

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{ \left| x \right| } = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) \cdot (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There are special rules for adding or subtracting signed zero:

* &lt;math&gt;x + (\pm 0) = x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) + (-0) = (-0) - (+0) = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(+0) + (+0) = (+0) - (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x - x = x + (-x) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for any finite &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, −0 when rounding toward negative)

Because of negative zero (and also when the rounding mode is upward or downward), the expressions {{nowrap|−(''x'' − ''y'')}} and {{nowrap|(−''x'') − (−''y'')}}, for floating-point variables ''x'' and ''y'', cannot be replaced by {{nowrap|''y'' − ''x''}}. However {{nowrap|(−0) + ''x''}} can be replaced by ''x'' with rounding to nearest (except when ''x'' can be a [[NaN#Signaling NaN|signaling NaN]]).

Some other special rules:

* &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-0} = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daops.html#refsqrt|title=Decimal Arithmetic: Arithmetic operations{{snd}}square-root|first=Mike|last=Cowlishaw|authorlink=Mike Cowlishaw|date=7 April 2009|publisher=speleotrove.com ([[IBM Corporation]])|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{-\infty} = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left|x\right|}{-0} = -\infty\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (for non-zero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;{\pm 0} \times {\pm \infty} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[Not a Number]] or interrupt for [[indeterminate form]])
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pm 0}{\pm 0} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Division of a non-zero number by zero sets the divide by zero [[flag (computing)|flag]], and an operation producing a NaN sets the invalid operation flag. An [[exception handling|exception handler]] is called if enabled for the corresponding flag.

===Comparisons===
According to the IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 standard, negative zero and positive zero should compare as equal with the usual (numerical) comparison operators, like the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operators of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java programming language|Java]].  In those languages, special programming tricks may be needed to distinguish the two values:

* [[Type punning]] the number to an integer type, so as to look at the sign bit in the bit pattern;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;copysign()&lt;/code&gt; function (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 copySign operation) to copy the sign of the zero to some non-zero number;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;signbit()&lt;/code&gt; macro (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 isSignMinus operation) that returns whether the sign bit of a number is set;
* taking the reciprocal of the zero to obtain either 1/(+0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞ or 1/(−0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−∞ (if the [[division by zero]] exception is not trapped).

Note: [[Cast (computer programming)|Casting]] to integral type will not always work, especially on two's complement systems.

However, some programming languages may provide alternative comparison operators that do distinguish the two zeros. This is the case, for example, of the &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; method in Java's &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; wrapper class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29 http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals(java.lang.Object)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific uses==
Informally, one may use the notation "−0" for a negative value that was rounded to zero.  This notation may be useful when a negative sign is significant; for example, when tabulating [[Celsius]] temperatures, where a negative sign means ''below freezing''.

In statistical mechanics, one sometimes uses [[negative temperature]]s to describe systems with [[population inversion]], which can be considered to have a temperature greater than positive infinity, because the coefficient of energy in the population distribution function is &amp;minus;1/Temperature. In this context, a temperature of &amp;minus;0 is a (theoretical) temperature larger than any other negative temperature, corresponding to the (theoretical) maximum conceivable extent of population inversion, the opposite extreme to +0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Charles Kittel|Kittel, Charles]] and [[Herbert Kroemer]] | title=Thermal Physics (2nd ed.) | publisher=W. H. Freeman Company | year=1980 | isbn=0-7167-1088-9|page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable theorists ==
The study of social systems is integral to the fields of sociology and public policy. Social systems have been studied for as long as sociology has existed.

=== Talcott Parsons ===
[[Talcott Parsons]] was the first to formulate a systematic theory of social systems, which he did as a part of his [[AGIL paradigm]]. He defined a social system as only a segment (or a "subsystem") of what he called [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social System|last=Parsons|first=Talcott|publisher=Routledge|year=1951|isbn=0-203-99295-4|location=England|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parsons organized social systems in terms of action units, where one action executed by an individual is one unit. He defines a social system as a network of interactions between actors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Parsons, social systems rely on a system of language, and [[culture]] must exist in a society in order for it to qualify as a social system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Parsons' work laid the foundations for the rest of the study of social systems theory and ignited the debate over what framework social systems should be built around, such as actions, communication, or other relationships.

=== Niklas Luhmann ===
[[Niklas Luhmann]] was a prominent sociologist and social systems theorist who laid the foundations of modern social system thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambriapress.com/cambriapress.cfm?template=4&amp;bid=339|title=Observing Society: Meaning, Communication, and Social Systems  By Daniel B. Lee and Achim Brosziewski|website=www.cambriapress.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based his definition of a "social system" on the mass network of communication between people and defined society itself as an "autopoietic" system, meaning a self-referential and self-reliant system that is distinct from its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMlvNXfpxfoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=social+systems&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9Tk1wDUDhX&amp;sig=JWsWpj5thEmyB7Afc3fu-JBTbK4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKj8uipq3UAhVi2IMKHZGlDtg4HhDoAQhXMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20systems&amp;f=false|title=Luhmann's "social Systems" Theory: Preliminary Fragments for a Theory of Translation|last=Vermeer|first=Hans J.|date=2006|publisher=Frank &amp; Timme GmbH|isbn=9783865961020|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann considered social systems as belonging to three categories: societal systems, organizations, and interaction systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayrhofer|first=Wolfgang|date=2004|title=Social Systems Theory as Theoretical Framework for Human Resource Management – Benediction or Curse?|jstor=41783463|journal=Management Revue|volume=15|issue=2|pages=178–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luhmann considered societal systems, such as religion, law, art, education, science, etc., to be closed systems consisting of different fields of interaction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Niklas Luhmann and Organizational Studies|last=David Seidl|first=Kai Helge Becker|publisher=CBS press|year=2013|isbn=978-87-630-0304-9|location=Denmark|pages=35–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations were defined as a network of decisions which reproduce themselves; his definition is difficult to apply in terms of finding a real-world example.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, interaction systems are systems that reproduce themselves on the basis of communication rather than decision making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Jay Wright Forrester ===
[[Jay Wright Forrester]] founded the field of [[system dynamics]], which deals with the simulation of interactions in dynamic systems. In his work on social systems, he discusses the possibilities of social system dynamics, or modeling social systems using computers with the aim of testing the possible effects of passing new public policies or laws. In his paper he recognized the difficulty of producing a reliable computer model system, but argued that an imperfect model was better than none and simply implementing new policy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.constitution.org/ps/cbss.htm|title=Jay W. Forrester: Counterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrester argued that unsuccessful public policies aim to treat the symptoms rather than the causes of social issues and that they also generally focus on  rather than  efforts. This occurs because there is either an incomplete understanding or a misunderstanding of the causes of an issue on the part of the policymakers, which often leads to ineffective or detrimental policies which aggravate the issues they were implemented to correct or cause other issues to arise. Another problem Forrester notes is that some policies which may work in the long run may aggravate an issue in the short run. A successful policy according to Forrester must target the correct leverage points, in this case the aspect of the social problem which, if modified, will produce a sizeable enough effect to correct the problem.

== Modeling ==
One significant problem with studying social systems is the difficulty of forming and testing theories; social systems are not easily manipulated or controlled and large-scale systems cannot be reproduced in a lab setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JACKSON|first=MICHAEL C.|date=1985-01-01|title=Social Systems Theory and Practice: The Need for a Critical Approach|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03081078508934877|journal=International Journal of General Systems|volume=10|issue=2-3|pages=135–151|doi=10.1080/03081078508934877|issn=0308-1079}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rapid increase in the availability of digital [[data]] over the last decade gives scientists studying the behaviors of social systems very detailed and much more holistic pictures of how social systems respond to various events and how networked social systems behave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vespignani|first=Alessandro|date=24 July 2009|title=Predicting the Behavior of Techno-Social Systems|url=http://www.gleamviz.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/science2009.pdf|journal=Science|volume=325|pages=425–428|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the development and popularity of social media platforms such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] offer new ways to study the evolution of social systems and social networking behaviors with [[social graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thesystemsthinker.com/extending-systems-thinking-to-social-systems/|title=Extending Systems Thinking to Social Systems - The Systems Thinker|date=2016-01-23|work=The Systems Thinker|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the behaviors of these systems may be surprising or not yet well understood, the digital age offers a new frontier for the study of social systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/multimedia/simons-science-series/online-social-systems/|title=Online Social Systems {{!}} Simons Foundation|website=www.simonsfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable past models are the WORLD2 and [[World3|WORLD3]] models: these both aimed to outline the world's distribution of resources. WORLD3 was based on the [[Club of Rome]]'s ''[[The Limits to Growth|Limits to Growth]].''

[[Image:Sphere wireframe 10deg 6r.svg|right|thumb|A two-dimensional [[3D projection#Perspective projection|perspective projection]] of a sphere]]
A '''sphere''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:σφαῖρα|σφαῖρα]] — ''sphaira'', "globe, ball"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^ σφαῖρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is a perfectly round [[Geometry|geometrical]] object in [[solid geometry|three-dimensional space]] that is the surface of a completely round [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] (viz., analogous to the circular objects in two dimensions, where a "[[circle]]" circumscribes its [[Disk (mathematics)|"disk"]]).

Like a circle in a two-dimensional space, a sphere is defined mathematically as the [[Locus (mathematics)|set of points]] that are all at the same distance {{math|''r''}} from a given point, but in a three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name=Albert54&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distance {{math|''r''}} is the [[radius]] of the ball, which is made up from all points with a distance less than {{math|''r''}} from the given point, which is the [[centre (geometry)|center]] of the mathematical ball. These are also referred to as the radius and center of the sphere, respectively. The longest straight line through the ball, connecting two points of the sphere, passes through the center and its length is thus twice the radius; it is a [[diameter]] of both the sphere and its ball.

While outside mathematics the terms "sphere" and "ball" are sometimes used interchangeably, in [[mathematics]] the above distinction is made between a ''sphere'', which is a two-dimensional [[closed surface]], [[embedding|embedded]] in a three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], and a ''ball'', which is a three-dimensional shape that includes the sphere and everything ''inside'' the sphere (a ''closed ball''), or, more often, just the points ''inside'', but ''not on'' the sphere (an ''open ball''). This distinction has not always been maintained and especially older mathematical references talk about a sphere as a solid. This is analogous to the situation in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], where the terms "circle" and "disk" can also be confounded.

==Equations in three-dimensional space==
[[Image:Sphere and Ball.png|right|thumb|two orthogonal radii of a sphere]]
{{see also|trigonometric function|spherical coordinates}}

In [[analytic geometry]], a sphere with center {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and radius {{mvar|r}} is the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all points {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} such that
:&lt;math&gt; (x - x_0 )^2 + (y - y_0 )^2 + ( z - z_0 )^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{mvar|a, b, c, d, e}} be real numbers with {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}} and put
:&lt;math&gt;x_0 = \frac{-b}{a}, \quad y_0 = \frac{-c}{a}, \quad z_0 = \frac{-d}{a}, \quad \rho = \frac{b^2 +c^2+d^2 - ae}{a^2}. &lt;/math&gt;
Then the equation
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z) = a(x^2 + y^2 +z^2) + 2(bx + cy + dz) + e = 0&lt;/math&gt;
has no real points as solutions if &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and is called the equation of an '''imaginary sphere'''. If &lt;math&gt;\rho = 0&lt;/math&gt; the only solution of &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the point &lt;math&gt;P_0 = (x_0,y_0,z_0)&lt;/math&gt; and the equation is said to be the equation of a '''point sphere'''. Finally, in the case &lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is an equation of a sphere whose center is &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; and whose radius is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt \rho&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Albert54 /&gt;

If {{mvar|a}} in the above equation is zero then {{math|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = 0}} is the equation of a plane. Thus, a plane may be thought of as a sphere of infinite radius whose center is a [[point at infinity]].&lt;ref name=Woods266&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|1961|loc=p. 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The points on the sphere with radius &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and center &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0,z_0)&lt;/math&gt; can be parameterized via
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} x &amp;= x_0 + r \sin \varphi \; \cos \theta \\
y &amp;= y_0 + r \sin \varphi \; \sin \theta \qquad (0 \leq \varphi \leq \pi,\;  0 \leq \theta &lt; 2\pi ) \\
z &amp;= z_0 + r \cos \varphi \,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kreyszig|1972|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sphere of any radius centered at zero is an integral surface of the following [[differential form]]:
:&lt;math&gt; x \, dx + y \, dy + z \, dz = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation reflects that position and velocity vectors of a point, {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} and {{math|(''dx'', ''dy'', ''dz'')}}, traveling on the sphere are always [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to each other.

A sphere can also be constructed as the surface formed by rotating a [[circle]] about any of its [[diameter]]s. Since a circle is a special type of [[ellipse]], a sphere is a special type of [[ellipsoid of revolution]]. Replacing the circle with an ellipse rotated about its [[major axis]], the shape becomes a prolate [[spheroid]]; rotated about the minor axis, an oblate spheroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enclosed volume{{anchor|Volume}} ==
[[File:Esfera Arquímedes0.svg|thumb|Sphere and circumscribed cylinder]]

In three dimensions, the [[volume]] inside a sphere (that is, the volume of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]], but classically referred to as the volume of a sphere) is 
: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|r}} is the radius of the sphere. [[Archimedes]] first derived this formula, by showing that the volume inside a sphere is twice the volume between the sphere and the [[circumscribe]]d [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of that sphere (having the height and diameter equal to the diameter of the sphere).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinhaus|1969|loc=p. 223}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion can be obtained from [[Cavalieri's principle]]. This formula can also be derived using [[integral calculus]], i.e. [[disk integration]] to sum the volumes of an [[infinite number]] of [[Circle#Properties|circular]] disks of infinitesimally small thickness stacked side by side and centered along the {{mvar|x}}-axis from {{math|1=''x'' = −''r''}}  to {{math|1=''x'' = ''r''}}, assuming the sphere of radius {{mvar|r}} is centered at the origin. 

At any given {{mvar|x}}, the incremental volume ({{mvar|δV}}) equals the product of the cross-sectional [[area of a disk#Onion proof|area of the disk]] at {{mvar|x}} and its thickness ({{mvar|δx}}):
: &lt;math&gt;\delta V \approx \pi y^2 \cdot \delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

The total volume is the summation of all incremental volumes:
: &lt;math&gt;V \approx \sum \pi y^2 \cdot \delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit as {{mvar|δx}} approaches zero&lt;ref name="delta"/&gt; this equation becomes:
: &lt;math&gt;V = \int_{-r}^{r} \pi y^2 dx.&lt;/math&gt;

At any given {{mvar|x}}, a right-angled triangle connects {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|r}} to the origin; hence, applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] yields:
: &lt;math&gt;y^2 = r^2 - x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Using this substitution gives
: &lt;math&gt;V = \int_{-r}^{r} \pi (r^2 - x^2)dx,&lt;/math&gt;

that can be evaluated to give the result
: &lt;math&gt;V = \pi \left[r^2x - \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{-r}^{r} = \pi \left(r^3 - \frac{r^3}{3} \right) - \pi \left(-r^3 + \frac{r^3}{3} \right) = \frac43\pi r^3.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, this formula is found using [[spherical coordinates]], with volume element
: &lt;math&gt; dV=r^2\sin\theta\, dr\, d\theta\, d\varphi&lt;/math&gt;
so
: &lt;math&gt;V=\int_0^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \int_0^r r'^2\sin\theta\, dr'\, d\theta\, d\varphi  
= 2\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \int_0^r r'^2\sin\theta\, dr'\, d\theta 
= 4\pi \int_0^r r'^2\, dr'\ 
=\frac43\pi r^3.&lt;/math&gt;
For most practical purposes, the volume inside a sphere [[Inscribed figure|inscribed]] in a cube can be approximated as 52.4% of the volume of the cube, since {{math|1=''V'' = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|6}} ''d''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|d}} is the diameter of the sphere and also the length of a side of the cube and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|6}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.5236. For example, a sphere with diameter 1 meter has 52.4% the volume of a cube with edge length 1 meter, or about 0.524&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Surface area{{anchor|Area}}==
&lt;!-- [[Surface area of a sphere]] is a redirect that points to this section --&gt;

The [[surface area]] of a sphere of radius {{mvar|r}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Archimedes]] first derived this formula&lt;ref name=MathWorld_Sphere&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Sphere |id=Sphere}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the fact that the projection to the lateral surface of a [[circumscribe]]d cylinder is area-preserving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinhaus|1969|loc=p. 221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach to obtaining the formula comes from the fact that it equals the [[derivative]] of the formula for the volume with respect to {{mvar|r}} because the total volume inside a sphere of radius {{mvar|r}} can be thought of as the summation of the surface area of an infinite number of spherical shells of infinitesimal thickness concentrically stacked inside one another from radius 0 to radius {{mvar|r}}. At infinitesimal thickness the discrepancy between the inner and outer surface area of any given shell is infinitesimal, and the elemental volume at radius {{mvar|r}} is simply the product of the surface area at radius {{mvar|r}} and the infinitesimal thickness.

At any given radius {{mvar|r}},&lt;ref&gt;{{mvar|r}} is being considered as a variable in this computation&lt;/ref&gt; the incremental volume ({{mvar|δV}}) equals the product of the surface area at radius {{mvar|r}} ({{math|''A''(''r'')}}) and the thickness of a shell ({{mvar|δr}}):
:&lt;math&gt;\delta V \approx A(r) \cdot \delta r. &lt;/math&gt;

The total volume is the summation of all shell volumes:
:&lt;math&gt;V \approx \sum A(r) \cdot \delta r.&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit as {{mvar|δr}} approaches zero&lt;ref name="delta"&gt;Pages 141, 149. {{cite book
|author1=E. J. Borowski |author2=J. M. Borwein |title=Collins Dictionary of Mathematics
|isbn=0-00-434347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; this equation becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;V = \int_0^r A(r) \, dr.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute {{mvar|V}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac43\pi r^3 = \int_0^r A(r) \, dr.&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to {{mvar|r}} yields {{mvar|A}} as a function of {{mvar|r}}:
:&lt;math&gt;4\pi r^2 = A(r).&lt;/math&gt;

This is generally abbreviated as:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|r}} is now considered to be the fixed radius of the sphere.

Alternatively, the [[area element]] on the sphere is given in [[spherical coordinates]] by {{math|1=''dA'' = ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin ''θ dθ dφ''}}. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], the area element is
: &lt;math&gt;dS=\frac{r}{\sqrt{r^{2}-{\displaystyle \sum_{i\ne k}x_{i}^{2}}}}\prod_{i\ne k}dx_{i},\;\forall k.&lt;/math&gt; 
For more generality, see [[Volume element|area element]].

The total area can thus be obtained by [[Integral|integration]]:
:&lt;math&gt;A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi r^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\varphi = 4\pi r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The sphere has the smallest surface area of all surfaces that enclose a given volume, and it encloses the largest volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area. The sphere therefore appears in nature: for example, bubbles and small water drops are roughly spherical because the [[surface tension]] locally minimizes surface area.

The surface area relative to the mass of a ball is called the [[specific surface area]] and can be expressed from the above stated equations as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SSA} = \frac{A}{V\rho} = \frac{3}{r\rho},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[density]] (the ratio of mass to volume).

==Geometric properties==
A sphere is uniquely determined by four points that are not [[coplanar]]. More generally, a sphere is uniquely determined by four conditions such as passing through a point, being tangent to a plane, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property is analogous to the property that three [[collinear|non-collinear]] points determine a unique circle in a plane.

Consequently, a sphere is uniquely determined by (that is, passes through) a circle and a point not in the plane of that circle.

By examining the [[Circle of a sphere#Sphere-sphere intersection|common solutions of the equations of two spheres]], it can be seen that two spheres intersect in a circle and the plane containing that circle is called the '''radical plane''' of the intersecting spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the radical plane is a real plane, the circle may be imaginary (the spheres have no real point in common) or consist of a single point (the spheres are tangent at that point).&lt;ref name=Woods267&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|1961|loc=p. 267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The angle between two spheres at a real point of intersection is the [[dihedral angle]] determined by the tangent planes to the spheres at that point. Two spheres intersect at the same angle at all points of their circle of intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; They intersect at right angles (are [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]]) if and only if the squares of the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of the squares of their radii.&lt;ref name=Woods266 /&gt;

===Pencil of spheres===
If {{math|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = 0}} and {{math|1=''g''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = 0}} are the equations of two distinct spheres then 
:&lt;math&gt;s f(x,y,z) + t g(x,y,z) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
is also the equation of a sphere for arbitrary values of the parameters {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}}. The set of all spheres satisfying this equation is called a '''pencil of spheres''' determined by the original two spheres. In this definition a sphere is allowed to be a plane (infinite radius, center at infinity) and if both the original spheres are planes then all the spheres of the pencil are planes, otherwise there is only one plane (the radical plane) in the pencil.&lt;ref name=Woods266 /&gt;

If the pencil of spheres does not consist of all planes, then there are three types of pencils:&lt;ref name=Woods267 /&gt;
*If the spheres intersect in a real circle {{mvar|C}}, then the pencil consists of all the spheres containing {{mvar|C}}, including the radical plane. The centers of all the ordinary spheres in the pencil lie on a line passing through the center of {{mvar|C}} and perpendicular to the radical plane.
*If the spheres intersect in an imaginary circle, all the spheres of the pencil also pass through this imaginary circle but as ordinary spheres they are disjoint (have no real points in common). The line of centers is perpendicular to the radical plane, which is a real plane in the pencil containing the imaginary circle.
*If the spheres intersect in a point {{mvar|A}}, all the spheres in the pencil are tangent at {{mvar|A}} and the radical plane is the common tangent plane of all these spheres. The line of centers is perpendicular to the radical plane at {{mvar|A}}.

All the tangent lines from a fixed point of the radical plane to the spheres of a pencil have the same length.&lt;ref name=Woods267 /&gt;

The radical plane is the locus of the centers of all the spheres that are orthogonal to all the spheres in a pencil. Moreover, a sphere orthogonal to any two spheres of a pencil of spheres is orthogonal to all of them and its center lies in the radical plane of the pencil.&lt;ref name=Woods267 /&gt;

==Terminology==
Pairs of points on a sphere that lie on a straight line through the sphere's center are called [[antipodal point]]s. A [[great circle]] is a circle on the sphere that has the same center and radius as the sphere and, consequently, divides it into two equal parts. The [[plane section]]s of a sphere are called ''spheric sections''. They are all circles and those that are not great circles are called [[Circle of a sphere|''small circles'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |id=SphericSection |title=Spheric section}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shortest distance along the surface between two distinct non-antipodal points on the sphere is the length of the smaller of the two arcs on the unique great circle that includes the two points. Equipped with this "[[great-circle distance]]", a great circle becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].

If a particular point on a sphere is (arbitrarily) designated as its ''north pole'', then the corresponding antipodal point is called the ''south pole'', and the [[equator]] is the great circle that is equidistant to them. Great circles through the two poles are called lines (or [[meridian (geography)|meridians]]) of [[longitude]], and the line connecting the two poles is called the [[axis of rotation]]. Circles on the sphere that are parallel to the equator are lines of [[latitude]]. This terminology is also used for such approximately [[spheroid]]al [[astronomical bodies]] as the planet [[Earth]] (see [[geoid]]).

==Hemisphere==
{{anchor|hemisphere}}

Any plane that includes the center of a sphere divides it into two equal '''hemispheres'''. Any two intersecting planes that include the center of a sphere subdivide the sphere into four [[spherical lune|lunes]] or biangles, the vertices of which all coincide with the [[antipodal point]]s lying on the line of intersection of the planes.

The antipodal quotient of the sphere is the surface called the [[real projective plane]], which can also be thought of as the [[northern hemisphere]] with antipodal points of the equator identified.

The hemisphere is [[filling area conjecture|conjectured]] to be the optimal (least area) isometric filling of the [[Riemannian circle]].

==Generalizations==
===Dimensionality===
{{Main|n-sphere}}
Spheres can be generalized to spaces of any number of [[dimension]]s. For any [[natural number]] {{mvar|n}}, an "{{mvar|n}}-sphere," often written as {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, is the set of points in ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional Euclidean space that are at a fixed distance {{mvar|r}} from a central point of that space, where {{mvar|r}} is, as before, a positive real number. In particular:
*{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}: a 0-sphere is a pair of endpoints of an interval {{math|[−''r'', ''r'']}} of the real line
*{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}: a 1-sphere is a [[circle]] of radius ''r''
*{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}: a 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere
*{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}: a [[3-sphere]] is a sphere in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.

Spheres for {{math|''n'' &gt; 2}} are sometimes called [[hypersphere]]s.

The {{mvar|n}}-sphere of unit radius centered at the origin is denoted {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and is often referred to as "the" {{mvar|n}}-sphere. Note that the ordinary sphere is a 2-sphere, because it is a 2-dimensional surface (which is embedded in 3-dimensional space).

The surface area of the unit ({{math|''n''-1}})-sphere is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2 \pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Γ(''z'')}} is Euler's [[gamma function]].

Another expression for the surface area is
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
 \displaystyle \frac{(2\pi)^{n/2}\,r^{n-1}}{2 \cdot 4 \cdots (n-2)}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\
 \displaystyle \frac{2(2\pi)^{(n-1)/2}\,r^{n-1}}{1 \cdot 3 \cdots (n-2)}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and the volume is the surface area times {{math|{{sfrac|''r''|''n''}}}} or
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
 \displaystyle \frac{(2\pi)^{n/2}\,r^n}{2 \cdot 4 \cdots n}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}; \\ \\
 \displaystyle \frac{2(2\pi)^{(n-1)/2}\,r^n}{1 \cdot 3 \cdots n}, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

General recursive formulas also exist for the [[volume of an n-ball|volume of an {{mvar|n}}-ball]].

===Metric spaces===
More generally, in a [[metric space]] {{math|(''E'',''d'')}}, the sphere of center {{mvar|x}} and radius {{math|''r'' &gt; 0}} is the set of points {{mvar|y}} such that {{math|1=''d''(''x'',''y'') = ''r''}}.

If the center is a distinguished point that is considered to be the origin of {{mvar|E}}, as in a [[norm (mathematics)|normed]] space, it is not mentioned in the definition and notation. The same applies for the radius if it is taken to equal one, as in the case of a [[unit sphere]].

Unlike a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]], even a large sphere may be an empty set. For example, in {{math|'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with [[Euclidean metric]], a sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} is nonempty only if {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be written as sum of {{math|''n''}} squares of [[integer]]s.

==Topology==
In [[topology]], an {{mvar|n}}-sphere is defined as a space [[homeomorphic]] to the boundary of an [[ball (mathematics)#Topological balls|{{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball]]; thus, it is [[homeomorphic]] to the Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-sphere, but perhaps lacking its [[Metric space|metric]].
*A 0-sphere is a pair of points with the [[discrete topology]].
*A 1-sphere is a circle ([[up to]] [[homeomorphism]]); thus, for example, (the image of) any [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] is a 1-sphere.
*A 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere ([[up to]] [[homeomorphism]]); thus, for example, any [[spheroid]] is a 2-sphere.

The {{mvar|n}}-sphere is denoted {{math|''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}}. It is an example of a [[compact space|compact]] [[topological manifold]] without [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]]. A sphere need not be [[Manifold#Differentiable manifolds|smooth]]; if it is smooth, it need not be [[diffeomorphic]] to the Euclidean sphere.

The [[Heine–Borel theorem]] implies that a Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-sphere is compact. The sphere is the inverse image of a one-point set under the continuous function {{math|{{norm|''x''}}}}. Therefore, the sphere is closed. {{math|''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is also bounded; therefore it is compact.

Remarkably, it is possible to turn an ordinary sphere inside out in a [[three-dimensional space]] with possible self-intersections but without creating any crease, in a process called [[sphere eversion]].

==Spherical geometry==
[[Image:Sphere halve.png|thumb|right|[[Great circle]] on a sphere]]
{{Main|Spherical geometry}}
The basic elements of [[Euclidean plane geometry]] are [[Point (geometry)|points]] and [[line (mathematics)|lines]]. On the sphere, points are defined in the usual sense. The analogue of the "line" is the [[geodesic]], which is a [[great circle]]; the defining characteristic of a great circle is that the plane containing all its points also passes through the center of the sphere. Measuring by [[arc length]] shows that the shortest path between two points lying on the sphere is the shorter segment of the [[great circle]] that includes the points.

Many theorems from [[classical geometry]] hold true for spherical geometry as well, but not all do because the sphere fails to satisfy some of classical geometry's [[postulate]]s, including the [[parallel postulate]]. In [[spherical trigonometry]], [[angle]]s are defined between great circles. Spherical trigonometry differs from ordinary [[trigonometry]] in many respects. For example, the sum of the interior angles of a [[spherical triangle]] always exceeds 180&amp;nbsp;degrees. Also, any two [[similar triangles|similar]] spherical triangles are congruent.

==Eleven properties of the sphere==
[[Image:Sphere section.png|thumb|A normal vector to a sphere, a normal plane and its normal section. The curvature of the curve of intersection is the sectional curvature. For the sphere each normal section through a given point will be a circle of the same radius: the radius of the sphere. This means that every point on the sphere will be an umbilical point.]]

In their book ''Geometry and the Imagination''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=[[David Hilbert|Hilbert, David]]; Cohn-Vossen, Stephan
|title=Geometry and the Imagination
|edition=2nd
|year=1952
|publisher=Chelsea
|isbn=0-8284-1087-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hilbert]] and [[Stephan Cohn-Vossen]] describe eleven properties of the sphere and discuss whether these properties uniquely determine the sphere. Several properties hold for the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], which can be thought of as a sphere with infinite radius. These properties are:
#''The points on the sphere are all the same distance from a fixed point. Also, the ratio of the distance of its points from two fixed points is constant.''
#:The first part is the usual definition of the sphere and determines it uniquely. The second part can be easily deduced and follows a similar [[Circle#Circle of Apollonius|result]] of [[Apollonius of Perga]] for the [[circle]]. This second part also holds for the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]].
#''The contours and plane sections of the sphere are circles.''
#:This property defines the sphere uniquely.
#''The sphere has constant width and constant girth.''
#:The width of a surface is the distance between pairs of parallel tangent planes. Numerous other closed convex surfaces have constant width, for example the [[Meissner body]]. The girth of a surface is the [[circumference]] of the boundary of its orthogonal projection on to a plane. Each of these properties implies the other.
#''All points of a sphere are [[umbilic]]s.''
#:At any point on a surface a [[Normal (geometry)|normal direction]] is at right angles to the surface because the sphere these are the lines radiating out from the center of the sphere. The intersection of a plane that contains the normal with the surface will form a curve that is called a ''normal section,'' and the curvature of this curve is the ''normal curvature''. For most points on most surfaces, different sections will have different curvatures; the maximum and minimum values of these are called the [[principal curvature]]s. Any closed surface will have at least four points called ''[[umbilical point]]s''. At an umbilic all the sectional curvatures are equal; in particular the [[principal curvature]]s are equal. Umbilical points can be thought of as the points where the surface is closely approximated by a sphere.
#:For the sphere the curvatures of all normal sections are equal, so every point is an umbilic. The sphere and plane are the only surfaces with this property.
#''The sphere does not have a surface of centers.''
#:For a given normal section exists a circle of curvature that equals the sectional curvature, is tangent to the surface, and the center lines of which lie along on the normal line. For example, the two centers corresponding to the maximum and minimum sectional curvatures are called the ''focal points'', and the set of all such centers forms the [[focal surface]].
#:For most surfaces the focal surface forms two sheets that are each a surface and meet at umbilical points. Several cases are special:
#:* For [[channel surface]]s one sheet forms a curve and the other sheet is a surface
#:* For [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], cylinders, [[torus|tori]] and [[Dupin cyclide|cyclides]] both sheets form curves.
#:* For the sphere the center of every osculating circle is at the center of the sphere and the focal surface forms a single point. This property is unique to the sphere.
#''All geodesics of the sphere are closed curves.''
#:[[Geodesics]] are curves on a surface that give the shortest distance between two points. They are a generalization of the concept of a straight line in the plane. For the sphere the geodesics are great circles. Many other surfaces share this property.
#''Of all the solids having a given volume, the sphere is the one with the smallest surface area; of all solids having a given surface area, the sphere is the one having the greatest volume.''
#:It follows from [[isoperimetric inequality]]. These properties define the sphere uniquely and can be seen in [[soap bubble]]s: a soap bubble will enclose a fixed volume, and [[surface tension]] minimizes its surface area for that volume. A freely floating soap bubble therefore approximates a sphere (though such external forces as gravity will slightly distort the bubble's shape).
#''The sphere has the smallest total mean curvature among all convex solids with a given surface area.''
#:The [[mean curvature]] is the average of the two principal curvatures, which is constant because the two principal curvatures are constant at all points of the sphere.
#''The sphere has constant mean curvature.''
#:The sphere is the only imbedded surface that lacks boundary or singularities with constant positive mean curvature. Other such immersed surfaces as [[minimal surface]]s have constant mean curvature.
#''The sphere has constant positive Gaussian curvature.''
#:[[Gaussian curvature]] is the product of the two principal curvatures. It is an intrinsic property that can be determined by measuring length and angles and is independent of how the surface is [[embedding|embedded]] in space. Hence, bending a surface will not alter the Gaussian curvature, and other surfaces with constant positive Gaussian curvature can be obtained by cutting a small slit in the sphere and bending it. All these other surfaces would have boundaries, and the sphere is the only surface that lacks a boundary with constant, positive Gaussian curvature. The [[pseudosphere]] is an example of a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature.
#''The sphere is transformed into itself by a three-parameter family of rigid motions.''
#:Rotating around any axis a unit sphere at the origin will map the sphere onto itself. Any rotation about a line through the origin can be expressed as a combination of rotations around the three-coordinate axis (see [[Euler angles]]). Therefore, a three-parameter family of rotations exists such that each rotation transforms the sphere onto itself; this family is the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The plane is the only other surface with a three-parameter family of transformations (translations along the {{mvar|x}}- and {{mvar|y}}-axes and rotations around the origin). Circular cylinders are the only surfaces with two-parameter families of rigid motions and the [[Surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]] and [[helicoid]]s are the only surfaces with a one-parameter family.

'''System F''', also known as the ('''Girard–Reynolds''') '''polymorphic lambda calculus''' or the '''second-order lambda calculus''', is a [[typed lambda calculus]] that differs from the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] by the introduction of a mechanism of universal quantification over types. System F thus formalizes the notion of [[parametric polymorphism]] in [[programming language]]s, and forms a theoretical basis for languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. System F was discovered independently by [[logician]] [[Jean-Yves Girard]] (1972) and [[computer scientist]] [[John C. Reynolds]] (1974).

Whereas [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has variables ranging over functions, and binders for them, System F additionally has variables ranging over ''types'', and binders for them. As an example, the fact that the identity function can have any type of the form A→ A would be formalized in System F as the judgment

:&lt;math&gt;\vdash \Lambda\alpha. \lambda x^\alpha.x: \forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a '''[[type variable]]'''.  The upper-case &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is traditionally used to denote type-level functions, as opposed to the lower-case &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; which is used for value-level functions. (The superscripted &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; means that the bound ''x'' is of type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; the expression after the colon is the type of the lambda expression preceding it.)

As a [[term rewriting system]], System F is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. However, type inference in System F (without explicit type annotations) is undecidable. Under the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]], System F corresponds to the fragment of second-order [[intuitionistic logic]] that uses only universal quantification. System F can be seen as part of the [[lambda cube]], together with even more expressive typed lambda calculi, including those with [[dependent types]].

According to Girard, the "F" in ''System F'' was picked by chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Girard|first=Jean-Yves|date=|title=The system F of variable types, fifteen years later|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0304397586900447|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=45|page=160|pages=|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(86)90044-7|quote=However, in [3] it was shown that the obvious rules of conversion for this system, called F by chance, were converging.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic and predicates ==
The &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; type is defined as:
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a [[type variable]]. This means: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of all functions which take as input a type &amp;alpha; and two expressions of type &amp;alpha;, and produce as output an expression of type &amp;alpha; (note that we consider &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; to be [[right-associative]].)

The following two definitions for the boolean values &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; are used, extending the definition of [[Church encoding#Church Booleans|Church booleans]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = \Lambda\alpha{.}\lambda x^{\alpha} \lambda y^\alpha{.}x&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- These didn't render without the {}-wrapped around the . --&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \Lambda\alpha{.}\lambda x^{\alpha} \lambda y^{\alpha}{.}y&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that the above two functions require ''three'' &amp;mdash; not two &amp;mdash; parameters. The latter two should be lambda expressions, but the first one should be a type. This fact is reflected in the fact that the type of these expressions is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;; the universal quantifier binding the &amp;alpha; corresponds to the &amp;Lambda; binding the alpha in the lambda expression itself. Also, note that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt; is a convenient shorthand for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\forall\alpha.\alpha \to \alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not a symbol of System F itself, but rather a "meta-symbol". Likewise, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; are also "meta-symbols", convenient shorthands, of System F "assemblies" (in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=IL-SI67hjI4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nicolas+Bourbaki&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nbfmxi9gJK&amp;sig=4nPo8EFXrQYwAC2y0pD0uGv-EGY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3sYBUOukIMLW2AX4t_inCw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nicolas%20Bourbaki&amp;f=false Bourbaki sense]); otherwise, if such functions could be named (within System F), then there would be no need for the lambda-expressive apparatus capable of defining functions anonymously.)

Then, with these two &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-terms, we can define some logic operators (which are of type &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathsf{Boolean} \rightarrow \mathsf{Boolean} \rightarrow \mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt;):
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{AND} &amp;= \lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}} \lambda y^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x y\, \mathbf{F}\\
\mathrm{OR}  &amp;= \lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}} \lambda y^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \mathbf{T}\, y\\
\mathrm{NOT} &amp;= \lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \mathbf{F}\, \mathbf{T} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As in Church encodings, there is no need for an &lt;tt&gt;IFTHENELSE&lt;/tt&gt; function as one can just use raw &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt;-typed terms as decision functions. However, if one is requested:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IFTHENELSE} = \Lambda \alpha.\lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}}\lambda y^{\alpha}\lambda z^{\alpha}. x \alpha y z &lt;/math&gt;
will do.
A ''predicate'' is a function which returns a &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathsf{Boolean}&lt;/math&gt;-typed value. The most fundamental predicate is &lt;tt&gt;ISZERO&lt;/tt&gt; which returns &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if its argument is the [[Church encoding#Church numerals|Church numeral]]  &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ISZERO} = \lambda n^{\forall \alpha. (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \alpha}{.}n^{\mathsf{Boolean}} (\lambda x^{\mathsf{Boolean}}{.}\mathbf{F})\, \mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt;

==System F structures==

System F allows recursive constructions to be embedded in a natural manner, related to that in [[Martin-Löf's type theory]]. Abstract structures (S) are created using ''constructors''. These are functions typed as:
:&lt;math&gt;K_1\rightarrow K_2\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;.

Recursivity is manifested when &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; itself appears within one of the types &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;. If you have &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of these constructors, you can define the type of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha.(K_1^1[\alpha/S]\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow \alpha)\dots\rightarrow(K_1^m[\alpha/S]\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow \alpha)\rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the natural numbers can be defined as an inductive datatype &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; with constructors
: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{zero} : \mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathit{succ} : \mathrm{N} \rightarrow \mathrm{N}&lt;/math&gt;
The System F type corresponding to this structure is
&lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha. \alpha \to (\alpha \to \alpha) \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  The terms of this type comprise a typed version of the [[Church numeral]]s, the first few of which are:
: &lt;tt&gt;0 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;1 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . f x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;2 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . f (f x)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;tt&gt;3 := &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Lambda \alpha . \lambda x^\alpha . \lambda f^{\alpha\to\alpha} . f (f (f x))&lt;/math&gt;

If we reverse the order of the curried arguments (''i.e.,'' &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha. (\alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \alpha&lt;/math&gt;), then the Church numeral for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a function that takes a function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt; as argument and returns the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power of &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;. That is to say, a Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]] – it takes a single-argument function &lt;tt&gt;''f''&lt;/tt&gt;, and returns another single-argument function.

==Use in programming languages==

The version of System F used in this article is as an explicitly typed, or Church-style, calculus.  The typing information contained in λ-terms makes [[type-checking]] straightforward.  [[Joe Wells]] (1994) settled an "embarrassing open problem" by proving that type checking is [[decision problem|undecidable]] for a Curry-style variant of System F, that is, one that lacks explicit typing annotations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/research-summary.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.church-project.org/reports/Wells:APAL-1999-v98-no-note.html|title=The Church Project: Typability and type checking in {S}ystem {F} are equivalent and undecidable|date=29 September 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929211126/http://www.church-project.org/reports/Wells:APAL-1999-v98-no-note.html|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells's result implies that [[type inference]] for System F is impossible.
A restriction of System F known as "[[Hindley–Milner]]", or simply "HM", does have an easy type inference algorithm and is used for many [[statically typed]] [[functional programming languages]] such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell 98]] and [[ML programming language|ML]]. Over time, as the restrictions of HM-style type systems have become apparent, languages have steadily moved to more expressive logics for their type systems. As of 2008, [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]], a Haskell compiler, goes beyond HM, and now uses System F extended with non-syntactic type equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/FC|title=Commentary/Compiler/FC – GHC|website=ghc.haskell.org|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[F Sharp (programming_language)|F#]] is designed from scratch with System F in mind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; ==
While System F corresponds to the first axis of Barendregt's [[lambda cube]], '''System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;''' or the '''higher-order polymorphic lambda calculus''' combines the first axis (polymorphism) with the second axis ([[type operator]]s); it is a different, more complex system.

System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined inductively on a family of systems, where induction is based on the [[Kind (type theory)|kind]]s permitted in each system:

* &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; permits kinds:
** &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; (the kind of types) and
** &lt;math&gt;J\Rightarrow K&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;J\in F_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K\in F_n&lt;/math&gt; (the kind of functions from types to types, where the argument type is of a lower order)

In the limit, we can define system &lt;math&gt;F_\omega&lt;/math&gt; to be

* &lt;math&gt;F_\omega = \underset{1 \leq i}{\bigcup} F_i&lt;/math&gt;

That is, F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is the system which allows functions from types to types where the argument (and result) may be of any order.

Note that although F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; places no restrictions on the ''order'' of the arguments in these mappings, it does restrict the ''universe'' of the arguments for these mappings: they must be types rather than values.  System F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; does not permit mappings from values to types ([[Dependent types]]), though it does permit mappings from values to values (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction), mappings from types to values (&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction, sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;) and mappings from types to types (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction at the level of types)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4116">The conventional explanation until 1951 for the cause of [[famine]]s was the decline of food availability (abbreviated as FAD for food availability decline). The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010|p=}} However this does not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from them.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}}

==Failure of exchange entitlements==
It has been suggested{{By whom|date=October 2018}} that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability such as the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e. labor for rice, when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} According to the proposed theory, famines are due to an inability of a person to exchange his entitlements rather than to food unavailability.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} This theory is called the failure of exchange entitlements or FEE in short.

==Lack of democracy==
[[Amartya Sen]] advances the theory that lack of democracy and famines are interrelated; he cites the example of the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], stating that it only occurred because of the lack of democracy in India under British rule. He further argues that the situation was aggravated by the British government's suspension of trade in rice and grains among various Indian provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, A. ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation,'' 1981; Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198284632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olivier Rubin's review of the evidence disagrees with Sen; after examining the cases of post-Independence India, [[Niger]], and [[Malawi]], he finds that "democracy is no panacea against famine." Rubin's analysis questions whether democracy and a free press were sufficient to truly avert famine in 1967 and 1972 (the [[Famine in India#1972 Maharashtra drought|Maharashtra famine]] involved some 130,000 deaths), and notes that some dynamics of electoral democracy complicate rather than bring about famine relief efforts. Rubin does not address colonial period famines.{{sfn|Rubin|2009}}

On the other hand, Andrew Banik's study ''Starvation and India's democracy'' affirms Sen's thesis, but indicates that while democracy has been able to prevent famines in India, it has not been sufficient to avoid [[Malnutrition in India|severe under-nutrition]] and starvation deaths, which Banik calls a 'silent emergency' in the country.{{sfn|Banik|2007}}

According to a FEWSNET report, "Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/reactions/fewsnet-report-260000-people-died-somalia-famine&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Utilitarianism|expanded=Key concepts}}
Within [[economics]] the concept of '''utility''' is used to model worth or value, but its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or satisfaction within the theory of [[utilitarianism]] by moral philosophers such as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. But the term has been adapted and reapplied within [[neoclassical economics]], which dominates modern economic theory, as a '''utility function''' that represents a consumer's preference ordering over a choice set. As such, it is devoid of its original interpretation as a measurement of the pleasure or satisfaction obtained by the consumer from that choice.

== Utility function ==
Consider a set of alternatives facing an individual, and over which the individual has a preference ordering. A '''utility function''' is able to represent those preferences if it is possible to assign a [[real number]] to each alternative, in such a way that ''alternative a'' is assigned a number greater than ''alternative b'' if, and only if, the individual prefers ''alternative a'' to ''alternative b''.  In this situation an individual that selects the most preferred alternative available is necessarily also selecting the alternative that maximises the associated utility function.

[[Gérard Debreu]] precisely defined the conditions required for a preference ordering to be representable by a utility function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Debreu|first=Gérard|title=Decision processes|pages=159–167|year=1954|postscript=.|editor-last1=Thrall|editor-first1=Robert M.|contribution=Representation of a preference ordering by a numerical function|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|oclc=639321|ref=harv|editor-last2=Coombs|editor-first2=Clyde H.|editor-last3=Raiffa|editor-first3=Howard|editor-link2=Clyde H. Coombs|editor-link3=Howard Raiffa}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a finite set of alternatives these require only that the preference ordering is complete (so the individual is able to determine which of any two alternatives is preferred, or that they are equally preferred), and that the preference order is [[Transitive relation|transitive]].

==Applications==

Utility is usually applied by [[economist]]s in such constructs as the [[indifference curve]], which plot the combination of commodities that an individual or a society would accept to maintain a given level of satisfaction. Utility and indifference curves are used by economists to understand the underpinnings of [[demand curve]]s, which are half of the [[supply and demand]] analysis that is used to analyze the workings of [[good (economics)|goods]] markets.

Individual utility and social utility can be construed as the value of a utility function and a [[social welfare function]] respectively.  When coupled with production or commodity constraints, under some assumptions these functions can be used to analyze [[Pareto efficiency]], such as illustrated by [[Edgeworth box]]es in [[contract curve]]s. Such efficiency is a central concept in [[welfare economics]].

In [[finance]], utility is applied to generate an individual's price for an [[asset]] called the [[indifference price]].  Utility functions are also related to [[risk measure]]s, with the most common example being the [[entropic risk measure]].

==Revealed preference==
It was recognized that utility could not be measured or observed directly, so instead economists devised a way to infer underlying relative utilities from observed choice. These 'revealed preferences', as they were named by [[Paul Samuelson]], were revealed e.g. in people's willingness to pay: &lt;blockquote&gt;Utility is taken to be correlative to Desire or Want. It has been already argued that desires cannot be measured directly, but only indirectly, by the outward phenomena to which they give rise: and that in those cases with which economics is chiefly concerned the measure is found in the price which a person is willing to pay for the fulfillment or satisfaction of his desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alfred |last=Marshall |year=1920 |title=Principles of Economics. An introductory volume |edition=8th |location=London |publisher=Macmillan }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|78}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=={{Visible anchor|Functions|Utility functions}}==

There has been some controversy over the question whether the utility of a [[commodity]] can be measured or not. At one time, it was assumed that the consumer was able to say exactly how much utility he got from the commodity. The economists who made this assumption belonged to the 'cardinalist school' of economics. Today '''utility functions''', expressing utility as a function of the amounts of the various goods consumed, are treated as either ''cardinal'' or ''ordinal'', depending on whether they are or are not interpreted as providing more information than simply the rank ordering of preferences over bundles of goods, such as information on the strength of preferences.

===Cardinal===
{{Main|Cardinal utility}}

When cardinal utility is used, the magnitude of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity. For example, suppose a cup of orange juice has utility of 120 utils, a cup of tea has a utility of 80 utils, and a cup of water has a utility of 40 utils. With cardinal utility, it can be concluded that the cup of orange juice is better than the cup of tea by exactly the same amount by which the cup of tea is better than the cup of water. Formally speaking, this means that if one has a cup of tea, she would be willing to take any bet with a probability, p, greater than .5 of getting a cup of juice, with a risk of getting a cup of water equal to  1-p. One cannot conclude, however, that the cup of tea is two thirds as good as the cup of juice, because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences, but also on the "zero" of utility. For example, if the "zero" of utility was located at -40, then a cup of orange juice would be 160 utils more than zero, a cup of tea 120 utils more than zero.

[[Neoclassical economics]] has largely retreated from using cardinal utility functions as the basis of economic behavior. A notable exception is in the context of analyzing choice under conditions of risk (see [[#Expected utility|below]]).

Sometimes cardinal utility is used to aggregate utilities across persons, to create a [[social welfare function]].

===Ordinal===
{{Main|Ordinal utility}}

When ordinal utilities are used, differences in utils (values taken on by the utility function) are treated as ethically or behaviorally meaningless:  the utility index encodes a full behavioral ordering between members of a choice set, but tells nothing about the related ''strength of preferences''. In the above example, it would only be possible to say that juice is preferred to tea to water, but no more.

Ordinal utility functions are unique [[up to]] increasing [[Monotonic function#Monotonic transformation|monotone (or monotonic) transformations]]. For example, if a function &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is taken as ordinal, it is equivalent to the function &lt;math&gt;u(x)^3&lt;/math&gt;, because taking the 3rd power is an increasing monotone transformation (or monotonic transformation). This means that the ordinal preference induced by these functions is the same (although they are two different functions). In contrast,  cardinal utilities are unique only up to increasing linear transformations, so if &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is taken as cardinal, it is not equivalent to &lt;math&gt;u(x)^3&lt;/math&gt;.

===Preferences===

Although [[Preference (economics)|preference]]s are the conventional foundation of [[microeconomics]], it is often convenient to represent preferences with a utility [[Function (mathematics)|function]] and analyze human behavior indirectly with utility functions.  Let ''X'' be the '''consumption set''', the set of all mutually-exclusive baskets the consumer could conceivably consume.  The consumer's '''utility function''' &lt;math&gt; u\colon X\to \R&lt;/math&gt; ranks each package in the consumption set.  If the consumer strictly prefers ''x'' to ''y'' or is indifferent between them, then &lt;math&gt;u(x)\geq u(y)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, suppose a consumer's consumption set is ''X'' =&amp;nbsp;{nothing, 1&amp;nbsp;apple,1&amp;nbsp;orange, 1&amp;nbsp;apple and 1&amp;nbsp;orange, 2&amp;nbsp;apples, 2&amp;nbsp;oranges}, and its utility function is ''u''(nothing)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''u''(1&amp;nbsp;apple)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''u''(1&amp;nbsp;orange)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''u''(1&amp;nbsp;apple and 1&amp;nbsp;orange)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, ''u''(2&amp;nbsp;apples)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''u''(2&amp;nbsp;oranges)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.  Then this consumer prefers 1 orange to 1 apple, but prefers one of each to 2 oranges.

In micro-economic models, there are usually a finite set of L commodities, and a consumer may consume an arbitrary amount of each commodity.  This gives a consumption set of &lt;math&gt;\R^L_+&lt;/math&gt;, and each package &lt;math&gt;x \in \R^L_+&lt;/math&gt; is a vector containing the amounts of each commodity.  In the previous example, we might say there are two commodities: apples and oranges.  If we say apples is the first commodity, and oranges the second, then the consumption set &lt;math&gt;X =\R^2_+&lt;/math&gt; and ''u''(0,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''u''(1,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''u''(0,&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''u''(1,&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, ''u''(2,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''u''(0,&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 as before.  Note that for ''u'' to be a utility function on&amp;nbsp;''X'', it must be defined for every package in&amp;nbsp;''X''.

A utility function &lt;math&gt; u\colon X\to \R&lt;/math&gt; '''represents''' a preference relation &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; on X [[if and only if|iff]] for every &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u(x)\leq u(y)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\preceq  y&lt;/math&gt;.  If u represents &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, then this implies &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; is complete and transitive, and hence rational.

===Revealed preferences in finance===

In financial applications, e.g. [[portfolio optimization]], an investor chooses financial portfolio which maximizes his/her own utility function, or, equivalently, minimizes his/her [[risk measure]]. For example, [[modern portfolio theory]] selects variance as a measure of risk; other popular theories are [[expected utility theory]]&lt;ref name="exputility"&gt;Von Neumann, J., Morgenstern, O. (1953). Theory of games and economic behavior, 3rd ed., Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[prospect theory]].&lt;ref name="prosp"&gt;Kahneman, D., Tversky, A. (1979).
Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica, 47, 263-291.&lt;/ref&gt; To determine specific utility function for any given investor, one could design a questionnaire procedure with questions in the form: How much would you pay for ''x%'' chance of getting ''y''? Revealed preference theory suggests a more direct  approach: observe a portfolio ''X*'' which an investor currently holds, and then find a utility function/risk measure such that ''X*'' becomes an optimal portfolio.&lt;ref name="riskinverse"&gt;Grechuk, B., Zabarankin, M. (2016). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283985485_Inverse_Portfolio_Problem_With_Coherent_Risk_Measures Inverse portfolio problem with coherent risk measures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903204155/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283985485_Inverse_Portfolio_Problem_With_Coherent_Risk_Measures |date=3 September 2017 }}, European Journal of Operational Research 249(2), 740-750.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===

In order to simplify calculations, various alternative assumptions have been made concerning details of human preferences, and these imply various alternative utility functions such as:

* [[constant elasticity of substitution|CES]] (''constant elasticity of substitution'', or ''[[isoelastic utility|isoelastic]]'') utility
* [[Isoelastic utility]]
* [[Exponential utility]]
* [[Quasilinear utility]]
* [[Homothetic preferences]]
* [[Stone–Geary utility function]]
* [[Gorman polar form]]
** [[Greenwood–Hercowitz–Huffman preferences]]
** [[King–Plosser–Rebelo preferences]]
* [[Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion]]

Most utility functions used in modeling or theory are '''well-behaved.''' They are usually monotonic and quasi-concave. However, it is possible for preferences not to be representable by a utility function. An example is [[lexicographic preferences]] which are not continuous and cannot be represented by a continuous utility function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan E., Jr. |last=Ingersoll |title=Theory of Financial Decision Making |location=Totowa |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |year=1987 |page=21 |isbn=0-8476-7359-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expected==
{{Main|Expected utility hypothesis}}

The expected utility theory deals with the analysis of choices among '''risky''' projects with multiple (possibly multidimensional) outcomes.

The [[St. Petersburg paradox]] was first proposed by [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicholas Bernoulli]] in 1713 and solved by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738. D. Bernoulli argued that the paradox could be resolved if decision-makers displayed [[risk aversion]] and argued for a logarithmic cardinal utility function. (Analyses of international survey data in the 21st century have shown that insofar as utility represents happiness, as in [[utilitarianism]], it is indeed proportional to log income.)

The first important use of the expected utility theory was that of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]], who used the assumption of expected utility maximization in their formulation of [[game theory]].

===von Neumann–Morgenstern===
{{Main|Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem}}

Von Neumann and Morgenstern addressed situations in which the outcomes of choices are not known with certainty, but have probabilities attached to them.

A notation for a ''[[Lottery (probability)|lottery]]'' is as follows: if options A and B have probability ''p'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'' in the lottery, we write it as a linear combination:
:&lt;math&gt;
L = p A + (1-p) B
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for a lottery with many possible options:

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \sum_i p_i A_i,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sum_i p_i =1&lt;/math&gt;.

By making some reasonable assumptions about the way choices behave, von Neumann and Morgenstern showed that if an agent can choose between the lotteries, then this agent has a utility function such that the desirability of an arbitrary lottery can be calculated as a linear combination of the utilities of its parts, with the weights being their probabilities of occurring.

This is called the ''expected utility theorem''. The required assumptions are four axioms about the properties of the agent's [[preference relation]] over 'simple lotteries', which are lotteries with just two options. Writing &lt;math&gt;B\preceq A&lt;/math&gt; to mean 'A is weakly preferred to B' ('A is preferred at least as much as B'), the axioms are:

# completeness: For any two simple lotteries &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;L\preceq M&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;M\preceq L&lt;/math&gt; (or both, in which case they are viewed as equally desirable).
# transitivity: for any three lotteries &lt;math&gt;L,M,N&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;L\preceq M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M\preceq N&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;L\preceq N&lt;/math&gt;.
# convexity/continuity (Archimedean property): If &lt;math&gt;L \preceq M\preceq N&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 1 such that the lottery &lt;math&gt;pL + (1-p)N&lt;/math&gt; is equally desirable as &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
# independence: for any three lotteries &lt;math&gt;L,M,N&lt;/math&gt; and any probability ''p'', &lt;math&gt;L \preceq M&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;pL+(1-p)N \preceq pM+(1-p)N&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, if the lottery formed by the probabilistic combination of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is no more preferable than the lottery formed by the same probabilistic combination of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N,&lt;/math&gt; then and only then &lt;math&gt;L \preceq M&lt;/math&gt;.

Axioms 3 and 4 enable us to decide about the relative utilities of two assets or lotteries.

In more formal language: A von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function is a function from choices to the real numbers:
:&lt;math&gt; u\colon X\to \R&lt;/math&gt;
which assigns a real number to every outcome in a way that captures the agent's preferences over simple lotteries. Under the four assumptions mentioned above, the agent will prefer a lottery &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; to a lottery &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if, for the utility function characterizing that agent, the expected utility of &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the expected utility of &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;L_1\preceq L_2 \text{ iff } u(L_1)\leq u(L_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Of all the axioms, independence is the most often discarded. A variety of [[generalized expected utility]] theories have arisen, most of which drop or relax the independence axiom.

===As probability of success===
Castagnoli and LiCalzi and Bordley and LiCalzi (2000) provided another interpretation for Von Neumann and Morgenstern's theory.  Specifically for any utility function, there exists a hypothetical reference lottery with the expected utility of an arbitrary lottery being its probability of performing no worse than the reference lottery. Suppose success is defined as getting an outcome no worse than the outcome of the reference lottery.  Then this mathematical equivalence means that maximizing expected utility is equivalent to maximizing the probability of success. In many contexts, this makes the concept of utility easier to justify and to apply. For example, a firm's utility might be the probability of meeting uncertain future customer expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Castagnoli, E. and M. LiCalzi. "Expected Utility Theory without Utility."

==Indirect==
{{Main|Indirect utility}}

An indirect utility function gives the optimal attainable value of a given utility function, which depends on the prices of the goods and the income or wealth level that the individual possesses.

===Money===

One use of the indirect utility concept is the notion of the utility of money.  The (indirect) utility function for money is a nonlinear function that is [[bounded function|bounded]] and asymmetric about the origin. The utility function is [[concave function|concave]] in the positive region, reflecting the phenomenon of [[diminishing marginal utility]].  The boundedness reflects the fact that beyond a certain point money ceases being useful at all, as the size of any economy at any point in time is itself bounded.  The asymmetry about the origin reflects the fact that gaining and losing money can have radically different implications both for individuals and businesses.  The non-linearity of the utility function for money has profound implications in decision making processes: in situations where outcomes of choices influence utility through gains or losses of money, which are the norm in most business settings, the optimal choice for a given decision depends on the possible outcomes of all other decisions in the same time-period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. O. |last=Berger |title=Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer-Verlag |edition=2nd |year=1985 |chapter=Utility and Loss |isbn=3-540-96098-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion and criticism==
Cambridge economist [[Joan Robinson]] famously criticized utility for being a circular concept: "Utility is the quality in commodities that makes individuals want to buy them, and the fact that individuals want to buy commodities shows that they have utility"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joan |last=Robinson |year=1962 |title=Economic Philosophy |location=Harmondsworth, Middle-sex, UK |publisher=Penguin Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}} Robinson also pointed out that because the theory assumes that preferences are fixed this means that utility is not a testable assumption. This is so because if we take changes in peoples' behavior in relation to a change in prices or a change in the underlying budget constraint we can never be sure to what extent the change in behavior was due to the change in price or budget constraint and how much was due to a change in preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pilkington |first=Philip |title=Joan Robinson’s Critique of Marginal Utility Theory |work=Fixing the Economists |date=17 February 2014 |url=https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/joan-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112846/https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/joan-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory/ |archivedate=13 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is similar to that of the philosopher [[Hans Albert]] who argued that the ceteris paribus conditions on which the marginalist theory of demand rested rendered the theory itself an empty tautology and completely closed to experimental testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pilkington |first=Philip |title=utility Hans Albert Expands Robinson’s Critique of Marginal Utility Theory to the Law of Demand |work=Fixing the Economists |date=27 February 2014 |url=https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/hans-albert-expands-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory-to-the-law-of-demand/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719164628/https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/hans-albert-expands-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory-to-the-law-of-demand/ |archivedate=19 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, demand and supply curve (theoretical line of quantity of a product which would have been offered or requested for given price) is purely ontological and could never been demonstrated empirically.

Another criticism comes from the assertion that neither cardinal nor ordinal utility is empirically observable in the real world. In the case of cardinal utility it is impossible to measure the level of satisfaction "quantitatively" when someone consumes or purchases an apple. In case of ordinal utility, it is impossible to determine what choices were made when someone purchases, for example, an orange. Any act would involve preference over a vast [[set (mathematics)|set]] of choices (such as apple, orange juice, other vegetable, vitamin C tablets, exercise, not purchasing, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cujif/ABSTRACT/980606.htm |title=Revealed Preference Theory |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090409/http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cujif/ABSTRACT/980606.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~botond/mistakeschicago.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015203300/http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~botond/mistakeschicago.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other questions of what arguments ought to enter into a utility function are difficult to answer, yet seem necessary to understanding utility. Whether people gain utility from coherence of wants, beliefs or a sense of duty is key to understanding their behavior in the utility organon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Daniel|title=Professor|journal=Econ Journal Watch|date=May 2014|volume=11|issue=2|pages=97–105|url=http://econjwatch.org/file_download/826/CompleteIssueMay2014.pdf|accessdate=November 15, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005153234/http://econjwatch.org/file_download/826/CompleteIssueMay2014.pdf|archivedate=5 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, choosing between alternatives is itself a process of determining what to consider as alternatives, a question of choice within uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=Towards a Better Life|date=1932|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14817">The '''World3''' [[model (abstract)|model]] is a [[system dynamics]] model for [[computer simulation]] of interactions between population, industrial growth, food production and limits in the [[ecosystem]]s of the earth. It was originally produced and used by a [[Club of Rome]] study that produced the model and the book ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' (1972). The creators of the model were [[Dennis Meadows]], project manager, and a team of 16 researchers.&lt;ref name="Meadows-1972"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadows|first1=Donella H|last2=Meadows|first2=Dennis L|last3=Randers|first3=Jørgen|last4=Behrens III|first4=William W|title=The Limits to Growth; A Report for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind|date=1972|publisher=Universe Books|location=New York|isbn=0876631650|url=http://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Limits-to-Growth-digital-scan-version.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|8}}  

The model was documented in the book ''Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World''. It added new features to [[Jay W. Forrester]]'s World2 model. Since World3 was originally created, it has had minor tweaks to get to the World3/91 model used in the book ''[[Beyond the Limits]]'', later improved to get the World3/2000 model distributed by the [[Institute for Policy and Social Science Research]] and finally the World3/2004 model used in the book ''Limits to Growth: the 30 year update''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meadows|first1=Donella|last2=Randers|first2=Jorgen|last3=Meadows|first3=Dennis|title=A Synopsis: Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update|url=http://donellameadows.org/archives/a-synopsis-limits-to-growth-the-30-year-update/|website=Donella Meadows Project|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World3 is one of several global models that have been generated throughout the world (Mesarovic/Pestel Model, Bariloche Model, MOIRA Model, SARU Model, FUGI Model) and is probably the model that generated the spark for all later models.

== Model ==
The model consisted of several interacting parts.  Each of these dealt with a different system of the model.  The main systems were 
*the food system, dealing with agriculture and food production
*the industrial system
*the population system
*the non-renewable resources system
*the pollution system

=== Agricultural system ===
The simplest useful view of this system is that land and [[fertilizer]] are used for [[farm]]ing, and more of either will produce more food. In the context of the model, since land is finite, and industrial output required to produce fertilizer and other [[agricultural]] inputs can not keep up with demand, there necessarily will be a food collapse at some point in the future.

=== Nonrenewable resources system ===
{{main|World3 nonrenewable resource sector}}

The nonrenewable resource system starts with the assumption that the total amount of resources available is finite (about 110 times the consumption at 1990s rates for the World3/91 model). These resources can be extracted and then used for various purposes in other systems in the model. An important assumption that was made is that as the nonrenewable resources are extracted, the remaining resources are increasingly difficult to extract, thus diverting more and more industrial output to resource extraction.

=== Reference run predictions ===
The ''Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World'' provides several different scenarios. The "reference run" is the one that "represent the most likely behavior mode of the system if the process of industrialization in the future proceeds in a way very similar to its progress in the past, and if technologies and value changes that have already been institutionalized continue to evolve."&lt;ref name="Meadows et al.-1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadows|first1=Dennis L., et al.|title=Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World|date=1974|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0262131420|url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Dynamics-Growth-Finite-World-Dennis-L-Meadows/9780262131421|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|502}} In this scenario, in 2000, the world population reaches six billion, and then goes on to peak at seven billion in 2030. After that population declines because of an increased death rate. In 2015, both industrial output per capita and food per capita peak at US$375 per person (1970s dollars) and 500 vegetable-equivalent kilograms/person. Persistent pollution peaks in the year 2035 at 11 times 1970s levels.&lt;ref name="Meadows et al.-1974"/&gt;{{RP|500}}

== Criticism of the model ==
There has been quite a bit of criticism of the World3 model. Some has come from the model creators themselves, some has come from economists and some has come from other places.

One of the major criticisms of the model is that it simply has not reflected the reality of the world since the 1970s when the model was first published.{{fact|date=January 2011}} At least one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.05.001 | title = A comparison of the Limits to Growth with 30 years of reality | year = 2008 | last1 = Turner | first1 = G. | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 397–411  }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, claims that "30 years of historical data compare favorably with key features of a business-as-usual scenario called the 'standard run' scenario" produced by the World3 model.

In the book ''Groping in the Dark: The First Decade of Global Modelling'',&lt;ref name="Meadows-1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadows|first1=Donella H.|title=Groping in the dark: the first decade of global modelling| date=1982| publisher=Wiley| location=New York|isbn=0471100277|url=https://books.google.co.th/books/about/Groping_in_the_dark.html?id=QPaQAAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|129}} [[Donella Meadows]] states: &lt;blockquote&gt;We have great confidence in the basic qualitative assumptions and conclusions about the instability of the current global socioeconomic system and the general kinds of changes that will and will not lead to stability. We have relatively great confidence in the feedback-loop structure of the model, with some exceptions which I list below.  We have a mixed degree of confidence in the numerical parameters of the model; some are well-known physical or biological constants that are unlikely to change, some are statistically derived social indices quite likely to change, and some are pure guesses that are perhaps only of the right order of magnitude. The structural assumptions in World3 that I consider most dubious and also sensitive enough to be of concern are:

*the constant capital-output ratio (which assumes no diminishing returns to capital)
*the residual nature of the investment function
*the generally ineffective labour contribution to output&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A detailed criticism of the model is in the book ''Models of Doom: A Critique of the Limits to Growth''.&lt;ref name="Cole-1973"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=H. S. D.|last2=Freeman|first2=Christopher|title=Models of Doom: A Critique of the Limits to Growth|date=1973|publisher=Vhps Rizzoli|isbn=0876639058|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Models-Doom-Critique-Limits-Growth/dp/0876639058|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|905-908}}

Both [[Julian Lincoln Simon]] and [[Bjørn Lomborg]] have discussed the assumptions that the model makes. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The first assumption that they criticize is the assumption of finite natural resources.  They also state that the limits on agriculture are invalid since they are based on the limit of the amount of land.

[[Vaclav Smil]] disagreed with the combination of physically different processes into simplified equations:
 
:But those of us who knew the [[DYNAMO (programming language)|DYNAMO]] language in which the simulation was written and those who took the model apart line-by-line quickly realized that we had to deal with an exercise in misinformation and obfustication rather than with a model delivering valuable insights.  I was particularly astonished by the variables labelled ''Nonrenewable Resources'' and ''Pollution''. Lumping together (to cite just a few scores of possible examples) highly substitutable but relatively limited resources of liquid oil with unsubstitutable but immense deposits of sedimentary phosphate rocks, or short-lived atmospheric gases with long-lived radioactive wastes, struck me as extraordinarily meaningless.&lt;ref name="Smil-2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smil|first1=Vaclav|title=Energy at the Crossroads; Global Perspectives and Uncertainties|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780262693240|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/energy-crossroads|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|168}}

He does however consider continuous growth in world GDP a problem:

:Only the widespread scientific illiteracy and innumeracy—all you need to know in this case is how to execute the equation &lt;math&gt;y = x * e^{rt}&lt;/math&gt;—prevents most of the people from dismissing the idea of sustainable growth at healthy rates as an oxymoronic stupidity whose pursuit is, unfortunately, infinitely more tragic than comic. After all, even cancerous cells stop growing once they have destroyed the invaded tissues.&lt;ref name="Smil-2005"/&gt;{{RP|338-339}}

Others have put forth criticisms, such as Henshaw, King, and Zarnikau who in a 2011 paper, ''Systems Energy Assessment''&lt;ref&gt; Henshaw, King, Zarnikau, 2011 ''Systems Energy Assessment''. ''Sustainability'', 3(10), 1908-1943; doi:10.3390/su3101908 &lt;/ref&gt; point out that the methodology of such models may be valid empirically as a world model, but might not then also be useful for decision making. The impact data being used is generally collected according to where the impacts are recorded as occurring, following standard I/O material processes accounting methods. It is not reorganized according to who pays for or profits from the impacts, so who is actually responsible for economic impacts is never determined.  

*The economic motives causing the impacts, that might also control them, would then not be reflected in the model.
*As a seeming technicality, it could bring into question the use of many kinds of economic models for sustainability decision-making.

The authors of the book ''Surviving 1,000 Centuries'' consider some of the predictions too pessimistic, but some of the overall message correct.&lt;ref name="Bonnet-2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonnet|first1=Roger-Maurice|last2=Woltjer|first2=Lodewijk|title=Surviving 1,000 Centuries; Can we do it?|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9780387746333|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=83zhYT7kvgkC&amp;pg=PA314&amp;lpg=PA314&amp;dq=Surviving+1,000+Centuries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uzkCQRyzL3&amp;sig=TaIRlN9ABnqTfp4UhBYGB5yatPk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjt8q-sOHXAhUDLo8KHQ3hAJIQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Surviving%201%2C000%20Centuries&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|4-5}}&lt;blockquote&gt;...[We] come to the well-known study, ''Limits to Growth'', published under the sponsorship of the 'Club de Rome' - an influential body of private individuals.  A first attempt was made to make a complete systems analysis of the rapidly growing human-biological-resource-pollution system.  In this  analysis the manifold interactions between the different parts were explicitly taken into account.  The conclusion was that disaster was waiting around the corner in a few decades because of resource exhaustion, pollution and other factors.  Now, 35 years later, our world still exists, ... So the 'growth lobby' has laughed and proclaimed that ''Limits to Growth'' and, by extension, the environmental movements may be forgotten.  This entirely misses the point.  Certainly the timescale of the problems was underestimated in ''Limits to Growth'', giving us a little more time than we thought.  Moreover, during the last three decades a variety of national or collaborative international measures have been taken that have forced reductions in pollution, as we shall discuss.  A shining example of this is the Montreal Protocol (1987) that limited the industrial production of fluorocarbons that damage the ozone layer and generated the 'ozone hole' over Antarctica. The publication of ''Limits to Growth'' has greatly contributed towards creating the general willingness of governments to consider such issues.  Technological developments have also lead to improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and other resources, but, most importantly, the warnings from Malthus onward have finally had their effect as may be seen from the population-limiting policies followed by China and, more hesitantly, by India.  Without such policies all other efforts would be in vain.  However, the basic message of ''Limits to Growth'', that exponential growth of our world civilization cannot continue very long and that a very careful management of the planet is needed, remain as valid as ever.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
