'''Against All Authority''' (often abbreviated '''-AAA-''') was an American [[punk band]], formed in Florida in 1992. Playing in the [[ska punk]] style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Against_All_Authority/Discography/album/P279226/R832130/ |title=Restoration of Chaos &amp; Order Album Review, Songs, Ratings |work=Starpulse.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; their business practice follows a stringent [[DIY ethic]]. Since their disbandment, Joe has started [[ajamrecords.com|A Jam Records]] with friend Dave Santos. They have been signing local punk and alternative acts in Florida, most recently Pop Punk band [http://dialdrivefl.com Dial Drive ] from [[Orlando, Florida]]

==History==
Against All Authority was founded in [[Cutler Ridge, Florida]] in [[1992 in music|1992]],&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web | title=Against All Authority|work=Allmusic| url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p279226|pure_url=yes}}| accessdate=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  driven by willingness to promote their message—"questioning our economic differences and promoting our human similarities", as stated by their now defunct official website. A strong engagement in political and social issues is clearly evident in their lyrics. The band maintain a fierce DIY stance influenced by the approach of the [[Dead Kennedys]] and [[Subhumans (UK band)|Subhumans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Punk Band That Most Certainly Does Not Suck |work=[[Nerve (magazine)|Nerve Magazine]] |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928192630/http://www.thenervemagazine.com/2006/07/article_template.php?id=1 |url=http://www.thenervemagazine.com/2006/07/article_template.php?id=1 |accessdate=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in their career the band decided to book concerts, make recordings and even produce band T-shirts on their own.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt; Their first release "Above The Law" was released on Far Out Records. Later they signed on independent label [[Hopeless Records]], becoming one of their major bands. In addition to touring and recording, the band is frequently involved in demonstrations and social projects. They have also influenced a number of other bands. Guitar player Joe Koontz has formed a new band called Nobody's Hero, with members of [[The Vandals]] and [[Guajiro (band)|Guajiro]].&lt;!-- www.reverbnation.com/nobodyshero305 --&gt; Trombonist [[Fin Leavell]]  is now fronting the band [[Nightswim]].&lt;!-- www.nightswim.com --&gt; Drummer Macbeth Proenza also formed a new band called Hit Play!, with former members of Polly Esther, Underpaid, Crooked Edge &amp; Hero of Our time .

The '''Altavista petroglyph complex''' is located near the village and beach-town of [[Chacala]], south of the Compostela Municipality, in [[Nayarit]] [[Mexico]].

The area is known as "La Pila del Rey", "Chacalán", "El Santuario", "The Petroglyphs” or "the Altavista petroglyphs", near the Jaltemba Bay, in the Pacific Ocean of Nayarit.&lt;ref name= Richard &gt;{{cite journal |last= Lawhorn |first= Richard |date= |title= Petroglyphs at Altavista |trans-title= Petroglifos en Altavista |journal= |location= |url=http://richardlawhorn.com/altavista/pila_del_rey.html |accessdate=Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This region was originally home to the largely unstudied [[Tecoxquin]] (Tequectequi) native culture dating from approximately 2000 BC to 2300 BCE.&lt;ref name="Vecinal"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pro-conservacion Difusion del Patrimonio Historico Cultural de Las Varas Nayarit A.C. |last= |first= |authorlink=  |year= |publisher=Ejido de Altavista. C.E.C.A.N. / I.N.A.H. |location= |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 56 petroglyphs whose antiquity cannot be accurately determined. Aside from its cultural and archeological importance, the site remains an important religious center for the [[Huichol people|Huichol]]es who still leave offerings and perform ceremonies here.&lt;ref name="MexDes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armendáriz |first=Lorenzo |date=February 2008 |title=Viva la Riviera Nayarita |journal=Guía México Desconocido |volume=372 |pages=70–77 |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/8261-Viva-la-Riviera-Nayarita.-Sus-playas,-sus-frutos-del-mar,-su-paz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811110947/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/8261-Viva-la-Riviera-Nayarita.-Sus-playas%2C-sus-frutos-del-mar%2C-su-paz |archivedate=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prehispanic times, the Compostela municipality area was inhabited by the Mazatán peoples, tributary of Xalisco-Zacualpan Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit COMPOSTELA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517162123/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_nayarit |date=2011-05-17 }} Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Nayarit (Spanish) Oct. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petroglyphs==
The Tecoxquines (Aztec Group) engraved images in volcanic stone over two thousand years ago near Las Piletas. These petroglyphs perhaps were symbolic elements of everyday life, as far as health, fertility, rains, and crops. The rock carvings might have been meant as prayers or offerings to the gods responsible for these things.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

There are fifteen signs (Spanish &amp; English posted along entrance path,&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt; a brief summary is provided below:

=== Sign 1 - Altavista===
Altavista petroglyphs archaeological site, located along the sides of a creek on the slopes the Copo volcano. Covers an area of approximately 80&amp;nbsp;hectares, with a large concentration of petroglyphs. (More than 2000 engravings identified)&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

=== Sign 2 - The Tecoxquin (Throat-Cutters) ===
Original Altavista inhabitants. This native group inhabited a vast region covering the South coast of Nayarit, neighbouring coasts, and mountainous regions of Jalisco, Mexico. They were mainly farmers, fishermen, salt producers and traders of cocoa and cotton. The Tecoxquines were organized in a number of villages under the control of Teuzacualpan Chila Valley (modern city of Zacualpan). Business links allowed them to develop an intensive trade, reached Sinaloa to the north and Colima and Michoacán to the South and East.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 3 - Religious Life (Tecoxquines)===
No doubt, many religious ceremonies at this site were based on nahualism. [[Nagual|Nahualism]] or [[Shamanism]] as former religious practices whereby people communicated with their gods and spirits during altered states of consciousness. This tradition has deep roots in the region; the Nayarit word derives from the word "nahualli". The Tecoxquines used psychotropic plants and tobacco plants to achieve states of ecstasy and communicate with their gods.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 4 - The Last of The Tecoxquines===
[[File:Altavistapeto3.jpg|thumb|350px|Petroglyphs at Altavista Site, Compostela, Nayarit.]]
After the Spanish conquest, the Tecoxquines completely annihilated by epidemics and forced labor. Today native cities of the region still talk about "white Indians," ghosts appearing from the mountains to honor their ancient gods.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 5 – The Tecuales===
The Tecoxquin ancient villages, as far as the Ixtapa salt producers, were populated by Tecuales, ancestors of the current Huichol.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 6 - The Water Cycle ===
Nayarit State is characterized by heavy rainfall. Rainfall is concentrated between May and October. The Altavista mountains attract heavy rains leaving drier areas to the East (desert weather at the opposite side). Perhaps because of this abundance of water, Altavista was considered a special place.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 7 - Tomoanchan (or Tamoanchan)===
[[Tamoanchan]] is a mythical paradisiac location known to the [[Mesoamerican]] cultures of the central Mexican region in the Late Postclassical period, is a central part of the ancient Mesoamerican cosmology. Tamoanchan is the cosmic tree that connects life and supports the world. Its roots are underground in the water and fertility field. Its trunk is between human beings above ground and heavens. The Crown of the tree is in heaven, the kingdom of gods and rain. Tamoanchan was represented by the Ceiba tree.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 8 - Warfare: Trophy Heads ===
The "Guerra Florida " (flower war) was one of the main religious practices associated with the Tecoxquines. The aim was not to conquer. Rather, get warriors prisoners for ritual sacrifice, and whose heads were cut and then offered to the gods. These wars were usually produced locally, but also conducted in places as far away as the Talpa and Mascota Valleys and Mochitiltic Canyon in Jalisco.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 9 – Tlalocan===
water was thought to be underground in ancient Mesoamerica, hence the underworld was considered a fertile place. Tlalocan was the "water"paradise underground. It was inhabited by the “Chanes”, or water spirits, as well as the spirits of people drowned or whose death was water related. Tlalocan also was the site of the legendary crocodile [[Cipactli]],&lt;ref&gt;in Aztec mythology; Cipactli was a voracious, primitive and monstrous creature, half crocodile, half fish. It was always hungry, and in each joint of its 18 bodies had a mouth adorning it. Tezcatlipoca sacrificed a foot, using it as bait to attract it. It is also the first day of the sacred Aztec calendar, Tonalpohualli.&lt;/ref&gt; a "earth monster", symbolizing fertility.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 10 – The Devoted Christ ===
The first historical references of the archaeological site of Altavista date from 1612. These describe many crosses, and above all, a devout Christ that local people venerates. This is possibly a reference to the "corn man", a figure that symbolizes fertility and growth. Local farmers leave offerings of candles and gourd bowls of salt to this figure in order to obtain fertility for their coffee and tobacco crops.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 11 – The Apostle Matthew ===
During the early 17TH century, Spaniards believed that the Apostle Matthew traveled to the new world in prehispanic times to evangelize natives. This is thought to explain the crosses engraved in the Altavista rocks.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 12 – The Cross ===
For Tecoxquines, as well as for most ancient Mesoamerican, the cross actually was a mental map of the cosmos. Symbolizes five sacred directions: the four cardinal points and the center. Each is associated with certain gods, colors, and sacred kingdoms, as well as each of the four trees that formed the tamoanchan kingdoms. The idea of the universe of four corners is still present among native Mexico today, symbolized by crosses, diamonds and other similar forms.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 13 – Communication With The Gods ===
The Altavista rocks were probably associated with the mythical [[Tamoanchan]] trees connecting the underworld, earth and heaven. The prayers of the people went up through the sap of the trunks into the realm of the gods. In turn, the gifts of the gods, rain, fertility and good health returned to land the same way. For the Tecoxquines the Altavista rocks would have served the same purpose, a means of communication between the people and their gods.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 14 – Tecoxquin Symbolism ===
Spirals, wavy lines, and other symbols carved in the Altavista rocks probably constitute a ritual prayer language for the gods. As an agricultural culture, the Tocoxquines would have been concerned with rain, fertility of the land and the continuity of the seasonal rhythms that they relied on. While the exact meaning of symbols will never be known, spirals have been interpreted as the Sun, storm, the wind, the spiral snake, or as a symbol of the natural cycle of station rainy and dry.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

===Sign 15 –Huichol Offerings===
Huichol natives occasionally visit Altavista originally lived in the Nayar mountains, recently a group moved to the Las Varas area. They present offerings and perform ceremonies for Nakahue, "our fertility grandmother" and Tatevari, "our grandfather of fire". Some Huicholes also travel to the nearby Chacala Port, where ancient petroglyphs are present and leave offerings for Tatei Aramara “our mother Ocean”.&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

The '''Association of Polish Artists and Designers''' ({{lang|pl|Związek Polskich Artystów Plastyków}}, ZPAP) is an official association of professional artists in [[Poland]], representing more than 8,500 learned artists working in the field of [[visual arts]], including: painting, sculpture, graphic design, interior and set design, ceramics, fabric arts, as well as new media, and [[art restoration]].

The Association was founded in 1911 in [[Kraków]] during the [[Partitions of Poland]]. In [[Polish culture in the Interbellum|the interwar period]] until 1939 it served as a trade union and in 1945, following World War II, it was formally re-established as an association.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Sujo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y7WuzDK3dSkC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=ZPAP  ''Legacies of Silence''.] Published by New Age Publishers, 2001; 127 pages. {{ISBN|0-85667-534-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artluk.com/onas.php  ''artluk'' Magazine] with funds by [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage of the Republic of Poland|Polish Ministry of Culture and Art]]. {{en icon}} {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, ZPAP supported the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] and opposed the imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law in 1981]]. Consequently, the military authorities disbanded the Association when it refused to retract its [[communiqué]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Umbrella Magazine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FGlUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=1982+%22The+suspension+of+ZPAP,+reported+by+the+official+press,+was+ordered+after+it+refused+to+retract+eight+communiques+released+in+the+last+year%22&amp;dq=1982+%22The+suspension+of+ZPAP,+reported+by+the+official+press,+was+ordered+after+it+refused+to+retract+eight+communiques+released+in+the+last+year%22&amp;pgis=1  Item notes: v. 5-7, page 68.] Published by Umbrella Associates, U.S., 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Inglot, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RnAaq6ws_kMC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=%22the+majority+of+artists+joined+in+the+widespread+national+effort+to+break+the+party-state+monopoly%22#PPA95,M1  ''The Figurative Sculpture of Magdalena Abakanowicz''], page 95. Published by University of California Press, 2004; 154 pages. {{nobreak|{{ISBN|0-520-23125-2}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ZPAP operated unofficially until the [[History of Poland (1989–present)|restoration of democracy]] in 1989. Today, ZPAP features prominently across the country with 23 regional Chapters, paid staff, curators, publications, and regional art galleries promoting work of its members.&lt;ref name="IAM"&gt;Instytut Adama Mickiewicza, [http://www.culture.pl/pl/culture/artykuly/in_or_zpap  "Sztuki wizualne: Związek Polskich Artystów Plastyków"] at www.culture.pl ISSN 1734-0624 Nr 2628&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
ZPAP membership is limited to graduates of art faculties of relevant institutions of higher learning, with the main emphasis on regional Academies of Fine Arts. On top of its creative presence in major Polish cities, the Association operates two professional development retreats, in [[Ustka]] and in [[Świnoujście]].&lt;ref name="IAM" /&gt; It sponsors dozens of commercial art galleries across Poland as well as selected stores with professional art supplies. ZPAP organizes a number of annual events, and offers its own [[Jan Cybis]] Award for creative achievement. In 1996 the Association organized the UNESCO conference around the international status of an artist.&lt;ref name="IAM" /&gt; It is the leading advocacy group working in conjunction with the Polish governmental agencies regulating labor laws applicable to practising art professionals. ZPAP is represented in the World Executive Committee of the [[International Association of Art]] (IAA).&lt;ref name="zpap.org"&gt;[http://www.zpap.org.pl/index.php?IdKat=1003010018&amp;IdKat2=1157655602  Official webpage of The Association of Polish Artists and Designers] {{en icon}} {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, ZPAP manages copyrights of about 1,000 members and is in charge of issuing  licenses for the commercial use of their artwork. The economic nonprofit activity of the Association is geared toward generating funds necessary for the maintaining of its venues, as well as providing financial support for members in need.&lt;ref name="zpap.org"/&gt;

The main office of ZPAP is in [[Warsaw]] and is located at the upper floor of the historic [[Kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]] Efrosa at [[Nowy Świat Street|ul. Nowy Świat]] 7 ''(pictured)'', where Princes of the [[Lubomirski family]] once lived in the 18th century. The building was rebuilt with its original [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] portal intact following wartime destruction of the Polish capital.&lt;ref name="zpap.org"/&gt;

Regional chapters of ZPAP are located in the following cities: [[Białystok]], [[Bielsko-Biała]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Częstochowa]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Katowice]], [[Kielce]], [[Koszalin]], [[Kraków]], [[Lublin]], [[Łódź]], [[Olsztyn]], [[Opole]], [[Poznań]], [[Radom]], [[Rzeszów]], [[Szczecin]], [[Toruń]], [[Warszawa]], [[Wrocław]], [[Zakopane]], [[Zielona Góra]], and [[Gliwice]].

'''Bad Girrls Studios''' was a popular [[Boston]] [[Art gallery|gallery]] and performance space from 1996 to 2000, located at 209 Green Street in Jamaica Plain. Founded by [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] student Jessica Brand, the [[artist-run]] studio hosted numerous events until it closed due to pressure from the [[Boston Licensing Commission]] and lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/03/04/no_alternative/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=No alternative | first=Geoff | last=Edgers | date=March 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=98915 The Harvard Crimson :: Arts :: The Field Guide: Art in Boston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://users.rcn.com/kyp/dog.html Putting Shakespeare's Dog to Sleep&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad Girrls Studios supported [[female]] artists in particular, and art that pushed boundaries of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], the largest of which was a 1998 exhibit "Naughty Girrls Nite @ Bad Girrls Studios", produced by studio member Rebecca Goldberg, which drew over 50 women artists and performers from [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New England]].

Several of the studio members were also co-founders or members of the [[Art School Cheerleaders]]. This performance art group, which began at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]], used Cheerleading as a medium for satirical commentary about art and the art world, and to advocate for arts funding.

The artist-run gallery was partially inspired by another important [[performance art]] space in Boston during that time, [[Mobius Artists Group]], that brought cutting-edge performance artists to Boston through an international exchange program. Mobius had been founded by another member of the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] community, instructor Marilyn Arsem. 

Bad Girrls Studios operated under the slogan "Art is Not A Luxury."

The '''Black Madonna of Częstochowa''' ({{lang-pl|Czarna Madonna}} or {{lang|pl|Matka Boska Częstochowska|italic=yes}}, {{lang-la|Imago thaumaturga Beatae Virginis Mariae Immaculatae Conceptae, in Claro Monte}} ), also known as '''Our Lady of Częstochowa''', is a revered [[icon]] of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] housed at the [[Jasna Góra Monastery]] in [[Częstochowa]], [[Poland]]. Several Pontiffs have recognised the venerated icon, beginning with [[Pope Clement XI]] who issued a [[Canonical Coronation]] to the image on 8 September 1717 via the Vatican Chapter.

==The icon==
The four-foot-high painting displays a traditional composition well known in the icons of Eastern Christians.  The Virgin Mary is shown as the "[[Hodegetria]]" ("One Who Shows the Way"). In it the Virgin directs attention away from herself, gesturing with her right hand toward Jesus as the source of salvation. In turn, the child extends his right hand toward the viewer in blessing while holding a book of gospels in his left hand. The icon shows the Madonna in [[fleur-de-lis]] robes.&lt;ref name=polish/&gt;

The origins of the icon and the date of its composition are still contested among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_black_madonna_a_folkloristic_and_iconographic_investigation/ ''The Black Madonna: A Folkloristic and Iconographic Investigation''. Skeptical Inquirer. September/October 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty in dating the icon is due in part to its original image being painted over after being badly damaged by [[Hussite]] raiders in 1430. The wooden boards that backed the painting were broken and the canvas slashed. [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] restorers unfamiliar with the [[encaustic painting|encaustic method]] found that the paints they applied to the damaged areas "simply sloughed off the image" according to the medieval chronicler Risinius, and their solution was to erase the original image and to repaint it on the original panel. The original features of an Orthodox icon were softened; the nose was made more aquiline.&lt;ref name=polish/&gt;

==History==

===Lucan tradition===
The icon of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of Częstochowa has been intimately associated with Poland for the past 600 years. Its history prior to its arrival in Poland is shrouded in numerous legends which trace the icon's origin to [[Luke the Evangelist|St. Luke]] who painted it on a cedar table top from the house of the [[Holy Family]].&lt;ref name="UDayton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/c/czestochowa-black-madonna.php|title=Black Madonnas: Our Lady of Czestochowa|date=2008-03-26|last=Duricy|first=Michael P|publisher=The Marian Library/International Marian Research Institute, Dayton, Ohio - [[University of Dayton]]|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zawada"&gt;

===Arrival in Częstochowa===

The oldest documents from [[Jasna Góra Monastery|Jasna Góra]] state that the picture travelled from Constantinople via [[Belz]].&lt;ref name="Zawada"/&gt; Eventually it came into the possession of [[Vladislaus II of Opole|Władysław Opolczyk]], [[Duke of Opole]], and adviser to [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis of Anjou]], King of Poland and Hungary. Ukrainian sources state that earlier in its history it was brought to Belz with much ceremony and honors by King [[Leo I of Galicia|Lev I of Galicia]] and later taken by Władysław from the Castle of Belz, when the town was incorporated into the Polish kingdom. A popular story tells that in late August 1384, Ladislaus was passing Częstochowa with the picture when his horses refused to go on. He was advised in a dream to leave the icon at Jasna Gora.

Art historians say that the original painting was a Byzantine icon created around the sixth or ninth century. They agree that Prince Władysław brought it to the monastery in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=polish&gt;[http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/APHistory/blackmadonna/blackmadonna.html "The Black Madonna of Czestochowa", ''Polish American Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pontifical approbations==
Several Pontiffs have recognized the image, namely the following:

* [[Pope Clement XI]] issued a [[Canonical Coronation]] for the image through the Vatican Chapter on 8 September 1717
* [[Pope Pius X]], after the crowns were stolen on 23 October 1909, the Pontiff replaced the crowns on 22 May 1910.
* [[Pope John Paul II]] gifted another set of crowns as a native of Poland, which was placed on 26 August 2005.

===Coronation as Queen and Protectress of Poland===
In August 1382 the hilltop parish church was transferred to the Paulites, a hermitic order from Hungary.&lt;ref name=Menaker/&gt; The golden fleur-de-lis painted on the Virgin's blue veil parallel the heraldic ''azure, semée de lis, or'' of the French royal coat of arms and the most likely explanation for their presence is that the icon had been present in Hungary during the reign of either [[Charles I of Hungary]] and/or [[Louis the Great]], the Hungarian kings of the [[Anjou]] dynasty, who probably had the fleur-de-lis of their family's coat of arms painted on the icon.  This would suggest that the icon was probably originally brought to Jasna Gora by the Pauline monks from their founding monastery in Hungary.
 
The Black Madonna is said to have miraculously saved the monastery of Jasna Góra (English: Bright Mount) from a Swedish invasion.&lt;ref name="Zawada"/&gt; The Siege of Jasna Góra took place in the winter of 1655 during the [[Second Northern War]], as the Swedish invasion of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is known. The Swedes were attempting to capture the Jasna Góra monastery in Częstochowa. Seventy monks and 180 local volunteers, mostly from the szlachta (Polish nobility), held off 4,000 Swedes for 40 days, saved their sacred icon and, according to some accounts, turned the course of the war.&lt;ref name=Menaker/&gt; This event led King [[John II Casimir Vasa]] to "crown" Our Lady of Częstochowa ("the [[Black Madonna]]") as [[Lwów Oath|Queen and Protector of Poland]] in the cathedral of [[Lviv|Lwów]] on April 1, 1652. Prior to this event, several royal nobilities have offered crowns to the image throughout the years, replacing its iron sheet crown by gold and several jewels. In later years, various jewels were interchanged and repositioned around the image to preserve the aesthetic of the icon with the replacement of stolen crowns.&lt;ref&gt;http://sunday.niedziela.pl/artykul.php?dz=polska&amp;id_art=00163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends about the Madonna's appearance===
{{RC-Mariology}}
[[File:Jasna Gora - Czarna Madonna (mozaika).jpg|thumb|right|Black Madonna mosaic at Jasna Góra.]]
The legend concerning the two scars on the Black Madonna's right cheek is that the [[Hussite]]s stormed the Pauline monastery in 1430, plundering the sanctuary. Among the items stolen was the icon. After putting it in their wagon, the Hussites tried to get away but their horses refused to move. They threw the portrait down to the ground and one of the plunderers drew his sword upon the image and inflicted two deep strikes. When the robber tried to inflict a third strike, he fell to the ground and writhed in agony until his death. Despite past attempts to repair these scars, they had difficulty in covering up those slashes as the painting was done with tempera infused with diluted wax.&lt;ref name="UDayton"/&gt;

===Veneration===
Częstochowa is regarded as the most popular shrine in Poland, with many Polish Catholics making a pilgrimage there every year. A pilgrimage has left Warsaw every August 6 since 1711 for the nine-day, 140-mile trek. Elderly pilgrims recall stealing through the dark countryside at great personal risk during the German Nazi occupation. Pope John Paul II secretly visited as a student pilgrim during World War II.&lt;ref name=Menaker&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/22/travel/poland-s-black-madonna.html Menaker, Drusilla. "Poland's Black Madonna", ''New York Times'', July 22, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast day of Our Lady of Częstochowa is celebrated on August 26.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Orthodox Christians are also aware of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa and venerate her. The icon is popular in Ukraine and Belarus as former parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and even in Russia. Moreover, this icon has an Orthodox origin, but Polish historians have found out it has been repainted at least twice and there is almost nothing left of the previous Byzantine manner of painting.&lt;ref&gt;A. Różycka-Bryzek, J. Gadomski, Obraz Matki Boskiej Częstochowskiej w świetle badań historii sztuki, "Studia Claromontana" 5, 1984, s. 27-52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukrainians]] have a special devotion for the Madonna of Częstochowa. The icon is often mentioned in Ukrainian folk songs from the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Zawada"/&gt;

'''Clarissa Munger Badger''' (1806–1889) was a mid 19th century American [[botanical illustrator]] best known for three volumes of flower paintings accompanied by poetry. She also painted on textiles.

==Family==
[[File:Clarissa-Badger tulips-1867.jpg|thumb|Clarissa Munger Badger, lithograph of tulips from her 1867 book ''Floral Belles from the Green-House and Garden''.]]
Clarissa W. Munger was born in [[Madison, Connecticut|East Guilford]], Connecticut, in 1806 to [[George Munger (artist)|George Munger]], a portrait painter and engraver, and Parnel Kelsey Munger.&lt;ref name=mcb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhs/&gt; Clarissa, her older brother George, and her younger sister Caroline all become artists as well, with Caroline specializing in portraits like her father and Clarissa in botanical art.&lt;ref name=mds/&gt;&lt;ref name=jk/&gt;

In 1828, she married the Rev. [[Milton Badger]], who was a minister in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] and later became the associate secretary of the [[American Home Missionary Society]], a job requiring him to spend time in the western United States.&lt;ref name=slb/&gt;&lt;ref name=cq/&gt; They had five children, of whom two survived to adulthood, both becoming doctors.&lt;ref name=slb/&gt; Milton developed [[Bright's disease]], and the couple moved back Madison, Connecticut, where Clarissa was widowed in 1873.&lt;ref name=cq/&gt;

==Works==
In 1848, Clarissa Munger Badger privately published ''A Forget-Me-Not: Flowers from Nature with Selected Poetry'' under the name '''C. M. Badger'''. This was a volume of poetry by [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[Lydia Sigourney]], [[Mary Howitt]], and others illustrated with 13 of her flower paintings. This may have provided a model for her 1859 book  ''Wild Flowers Drawn and Colored from Nature'' (informally known as ''The Wild Flowers of America''), which was illustrated with 22 plates of individual common flowers such as [[trailing arbutus]], [[purple violet]], [[cardinal flower]], and [[harebell]].&lt;ref name=mds/&gt; It also included poems, thought in this case to have been written by Badger herself, together with an introductory poem by Sigourney.&lt;ref name=mhs/&gt; The poet [[Emily Dickinson]] owned a copy of this book.&lt;ref name=jf/&gt; The plates were widely reproduced at the time, contributing to Badger's reputation as a top-rank botanical artist.&lt;ref name=mhs/&gt;

Clarissa's third book, ''Floral Belles from the Green-House and Garden'', was published in 1867 with 16 hand-colored lithographic plates typically showing two or three flowers in clusters or bouquets. As with her first book, the flower paintings were accompanied by poetry, in this case poems about the flowers depicted.

A sketch written when Badger was 75 remarks on the "feeling and delicacy" of her watercolors and remarks that she was still painting flowers at that advanced age.&lt;ref name=slb/&gt; The popularity of Badger's graceful, stylized paintings in her own day was "dwarfed by her male counterparts; only now is she being applauded as a fine botanical artist".&lt;ref name=jk/&gt;

Recent research has revealed that Badger also painted on textiles. Extant works include a quilt with some panels featuring hand-painted flowers, and a silk scarf with roses painted at one end and [[morning glories]] at the other.&lt;ref name=mhs/&gt;

Portraits of Badger and her husband were painted in 1846-47 by [[Nathaniel Jocelyn]].&lt;ref name=mhs/&gt;

The '''coat of arms of [[Cameroon]]''' consists of a shield with a banner above and below it. Behind the shield are two crossed [[fasces]]. The shield has the same color pattern as the [[flag of Cameroon]], and in the center is a map of the nation. The scales of justice are superimposed on top of the map of the nation.

==Description==
The banner at the bottom gives the name of the nation in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. The top banner contains the national [[motto]]: {{Lang|fr|Paix, Travail, Patrie}}. The fasces are a symbol of the republic's authority, and the scales of justice represent justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/int/afr/cm-nat.htm National arms of Cameroon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous version of the state arms had text in French  only, with "République du Cameroun – 1er Janvier 1960" on a scroll above the shield, and "Paix, Travail, Patrie" below the shield.  The shield differed in that the green and yellow areas to left and right each had one large blue five-pointed star, while the central red area did not have a star on top (so that the blue map outline of Cameroon extended higher).&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to the Flags of the World'' by Mauro Talocci, revised and updated by Whitney Smith ({{ISBN|0-688-01141-1}}), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier coats of arms ==
===Proposed arms 1914===
In 1914, the German government decided to assign coats of arms to its overseas colonies, including Cameroon.  Arms were designed, but [[World War I]] broke out before the project was  finalised, and the arms were never actually taken into use. Giving the colonies their own insignia in time of war could let them have a symbol to rally around in case of rebellion. The arms proposed for [[Kamerun|the Imperial Colony of Cameroon]] depicted an elephant's head and the German imperial eagle on a chief. The eagle and the imperial crown on the shield was the same for all the proposed colonial arms.&lt;ref name=lv&gt;Schurdel, H.D. . Battenberg (1995).  ''Flaggen &amp; Wappen Deutschland - Heraldik, Hymnen, BRD &amp; DDR Flaggen und Wappen, Deutsche Ostgebiete, ehem. deutsche Kolonien u.v.m.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Covering cherub''' (in literary usage) is the [[Anxiety of influence|obstructing presence]] for the artist of the inherited tradition, and cultural predecessors, with which they are faced.

==Origins==
Found originally in [[Ezekiel]], the covering cherub was adapted for use by (among others) both [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[William Blake]].  In the [[William Blake's mythology|Blakean vision]], the covering cherub was a composite but always negative figure of truth's guardian turned destructive,&lt;ref&gt;D. Erdman, ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake'' (2008) p. 944 and p. 926&lt;/ref&gt; of a cruel and hardened Selfhood;&lt;ref&gt;N.Marsh, ''William Blake: The Poems'' (2012) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and it was from Blake that in 1967 [[Harold Bloom]] derived his concept of the covering cherub as a literary/cultural barrier.  Apparently, a waking nightmare he experienced gave rise first to his poem on the subject, "The Covering Cherub", and eventually to his book [[Anxiety of Influence|''The Anxiety of Influence'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hilobrow.com/2013/07/11/harold-bloom/ Harold Bloom]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thematics==
For Bloom, "the Covering Cherub then is a demon of continuity...cultural history, the dead poets, the embarrassments  of a tradition grown too wealthy to need anything more".&lt;ref&gt;H. Bloom, ''The Anxiety of Influence'' (1973) p. 39 and p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom considered the artistic struggle in [[Freud]]ian terms, as a filial contest with a [[father figure]] carrying cultural authority&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers ed., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; – an [[Oedipal conflict]] with a [[superego]] either originally modelled on a cultural hero&lt;ref&gt;L. Hudson/B. Jarot, ''The Way Men Think'' (1993) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; or influenced subsequently by such an ideal model.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Though initially referencing a patriarchal father/son interaction, the concept of the covering cherub has also been applied to works by women writers such as [[Angela Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;''Bluebeard Gothic'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virginia Woolf]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Keane, ''John Milton's Paradise Lost'' (2013) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have seen Bloom's central image as too open-ended to serve as analyical tool, a vague series of analogies only tenuously working as Bloom desired.&lt;ref&gt;J. Doane, ''Nostalgia and Sexual Difference'' (2013) p. 90-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crescent Theatre''' is a non-professional [[theatre]] run mostly by volunteers, in Sheepcote Street, [[Brindleyplace]], in [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

It houses one of the oldest theatre companies in the city: The Crescent Theatre Company. The Crescent also plays host to numerous visiting companies every year, both amateur and professional.

The company began, as the Municipal Players, in 1924. The first theatre was a converted building, formerly Baskerville Hall, in [[The Crescent (Birmingham)|The Crescent]], Cambridge Street.&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornton|first=Roy|title=Lost Buildings of Birmingham|year=2009|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978 0750950992|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first production was Edmund Rostand's "The Romantics" in 1932. The theatre moved to newly built premises on Cumberland Street in 1964, designed by [[Graham Winteringham]] of S.T. Walker and Partners, with a seating capacity of 296. The [[apron stage]] and first seven rows of seats were on a revolving platform to turn the interior into an arena theatre. The two-storey building was faced with [[London]] stock bricks and black-framed windows. Phase Two of the construction would have included a restaurant and a rehearsal stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Hickman|title=Birmingham|year=1970|publisher=Studio Vista Ltd.|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Original Crescent Theatre, Birmingham.jpg|thumb|left|The second theatre on Cumberland Street, 1964-1998]]
The present theatre was opened in 1998 by [[Celia Imrie]]. The theatre it replaced was demolished in the same year. It houses two performance spaces: The Main House, and the Ron Barber Studio. The Main House seats up to 340, and the Studio up to 120. The building was designed by [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] and John Chatwin.

The theatre is run by a board of directors elected from the membership including chairman, secretary and treasurer. They oversee the general direction of the theatre and all the membership activities. There is a small team of paid staff who look after the day-to-day running of the building and supervise the visiting companies. Throughout the year they play host to a variety of companies of different sizes including Birmingham Royal Ballet, Midland Opera, Stage2, Birmingham School of Acting, Birmingham Conservatiore, Bournville MTC, The Arcadians, Tinker's Farm Opera, Midland Theatre Ballet and The Rep.

[[File:The Ritz on Piccadilly.jpg|thumb|The [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] is opposite Dover Street]]
'''Dover Street''' is a street in [[Mayfair]], London. The street is notable for its [[Georgian architecture]] as well as the location of historic London clubs and hotels, which have been frequented by world leaders and historic figures in the arts. It also hosts a number of contemporary art galleries. An equestrian sculpture by [[Elisabeth Frink]] stands on the junction of Dover Street and [[Piccadilly]], opposite the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]].

== Location ==
The street lies in the south of Mayfair in the [[West End of London|West End]]. To the south-east, the street adjoins the major thoroughfare of [[Piccadilly]]. To the north-west, it continues as Grafton Street. To the north-east is [[Albemarle Street]], running parallel with Dover Street and the location of the [[Royal Institution]]. South-west is [[Berkeley Street]] (adjoining [[Berkeley Square]] to the north), also running in parallel.

The nearest tube station is [[Green Park tube station|Green Park]].

== History ==
Dover Street was built by a syndicate of developers headed by [[Sir Thomas Bond, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Bond]]. The syndicate purchased a Piccadilly mansion called [[Clarendon House]] from [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle]] in 1683 and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area. At that time the house backed onto open fields and the development of the various estates in Mayfair was just getting underway. The syndicate also built [[Bond Street]] and [[Albemarle Street]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mexborough House, 33 Dover Street, 1906.jpg|thumb|right|Mexborough House, 33 Dover Street, shown here in 1906, built by [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson|James S. Gibson]]]] --&gt;

In June 1797 [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] moved into 28 Dover Street a building of his own design, he built an even bigger house next door at 29 into which he moved the following year.&lt;ref&gt;John Sumerson, ''The Life and Work of John Nash Architect'', 1980, George Allen &amp; Unwin, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Edward Moxon]] moved from premises he had established in 1830 in [[New Bond Street]] to 44 Dover Street. He published [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] from 1835 onwards and in 1839 issued the first complete edition of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s poems. In 1841, he was found guilty of [[blasphemy]] for passages in  Shelley's ''[[Queen Mab]]''. [[Anne Lister]] (1791–1840), a notable Victorian landowner and diarist, liked to stay at Hawkins, located at 26 Dover Street.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Brown's Hotel]] (then termed a "genteel inn") was established in 1837 by James Brown, [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]]'s valet, who took a lease on 23 Dover Street to cater for those who were in town "for the Season". He ran it with his wife, Sarah Willis, the personal maid of [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Lady Byron]], who gave financial support. The hotel was later enlarged and joined with backing premises on Albemarle Street. In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] made the first successful telephone call in Britain from the hotel. In 1890, The International Niagara Commission met in the hotel and their decision on distributing "[[Niagara Falls#Power|Niagara power]]" subsequently led to the adoption of the alternating current worldwide. Other guests have included [[Napoleon III]],  [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (at the time of his marriage), [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[Agatha Christie]] (her book ''At Bertram's Hotel'' is based on Brown's).

[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] in ''Our Hundred Days in Europe'' records staying at Mackellar's Hotel, 17 Dover Street, where "we found ourselves comfortably lodged and well cared for during the whole time we were in London".

[[Frédéric Chopin]] took lodgings in Dover Street in 1848 and performed a number of piano recitals in London and undertook piano lessons.

In the 1920s many notable photographers were based in Dover Street including [[Paul Tanqueray]], [[Hugh Cecil]] and [[Alexander Bassano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp08077/yvonne-gregory|title=Yvonne Gregory|publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Adams (photographer)|Marcus Adams]], [[Yvonne Gregory]] and [[Bertram Park]], the "Three Photographers", were based at 43 Dover Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp04999/marcus-adams?role=art|title=Marcus Adams |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Green Park tube station|Green Park Underground station]] was originally known as Dover Street station. The original [[Leslie Green]]-designed building was located in Dover Street, but, following refurbishment in the 1930s to install escalators, the entrance was moved to Piccadilly and the station was renamed.&lt;ref&gt;

==Clubs==
The street is historically and currently the location of a number of well-known London clubs, although the oldest and most fashionable London clubs are located in [[St James's]] and [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]:
* The [[Albemarle Club]], originally in Albemarle Street nearby, was relocated to 37 Dover Street before its closure.
* The [[Arts Club]], founded by [[Charles Dickens]] and others in 1863, originally in [[Hanover Square, London|Hanover Square]], has been located at 40 Dover Street since 1893. [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]'s decision to sue [[John Ruskin]] was made on the premises. The Arts Club premises are currently used for meetings of the [[Eccentric Club]].
* The Bath Club, where [[Mark Twain]] breakfasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author       = [[Albert Bigelow Paine]] | year       = 1917 | title       = Chapter CCLVII, a True English Welcome | work       = Mark Twain: a Biography [etext.library.adelaide.edu.au] | url       = http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/t/twain/mark/paine/chapter257.html | accessdate       = 26 July 2007 | deadurl       = yes | archiveurl       = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626165344/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/t/twain/mark/paine/chapter257.html | archivedate       = 26 June 2007 | df       = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Capisce Club, 1 Dover Street, was formerly a [[nightclub]] and restaurant.
* [[Mahiki]], 1 Dover Street, is a [[nightclub]] and bar, with a [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] and tiki theme, predominantly specialising in rum. Often frequented by celebrities and royalty, including [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]].
* [https://womanandhersphere.com/category/rooms-of-their-own-womens-clubs/ Empress Club], 35 Dover Street, Towards the end of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the idea of a London club solely for women, was put forward by one of Queen Victoria’s Ladies-in-Waiting, With the help of other Ladies at Court, and indeed with the blessing of the Queen herself, the idea went ahead, and on 24 May 1897 the Empress Club opened – founded the “Ladies of England” and in commemoration of her Majesty’s Golden Jubilee.  The Club’s foundation marked a new era in the history of Ladies’ Clubs. Unconnected with any political movement it soon became powerful Social Institution. Headed by the Duchess of Leeds, the Vice-Presidents and Committee included a Princess and several Countesses.  The original clubhouse was at 32 Dover Street, such was the rush to join that within 12 months a new site had to be found on which to erect a building worthy of the large and influential membership which represented nearly every known family of distinction.  The site found was at No. 35, almost next door, and by 1901 the Empress Club was installed in a most impressive and palatial building with another entrance in Berkley Street. It boasted12 Reception Rooms, handsomely decorated, and one hundred bedrooms for which the lowest charge was 4/- a night- and this included Lights, Boots, Bath and attendance. Coal fires, it is true, were 1/6 extra but Ladies’ Maids could be accommodated for 7/6 per day!  Members wishing to interview servants at the Club had to give two clear days’ notice to the Secretary and then conduct the interview before 12 noon. Ladies could keep their cycles at the Club, but dogs were not allowed and Gentlemen guests only as far as the Dining and drawing Rooms. An orchestra played during afternoon tea (1/-) and smoking was permitted. It also played in the Grand Dining Hall during dinner, after which smoking was again allowed. Luncheon was 2/6 and dinner 3/6!  During the great war over £50,000 was raised by members in aid to the Forces, and again £16,000 in World War II. The Club withstood many near misses from bombs and suffered considerable damage from fire in 1941  After the war the Club never quite recovered its former glory and some years later it was sold. Most of the building was turned into offices and the Grand Dining Hall became a Night Club. In 1961 this was acquired by the Caprice - A l’Ecu de France group, where it became the Empress Restaurant. The property is currently occupied by Christian Louboutin.
And a fictional one:

* The [[Drones Club]], the gentlemen's club of many of [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s novels, was located on Dover Street, off Piccadilly.

==Galleries==
Art galleries in the street include:

* The Alexia Goethe Gallery, 5&amp;ndash;7 Dover Street.
* The CCA Galleries, 8 Dover Street &amp;mdash; originally Christies Contemporary Art and now an independent company publishing prints.
* The Gallery at 32 Dover Street (now part of [[Wolf &amp; Badger]]).
* Richard Green, 39 Dover Street.
* The [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA) was initially in Dover Street, but relocated to [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] in 1968.
* The Wapping Project Bankside, 37 Dover St, in the same building as [[Mallett Antiques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bjp-online.com/2014/09/wapping-project-bankside-re-opens-in-mayfair-with-new-exhibition/ | date = 17 September 2014 | accessdate = 23 October 2015 | first = Gemma | last = Padley | magazine = [[British Journal of Photography]] | title = Wapping Project Bankside re-opens in Mayfair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Christopher Cannon, in ''The Making of Chaucer's English'', gives a complete detailed work on the [[etymology]] of Chaucer's special manuscript words and references the [[Middle English Dictionary]] (''MED'') definitions and etymology of each of these words.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460&gt;Cannon, 224-460&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that the ''MED'' does not give details on the etymology of many of Chaucer's derived words, including many compounds, some participial [[adjective]]s, and most [[gerunds]].&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt; Cannon also points out that, while the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] lists Chaucer as the ''first cited author'' of these words, it also is mostly silent on the etymologies of these particular derived words.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;Simpson, Weiner, et al, ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. According to the Library of Congress for those that have academic library subscribing to the OED, here are the steps you can use to find such a list of words:
* Once you are in the OED Online, select "Simple Search" found at the bottom of the screen.
* Enter the word Chaucer in the box on the upper left of the screen where it says Search for
* For the next box below labeled "in," use the pull-down arrow and click on "first cited author."
* Most Universities and Colleges and many large public libraries have OED Online where the reference librarian can give you a listing.
* The listing output shows Chaucer's works where he is cited as the first cited author of these words and the year the work was published.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon furnishes a complete list of Chaucer's special manuscript words with their etymology.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt;

Historian Albert Baugh points out that some of Chaucer's [[aureate]] words came from Latin or French origin.&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, pp. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Chaucer's aureate words like ''[[:wikt:laureate|laureate]], [[:wikt:mediation|mediation]],'' and ''[[:wikt:oriental|oriental]]'' eventually became a part of everyday English. Baugh points out that the innovations of word development into common speech and everyday usage, such as these Chaucer words, is of considerable interest in the history of style.&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

== List ==
Below is a complete list of the 1977 Chaucer's special manuscript words that are first found in the existing manuscripts below as listed in the Oxford English Dictionary as being the ''first cited author.''&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; Some now have different spellings and others are given the "root" word definition.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt; Some of these words are now dated or obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscript words first found written in Chaucer's work, from ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and other of his publications as shown below, were published in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=cannon224_460/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

===''The Canterbury Tales''===
''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is a collection of tales written sometime after 1373, with 'sondry folk' that resemble [[Boccaccio]]'s stories of ''[[The Decameron]]'' of fleeing nobles.

==== General Prologue ====
The ''[[General Prologue]]'' introduces the tellers of the tales, with much wry and subtle social commentary.

The '''''Eufemiavisorna''''' are a group of three medieval romances translated into [[Old Swedish|medieval Swedish]]: ''[[Ywain|Herr Ivan lejonriddaren]]'' (1303), ''[[Hertig Fredrik av Normandie]]'' (1301 or 1308), and ''[[Floris and Blancheflour|Flores och Blanzeflor]]'' (probably 1312). They are known in Swedish (and generally in English) as the ''Eufemiavisorna'', 'the Euphemia poems' (or, without the definite article, the ''Eufemiavisor'') or, less commonly, ''Eufemiaromanerna'', 'the Euphemia romances'; they are known in Norwegian ([[bokmål]]) as the ''Eufemiavisene''. The romances are an early example of the poetic form known as [[Knittelvers]]; are the first known Scandinavian renderings of Continental European [[chivalric romance]] in verse; and are one of the first major works of literature in Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 172-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and content==

Scandinavian translations of Continental European romance began with [[Chivalric sagas|prose translations]] in the Norwegian court. The ''Eufemiavisorna'' represent a further stage of adaptation of Romance, using verse. They are named after Norway's Queen [[Euphemia of Rügen]] (1270–1312): in the fullest manuscript attestations, there is a colophon at the end of each romance indicating that she commissioned the translations. The translations are thought to represent Euphemia's effort to bring Continental courtly culture to the royal court of Sweden.

It is not known who translated the poems, but scholarly consensus supports the idea that there was one, clerical translator, intimately familiar with German ''Knittel'' forms.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Herr Ivan'' ===
According to [[Peter Andreas Munch]]'s generally accepted theory, the translation of Chrétien de Troyes's ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion|Yvain]]'' as ''Herr Ivan lejonriddaren'' celebrated the betrothal of Euphemia's daughter [[Ingeborg of Norway|Ingeborg]]'s abortive betrothal to [[Magnus Birgerson]] in 1302. ''Herr Ivan'' is 6,645 lines and, in the assessment of Gösta Holm,

: It is generally maintained that the Swedish translator used MSS both of the Old French ''Yvain'' and of the Old Norwegian ''Íven(t)''. The end of the poem states that it was translated ''af valske tungo'' ("from the French language"). The translator deals freely with his originals; he shortens, revises, and makes additions. The narration is more expansive in the latter part. The additions are often mechanical and especially frequent in rhyme position.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Hertig Fredrik'' ===
The reason for the 3,310-line translation of ''Hertig Fredrik av Normandie'' (1308) is not known, and it may not originally have belonged to the ''Eufemiavisorna''. 'On the whole, it is more artistic than its Swedish forerunner, ''Herr Ivan''.' No direct source for this romance survives, but 'the end of the poem states that it was first translated ''aff walsko j tytzt mall'' ("from French into German"), at the instance of [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto]]. This information is generally accepted by scholars, although no German text is known'.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Flores och Blanzeflor'' ===
The translation of the anonymous Old French ''[[Floris and Blancheflour]]'' as the 2,192-line ''Flores och Blanzeflor'' seems to have been composed in 1312&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Munch's theory may have marked Ingeborg's successful marriage in 1312 to [[Eric, Duke of Södermanland]]. The translation is based on the Norwegian translation of the French.

=== Danish translation ===
The ''Eufemiavisorna'' were translated into Danish at the beginning of the sixteenth century; there are two other independent Danish versions of ''[[Ywain]]''.

==Form==

According to Gösta Holm, 'The style, rhyme technique, and vocabulary of the ''Eufemiavisorna'' are to a great extent influenced by German patterns; the translator(s) must have been acquainted with the culture of the South. Thus, French originals have had a surprisingly insignificant influence on the form of the ''Eufemiavisorna''.'

: Like the English adapters of the 13th and 14th centuries, the author of the ''Eufemiavisorna'' possessed a weak sensitivity to the subtle and refined aspects of courtly romance. The intricate analysis of the emotional life of characters, especially women, in the best French romances, was foreign to the author of the ''Eufemiavisorna''. Instead, he was very font of manly sports, ''torney'', ''dyost'' ("tournaments, jousts"), and the like, fights, grand assemblies, and vivid scenes in the knights' castles. In short, the main themes of the ''Eufemiavisorna'' are adventures, fights, and love.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==

The Danish translations of the Swedish ''Eufemiavisorna'' derive from lost manuscripts closer to the archetypes than our surviving Swedish ones, and therefore have an independent text-critical value for reconstructing the Swedish translations.&lt;ref&gt;Gösta Holm, 'Eufemiavisorna', in ''Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 171-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Color Vision test''' is a test of the [[Visual system|human visual system]] often used to test for [[color blindness]]. The system was developed by [[Dean Farnsworth]] in the 1940s and it tests the ability to isolate and arrange minute differences in various color targets with constant [[lightness|value]] and [[colorfulness|chroma]] that cover all the visual [[hue]]s described by the [[Munsell color system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farnsworth|first=Dean|title=The Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue and Dichotomous Tests for Color Vision|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|year=1943|volume=33|pages=568–574|doi=10.1364/josa.33.000568}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several variations of the test, one featuring 100 color hues and one featuring 15 color hues. Originally taken in an analog environment with physical hue tiles, the test is now taken from computer consoles. An accurate quantification of [[color vision]] accuracy is particularly important to designers, photographers and [[colorists]], who all rely on accurate color vision to produce quality content.

==Vision tests==

=== 100 hue test ===
The most common form of the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Color Vision Test contains four distinct rows of similar color hues, each containing 25 distinct variations of each hue. Each color hue at the polar end of a row is fixed in position, to serve as an anchor. Each hue tile between the anchors can be adjusted as the [[Standard illuminant|observer]] sees fit. The final arrangement of the hue tiles represents the [[Visual acuity|aptitude of the visual system]] in discerning differences in color hue. Failures within the observers visual system can be measured as a function of two factors contained within the test; either the amount of instances that a tile is misplaced, or the severity of a tile displacement (i.e., the distance between where a tile should have been placed and where it was actually placed.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xrite.com/online-color-test-challenge|title=X-Rite Hues Test Description}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:100 hue arrangement.jpg|thumb|right|Tile arrangement for the 100 hues test.]]
The tiles are arranged in four rows based on color hue. The rows cover orange/magenta hues, yellow/green hues, blue/purple and purple/magenta hues, in that order. The physical derivative of the test is given on a black background to isolate and accentuate color hues, which are round and roughly an inch in diameter.  The digital derivative of the test is based on square hue images, which are also presented on a black background, but can vary in size based on [[Computer monitor|monitor]], [[Display resolution|resolution]], [[Digital zoom|zoom]] and a variety of other external settings and variables.  The digital distribution of the 100 Hues test is far more popular given its easy access for little or no licensing fee, and an apparent level of accuracy for most audiences. Taking the physical hue test under experimentally sound conditions (see Testing Environment) is far more accurate but the high price of the physical test kit is often prohibitive
[[File:Huetestfmd15-2.jpg|thumb|left|A physical set of tiles for the D15 hue color test.]]

===D15 test===

The Farnsworth-Munsell D15 Color Vision Test is an older version of the test. It is composed of a single tray, holding 15 independent color hues. The D15 test is administered in the same way as the 100 Hues test; the same environmental factors are recommended for non-professional results and required to garner completely professional results.  The key difference between the D15 and 100 Hues test is the intended pool of qualitative informative results. The 100 Hue test is administered in pursuit of measuring an individual’s overall color vision acuity, while the primary purpose of the D15 test is to identify [[Color blindness|color vision defects]], most notably red-green and blue-yellow color sensing deficiencies. The D15 test is most notable to be relevant to forms of [[color blindness]] or individuals suffering with vision that incorporates [[protanomaly]], [[deuteranomaly]], [[protanopia]] and [[deuteranopia]]. For more information on color vision deficiencies or color blindness, see [[Color Blindness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xrite.com/fm-dichotomous-d15-test|title=X-Rite FM D15 Color Vision Test}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental factors ==

The Munsell Vision Test is reliant on a wide assortment of environmental factors to generate accurate and consistent color vision results. Many of these factors are universal across both physical and digital releases of the test, although several are unique to either test in their own right. The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] has determined some baseline values and experimental standards to be used in both editions of the test, others are fluid and merely require consistency from test to test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihs.com/products/industry-standards/organizations/cie/index.aspx|title=CIE Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illuminants ===

[[File:Illuminant curves.jpg|thumb|right|Illuminant curves]]
[[Illuminants]] are unique location to location across the globe, however several types of illuminant have been standardized by the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]]. Illuminants types [[Standard illuminant|D65]] and [[Standard illuminant|D50]] are acceptable for use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihs.com/products/industry-standards/org/cie/list/index.aspx|title=CIE Standard Illuminant Documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Standard illuminant|D50 illuminant]] is suggested for a [[Color calibration|calibrated]] and accurate color vision test result. Use of different illuminant can sway results in a significant manner due to the [[spectral power distribution]] of alternate sources and their [[angle of incidence (optics)|incident]] effect on how displayed information is processed by the human visual system. Illuminants containing varying concentrations of differing [[wavelength]] [[Radiant intensity|intensity]] light skews the [[Color model|representation of color on the screen]] in a manner that would cause the eye to mismatch color patches. In combination with the [[Luminosity function|spatial acuity function]] of the human visual system, [[Illumination (lighting)|illumination]] plays a significant role in the [[Color rendering index|color accuracy of a display]].

=== Screen calibration ===

[[File:Standard gamma.png|thumb|left|Standardized curves for common display gamma settings.]]
Combined with [[Available light|ambient illumination]] of the scene, several other factors are also integral for testing environment standardization. [[Gamma correction|Calculated screen gamma]] is a significant factor. As gamma changes for the display, the representation of [[color]], [[Display contrast|contrast]] and [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]] are affected proportional to the magnitude of the change of the gamma curve. CIE recommends a gamma value of 2.2 as it is the current display manufacturing standard.  A proper, professional grade screen calibration is required in order for concretely accurate test information. Several companies manufacture portable display calibration tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://x-rite.com X-Rite]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://datacolor.com Datacolor]&lt;/ref&gt; Tools such as these take into account the type of screen and the screen’s primary illumination source.

There is no standard monitor hardware specification for the digital release of the Munsell Vision Test.  Correct and thorough monitor calibration takes into account human visual system [[Metamerism (color)|metamerism]], a phenomenon that combines several color science elements to generate [[Color management|visual matching colors]] regardless of differences in source illumination, although it is ultimately not universally effective.

=== Formal monitor tests ===

[[File:Error by display.png|thumb|right|Error by display]]
Informative subject testing done at the [[RIT|Rochester Institute of Technology’s]] [http://www.rit.edu/cos/colorscience/ Munsell Color Science Lab] discovered consistent [[Color vision|color perception]] difficulties when identical subjects performed the Munsell Vision Test on varying calibrated monitors in a test comparing color vision test results between [[Apple MacBook Pro]] laptop displays and a [[Samsung]] [[LCD Monitor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jonlesser.net/2009/05/hue-test-fail |title=Color Vision Test Result Differences by Display Type] ''Conducted at RIT Munsell Color Science Lab 2002'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114033423/http://jonlesser.net/2009/05/hue-test-fail/ |archivedate=2011-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results garnered from the experiment exemplified the differences that displays can exhibit in failure to accurately quantify color.  [[angle of incidence (optics)|Incident angle]] to the test monitor is a final strong source of [[Uncertainty|experimental uncertainty]], as very few monitors commercially available are capable of accurately representing [[hue]], [[Tints and shades|tone]] and [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]] consistently at all viewing angles incident to the monitor.

=== Observer error ===

Several sources of error (and therefore, inherent accuracy shortcomings) are directly related to the observer. Although CIE demonstrates several sets of data regarding the optimal, standard observer, each individual observer differs slightly from the baseline. Factors like [[visual acuity]], color blindness and visual system defects ([[cataracts]], surgeries, [[LASIK]], [[Irlen filters|tinted optics]], [[Responsivity|poor cone responsivity]], etc.) are all directly tied to observer color perception accuracy. The accuracy of an observers test answers are represented in Test Results

== Test results and interpretation ==

[[File:Farnsworth-Munsell3.png|thumb|left|A typical scoring results screen from X-Rite's 100 Hues test evaluation software.]] 
[[File:Colorblindness.png|thumb|right|150px|Colorblindness]]
Noting the sources of error previously addressed that are introduced by environmental factors and observer uncertainties, several digital test sources offer software installations that analyze the information garnered from the test. Data generated from [http://www.xrite.com/fm-100-hue-scoring-system X-Rite’s] online test offer several types of information, most notably the Total Estimation Score (TES), Color Vision Deficiency Type (CVDT) and Color Vision Deficiency Severity (CVDS). TES is an automated, generated value that calculates the number of tiles placed incorrectly and scales the value for uniform analysis.  Average TES scores range from thirty to forty in series tests; while scores exceeding seventy can point to a marker for color blindness. Lower scores are intended to point to significantly increased color vision accuracy, as the TES score is directly correlated to the number of tiles incorrectly identified. Based on an axis interpretation of the information generated, a color vision deficiency type is also determined, based on a straight line plotted to intersect the center of the Munsell color sphere and the peak point of the highest color error spike. This axis is used to determine the color error tendencies the eye. From this information, if a value of seventy or higher is returned, a clinical form of color blindness can be estimated based upon the location of the CVDT axis. The [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of color error peaks is used to determine the magnitude of the observers Color Vision Deficiency Severity. Accuracy of the test is relative to the display and based upon its correct calibration.

== Relevant markets ==

Several industrial and commercial markets have great need for characterized and accurate color vision as well as tests to quantify color vision accuracy. Among these are divisions like healthcare systems, design companies and photography and motion picture industries. In order to generate color accurate products, employee vision accuracy is crucial as well.

=== Design ===

In the design sphere, there are several common yet largely important uses for color accuracy that lean heavily on the designers ability to accurately sense color. Careers such as graphic design, photography, graphics and color development are common fields that rely heavily on employees with accurate color vision. Additionally, paint engineering also relies heavily on color science employees with a demonstrated acuity in color vision. Examples of relevant companies includes [[Pantone]] and [[Sherwin-Williams]].

=== Healthcare ===

In the medical sphere, it is important to have products to measure patients color vision. While medically professional vision tests are available, a Munsell Vision Test is often an informal and relevant test to determine a potential need for more thorough vision testing at the hands of pro staff or optometry experts. As previously mentioned, the Munsell-Farnsworth D15 Color Vision Test is a capable and professional method to test an individual.

=== Motion picture ===

Motion picture professionals also desire color vision acuity information for integral parts of film post production like color timing and final color correction. Since these processes are highly subjective to individuals such as the director and the colorist, accurate color vision is vital to the final aesthetic appearance of the film. In addition to this, engineers involved in the production and chemistry of film and digital systems engineering are reliant on proper color vision to construct and engineer imaging systems that accurately sense and represent color in stored images and display.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10430">'''Florida Artists Hall of Fame''' recognizes artists who have made significant contributions to art in Florida. It was established by the [[Florida Legislature]] in 1986. There is a '''Florida Artists Hall of Fame Wall''' on the Plaza Level in the rotunda of the [[Florida Capitol]]. The [[Florida Council on Arts and Culture]] reviews nominations annually and makes recommendations to the [[Florida Secretary of State]]. No more than two inductees are selected in any year&lt;ref name="FAHF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/ahf/ |title=Florida Artists Hall of Fame |publisher=Division of Cultural Affairs, [[Secretary of State of Florida]]|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2012 when four inductees were added.

In 2013 legendary Florida folk singer &amp; songwriter [[Frank Thomas (musician)|Frank J. Thomas]] born and raised in Clay County&lt;ref&gt;http://dos.myflorida.com/historical/preservation/florida-folklife-program/folk-heritage-awards/list-of-past-recipients/frank-ann-thomas/&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Latin pop]] superstar [[Gloria Estefan]] and painter [[Laura Woodward]] were inducted.

In 1986, the Hall was established by the Florida Legislature.  It provides recognition to persons, living or dead, who "made significant contributions to the arts in Florida either as performing or practicing artists in individual disciplines."  The awards recipients show diversity of artistic accomplishment in the state's "cultural tapestry."   Inductions take placed each March during the Florida Heritage Awards. Each honoree receives a commemorative bronze sculpture.  The sculpture, ''La Florida'' was created by [[Enzo Torcoletti]].&lt;ref name="FAHF"/&gt;

'''Folk art''' encompasses art produced from an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous culture]] or by [[peasants]] or other laboring [[tradespeople]]. In contrast to [[fine art]], folk art is primarily utilitarian and decorative rather than purely aesthetic.&lt;ref name=bullfinch&gt;West, Shearer (general editor), ''The Bullfinch Guide to Art History'', page 440, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, United Kingdom, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8212-2137-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk Art is characterized by a naive style, in which traditional rules of [[body proportions|proportion]] and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] are not employed.

As a phenomenon that can chronicle a move towards civilization yet rapidly diminish with modernity, [[industrialisation|industrialization]], or outside influence, the nature of folk art is specific to its particular culture. The varied geographical and temporal prevalence and diversity of folk art make it difficult to describe as a whole, though some patterns have been demonstrated.

==Characteristics==
Characteristically folk art is not influenced by [[art movements|movements]] in [[academic art|academic]] or fine art circles, and, in many cases, folk art excludes works executed by professional artists and sold as "high art" or "fine art" to the society's art patrons.&lt;ref name="bullfinch"/&gt; On the other hand, many 18th- and 19th-century American folk art painters made their living by their work, including itinerant portrait painters, some of whom produced large bodies of work.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Robert and Weissman, Judith Reiter. ''The Knopf Collectors' Guides to American Antiques: Folk Art''. Folk art are simple,direct, and mostly always dark. Knopf. 1983&lt;/ref&gt;


Terms that might overlap with folk art are naïve art, [[tribal art]], primitive art, popular art, outsider art, [[traditional art]], [[tramp art]] and working-class art/blue-collar art. As one might expect, these terms can have multiple and even controversial connotations but are often used interchangeably with the term "folk art".

Folk art expresses cultural identity by conveying shared community values and aesthetics. It encompasses a range of utilitarian and decorative media, including cloth, wood, paper, clay, metal and more. If traditional materials are inaccessible, new materials are often substituted, resulting in contemporary expressions of traditional folk art forms. Folk art reflects traditional art forms of diverse community groups — ethnic, tribal, religious, occupational, geographical, age- or gender-based — who identify with each other and society at large. Folk artists traditionally learn skills and techniques through apprenticeships in informal community settings, though they may also be formally educated.

==Antique folk art==
Antique folk art is distinguished from traditional art in that, while collected today based mostly on its artistic merit, it was never intended to be 'art for art’s sake' at the time of its creation. Examples include: weathervanes, old store signs and carved figures, itinerant portraits, carousel horses, fire buckets, painted game boards, cast iron doorstops and many other similar lines of highly collectible "whimsical" antiques.&lt;ref&gt;^a b French, JC (1928). The art of the Pal empire of Bengal.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary folk art==
[[File:655 wrightwood address on wall in Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|200px|a folk art wall in [[Chicago|Lincoln Park, Chicago]]]]
Many folk art traditions like [[quilting]], ornamental [[picture framing]], and [[duck decoy (model)|decoy carving]] continue to thrive, while new forms constantly emerge.

Contemporary folk artists are frequently self-taught as their work is often developed in isolation or in small communities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/treasures/1fa/index.html Slide show of 73 works of folk art with brief descriptions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607035456/http://americanart.si.edu/treasures/1fa/index.html |date=2011-06-07 }} Smithsonian American Art Museum. Retrieved July 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] houses over 70 such artists; for example, [[Elito Circa]], a famous and internationally recognized folk artist, developed his own styles without professional training or guidance from the masters.

==Influence on mainstream art==
Folk artworks, styles and motifs have inspired various artists. For example, [[Pablo Picasso]] was inspired by African tribal sculptures and masks, while [[Natalia Goncharova]] and others were inspired by traditional [[Russians|Russian]] [[popular prints]] called [[lubok]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/9705226m/mmcourse/project/gonch.project/biography.htm ''Goncharova Biography''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720062835/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/9705226m/mmcourse/project/gonch.project/biography.htm |date=2009-07-20 }}, Hatii, retrieved 19/2/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Mosque of Kilwa''' is a [[Jama Masjid|congregational]] [[mosque]] on the island of [[Kilwa Kisiwani]], in [[Tanzania]]. It was likely founded in the tenth century, but the two major stages of construction date to the eleventh or twelfth and thirteenth century, respectively. It is one of the earliest surviving mosques on the east African coast and is one of the first mosques built without a courtyard.

The smaller northern prayer hall dates to the first phase of construction and was built in the 11th or 12th century. It contained a total of 16 bays, supported by nine pillars, originally carved from [[coral]] but later replaced by timber. The structure, which was entirely roofed, was perhaps one of the first mosques to have been originally built without a courtyard.

It was modified in the 13th century adding side pilasters, timber, transverse beams.

In the early fourteenth century, [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]], who also built the nearby [[Palace of Husuni Kubwa]], added a southern extension which included a great dome. This dome was described by [[Ibn Battuta]] after he visited Kilwa in 1331.

[[File:La fenaison, Rosa Bonheur.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Rosa Bonheur]], ''Haymaking in the Auvergne''''', 1854]]
'''''Haymaking in the Auvergne''''' (French: ''Fenaison d'Auvergne'' or ''La fenaison en Auvergne'') is an 1854 oil painting by French artist [[Rosa Bonheur]].  It measures {{convert|2.15|x|4.22|m}}.  

After her first great artistic success, ''[[Ploughing in the Nivernais]]'' exhibited in 1849, Bonheur showed studies of two new paintings to French Minister of Fine Arts [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny]].  He rejected one, ''[[The Horse Fair]]'', and commissioned ''Haymaking in the Auvergne'' instead.  Bonheur focussed on completing ''The Horse Fair'' first, and De Morny attempted to change his mind after its good reception at the [[Paris Salon]] in 1853. 

The painting depicts the loading of a [[hay]] onto a cart pulled by four oxen.  The beasts to the right wait patiently, attended by a man in wide-brimmed hat.  Other men are cutting grass with scythes, while women rake up the hay, and other people use [[pitchforks]] to lift the hay onto a large pile on the cart.  

The painting was bought by the French state in 1854 for 20,000 francs.  It won a gold medal when it was exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris in 1855, as a pendant to ''Ploughing in the Nivernais''.  It was also exhibited as part of the retrospective of 18th century French art at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]. 

The painting was held at the [[Musée du Luxembourg]] from 1874 to 1878, and then moved to the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], where it remains. A smaller version, {{convert|71.1|x|129|cm}} is in a private collection.  The print of an engraving by [[William Turner Davey]] was published in London in 1878 by [[Louis Brall]] &amp; Sons.

'''Henry Condell''' (5 September 1576 ([[Baptism|baptised]]) – December 1627) was an actor in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the playing company for which [[William Shakespeare]] wrote. With [[John Heminges]], he was instrumental in preparing and editing the [[First Folio]], the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;Pogue, Kate. ''Shakespeare's Friends''. Greenwood Publishing Group (2006) {{ISBN|9780275989569}} pp. 129-136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Condell's early life is obscure. It appears that he may have been from [[East Anglia]], as his will mentions 'my Cosen Gilder late of [[New Buckenham|newe Buckenham]]’.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}{{sfn|Honigmann|993|p=159}} According to Edmond:{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only Henry Condell so far discovered at a suitable date in that part of England was the son of a Robert Condell of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, a fishmonger, and his wife, Joan, née Yeomans, of New Buckenham, a market town not far from Norwich. Henry Condell, presumably their son, was baptized at St Peter on 5 September 1576.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditionally, he is associated with the "Harry" who appears in the cast list for [[Richard Tarlton]]'s [[The Seven Deadly Sins (play)|''The Seven Deadly Sins'']], but this identification is little more than conjecture. If the connection is true, then Condell was an actor as early as 1590, acting in [[Lord Strange's Men]] alongside [[John Heminges]] and [[Augustine Phillips]]. Condell was definitely in London by 24 October 1596, when he married, at [[St Laurence Pountney]], Elizabeth Smart (d.1635), the only child of John Smart of the [[Strand, London|Strand]], gentleman.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}} They settled in [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], the parish in which Heminges lived. Condell, like Heminges, served as [[churchwarden]] in that church. Nine children were baptized there, born between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (baptized 26 October 1606), who married Herbert Finch; Henry (baptized 6 May 1610, died 1630); and William (baptized 26 May 1611).{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}{{sfn|Honigmann|Brock|1993|p=158}}

Details of Condell's mature life, as is usual for Renaissance actors, are few. His status within the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Lord Chamberlain's]] and [[King's Men (playing company)|King's]] companies appears to have been high; in official communications he is generally listed shortly after [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]] and Heminges. Actors' wills indicate that he was close to at least some of his colleagues in the company. Shakespeare and Phillips bequeathed him money for mourning rings; [[Nicholas Tooley]] and [[Alexander Cooke]] named him as trustee for their estates. Condell prospered enough in his profession to purchase a country home at [[Fulham]] in [[Middlesex]] and other property, including an estate called Brockhampton in [[Snowshill]], [[Gloucestershire]]. The indentures recording the latter purchase contain the only known example of Condell's signature or handwriting apart from his last will.{{sfn|Barnard|1930|p=1}}

In addition to ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) and ''[[Every Man Out of His Humour]]'' (1599), Condell is known to have performed in four more of [[Ben Jonson|Jonson's]] plays: ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'' (1603), ''[[Volpone]]'' (1605), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610), and ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'' (1611). He was the original Cardinal in [[John Webster]]'s ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' (c. 1613). And he was listed in eight of the cast lists that were added to the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] of [[1679 in literature|1679]]:

Condell appears to have ended his stage career around 1619. He signed each of the nine sheets of his last will and testament on 13 December 1627.{{sfn|Honigmann|Brock|1993|p=160}} He died at Fulham aged 51, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 29 December 1627.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}} His widow, Elizabeth, was buried there on 3 October 1635.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}

Condell left an extensive estate, including shares in the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] and [[Blackfriars Theatre]]s.

Grenzfurther  is an outspoken researcher in the field of sexuality and technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://killscreendaily.com/articles/interviews/stories-about-orcs-and-rape-man-behind-arse-elektronika/ Interview with Arse Elektronika curator Johannes Grenzfurthner in Kill Screen Magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014025030/http://killscreendaily.com/articles/interviews/stories-about-orcs-and-rape-man-behind-arse-elektronika/ |date=14 October 2012 }}: "Stories about orcs and rape: the man behind Arse Elektronika"&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the founders of 'techno-hedonism' (see also: [[barbot]]s).

[[Boing Boing]] magazine referred to Grenzfurthner as ''leitnerd'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html "The story of Traceroute, about a Leitnerd's quest", Boing Boing magazine; April 14, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; a wordplay with the German term [[Leitkultur]] that ironically hints at Grenzfurthner's role in nerd/hacker/art culture.

== Career ==
In the early 1990s, Grenzfurthner was a member of several [[Bulletin Board System|BBS]] message boards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html Interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner about Traceroute, Boing Boing magazine; April 14, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Grenzfurther  used his online connections to create ''monochrom'', a [[zine]] or alternative magazine that dealt with art, technology and subversive cultures. His motivation was to react to the [[The Californian Ideology|emerging conservativism]] in cyber-cultures of the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://chaosradio.ccc.de/cre062.html CRE062 Monochrom]"&lt;/ref&gt; and to combine his political background in the Austrian punk and [[Anti-fascism|antifa]] movement with discussion of new technologies and the cultures they create.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Da Costa, "[http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/interview-johannes-grenzfurthner-monochrom-part-3 Interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner of monochrom, Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317210019/http://www.furtherfield.org/features/interviews/interview-johannes-grenzfurthner-monochrom-part-3 |date=17 March 2012 }}", Furtherfield.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication featured interviews and essays, by e.g. [[Bruce Sterling]], [[HR Giger]],  [[Eric Drexler]], [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Bob Black]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monochrom.at/mono/|title=monochrom print|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its experimental layout style.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.neural.it/art/2010/06/various_editors_monochrom_2634.phtml monochrom #26–34 Ye Olde Self-Referentiality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505115628/http://www.neural.it/art/2010/06/various_editors_monochrom_2634.phtml |date=5 May 2012 }}", Neural, 15 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the group decided to cover new artistic practices&lt;ref&gt;Erin Kobayashi, "[https://www.thestar.com/article/178430--how-to-be-buried-alive How to be buried alive]", ''Toronto Star'', 6 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lechner, "[http://www.ecrans.fr/Pop-Guerilla,3513.html]", Libération, 4 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and started experimenting with different media: computer games, robots, puppet theater, musical, short films, pranks,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKh1RojOyQI Video documentary short "The Thomann In(ter)vention" by Hadas Emma Kedar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071206122116/http://www.researchpubs.com/books/prank2exc16.php Interview with V. Vale in Pranks! 2]&lt;/ref&gt; conferences, online activism, which Grenzfurthner calls 'Urban Hacking'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.othercinema.com/otherzine/?issueid=26&amp;article_id=145|title=OtherZine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more specific: 'Context hacking', a term that Grenzfurthner coined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/2138 ''Context Hacking: Some Examples of How to Mess with Art, the Media System, Law and the Market'', at O'Reilly ETech 2008, San Diego] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314093838/http://en.oreilly.com/et2008/public/schedule/detail/2138 |date=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Context hacking transfers the hackers' objectives and methods to the network of social relationships in which artistic production occurs, and upon which it is dependent. In a metaphoric sense, these relationships also have a source code. Programs run in them, and our interaction with them is structured by a user interface. When we know how a space, a niche, a scene, a subculture or a media or political practice functions, we can change it and "recode" it, deconstructing its power relationships and emancipating ourselves from its compulsions and packaging guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monochrom.at/context-hacking-essay/|title=monochrom: CONTEXT HACKING – Essay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is known for working with different media, art and entertainment formats. Grenzfurthner calls this "looking for the best weapon of mass distribution of an idea".&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/narrativedesign-podcast/finding-your-weapons-of-mass-distribution-8a5241c3dc34#.osmbv9fe6 "Finding Your Weapons of Mass Distribution: A Conversation with Context Hacker Johannes Grenzfurthner", published on Narrative Design, September 19, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Grenzfurthner lives and works in [[Vienna]]. Grenzfurther grew up in [[Stockerau]] in rural Lower Austria&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmthreat.com/interviews/johannes-grenzfurthner-is-kinda-nerdy/ Film Threat, "Johannes Grenzfurthner is kinda nerdy", March 21, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and talks about it in his stand-up comedy "Schicksalsjahre eines Nerds" (2014) and his semi-autobiographical documentary film ''[[Traceroute (film)|Traceroute]]'' (2016).

:If I had not grown up in Stockerau, in the boonies of Lower Austria, than I would not be what I am now. The germ cell of burgeoning nerdism is difference. The yearning to be understood, to find opportunities to share experiences, to not be left alone with one's bizarre interest. At the same time one derives an almost perverse pleasure from wallowing in this deficit. Nerds love deficiency: that of the other, but also their own. Nerds are eager explorers, who enjoy measuring themselves against one another and also compete aggressively. And yet the nerd's existence also comprises an element of the occult, of mystery. The way in which this power is expressed or focused is very important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2016/04/14/the-story-of-traceroute-about.html Interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner about Traceroute, Boing Boing magazine; April 14, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grenzfurthner uses his personal history and upbringing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Chris|title=Nerds and Annihilation, Q&amp;A with Johannes Grenzfurthner|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/79393/traceroute-documentary-about-nerds-and-annihilation|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a source for his work. In a conversation with ''Zebrabutter'' he names the example that he wanted to deal with his claustrophobia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaestle|first1=Thomas|title=Der Film Glossary of Broken Dreams oder: Im Schlachthaus Zum Goldenen Kalb|url=https://www.zebrabutter.net/der-film-glossary-of-broken-dreams-oder-im-schlachthaus-zum-goldenen-kalb.html|website=Zebrabutter|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; so he started a series of art performances where volunteers can be buried alive.

As a child, Grenzfurthner spent a lot of time at his grandparents' farm in the small village of Unterzögersdorf (a [[cadastral community|cadastral municipality]] of Stockerau). His grandparents' stories about [[Naziism]], [[World War II]] and the Soviet occupation in [[allied-occupied Austria]] (1945-1955) influenced monochrom's long-term project [[Soviet Unterzoegersdorf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.livejournal.com/erf-/868742.html "in soviet unterzoegersdorf, game play you", ERF_, 11 December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fm4v2.orf.at/glashuettner/92453/main.html FM4: "Kurzbesuch in Sowjet-Unterzögersdorf", 23 July 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maymūnah Stone''' ({{lang-mt|il-Ġebla ta' Majmuna}} or ''il-Ħaġra ta' Majmuna'', {{lang-ar|شاهد قبر ميمونة}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonello|first=Giovanni|author-link=Giovanni Bonello|date=2000|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=-4doAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=majmuna+malta&amp;dq=majmuna+malta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh06yvvsjKAhVGXCwKHYpqDAwQ6AEIGzAA|title=Histories of Malta|volume=1|publisher=[[Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti]]|isbn=9789993210016|pages=9-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 12th-century [[marble]] [[tombstone]] (of Roman origins) which is believed to have been discovered in [[Xewkija]], [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]. According to judge and historian [[Giovanni Bonello]], the Majmuna Stone is a "spectacular visual relic of the Islamic presence in Malta." It is now exhibited in the [[Gozo Museum of Archaeology]] at the [[Cittadella (Gozo)|Cittadella]] of [[Victoria, Gozo|Victoria]], Gozo.&lt;ref name=bonello&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonello |first1=Giovanni |authorlink1=Giovanni Bonello |title=New Light on Majmuna's Tombstone |journal=Histories of Malta : Deceptions and Perceptions |date=2000 |volume=1 |pages=9–12 |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/2000proc%20New%20Light%20on%20Majmuna's%20Tombstone%20by%20G.%20Bonello.pdf |publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717091106/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/2000proc%20New%20Light%20on%20Majmuna%27s%20Tombstone%20by%20G.%20Bonello.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The marble stone was originally used in the Roman period as its backside indicates. A relief in the form of a rose was sculpted in the Roman architectural style. It was later reused as a tombstone. It is the only [[islamic funeral|islamic funerary]] stone in Malta of its period to be still intact in its original size and the only one which gives a date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/1925saracenicremainsinmaltatzammit.pdf |title=Data |website=melitensiawth.com |format=PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Majmuna Stone is the tombstone of a girl called [[Mahmuna|Majmuna]], who died on 21 March 1174.&lt;ref&gt;[http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/2002%20Malta%20Musulmana%20by%20C.%20Dalli.pdf page 37]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a marble slab which has Roman decorations on the back (such reuse was a common occurrence in Islamic [[North Africa]]). The [[Kufic]] [[Arabic]] inscription approximately translates to:&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Placenames Related to Islam, Christianity and Ethnicity|url=http://www.thinksite.eu/userfiles/Glossary%20of%20placenames%20related%20to%20Islam%20Christianity%20and%20Ethnicity.pdf|website=thinksite.eu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117201321/http://www.thinksite.eu/userfiles/Glossary%20of%20placenames%20related%20to%20Islam%20Christianity%20and%20Ethnicity.pdf|archivedate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the name of [[Allah]], the merciful and compassionate. May He be propitious to the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and to his followers and grant them eternal salvation.&lt;br&gt;
God is great and eternal and He has decreed that his creatures should perish. Of this the prophet of Allah bears witness.&lt;br&gt;
This is the tomb of Maymūnah, daughter of Hassān, son of ‘Ali al-Hudali, known as Ibn as-Susi. She died – Allah's mercy be upon her – on Thursday 16th day of the month of [[Sha'ban]] in the year 569, professing that there is only one God who has no equal.&lt;br&gt;
Look around you! Is there anything everlasting on earth; anything that repels or casts a spell on death? Death robbed me from a palace and, alas, neither doors nor bolts could save me. All I did in my lifetime remains, and shall be reckoned.&lt;br&gt;
Oh he who looks upon this tomb! I am already consumed inside it, and dust has settled on my eyes. On my couch in my abode there is nothing but tears, and what is to happen at my resurrection when I shall appear before my Creator? Oh my brother, be wise and repent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The inscription is dated 1174, almost a century after the [[Norman invasion of Malta]] in 1091. It is believed that Islam remained the dominant religion in Malta until the Arabs were expelled in 1224.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Debattista|first1=Martin|title=Timeline of Malta History|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/history/time-Line.htm|website=aboutmalta.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101133533/http://www.aboutmalta.com/history/time-Line.htm|archivedate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history==
[[File:Islamic funerary limestone Malta.jpeg|thumb|right|Other visual Islamic funerary found at the [[Domvs Romana]] in [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]], Malta]]
The date and location of discovery of the Majmuna Stone are unknown. It is traditionally held that the stone was found in an area known as ''Ta' Majmuna'', between the Gozitan villages of [[Xewkija]] and [[Sannat]]. However, it is also possible that the stone was not found in Malta at all, and it might originate from [[Tunisia]], North Africa.&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buhagiar|first=Mario|date=2007|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=9CRmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=majmuna+stone&amp;dq=majmuna+stone&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjskre1ssjKAhVBfg8KHXz0D6oQ6AEIKDAD|title=The Christianisation of Malta: catacombs, cult centres and churches in Malta to 1530|publisher=Archaeopress|isbn=9781407301099|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1772 book ''Malta illustrata ovvero descrizione di Malta isola del Mare Siciliano e Adriatico'', Count Giovannantonio Ciantar wrote about the stone and illustrated it, but he was not able to decipher its writing. Ciantar wrote that the tombstone was located in the courtyard of a private residence.&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;

In 1799, during the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|Maltese uprising against French occupation]], [[Paul I of Russia]] sent the diplomat Andrey Italinski to ensure the [[National Congress Battalions|insurgents]] that they had Russian protection. Italinski examined the stone during his stay in Malta, and was the first person who managed to decipher part of its inscription.&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;

In an undated early 19th century scrapbook, Father Giuseppe Carmelo Gristi recorded that the stone was discovered "in Malta," and was preserved at Baron Muscat's residence in [[Valletta]]. By 1839, the stone belonged to the Xara family, and it was eventually passed down to Baron Sir Giuseppe Maria de Piro. In 1845, de Piro donated it to the [[National Library of Malta|Public Library]].&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;&lt;ref name="susanna"&gt;{{cite book|first=Susanna|last=Hoe|title=Malta: Women, History, Books and Places|date=2015|url=http://www.holobooks.co.uk/MaltaItineraryChapter17.pdf|chapter=Valletta|page=370–371|archivedate=10 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010130128/http://www.holobooks.co.uk/MaltaItineraryChapter17.pdf|location=[[Oxford]]|publisher=Women's History Press (a division of Holo Books)|oclc=931704918|isbn=9780957215351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone has been part of the collections of the [[Gozo Museum of Archaeology]] since 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Places of Interest|url=http://www.xewkija.gov.mt/xewkija/229-places-of-interest|website=Xewkija Local Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117201017/http://www.xewkija.gov.mt/xewkija/229-places-of-interest|archivedate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called "the pride and joy" of the museum.&lt;ref name=bonello/&gt;

'''Mester de Clerecía''' ("Ministry of Clergy") is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Spanish literature|literature]] [[genre]] that can be understood as an opposition and surpassing of [[Mester de Juglaría]]. It was cultivated in the 13th century by Spanish learned poets, usually [[clerics]] (hence the name 'clerecía'). .

Unlike Mester de Juglaría, Mester de Clerecía was written on paper, not [[Anonymity|anonymous]], with regular metre (the ''cuaderna vía'') and done by educated authors. Also the topics are more serious: religious, historical and novelesque. The stanzas in them are composed of 4 alexandrine lines which contain 14 syllables each.

The most famous authors of this period are [[Gonzalo de Berceo]] and [[Arcipreste de Hita]]. The ''[[Poema de Fernán González]]'' is an example of anonymous mester de clerecía.

These poets carefully counted the number of syllables in each line and strived to achieve perfect lines. The line form is the Alexandrine line (14 syllables) with consonantal rhyme in stanzas of four lines each. This form is also known as the ''cuaderna vía'' or the fourfold way, and was borrowed from France and was popular until the late fourteenth century. Popular themes of these poets were Christian legends, lives of saints, and tales from classical antiquity. The poems were recited to villagers in public plazas. Two traits separate this form from the mester de juglaría: didacticism and erudition. Castilian priest and poet [[Gonzalo de Berceo]] was one of the greatest followers of the mester de clerecía. All of his works were religious; two of the most well known are ''Milagros de Nuestra Señora'' (about the miracles worked by the Virgin Mary) and ''Vida de Santa Oria''. Fourteenth-century poet Juan Ruíz, also known as the [[Arcipreste de Hita]], used the cuaderna vía in parts of his famous work ''Libro de buen amor''. He introduced sixteen-syllable lines.

'''Pancrace Bessa''' (1 January 1772 – 11 June 1846)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100616064346/http://huntbot.andrew.cmu.edu/HIBD/HI-PDF/Bulletin-20-2.pdf ''Bulletin of the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation''] Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. Vol. 20, No. 2, Fall 2008&lt;/ref&gt; was a French natural history artist, best known for his botanical illustrations. Bessa was a student of the great engraver [[Gerard van Spaendonck]] and worked alongside [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]], some of whose influence shows in Bessa's detailed and delicate treatment of his subjects. He was a regular exhibitor at the Paris Salons between 1806 and 1831.

Bessa's favourite subjects were fruit and flowers, with occasional digressions to birds and mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/artist/152262/pancrace-bessa.html Pancrace Bessa on artnet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, the [[Caroline Ferdinande Louise, duchesse de Berry|Duchesse de Berry]], daughter-in-law of [[King Charles X of France]], extended her patronage to him, which led to his giving painting lessons to the de Berry family. Their art connections went back to the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/fr-berry.html History of Berry]&lt;/ref&gt; Bessa also worked on the French royal watercolour collection on vellum the ''Velins du Roi'' from 1823 until his death.

In the early nineteenth century, Bessa, Redouté, Jean-Louis Prévost, [[Lancelot-Théodore Turpin de Crissé]], and [[Adélaïde Labille-Guiard|Madame Vincent]] raised France to pre-eminence in the genre of botanical painting.  Bessa developed a masterful use of [[stipple engraving]] technique, an essential part of colour printing. Bessa and Redoute collaborated on the ''Histoire des Arbres Forestiers de L'Amerique Septentrionale'', which appeared between 1810 and 1813. He prepared some 572 watercolours for ''L'Herbier Général de L'Amateur'' by Mordant de Launey and Loiseleur Longchamp, which appeared between 1810 and 1826.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AlErPQNXxf0C&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=%22pancrace+bessa%22+biography&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iWQ_ljTwPw&amp;sig=dKCJxZ9x5ifkEHMcYNM24oTchLw&amp;hl=en Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Description des Plantes cultivees a Malmaison a Navarre'' used 9 of Bessa's illustrations and 54 by Redouté.

Bessa’s final work was ''Flore des Jardiniers'', published in 1836.

'''Readgeek''' is an online book [[recommendations engine]] and [[social cataloging]] service launched in December 2010. The website allows users to search for books matching their individual taste making use of several [[algorithm]]s. Taking ratings and [[metadata]] of prior read books into account, those algorithms help the site to learn about a users preferences. The service suggests books other users with similar tastes have enjoyed, rather than offering up books similar to the ones a user already ranked.&lt;ref name=bu&gt;{{Cite news| author=

'''Saadiyat Island''' ({{lang-ar| جزيرة السعديات}}; ''{{Transl|ar|jazīrat as-saʿdiyyāt}}'', for "Island of Happiness"&lt;ref name="Group2014" /&gt;) is a [[Cultural tourism|tourism-cultural]] project for nature and [[Culture of the United Arab Emirates|Emirati heritage and culture]].&lt;ref name="Exell2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQu4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|title=Modernity and the Museum in the Arabian Peninsula|date=10 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-27901-3|page=63|author=Karen Exell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, under development, consists of a large, [[Low-lying coast|low-lying]] island, {{convert|500|m}} off the coast of [[Abu Dhabi]] island, [[UAE]]. A mixed commercial, residential, and leisure project is currently under construction on the island, expected to be completed in 2020. Saadiyat Island is expected to become Abu Dhabi's cultural centre, mostly for the Island’s Cultural District that is expected to include eight museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uae-embassy.org/news-media/saadiyat-island-home-guggenheim-and-louvre-museums|title=Saadiyat Island Home to Guggenheim and Louvre Museums|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island is five-minute drive away from downtown Abu Dhabi, 20 minutes from [[Abu Dhabi International Airport]], and one hour from Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.saadiyat.ae/en/about-saadiyat |title= About Saadiyat Island Abu Dhabi - Project by TDIC
|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The project is being developed by the [[Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority]]-held [[Tourism Development &amp; Investment Company]] (TDIC). The company plans is to dispose of development to private investors that will work on their sites in accordance with the master plan as well as other ground rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/abu-dhabi/press-room/press-releases/1853-abu-dhabi-to-build-gehry-designed-Guggenheim|title=Abu Dhabi to Build Gehry-Designed Guggenheim Museum|publisher=The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|date=July 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saadiyat.ae/en/about-saadiyat|title= Saadiyat in Numbers|website=www.saadiyat.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan for Saadiyat island was done by [[EDAW]] and continued under [[AECOM]].

The Island is located 500 meters off the coast of Abu Dhabi. An entire district on the island is devoted to culture and the arts, with exhibitions, permanent collections, productions and performances.&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdic.ae/TDIC/aboutus/Pages/index.aspx|title=Overview - About Us - TDIC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Close cooperation ===
In developing the island project, the [[Cooperation|close cooperation]] model is being followed by TDIC and the government agencies. The government-related entity has been working in cooperation with government agencies such as the Department of Transport to create an integrated project, complete with public amenities, in a relatively short period of time. Such close cooperation reassures smaller, private developers, who follow the GRE by providing smaller-scale works like shops, entertainment venues or real estate developments, which in turn attract a [[Residency (domicile)|full-time resident]] community.&lt;ref name="Group2014" /&gt;

== Features and services ==
The island has several cultural institutions in [[Saadiyat Island#Saadiyat Cultural District|Saadiyat Cultural District]].

== The Accommodation Village ==
The Saadiyat Accommodation Village, opened in 2009, is a modern housing community that offers social, recreational and educational facilities for residents.&lt;ref name="ftn5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saadiyat.ae/en/worker-welfare|title=Welfare|website=saadiyat.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development and labor conditions ===
The [[European Union]] has sent several delegations to Saadiyat Accommodation Village to meet with representatives from the TDIC.&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/eu-delegates-positive-about-saadiyat-workers-living-space|title=EU delegates ‘positive’ about Saadiyat workers’ living space|website=thenational.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Gulf Ultra Luxury Faction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/arts/design/inside-frank-gehrys-guggenheim-abu-dhabi.html|title=A New Art Capital, Finding Its Own Voice|date=7 December 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued a report accusing the contractors working on Saadiyat Island of violating the rights of workers on the site by charging them fees to obtain their work contracts, paying them less than they were promised, and holding their passports to prevent their resignation or departure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/05/18/uae-exploited-workers-building-island-happiness UAE: Exploited Workers Building ‘Island of Happiness’].&lt;/ref&gt; The report also called on western partners (including Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, the [[French Museum Agency]], and [[New York University]]) to seek contractual assurances that these violations would not continue once construction on facilities for those institutions was underway. The alleged violations of the workers' rights would also constitute violations of [[United Arab Emirates]] law. The activist group [[Gulf Labor]], which has staged protests at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] and the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]], continues to pressure Western art museums to use ethical labor practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/19/the-gulf-art-war|title=The Gulf Art War|last=Azimi|first=Negar|date=December 19, 2016|website=The New Yorker|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saadiyat Cultural District ===
Located at the Western end of the island, Saadiyat Cultural District occupies not much more than 10 per cent of the total area of the project.&lt;ref name="WippelBromber2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfmXCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA179|title=Under Construction: Logics of Urbanism in the Gulf Region|date=17 February 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00529-2|pages=179–|author1=Steffen Wippel|author2=Katrin Bromber|author3=Birgit Krawietz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cultural District lies on a total area of {{convert|2.43|km2|mi2}}. There are plans to spend 85 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] on the following projects:
* [[Louvre Abu Dhabi|Louvre]] museum, which was planned to open in 2015,&lt;ref name="open1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saadiyat.ae/en/masterplan/saadiyat-cultural-district/louvre-abu-dhabi2.html|title=Saadiyat -Louvre Abu Dhabi  |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Abu Dhabi Art}}
The Cultural District will house three major museums: The local Louvre and Guggenheim, as well as the Zayed National Museum. The contract for the Louvre Abu Dhabi was awarded in January 2013 to Arabtec Construction, Oger Abu Dhabi and Constructor San José, and it was scheduled for completion in 2015. The Zayed National Museum, designed by architect Norman Foster of [[Foster and Partners]], was set to open in 2016. The Guggenheim, by [[Frank Gehry]], is slated to open in 2017.&lt;ref name="Group2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RDPBwAAQBAJ|title=The Report: Abu Dhabi 2014|last=|first=|date=25 March 2014|publisher=Oxford Business Group|year=|isbn=978-1-907065-97-2|location=|pages=|via=|author=Oxford Business Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these institutions will represent a significant attraction in its own right.

[[File:50 Euro bill watermark.jpg|thumb|A hologram on a 50 [[Euro]] banknote]]
'''Security printing''' is the field of the [[printing]] industry that deals with the printing of items such as [[banknote]]s, [[cheque]]s, [[passport]]s, [[tamper-evident]] [[label]]s, [[security tape]]s, product [[authentication]], [[stock certificate]]s, [[postage stamp]]s and [[identity card]]s. The main goal of security printing is to prevent [[forgery]], tampering, or [[counterfeit]]ing. More recently many of the techniques used to protect these high-value documents have become more available to commercial printers whether they are using the more traditional offset and flexographic presses or the newer digital platforms. Businesses are protecting their lesser-value documents such as transcripts, coupons and prescription pads by incorporating some of the features listed below to ensure that they cannot be forged or that alteration of the data cannot occur undetected.

A number of technical methods are used in the security printing industry.

== Special paper ==
Most banknotes are made of heavy [[paper]], almost always from cotton fibres for strength and durability, in some cases linen or speciality coloured or forensic fibres are added to give the paper added individuality and protect against counterfeiting. Some countries, including [[Canada]], [[Nigeria]], [[Romania]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Israel]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], produce [[Polymer banknote|polymer (plastic) banknotes]], to improve longevity and allow the inclusion of a small transparent window (a few millimeters in size) as a security feature that is difficult to reproduce using common counterfeiting techniques.

== Watermarks ==

A [[watermark]] is a recognizable image or pattern in paper that appears lighter or darker than surrounding paper when viewed with a light from behind the paper, due to paper density variations. A watermark is made by impressing a water coated metal stamp or dandy roll onto the paper during manufacturing. Watermarks were first introduced in Bologna, Italy in 1282; as well as their use in security printing, they have also been used by papermakers to identify their product. Watermarks can also be made on polymer currency, for example, Australia has its coat of arms watermarked on all its plastic bills.

=== Simulated watermarks ===

Printed with white ink, simulated watermarks have a different reflectance than the base paper and can be seen at an angle. Because the ink is white, it cannot be photocopied or scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Features|url=https://www.advlaser.com/v/vspfiles/files/pdf/security.pdf|publisher=Advantage Laser Products|accessdate=26 May 2014|location=Atlanta, GA|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intaglio printing ==

[[intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]] is a printing technique in which the image is incised into a surface. Normally, copper or zinc plates are used, and the incisions are created by [[etching]] or [[engraving]] the image, but one may also use [[mezzotint]]. In printing, the surface is covered in ink, and then rubbed vigorously with tarlatan cloth or newspaper to remove the ink from the surface, leaving it in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink to the paper.

The very sharp printing obtained from the intaglio process is hard to imitate by other means. Intaglio also allows for the creation of latent images which are only visible when the document is viewed at a very shallow angle.

== Geometric lathe work ==
A [[guilloché]] is an ornamental pattern formed of two or more curved bands that interlace to repeat a circular design. They are made with a [[geometric lathe]].

[[File:Map3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A guilloché]]

== Microprinting ==
This involves the use of extremely small text, and is most often used on currency and bank checks. The text is generally small enough to be indiscernible to the naked eye. Cheques, for example, use [[microprinting|microprint]] as the signature line.

{{further|Microprinting}}

== Optically variable color-changing inks ==

[[Optically Variable Ink|Color changing inks]] are made from [[mica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weather Resistance Series, Pearlescent Pigment, Pearl EX Pigments|url=http://www.dychemco.com/pearlescent-pigment/1164252.html|publisher=Dynasty Chemicals (NingBo) Co., Ltd.|accessdate=26 May 2014|quote=Pearlescent Pigments are made from mica and they are widely used in paits, coating, printing ink, plastic, cosmetic, leather, wallpaper etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optically Variable Ink|Color changing inks]] colored magnetizable inks are prepared by including chromatic pigments of high color strength. The magnetic pigments’ strong inherent color generally reduces the spectrum of achievable shades. Generally, pigments should be used at high concentrations to ensure that sufficient magnetizable material is applied even in thin offset coats. Some magnetic pigment are best suited for colored magnetizable inks due to their lower blackness.
Homogenous magnetization (no preferred orientation) is easily obtained on pigment made of spherical particles. Best results are achieved when remanence and coercive field strength are very low and the saturating magnetization is high.

Magnetic pigments are also used in ribbon inks for coding and reading (MICR = Magnetic Ink Character Recognition).
The pigment is dispersed in a binder system (resin, solvent) or a wax compound and applied either by pressing or by hot melt to a carrier film (usually polyethylene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnetic pigments|date=July 2004|page=6|url=http://www.basf.pl/ecp1/Poland/pl/function/conversions:/publish/upload/02_Products_Industries/04_Business_Segments/Pigmenty/Pigmenty_magnetyczne_.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2014|publisher=BASF, The Chemical Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When pearlescent pigments are viewed at different angles the angle of the light as it's perceived makes the color appear to change as the magnetic fields within the particles shift direction.

== Holograms ==
{{Main|Security hologram}}
A [[hologram]] may be embedded either via hot-stamping foil, wherein an extremely thin layer of only a few [[micrometers]] of depth is bonded into the paper or a plastic substrate by means of a [[hot-melt adhesive]] (called a size coat) and heat from a metal die, or it may be directly embossed as holographic paper, or onto the laminate of a card itself.
When incorporated with a custom design pattern or logo, hologram hot stamping foils become security foils that protect credit cards, passports, bank notes and value documents from counterfeiting. Holograms help in curtailing forging, and duplication of products hence are very essential for security purposes. Once stamped on a product, they cannot be removed or forged, enhancing the product at the same time. Also from a security perspective, if stamped, a hologram is a superior security device as it is virtually impossible to remove from its substrate.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

== Security threads ==

Metal threads and foils, from simple iridescent features to foil color copying to foils with additional optically variable effects are often used.

There are two kinds of security threads.  One is a thin aluminum coated and partly de-metalized polyester film thread with microprinting which is embedded in the security paper as banknote or passport paper.  The other kind of security thread is the single or multicolor sewing thread made from cotton or synthetic fibers, mostly UV fluorescent, for the [[bookbinding]] of passport booklets.

On occasion, the banknote designers succumb to the Titanic effect (excess belief in the latest technology), and place too much faith in some particular trick. An example is the forgery of British banknotes in the 1990s.  British banknotes in the 1990s featured a metal strip through the paper about 1&amp;nbsp;mm wide that comes to the paper surface every 8&amp;nbsp;mm. When examined in reflected light, it appears to have a dotted metallic line running across it, but when viewed through transmitted light, the metal strip is dark and solid.

Duplicating this was thought to be difficult, but a criminal gang was able to reproduce it quickly. They used a cheap hot-stamping process to lay down a metal strip on the surface of the paper, then printed a pattern of solid bars over it using white ink to leave the expected metal pattern visible. At their trial, they were found to have forged tens of millions of pounds’ worth of notes over a period of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems|page=245|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-12.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2014|quote=banknote designers succumb to the Titanic effect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magnetic ink ==
Because of the speed with which they can be read by computer systems, magnetic ink character recognition is used extensively in banking, primarily for personal checks. The ink used in [[magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) technology is also used to greatly reduce errors in automated (or computerized) reading.

Some people believe that the magnetic ink was intended as a fraud prevention concept, yet the original intent was to have a non-optical technology so that writing on the cheque, like signatures, would not interfere with reading. The main magnetic fonts (E13-B and CMC7) are downloadable for a small fee and in addition magnetic toner is available for many printers. Some higher resolution toners have sufficient magnetic properties for magnetic reading to be successful without special toner.

== Serial numbers ==
[[Serial number]]s help make legitimate documents easier to track and audit. To help detect forgeries serial numbers will normally have a [[Check digit]] to verify the serial number.

Another method of protection is to create trap numbers within the serial number range. For example, the system may automatically invalidate numbers which are in a range of 200-300 (e.g. 210, 205 would be invalid). The system may even take single random numbers within a block (e.g. ending in 51, 37, 48 within a 200-300 range would be invalid).

== Anti-copying marks ==
In the late twentieth century advances in computer and photocopy technology made it possible for people without sophisticated training to easily copy currency. In an attempt to prevent this, banks have sought to add filtering features to the software and hardware available to the public that senses features of currency, and then locks out the reproduction of any material with these marks. One known example of such a system is the [[EURion constellation]].

== Copy-evident ==
{{Main|copy-evident document}}
Sometimes only the original document has value. An original signed [[cheque]] for example has value but a photocopy of it does not. An original prescription script can be filled but a photocopy of it should not be. Copy-evident technologies provide security to hard copy documents by helping distinguish between the original document and the copy.

The most common technology to help differentiate originals from copies is the [[void pantograph]]. Void pantographs are essentially invisible to the untrained, naked eye on an original but when scanned or copied the layout of lines, dots and dashes will reveal a word (frequently VOID and hence the name) or symbol that clearly allows the copy to be identified. This technology is available on both traditional presses (offset and flexographic) and on the newer digital platforms. The advantage of a digital press is that in a single pass through the printer a void pantograph with all the variable data can be printed on plain paper.

Copy-evident paper, sometimes marketed as ‘security paper’, is pre-printed void pantograph paper that was usually produced on an offset or flexographic press. The quality of the void pantograph is usually quite good because it was produced on a press with a very high resolution and when only a small number of originals are to be printed it can be a cost effective solution however the advent of the digital printer has rapidly eroded this benefit.

A second technology which complements and enhances the effectiveness of the void pantograph is the Verification Grid. This technology is visible on the original, usually as fine lines or symbols but when photocopied these lines and images disappear; the inverse reaction of the void pantograph. The most common examples of this technology are on the fine lines at the edge of a cheque which will disappear when copied or on a coupon when a symbol, such as a shopping cart, disappears when an unauthorized copy is made. Verification Grid is available for either traditional or digital presses.

Together the void pantograph and the Verification Grid complement each other because the reactions to copying are inverse, resulting in a higher degree of assurance that a hard copy document is an original.

== Prismatic coloration ==
The use of color can greatly assist the prevention of forgeries. By including a color on a document a color photocopier must be used in the attempt to make a copy however the use of these machines also tends to enhance the effectiveness of other technologies such as Void Pantographs and Verification Grids (see Copy-evident above).

By using two or more colors in the background and blending them together a prismatic effect can be created. This can be done on either a traditional or a digital press. When a document using this technique is attempted to be photocopied the scanning and re-creation by a color copier is inexact usually resulting in banding or blotching and thereby immediate recognition of the document as being a copy.

A frequent example of prismatic coloring is on checks where it is combined with other techniques such as the Void Pantograph to increase the difficulty of successful counterfeiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Features|url=https://www.advlaser.com/v/vspfiles/files/pdf/security.pdf|publisher=Advantage Laser Products|accessdate=26 May 2014|quote=Prismatic Two-Color Pantograph A multi-color background in which two colors change density and blend into each other, making it very difficult to reproduce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Halo ==
Carefully created images can be hidden in the background or in a picture on a document. These images cannot be seen without the help of an inexpensive lens of a specific line screening. When placed over the location of the image and rotated the image becomes visible. If the document is photocopied the Halo image is lost.

Halo can be printed on traditional or digital presses. The advantage of traditional presses is that multiple images can be overlaid in the same location and become visible in turn as the lens is rotated.

Halo is used as a technique to authenticate the originality of the document and may be used to verify critical information within the document. For example, the value of a coupon might be encoded as a Halo image that could be verified at the time of redemption or similarly the seat number on a sporting event ticket.

== False-positive testing ==
False-positive testing derives its name because the testing requires both a false and a positive reaction to authenticate a document. The most common instance is the widely available counterfeit detector marker seen in many banks and stores.

Counterfeit detector markers use a chemical interaction with the substrate, usually paper, of a document turning it a particular color. Usually a marker turns newsprint black and leaves currency or specially treated areas on a document clear or gold. The reaction and coloring varies depending upon the formulation. Banknotes, being a specially treated substrate, usually behave differently than standard newsprint or other paper and this difference is how counterfeits are detected by the markers.

False-positive testing can also be done on documents other than currencies as a means to test their authenticity. With the stroke of a marker a symbol, word or value can be revealed that will allow the user to quickly verify the document, such as a coupon. In more advanced applications the marker creates a barcode which can be scanned for verification or reference to other data within the document resulting in a higher degree of assurance of authenticity.

Photocopied documents will lack the special treating of the substrate so are easily detectable. False-positive testing generally is a one time test because once done the results remain visible so while useful as part of a coupon this technique is not suitable for ID badges for example.

== Fluorescent dyes ==
[[Fluorescent dyes]] are dyes which [[fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light or other unusual lighting. These show up as words, patterns or pictures and may be visible or invisible under normal lighting. This feature is also incorporated into many banknotes and other documents - e.g. Northern Ireland NHS prescriptions show a picture of local '8th wonder' the Giant's Causeway in UV light. Some producers include multi-frequency fluorescence, such that different elements fluoresce under specific frequencies of light.

== Registration of features on both sides ==
Banknotes are typically printed with fine alignment between the printing on each side of the note. This allows the note to be examined for this feature, and provides opportunities to unambiguously align other features of the note to the printing. Again, this is difficult to imitate accurately enough in most print shops.

== Electronic devices ==
With the advent of [[RFID]], it is possible to insert extremely small RF-active devices into the printed product to enhance document security. This is most apparent in modern biometric passports, where an RFID chip mirrors the printed information.

== [[Thermochromatic]] ink ==
Security ink with a normal "trigger" temperature of {{convert|88|F|C}}, which will either disappear or change colors when the ink is rubbed, usually by the fingertips.

== Latent images ==
Pressure-sensitive or hot stamped labels characterized with a normal (gray or colored) appearance. When viewed via a special filter (such as a polarizer) an additional, normally latent, image appears.

'''Shadowland Theatre''' is  a [[community art]]s [[theatre]] and [[artist collective|collective of visual and theatre artists]] on [[Toronto Islands|Toronto Island]]. It is a professional, [[not-for-profit]] [[theatre]] company and [[registered charity]], [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1994.

==History==
Shadowland Repertory Company (named after the early Hollywood magazine, Shadowland)  was founded&lt;ref&gt;"Toronto Star", July 25, 1984, ""Mainlanders invited to vaudeville history of Toronto Island", B3&lt;/ref&gt; in 1982 by Whitney Smith and Victor Coleman with a mandate of producing musicals using shadow puppetry and other alternative theatrical media. The first production, ''Radio Ghost'',&lt;ref&gt;"Toronto Star", April 1, 1982, D7&lt;/ref&gt; a musical about the fictional meeting of Canadian radio inventor [[Reginald Fessenden]] and radio diva [[Jessica Dragonette]], was co-written by Smith and Coleman and toured artist-run centres across Canada.

During the [[Harbourfront Centre (Toronto)|World Stage]] in 1982, the British company [[Welfare State International]] worked in collaboration with the Toronto Island community to produce the ''Tempest on Snake Island''. Inspired by this production, Island residents Smith and Sarah Miller raised funds for a second Shadowland production, along the same lines, to be part of the city’s 1984 sesquicentennial celebrations. Welfare State principals Boris and Maggie Howarth were hired to assist and the result was "Island Follies", a historical fantasia.&lt;ref&gt;"Toronto Star", July 25, 1984, Greg Quill, "Mainlanders invited to vaudeville history of Toronto Island." B3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Smith and Coleman handed over the company to the key group of Toronto Island artists who worked on the show —  Kathleen Doody, Leida Englar, Jerry Englar, Brad Harley and Sarah Miller — and it was renamed Shadowland Theatre.

Shadowland’s early development was significantly influenced by Welfare State's format of professional [[artist]]s engaging communities in collective performance, and this method has become the backbone of Shadowland’s way of working ever since. Other major influences are [[Bread and Puppet Theater]], [[Peter Minshall]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival|Trinidad Carnival]] ( leading to many years of involvement in [[Caribana Festival (Canada)|Caribana parades]]) and ongoing working relationships with many Caribbean artists. These influences have contributed to Shadowland's bold and visually distinctive form of [[theatre]] and [[performance|performance events]].  In the past decade the theatre has created signature processional outdoor theatre performances and collaborated with a wide range of communities and artists from many disciplines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6442">'''Tasos Zembylas''' (born 1962 in [[Cyprus]]) is a [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Social sciences|social scientist]] with focus in [[aesthetics]] and [[Cultural institutions|cultural institution]] studies.

== Life ==

From 1991 to 1997, Zembylas studied philosophy, history of art and sociology at the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1995 he held a research grant at the "Internationales Forschungszentrum Kulturwissenschaften" in Vienna. From 1997 to 1999 he was commissioned to carry out various studies in the field of [[education]] and [[vocational training]]. He also lectured on aesthetics and sociology of art at the University of Vienna and at the University of Applied Art in Vienna. In 1999, he was appointed assistant professor at the Institute of Culture Management and Culture Studies of the [[University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna]]. Having completed his advanced habilitation thesis in 2003, he was appointed university professor for [[Cultural Institutions Studies]] at the same institute. In 2009, Zembylas was visiting professor at [[Zeppelin University]] in Friedrichshafen, and 2010 he moved to the Institute for Music Sociology at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna.

== Research ==

Major research interests of Tasos Zembylas are [[epistemology]] of artistic creative practices, [[Cultural Institutions Studies]], and [[cultural policy]].
In the 1990s Tasos Zembylas investigated the formation process of the contemporary concept of art. His approach was to study not only relevant discourses and art theories in [[visual arts]], but, equally important, to describe and analyse institutional structures, processes of valuations and other practices taking place in the art world. He thereby developed a practice-oriented and practice-theoretical approach to the [[sociology]] of the arts.
The close connection between arts and social practices, as well as between [[art world]]s and [[social structure]]s embodied in cultural activities, led Zembylas in early 2000s to focus on cultural, social, political and economic analysis of arts and culture. His theoretical efforts resulted in the elaboration of an inter-disciplinary approach towards the major topics of [[cultural institution studies]]. In addition to his theoretical work, Zembylas has conducted several empirical studies, notably on public funding of the arts in Austria, which dealt with the legal standards prevailing in administrative subsidy procedures as well as the effects of public funding policies.
From 2006 to 2008, together with Claudia Dürr, Zembylas investigated the literary [[writing process]] from an epistemological perspective. The study focused on the formation and effects of artistic-practical know-how, as well as on the role of professional experience in the [[creative process]]. This study led to a general [[epistemology]] of artistic creative practices.
From 2013 to 2015, together with Andreas Holzer, Annegret Huber, Martin Niederauer and Rosa Reitsamer, Zembylas conducted a similar study on [[Musical composition|composition]] processes in the field of contemporary [[art music]]. In this case, the focus was on the materiality and processuality of artistic practices. In addition, the synergy of different forms of [[knowledge]] (especially [[tacit knowledge]]) was systematically investigated.
Tasos Zembylas has also published a literary travelogue about [[Mount Athos|Athos]]. In it he not only addressed religious practices but also the economic management of the Holy Monastery of [[Vatopedi]], which made the headlines in the international press in 2008 in connection with a real estate scandal.

'''The Burial''' were an [[Oi!]] band that incorporated [[ska]], [[northern soul]] and [[Folk music|folk]] influences into their music. Formed in 1981 in [[Yorkshire]], England, they released one album, ''A Day On the Town'', in 1988, and worked with [[Bradford]]'s [[Anarchism|anarchist]] rant-poet [[Nick Toczek]] on various projects under the name '''Britanarchists'''. They disbanded in 1988.

Two of The Burial's earliest recordings, "Backstreet Child" and "I Just Can't Forget", appear on the compilation album ''Oi! The Demos (80-83)'', whose liner notes describe them as "the prototype [[Skacore]] band". They have three songs on the compilation ''Oi! of Sex'' — two as The Burial ("Old Mans Poison", "Friday Night") and one as '''Nick Toczek's Britanarchists''' ("Stiff With a Quiff"). Their song "Sheila" appears on the compilation ''The Sound of Oi!'', and their song "Holding On" appears on  ''Oi! Glorious Oi!''

Their sound is described in ''Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible'' as a "volatile Punk and Soul cocktail."&lt;ref name="Oi!"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=George |title=Spirit of '69 - A Skinhead Bible |publisher=S.T. Publishing |date=1991 |location=Dunoon, Scotland |isbn=1-898927-10-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "Oi!: The Truth", [[Garry Bushell]] wrote: "Scarborough’s Burial cited Oi and 2-Tone as forebears and mixed the sounds of ska and rowdy bootboy [[punk rock|punk]] in their set." &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080731120915/http://www.garry-bushell.co.uk/oi/index.asp Oi!: The Truth]&lt;/ref&gt; A song by Bushell's band The Gonads, "Joys of Oi!", included the lyric "Burial at number one". ''[[i-D]]'' magazine described The Burial as "probably the first skinhead band to ever play ska".&lt;ref name="Skin"&gt;[http://skinheadheaven.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49:ska-party-id-magazine-article-1988&amp;catid=40:cuttings&amp;Itemid=72 Ska Party]&lt;/ref&gt; The band were regularly featured in the [[Trojan skinhead|traditional skinhead]] fanzine ''Hard as Nails'', and were described in Issue 4 as "Great Streetpunk hopes".

== Political views ==
Eric "Barney" Barnes was the chief [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] influence on the band. He was an active member of the [[Militant tendency]], and he vigorously supported the National Union of Miners in its year-long [[strike action]], as well as supporting [[working class]] revolutionary [[Socialism|socialist]] groups such as [[Red Action]], to whom The Burial gave an interview in which guitarist Chris said: "I've got short hair doesn't mean I'm a frigging Nazi. Don't mean I'm a Commie either."&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B11Ai00qi0ONNWI3MTdhODQtZTk0MC00ZmU0LWJlNDUtNDdmYTVlYjRjODc0/edit?pli=1 Red Action Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes told ''[[i-D]]'' magazine: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I come from an iron ore mining village near Middlesbrough and a strong trade union background. A lot of my family were original skins and to us [[Skinhead]] was a working class movement and fascism is totally opposed to that. The strong grounding in working class politics has given Northern Skins an abhorrence of  the National Front that London skins never had.&lt;ref name="Skin"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''[[i-D]]'' wrote: "They formed six years ago, emerging at the same time as [[The Redskins]], but whereas the later responded to boneheads by moving into the student circuit, a strong feature of The Burial's gigs was the Nazi-bashing."&lt;ref name="Skin"/&gt; The article includes a quote from Paul McGinn of the Glasgow Spy Kids: "They were the first band to stand up and say what a lot of people felt".&lt;ref name="Skin"/&gt; The book ''Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible'' included a quote from singer Mick Hall at a concert in Stockton in 1985, in which he said to the audience: "You read in the papers all Skinheads are thick fascist thugs. I'm not a thick fascist thug. Are there any thick fascist thugs in here?"&lt;ref name="Oi!"/&gt; The Burial are described in Oi! Oi! Oi!: Class, Locality, and British Punk (Oxford: Oxford University Press) as "militantly anti-fascist". &lt;ref&gt; https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/24/4/606/1671204Worley &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Column''''' ({{lang-ro|Columna}}) is a 1968 Romanian [[historical film]] directed by [[Mircea Drăgan]]. The film was selected as the Romanian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[41st Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; 

The action starts near the end of [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] (106 AD), when south western [[Dacia]] was transformed into a [[Roman province]]: [[Roman Dacia]]. It covers the years after the war, including the beginnings of the [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] and [[Origin of the Romanians|Romanian ethnogenesis]], the construction of [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]], resistance of the [[Free Dacians]] and first [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]].

==Plot==
===Part 1===
As the Romans under [[Trajan]] take the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa, the Dacian king [[Decebalus]] and his closest followers are forced to retreat. Trajan takes command of the city and orders one of his officers, Tiberius, to pursue the defeated king. In a cave, Decebalus broods on his defeat, and tells his devoted supporter Gerula that the Dacian people must continue to resist.  Tiberius and his men catch up with Decebalus and Gerula. Decebalus kills himself to avoid capture. To Gerula's horror, Tiberius chops off Decebalus' head and right hand as trophies to take back to Trajan. While they are returning to the Roman camp Gerula escapes. He gathers together a group of Dacians and takes them to a part of the land not yet under Roman control.

At Sarmizegetusa, Trajan orders Tiberius to remain in Dacia and preside over the Romanisation of the territory, building fortifications, victory monuments and Roman settlements. Tiberius initially meets resistance from the local people, but wins over influential local chief Ciungu when he shows clemency to his rebellious son. One of the Roman centurions, Sabinus, falls in love with a local woman, a devotee of the Dacian god [[Zalmoxis]]. They become lovers. 

The Romans seem to be building a successful community, but nearby, in a secret location, Gerula is training up free Dacians, including Decebalus's grandson, to launch a new campaign to destroy the Romans and restore the Dacian kingdom. Sabinus accidentally discovers the free Dacian camp, and a clash occurs, during which Gerula slashes Sabinus' face, blinding him.  Andrada, an aristocratic Dacian woman who has killed a Roman soldier, is brought back to the camp. Again Tiberius shows clemency. He also tries to woo Andrada, who rejects him. Eventually, after a period of distrust, Tiberius wins over Andrada, and the couple are married. Tiberius tells Ciungu that he intends to build a town, and use Roman technology to improve the lives of the Dacian people. Andrada gives birth to her first child with Tiberius, a boy. He proudly shows the baby to the community, to cheers from both Romans and Dacians.

===Part 2===
Years later, Tiberius has built up the settlement into a Roman town. Trajan sends a Roman official to legally declare it to be a municipality. During the ceremony the official is killed by an arrow — shot by one of Gerula's men. The colony nevertheless prospers. The blinded Sabinus becomes the local schoolteacher, instructing the children in Roman culture. Andrada, however, also passes on Dacian lore and stories of pre-Roman times to her son. Decebalus's grandson is now fully grown, becoming the potential new king Gerula wants him to be. Gerula decides it is time to launch the war of liberation against the Romans and their collaborators. A shipment of mined gold is attacked. Almost all those travelling with it, including Ciungu, are killed. One man is left alive to tell Tiberius that all such "traitors" will be killed. Tiberius is furious. He arranges a meeting with Gerula and tells him that if the Romans and the Dacians continue to attack each other, they will only weaken the country, making it ripe for invasion by the barbarians to the north. Gerula ponders this possibility. While doing so, he comes across Tiberius' young son, who has wandered away from the town to explore. Talking to him, he realises that the combination of Roman and Dacian culture can be positive. 

Just as Tiberius predicted, the chief of the northern barbarians plans to use the disorder in Dacia to expand into its territory. He meets with Gerula and suggests they join together to expel the Romans. Gerula decides that such an alliance would only replace invaders who brought civilization, with invaders who will bring barbarism. He convinces Decebalus's grandson to aid the Romans. The barbarian chief launches his attack on the Roman town. Tiberius has prepared sophisticated defences, but the force of the barbarian attack threatens to overwhelm the Romans until the free Dacians come to their aid in a cavalry attack. Tiberius sends in the Roman cavalry to support them and the barbarians are crushed. However, Decebalus's grandson is killed in the battle. Devastated, Gerula realises his dream of a restored Dacian kingdom is over. As Tiberius approaches the body of Decebalus' grandson, Gerula imagines he intends to decapitate him, as he did his grandfather. Confused and distraught, Gerula attacks and kills Tiberius. 

Tiberius' body is brought back to the town accompanied by a chastened Gerula. As Andrada laments, Gerula tells the dead man's son that his father was a great warrior who fought for his people, and that he must grow up to defend the new country his father helped create.

'''''The Hiding Place''''' is a 1971 book on the life of [[Corrie ten Boom]], written by ten Boom together with [[John and Elizabeth Sherrill]].

The idea of a book on ten Boom's life began as John and Elizabeth Sherrill were doing research for the book ''[[God's Smuggler]]'', about ten Boom's fellow Dutchman, [[Andrew van der Bijl]].  Corrie ten Boom was already in her mid-seventies when the Sherrills first heard about her. She was one of Brother Andrew's favorite traveling companions and many of his recollections were about her. In the preface to the book, the Sherrills recount:

:''...his [Brother Andrew's] fascinating stories about her in Vietnam, where she had earned that most honorable title "Double-old Grandmother" - and in a dozen other Communist countries - came to mind so often that we finally had to hold up her hands to stop his flow of reminiscence. "We could never fit her into the book," we said. "She sounds like a book in herself." It's the sort of thing you say. Not meaning anything.''

It was later made into a [[The Hiding Place (film)|film of the same name]], along with a comic book adaptation.

The title refers to both the physical hiding place where the ten Boom family hid [[Jew]]s from the [[Nazi]]s, and also to the Scriptural message found in Psalm 119:114 which states, "Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word... "&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/monkeynote/pmHidingPlaceSample.pdf Literature notes on the Hiding Place]". ''PinkMonkey''. 2006. Accessed on May 31 of 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The book begins with the ten Boom family celebrating the 100th anniversary of the family [[watch]] and watch repair business, now run by the family's elderly father, [[Casper ten Boom]]. The business took up the ground floor of the family home (known as the Béjé). Casper lived with his unmarried daughters Corrie (the narrator and a watchmaker herself) and [[Betsie ten Boom|Betsie]], who took care of the house. It seemed as if everyone in the Dutch town of [[Haarlem]] had shown up to the party, including Corrie's sister Nollie, her brother Willem, and her nephews Peter and Kik. Willem, a minister in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], brought a Jewish man, who had just escaped from Germany, as a guest. The man's beard had been burned off by some thugs, a grim reminder of what was happening just to the east of the Netherlands.

In the next few chapters, Corrie talks about her childhood, her infirm but glad-hearted mother, and the three aunts who once lived in the Béjé. She talks about the only man she ever loved, a young man named Karel, who ultimately married a woman from a rich family.

Eventually, both Nollie and Willem married. After the deaths of Corrie's mother and aunts, Corrie, Betsie, and their father settled down into a pleasant, domestic life. Then, in 1940, the [[Nazi]]s invaded the Netherlands.

The family had strong morals based on Christian beliefs, and they felt obligated to help their [[Jewish]] friends in every way possible. The Béjé soon became the center for a major anti-Nazi operation. Corrie, who had grown to think of herself as a middle-aged spinster, found herself involved in [[black market]] operations, using stolen [[ration card]]s, and eventually hiding Jews in her own home.

Corrie suffered a moral crisis over the lying, theft, [[forgery]], and [[bribery]] that was necessary to keep the Jews her family was hiding alive. Moreover, it was unlikely that her family would get away with helping Jews for long, as they had nowhere to hide them. The [[Dutch resistance|Dutch underground]] arranged for a secret room to be built in the Béjé, so the Jews would have a place to hide in the event of an inevitable raid.

It was a constant struggle for Corrie to keep the Jews safe; she sacrificed her own safety and part of her own personal room to give constant safety to the Jews. Rolf, a police officer friend, trained her to be able to think clearly anytime in case the Nazis invaded her home and started to question her.

When a man asked Corrie to help his wife, who had been arrested, Corrie agreed, but with misgivings. As it turned out, the man was a spy, and the watch shop was raided. The entire ten Boom family was arrested, along with the shop employees, though the Jews managed to hide themselves in the secret room.

Casper was in his mid-eighties by this time, and a Nazi official offered to let him go, provided he made no more trouble. Casper did not agree to this, and was shipped to prison. It was later learned he had died ten days later.

Meanwhile, Corrie was sent to [[Scheveningen]], a Dutch prison which was used by the Nazis for political prisoners, nicknamed 'Oranjehotel'--a hotel for people loyal to the [[House of Orange]].  She later learned that her sister was being held in another cell, and that, aside from her father, all other family members and friends had been released. A coded letter from Nollie revealed that the hidden Jews were safe. While at Scheveningen, Corrie befriended a depressed Nazi officer, who arranged a brief meeting with her family, under the pretense of reading Casper's will. Corrie was horrified to see how ill Willem was, as he had contracted [[jaundice]] in prison. He would eventually die from his illness in 1946. Corrie also learned that her nephew, Kik, had been captured while working with the Dutch underground. He had been killed, though the family did not learn of this until 1953.

After four months at Scheveningen, Corrie and Betsie were transferred to [[Vught#World War II|Vught]], a concentration camp for political prisoners in Netherlands. Corrie was assigned to a factory that made radios for aircraft. The work was not hard, and the prisoner-foreman, Mr. Moorman, was kind. Betsie, whose health was starting to fail, was sent to work sewing prison uniforms.

When a counter-offensive against the Nazis seemed imminent, the prisoners were shipped by train to Germany, where they were imprisoned at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], a notorious women's concentration camp. The conditions there were hellish; both Corrie and Betsie were forced to perform back-breaking manual labor. It was there that Betsie's health failed. Throughout the ordeal, Corrie was amazed at her sister's faith. In every camp, the sisters used a hidden [[Bible]] to teach their fellow prisoners about Jesus. In Ravensbrück, where there was only hatred and misery, Corrie found it hard to look to Heaven. Betsie, however, showed a universal love for everyone—not only for the prisoners, but also for the Nazis. Instead of feeling anger, she pitied the Germans, sorrowful that they were so blinded by hatred. She yearned to show them the love of Christ, but died before the war was over. Corrie was later released because of a clerical error, but she was forced to stay in a hospital barracks while recovering from [[edema]]. Corrie arrived back in the Netherlands by January 1945.

'''''The Suicide of Saul''''' is an oil-on-panel by [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|the Netherlandish Renaissance]] artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], painted in 1562. It is currently held and exhibited at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]].

==Description==
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Suicide of Saul (detail) - WGA3328.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail 1]]
The inscription identifies the subject as the rarely represented scene of the suicide of [[Saul]] after his defeat by the [[Philistines]]. These events are described in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel 31, 1-5]]: {{quotation| Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons. The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was severely wounded by the archers.
&lt;br /&gt;Then Saul said to his armorbearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and abuse me."&lt;br /&gt;But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it. And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him.|1 Samuel 31:1-5, [[NKJV]]&lt;ref&gt;From online [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2031,%201-5&amp;version=NKJV NKJV, 1 Samuel 31]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Bruegel has chosen the highly dramatic moment of the death of the armourbearer, just as the Philistines are approaching.&lt;sup&gt;See 1st detail&lt;/sup&gt;

Saul's death was interpreted as a punishment of [[pride]] - it was among the proud that [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] met [[Saul]] in the ''[[Purgatorio]]'' - and this may account for Bruegel's choice of such an unusual subject.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Dante's ''Canto'' XII, vv.40-42: ''O Saul, transfixed by your own sword, how dead / you seemed to lie on Mount Gilboa's plain, / which since that time has known no rain or dew.'' (transl. M. Musa, Penguin Books, 1985). Saul was placed in the 2nd Terrace of [[Purgatory]], with King [[Nimrod]], the subject of another Bruegel painting, ''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)|The Tower of Babel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Suicide of Saul (detail) - WGA3327.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail 2]]
As with most of his subjects taken from the Bible, Bruegel treats Saul's suicide as a contemporary event, showing the armies in 16th century armour. In 1529 the German painter [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] had shown the clash of the forces of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III of Persia|Darius]] at the [[The Battle of Alexander at Issus|Battle of the Issus]] in this way, and in many other respects, too, Bruegel is in Altdorfer's debt, particularly in the representation of the tiny, massed figures of the soldiers and their forests of lances.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the great battle scenes of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] are strongly reminiscent of this composition's battle deployment.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruegel may also have looked at the battle-scenes of another German painter, [[Jörg Breu the Younger]], and at a now lost battle-scene by the [[Antwerp]] landscape painter [[Joachim Patinir]] which is mentioned by [[biographer]] [[Karel van Mander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Screech|first=Matthew|title=Masters of the ninth art: bandes dessinées and Franco-Belgian identity|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvkGQnWZf1gC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Suicide of Saul'' is an early attempt by Bruegel to reconcile landscape and figure painting. If it is compared with one of his latest works, ''[[The Magpie on the Gallows]]'' of 1568, its weaknesses are apparent: the foreground and background are not yet reconciled and the jutting outcrop of rock in the centre&lt;sup&gt;see 2nd detail&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[Mannerism|mannerist]] device which one may see again in ''[[The Procession to Calvary (Bruegel)|The Procession to Calvary]]''. However, the distant landscape is seen through a shimmering haze, which seems to have the effect of emphasizing the foreground detail, and this does represent a new stage in the evolution of Bruegel's depiction of [[landscape art|naturalistic landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Pietro Allegretti, ''Brueghel'', Skira, Milano 2003. {{ISBN|0-00-001088-X}} {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
A '''trade secret''' is a [[formula]], [[best practice|practice]], [[business process|process]], [[design]], [[legal instrument|instrument]], [[pattern]], commercial method, or compilation of [[information]] not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by others by which a [[business]] can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2047462|title=Executive Trade Secrets|first=Tom C. W.|last=Lin|date=28 April 2012|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[jurisdiction]]s, such secrets are referred to as ''[[confidential information]]''.

==Definition==

The precise language by which a trade secret is defined varies by jurisdiction, as do the particular types of information that are subject to trade secret protection. Three factors are common to all such definitions: 

A trade secret is information that

* is not generally known to the public;
* confers economic benefit on its holder ''because'' the information is not publicly known; and
* is the subject of reasonable efforts by the holder to maintain its secrecy.

In international law, these three factors define a trade secret under article 39 of the [[TRIPS Agreement|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]], commonly referred to as the TRIPS Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04d_e.htm#7
|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Section 7: Protection of Undisclosed Information
|publisher=[[World Trade Organization]]|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the United States [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]], "A trade secret, as defined under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1839}}(3)(A),(B) (1996), has three parts: (1) information; (2) reasonable measures taken to protect the information; and (3) which derives independent economic value from not being publicly known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Value==
Trade secrets are an important, but invisible component of a company's [[intellectual property]] (IP). Their contribution to a company's value, measured as its [[market capitalization]], can be major.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, Mark A. Lemley (@006)  Intellectual Property in the Technological Age, 3rd ed.; Aspen&lt;/ref&gt; Being invisible, that contribution is hard to measure.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Lev (2001): Intangibles, Management, Measurement and Reporting, with comments by conference participants; Brookings Institution Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Patents are a visible contribution, but delayed, and unsuitable for internal [[innovation]]s. Having an internal [[Dashboard (management information systems)|scoreboard]] provides insight into the cost of risks of employees leaving to serve or start competing ventures.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Protection==
In contrast to registered intellectual property, trade secrets are, by definition, not disclosed to the world at large. Instead, owners of trade secrets seek to protect trade secret information from competitors by instituting special procedures for handling it, as well as technological and legal security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Elbaum | first = Dan | year = 2011 | title = Human factors in information-age trade secret protection | url = http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/chrr/22 | journal = Cornell HR Review | accessdate = 2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal protections include [[non-disclosure agreement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (NDAs), and [[work-for-hire]] and [[non-compete clause]]s. In other words, in exchange for an opportunity to be employed by the holder of secrets, an employee may sign agreements to not reveal their prospective employer's proprietary information, to surrender or assign to their employer ownership rights to intellectual work and work-products produced during the course (or as a condition) of employment, and to not work for a competitor for a given period of time (sometimes within a given geographic region). Violation of the agreement generally carries the possibility of heavy financial penalties which operate as a disincentive to reveal trade secrets. However, proving a breach of an NDA by a former stakeholder  who is legally working for a competitor or prevailing in a lawsuit for breaching a non-compete clause can be very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Customer Lists as Trade Secrets |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/customer-lists-trade-secrets|publisher=[[Dykema Gossett]] PLLC|work=The National Law Review|date=2009-12-30|accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holder of a trade secret may also require similar agreements from other parties he or she deals with, such as vendors, licensees, and board members.

As a company can protect its confidential information through NDA, work-for-hire, and non-compete contracts with its stakeholders (within the constraints of employment law, including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic- and time-scope), these protective contractual measures effectively create a perpetual monopoly on secret information that does not expire as would a [[patent]] or [[copyright]]. The lack of formal protection associated with registered intellectual property rights, however, means that a third party not bound by a signed agreement is not prevented from independently duplicating and using the secret information once it is discovered, such as through [[reverse engineering]].
[[File:Chartreuse-bottle.jpg|180px|thumb|Green [[Chartreuse liqueur]] protected by confidential information of the ingredients]]
Therefore, trade secrets such as secret formulae are often protected by restricting the key information to a few trusted individuals. Famous examples of products protected by trade secrets are [[Chartreuse liqueur]] and [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;Leon Stafford for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution December 8, 2011 [http://www.ajc.com/news/business/coke-hides-its-secret-formula-in-plain-sight-in-wo/nQPMm/ Coke hides its secret formula in plain sight in World of Coca-Cola move]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because protection of trade secrets can, in principle, extend indefinitely, it therefore may provide an advantage over patent protection and other registered intellectual property rights, which last only for a specific duration. The Coca-Cola company, for example, has no patent for the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula of Coca-Cola]] and has been effective in protecting it for many more years than the 20 years of protection that a patent would have provided. In fact, Coca-Cola refused to reveal its trade secret under at least two judges' orders.&lt;ref&gt;''For God, Country &amp; Coca-Cola'', by [[Mark Pendergrast]], 2nd Ed., Basic Books 2000, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies often try to discover one another's trade secrets through lawful methods of [[reverse engineering]] or employee poaching on one hand, and potentially unlawful methods including [[industrial espionage]] on the other. Acts of industrial espionage are generally illegal in their own right under the relevant governing laws, and penalties can be harsh.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fox Rubin (2012): Former Dow Chemical Scientist Gets Five Year in Prison; Wall Street Journal, 13 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of that illegality to trade secret law is: if a trade secret is acquired by improper means (a somewhat wider concept than "illegal means" but inclusive of such means), then the secret is generally deemed to have been ''misappropriated''. Thus, if a trade secret has been acquired via industrial espionage, its acquirer will probably be subject to legal liability for having acquired it improperly. (The holder of the trade secret is nevertheless obliged to protect against such espionage to some degree in order to safeguard the secret. Under most trade secret regimes, a trade secret is not deemed to exist unless its purported holder takes reasonable steps to maintain its secrecy.){{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==History==

===Roman law===
Commentators starting with A. Arthur Schiller assert that trade secrets were protected under [[Roman law]] by a claim known as ''actio servi corrupti'', interpreted as an "action for making a slave worse" (or an action for corrupting a servant). The Roman law is described as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Roman owner of a mark or firm name was legally protected against unfair usage by a competitor through the ''actio servi corrupti'' ... which the Roman jurists used to grant commercial relief under the guise of private law actions. "If, as the writer believes [writes Schiller], various private cases of action were available in satisfying commercial needs, the state was acting in exactly the same fashion as it does at the present day."&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;Alan Watson, ''Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded'', 11 Tul. Eur. &amp; Civ. L.F. 19, 19 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The suggestion that trade secret law has its roots in Roman law was introduced in 1929 in a ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'' article called "Trade Secrets and the Roman Law: The ''Actio Servi Corrupti''", which has been reproduced in Schiller's, ''An American Experience in Roman Law'' 1 (1971). See ''Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded'', at 19. However, the [[University of Georgia]] [[University of Georgia Law School|Law School]] professor [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]] argued in ''Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded ''that the ''actio servi corrupti'' was not used to protect trade secrets p.&amp;nbsp;19. Rather, he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Schiller is sadly mistaken as to what was going on. ... The ''actio servi corrupti'' presumably or possibly could be used to protect trade secrets and other similar commercial interests. That was not its purpose and was, at most, an incidental spin-off. But there is not the slightest evidence that the action was ever so used. In this regard the ''actio servi corrupti'' is not unique.

Exactly the same can be said of many private law actions including those for theft, damage to property, deposit, and production of property. All of these could, I suppose, be used to protect trade secrets, etc., but there is no evidence they were. It is bizarre to see any degree the Roman actio servi corrupti as the counterpart of modern law for the protection of trade secrets and other such commercial interests.&lt;ref name="watson"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century===

Trade secret law as we know it today made its first appearance in England in 1817 in ''[[Newbery v. James]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Newbery v. James'', (1817) 2 Mer. 446, 35 Eng. Rep. 1011, 1013 (Ct. Ch. 1817)&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|1=History|date=October 2014|reason=See doubts raised at [[Talk:Trade secret/Archives/2014#History]]}} and in the United States in 1837 in ''[[Vickery v. Welch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vickery v. Welch'', 36 Mass. (19 Pick.) 523, 527 (1837)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="surprising"&gt;See The Surprising Virtues of Treating Trade Secrets as IP Rights'', 61 Stan. L. Rev. at 315 &amp; n.6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=October 2014|reason=please help reader by summarising these cases here in plain English}} While those cases involved the first known common law causes of action based on a modern concept of trade secret laws, neither involved injunctive relief; rather, they involved damages only.&lt;ref name="surprising" /&gt; In England, the first case involving injunctive relief came in 1820 in ''Yovatt v Winyard'',&lt;ref&gt;''Yovatt v. Winyard'', (1820) 37 Eng. Rep. 425, 426 (Ch.)&lt;/ref&gt; while in the United States, it took until the 1866 case ''Taylor v. Blanchard''.&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v. Blanchard'', 95 Mass. (13 Allen) 370 (1866)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See The Surprising Virtues of Treating Trade Secrets as IP Rights'', 61 Stan. L. Rev. at 315 &amp; n.7; ''but see Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.'', 416 U.S. 470, 493 n.23, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 1892 n.23, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974) (trade secret law imported into the United States from England in 1868 in ''Peabody v. Norfolk'', 98 Mass. 452 (1868))&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=October 2014|reason=please summarise each example, please wikilink jargon terms}}

Trade secrets law continued to evolve throughout the United States as a hodgepodge of state laws. In 1939, the [[American Law Institute]] issued the [[Restatement of Torts]], containing a summary of trade secret laws across states, which served as the primary resource until the latter part of the century. As of 2013, however, only four states—Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Texas—still rely on the Restatement as their primary source of guidance (other than their body of state case law).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It has also been recently{{when|date=September 2014}} theorized that the doctrine of trade secrets should protect competitively valuable, personal information of company executives, in a concept known as "executive trade secrets".

===Worldwide===

====Commonwealth nations====
In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[common law]] jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] right rather than a [[property]] right.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=====England and Wales=====
{{See also|Breach of confidence in English law}}
The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] in the case of ''Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Ltd''&lt;ref&gt;''Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Ltd'', (1948) 65 P.R.C. 203&lt;/ref&gt; held that the action for breach of confidence is based on a principle of preserving "good faith".

The test for a cause of action for breach of confidence in the [[common law]] world is set out in the case of ''Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd'':&lt;ref&gt;''Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd'', (1969) R.P.C. 41 at 47&lt;/ref&gt;

* The information itself must have the necessary quality of confidence about it;
* That information must have been imparted in circumstances imparting an obligation of confidence;
* There must be an unauthorized use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it.

The "quality of confidence" highlights that trade secrets are a legal concept. With sufficient effort or through illegal acts (such as breaking and entering), competitors can usually obtain trade secrets. However, so long as the owner of the trade secret can prove that reasonable efforts have been made to keep the information confidential, the information remains a trade secret and generally remains legally protected. Conversely, trade secret owners who cannot evidence reasonable efforts at protecting confidential information risk losing the trade secret, even if the information is obtained by competitors illegally. It is for this reason that trade secret owners shred documents and do not simply recycle them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

A successful plaintiff is entitled to various forms of [[judicial relief]], including:

* An [[injunction]]
* An [[account of profits]] or an award of [[damages]]
* A [[Declaration (law)|declaration]]

=====Hong Kong=====
[[Hong Kong]] does not follow the traditional commonwealth approach, instead recognizing trade secrets where a judgment of the High Court indicates that confidential information may be a property right.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====European Union====
The EU adopted a [[Directive on the Protection of Trade Secrets]] on 27 May 2016.&lt;ref name=eudirective&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade secrets|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/intellectual-property/trade-secrets_en|website=European Commission|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the directive is to harmonize the definition of trade secrets in accordance with existing international standards, and the means of obtaining protection of trade secrets within the EU.&lt;ref name=eudirective/&gt;

====United States====
Within the U.S., trade secrets generally encompass a company's proprietary information that is not generally known to its competitors, and which provides the company with a competitive advantage.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Although trade secrets law evolved under state common law, prior to 1974, the question of whether patent law preempted state trade secrets law had been unanswered.  In 1974, the [[United States Supreme Court]] issued the landmark decision, ''Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.,'' which resolved the question in favor of allowing the states to freely develop their own trade secret laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.'', 416 U.S. 470, 94 S.Ct. 1879, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====State law=====
In 1979 several U.S. states adopted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] (UTSA), which was further amended in 1985, with approximately 47 states having adopted some variation of it as the basis for trade secret law. Another significant development is the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996|Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996]] ({{usc|18|1831|1839}}), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. 

This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity.

=====Federal law=====
On May 11, 2016, President Obama signed the [[Defend Trade Secrets Act]] (DTSA), 18 U.S.C.§§1839 et seq., which for the first time created a federal cause of action for misappropriating trade secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2016/05/24/defintion-trade-secret-dtsa/id=69262/|title=Definition of a 'Trade Secret' Under the DTSA|last=Toren|first=Peter J.|date=May 24, 2016|publisher=IPWatchdog|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DTSA provides for both a private right of action for damages and injunction and a civil action for injunction brought by the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/news/2016/06/protections_of_then.html|title=Protections of the Newly Enacted Defend Trade Secrets Act|last=Kelton|first=Jeff|date=June 24, 2016|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The statute followed state laws on liability in significant part, defining trade secrets in the same way as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act as,
{{quote|"all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing if (A) the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret; and (B) the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, another person who can obtain economic value from the disclosure or use of the information."}}
However, the law contains several important differences from prior law.
# Because it is a federal law, trade secret cases can be prosecuted in federal courts with concomitant procedural advantages.
# It provides for the unusual remedy of preliminary seizure of "property necessary to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret," 18 U.S.C. §1836
# It provides for remedies to include royalties in appropriate cases and exemplary damages up to two times the actual damages in cases of "willful and malicious" appropriation, 18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3).
The DTSA also clarifies that a United States resident (including a company) can be liable for misappropriation that takes place outside the United States, and any person can be liable as long as an act in furtherance of the misappropriation takes place in the United States, 18 U.S.C. §1837. The DTSA provides the courts with broad injunctive powers.  18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3).

The DTSA does not preempt or supplant state laws, but provides an additional cause of action.  Because states vary significantly in their approach to the "inevitable disclosure" doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;The "inevitable disclosure" doctrine allows an employee's new employment to be enjoined if the court determines that the nature of his new duties will inevitably lead to a disclosure or improper use of trade secrets of the prior employer.  It has been accepted in a number of states (see, e.g., PepsiCo, Inc. v. Redmond, 54 F.3d 1262 (7th Cir. 1995)(applying Illinois law), and flatly rejected in others (see, e.g., Schlage Lock Co. v. Whyte, 101 Cal. App. 4th 1443 (2002) (applying California law).&lt;/ref&gt; its use has limited, if any, application under the DTSA, 18 U.S.C.§1836(b)(3)(A).&lt;ref&gt;A Court may grant an injunction, provided the order does not "prevent a person from entering into an employment relationship, and that conditions placed on such employment shall be based on evidence of threatened misappropriation and not merely on the information that the person knows...." 18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3)(A)(i)(I).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other types of intellectual property law==
In the United States, trade secrets are not protected by law in the same manner as [[patent]]s or [[trademark]]s. Specifically, trademarks and patents are protected under federal statutes, the [[Lanham Act]] and [[United States patent law|Patent Act]], respectively. In contrast, trade secrets are protected under [[state law]]s, and most states have enacted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] (UTSA), except for [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[North Carolina]]. One of the differences between patents and trademarks, on the one hand, and trade secrets, on the other, is that a trade secret is protected only when the secret is {{clarify span|text=not disclosed.|explain=by their "owner"? What about leaks?|date=March 2018}}

===Comparison with trademarks===
Nations have different trademark policies. Assuming the mark in question meets certain other standards of protectibility, trademarks are generally protected from infringement on the grounds that other uses might confuse consumers as to the origin or nature of the goods once the mark has been associated with a particular supplier. Similar considerations apply to [[service mark]]s and [[trade dress]].

By definition, a trademark enjoys no protection (''qua'' trademark) until and unless it is "disclosed" to consumers, for only then are consumers able to associate it with a supplier or source in the requisite manner. (That a company plans to ''use'' a certain trademark might itself be protectible as a trade secret, however, until the mark is actually made public.)

To acquire a [[United States trademark law|trademark rights under U.S. law]], one must simply use the mark "in commerce".&lt;ref name="USPTO-FAQ"&gt;United States Patent and Trademark Office, [http://www.uspto.gov/main/faq/index.html General Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible to register a trademark in the United States, both at the federal and state levels.  Registration of trademarks confers some advantages, including stronger protection in certain respects, but registration is not required in order to get protection.&lt;ref name="USPTO-FAQ"/&gt; Registration may be required in order to file a lawsuit for trademark infringement.

===Comparison with patents===
To acquire a patent, full information about the method or product has to be supplied to the patent office and upon publication or issuance, will then be available to all. After expiration of the patent, competitors can copy the method or product legally. The temporary [[monopoly]] on the subject matter of the patent is regarded as a tradeoff for thus disclosing the information to the public.

One popular misconception held by many is that trade secret protection is incompatible with patent protection. It is typically said that if one applies for a patent one can no longer maintain a trade secret on the invention, but this is an oversimplification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordasecrets.com/2008/04/patenttrade_secret_complementa.html Jorda on Trade Secrets] by Karl Jorda&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain a patent, the inventor must [[sufficiency of disclosure|disclose the invention]], so that others will be able to both make and use the invention. Also, to obtain a patent in the United States, any preferences{{clarify|reason=What is meant by a "preference" here?|date=February 2016}} must likewise be disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112 |title=35 U.S.C. 112 |publisher=Uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615191627/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_112.htm#usc35s112 |archivedate=2006-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What is typically not appreciated though is that the critical time for satisfying this disclosure requirement is at the time the application is filed. In many if not most situations, improvements will be made to an invention even after filing of the patent application, and additional information will be learned. None of this additional information must be disclosed and can instead be kept as a secret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2100_2165_01.htm#sect2165.01 Considerations Relevant to Best Mode] MPEP 2165.01&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all patent licenses include clauses that require the inventor to disclose any trade secrets they have. Frequently it is this information not disclosed in the patent that is the most commercially viable. Thus, patent licensors should take steps to continue to maintain trade secrets as secrets, otherwise they will be lost. Accordingly, before disclosing any secrets not already protected by an issued patent the licensor will use a [[non-disclosure agreement]].

Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that a trade secret is not limited in time (it "continues indefinitely as long as the secret is not revealed to the public", whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention), a trade secret does not imply any registration costs,&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |title=The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid |first=Friedrich |last=Klinkert |date=April 2012 |conference=[[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center|MIPLC]] Lecture Series |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an immediate effect, does not require compliance with any formalities, and does not imply any disclosure of the invention to the public.&lt;ref name="klinkert-6"/&gt; The disadvantages of trade secrets include that "others may be able to legally discover the secret and be thereafter entitled to use it", "others may obtain patent protection for legally discovered secrets", and a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent.&lt;ref name="klinkert-7"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.miplc.de/research/lecture-series/ |title=The Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in Germany and U.S. Discovery Aid |first=Friedrich |last=Klinkert |date=April 2012 |conference=[[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center|MIPLC]] Lecture Series |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Trade secret regulations that mask the composition of chemical agents in [[consumer product]]s have been criticized for allowing the trade secret holders to hide the presence of potentially harmful and [[Toxicity|toxic substances]]. It has been argued that the public is being denied a clear picture of such products' safety, whereas competitors are well positioned to analyze its chemical composition.&lt;ref name=fitzgerald&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Randall Fitzgerald]]| title=[[The Hundred Year Lie]] |publisher=[[Dutton Penguin|Dutton]], 2006| page=24 |isbn=0-525-94951-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the National Environmental Trust tested 40 common consumer products; in more than half of them they found toxic substances not listed on the [[product label]].&lt;ref name=fitzgerald/&gt;

'''''Tía Vicenta''''' ("Aunt Vicenta") was a satirical current events magazine published in [[Argentina]] between 1957 and 1966.

==History==
Caricaturist and commentator [[Juan Carlos Colombres]] ("Landrú") established ''Tía Vicenta'' with fellow illustrator [[Oscar Conti (Oski)|Oski]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=morsa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/211351-landru-la-morsa-y-la-familia|title=Landrú, la morsa y la familia|publisher=''La Nación''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[current events]] weekly quickly earned renown for its satirical content, particularly regarding [[Argentine politics]], and its circulation, which initially averaged 50,000, doubled shortly afterward.&lt;ref name=jericles&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jericles.com.ar/mat-p-cole/texto01.html|title=Historia del humor gráfico argentino|publisher=Jericles|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327160103/http://www.jericles.com.ar/mat-p-cole/texto01.html|archivedate=2012-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of its recurring topics was the ban on [[Peronism]], which its editorials referred to often and in violation of [[Decree Law 4161/56]] (the decree, signed by President [[Pedro Aramburu]] in 1956, prohibited any mention of or references to exiled populist leader [[Juan Perón]] or Peronism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/documentos/revolucion_libertadora/decreto_4161.php|title=Decreto-ley 4161, del 5 de marzo de 1956|publisher=El Historiador|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223070542/http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/documentos/revolucion_libertadora/decreto_4161.php|archivedate=2012-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another political controversy whose coverage made ''Tía Vicenta'' memorable was the dispute between President [[Arturo Frondizi]] and Vice President [[Alejandro Gómez (politician)|Alejandro Gómez]] regarding [[Oil battle|Frondizi's decision in 1958]] to open the nation's [[petroleum|oil]] fields to foreign exploration (a reversal of Frondizi's earlier stance). The Vice President had not made his opposition to this policy in public. The covers of ''Tía Vicenta'', however, appeared for a number of weeks with a corner photo of Gómez in a circular insert with an epigraph asking: ''¿A mi por qué me miran?'' ("Why are you looking at me?"). Gómez was forced to resign by the President in November, merely six months after their swearing in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/02/07/elpais/p-01101.htm|title=Falleció Alejandro Gómez, el vicepresidente de Frondizi|publisher=''Clarín''}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

''Tía Vicenta'' also appeared as a supplement to the popular news daily ''[[El Mundo (Argentina)|El Mundo]]'' beginning in 1960,&lt;ref name=landru&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/517347-landru-un-surrealista-del-humor|title=Landrú, un surrealista del humor|publisher=''La Nación''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with a circulation ranging from 200,000 to 450,000 per issue it would become the best-selling magazine in the country.&lt;ref name=lab/&gt; Numerous well known Argentine illustrators and journalists began their career at ''Tía Vicenta'', including [[Quino]], [[Jorge Palacio|Faruk]], [[Carlos Loiseau|Caloi]], and [[Copi]].&lt;ref name=jericles/&gt; Other noted contributors included [[Conrado Nalé Roxlo]], [[Hermenegildo Sábat]], and [[María Elena Walsh]], as well as its co-founder, [[Oscar Conti (Oski)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediosindependientes.com/Comics_Tebeosfera_Arg05.htm|title=Breve historia de las publicaciones humorísticas argentinas|publisher=Medios Independientes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landrú used [[surreal humor]] to lampoon both politicians and prevailing issues. He made a likewise liberal use of artistic license on the magazine's covers themselves, which typically featured his caricatures (drawn as [[naïve art]]), and whose design changed frequently; to parody talk of a looming recession in 1966, for instance, he changed the magazine's name at one point to ''Carestía Vicenta'' ("Famine Vicenta").&lt;ref name=joyas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imageandart.com/tutoriales/comics/landru/landru01.html|title=Las Joyas de Tía Vicenta|publisher=Image and Art|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716032341/http://www.imageandart.com/tutoriales/comics/landru/landru01.html|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His irreverent portrayals of General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], who had seized power in a [[Revolución Argentina|1966 coup d'état]], as a [[walrus]] (a nickname with which colleagues in the [[Argentine Armed Forces]] referred to the laconic and moustachioed Onganía) resulted in the closure of ''Tía Vicenta'' by government edict in July of that year.&lt;ref name=morsa/&gt;&lt;ref name=joyas/&gt; The shuttered magazine returned as ''Tío Landrú'' from 1967 to 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historiaspasado.blogspot.com/2009/04/landru-gentleman-historia-xxxi.html|title=Landrú...the Gentleman|publisher=Osvaldo Laino}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again returned, by its original name though in a less successful version, from 1977 to 1979.&lt;ref name=joyas/&gt; 

Landrú would continue to illustrate editorials in numerous other publications in subsequent decades, notably ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]''.&lt;ref name=landru/&gt; Edgardo Russo wrote a history of the periodical, ''Historia de Tía Vicenta'', published by [[Espasa-Calpe]] in 1994.

'''UbuWeb''' is a large web-based educational resource for [[avant-garde]] material available on the internet, founded in 1996 by poet [[Kenneth Goldsmith]]. It offers [[visual poetry|visual]], [[Concrete poetry|concrete]] and [[sound poetry]], expanding to include [[film]] and [[sound art]] [[mp3]] archives.

==Philosophy==

UbuWeb was founded in response to the marginal distribution of crucial [[avant-garde]] material. It remains [[non-commercial]] and operates on a [[gift economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith, [http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/goldsmith/ubuweb.html "Ubuweb Wants to be Free" Open Letter], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; UbuWeb ensures educational open access to out-of-print works that find a second life through [[digital art]] reprint while also representing the work of contemporaries. It addresses problems in the distribution of and access to intellectual materials.

==Distribution policy==

UbuWeb does not distribute commercially viable works but rather resurrects [[avant-garde]] [[sound art]], [[video]] and textual works through their translation into a [[digital art]] web environment - re-contextualising them with current academic commentary and contemporary practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Damon Krukowski]], "[http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/goldsmith/artforum.html Free Verses: Kenneth Goldsmith and UbuWeb]", ''[[Artforum]]'', March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It houses and distributes freely the entire archive of the [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] project.

==Content==

Beyond its repository of works, UbuWeb features curated sections including [http://www.ubu.com/ubu/ ''/ubu Editions''] book-length editions of contemporary [[poetry]], selected and introduced by the poet Brian Kim Stefans. [http://www.ubu.com/ethno/ ''UbuWeb: Ethnopoetics''], curated by [[Jerome Rothenberg]], is fusing the avant-garde with traditional ethnic practices. [http://www.ubu.com/papers/ ''UbuWeb: Papers''] a series of contextual academic essays.

==Infrastructure==

UbuWeb is not affiliated to any academic institution, instead relying on alliances of interest and benefiting from bandwidth donations from its partnerships with [https://web.archive.org/web/20060715105639/http://greylodge.org/gpc/ GreyLodge], [[WFMU]], PennSound, The Electronic Poetry Center, The Center for Literary Computing, and ArtMob.

UbuWeb's board of directors includes the poets [[Charles Bernstein]], [[Darren Wershler-Henry]] and critic [[Marjorie Perloff]].

[[Image:20130609 in Zagreb 14.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Well of Life'' in front of [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb]]]]

The '''''Well of Life''''' (sometimes also '''''At the Well of Life''''' or the '''''Fountain of Life'''''; {{lang-hr|Zdenac života}}) is a [[sculpture]] by the Croatian sculptor and architect [[Ivan Meštrović]] installed in front of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]] on [[Republic of Croatia Square]] in [[Zagreb]], Croatia. It depicts people in various phases of life that crouch and twist their bodies around a well which symbolizes life, youth, and the source of eternal beauty.

==Description==
The sculpture is circular with relief of ten naked figures, a child, love couple and the old man, life-size, that crouch and twist their bodies around a well which contains water. Strong facial expressions of the figures show the joy of life which alternated rhythmically makes the life cycle. The figures are watching their reflections in the water, while their bodies appear to have been frozen in motion. The figures are arranged so that they show to viewer the purpose of the well, i.e., desire for life and joy, which can be seen best in young characters who are hugging and kissing as opposed to the old man who is at the end of his life and looks with grief into the well, a symbol of life. The sculpture depicts man's natural cycle, from birth to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zdenac života – Meštrovićevo remek-djelo|url=http://www.give-me-art.com/zdenac-zivota-mestrovicevo-remek-djelo/|website=Give-me-art.com|accessdate=16 October 2016|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture is smooth and rounded with no sharp edges or regular geometric forms. It is made of bronze, whose dark color is in great contrast to the whiteness of the rock on which it is placed. The transitions between light and shadow are mild. The sculpture is both [[wikt:convex|convex]] and [[wikt:concave|concave]].{{cn|date=October 2016}}

[[Auguste Rodin]]'s influence on Meštrović can be seen in this sculpture. As art historian professor Ljiljana Čerina says, "With its shimmering surface treatment of the body, Meštrović brings Rodin's [[impressionism]] into the [[Vienna Secession]] which proves that he is rodinist among [[secession (art)|secessionists]], while later in [[Paris]] he proves that he is secessionist among rodinists."&lt;ref name="slobodnadalmacija1"&gt;{{cite web|title='Zdenac života' u HNK Split|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/scena/kultura/clanak/id/200337/zdenac-zivota-u-hnk-split|website=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|accessdate=16 October 2016|language=hr|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
Sculpture was made in 1905, and was exhibited in 1909 in the author's gallery in [[Ilica (street)|Ilica]] street no. 12. In year 1912, sculpture  was bought by [[Izidor Kršnjavi]] and installed on the [[Republic of Croatia Square]]. It was placed in the cavity surrounded by walls so that naked bodies on it would not cause astonishment and critical comments of, at the time, conservative people of Zagreb. In correspondence with [[Ante Trumbić]], Meštrović clearly expressed his wish that ''Well of Life'' should be placed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].&lt;ref name="slobodnadalmacija1"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:NapoleonBike.jpg|300px|thumb|A Napoleon portrait manipulated by replacing the horse with a [[motorcycle]].]] --&gt;
'''Worth1000''' was an [[photoshopping|image manipulation]] and contest website. Worth1000 opened on January 1, 2002, and hosted over 340,000 unique images made in theme contests such as "Rejected Transformers", "Invisible World", and "Stupid Protests". In mid-2003, Worth1000 began hosting similar competitions for [[photography]], [[creative writing]], and [[multimedia]].  The service was shut down on 1 October 2013. In June 2014 the site was acquired by [[Sydney]] based [[crowdsourcing]] website [[DesignCrowd]] from Emerge Media.&lt;ref name="smartcompany-acquires"&gt;{{cite web|title=DesignCrowd acquires design and photo site Worth1000|date=17 June 2014|first=Bronwen|last=Clune|publisher=Smart Company|url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/business-advice/innovation/42415-designcrowd-acquires-design-and-photo-site-worth1000/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website was designed by [[Avi Muchnick]] and [[Israel Derdik]]. Muchnick named it after the old saying "[[a picture is worth a thousand words]]".

The site had been featured in many different publications, TV shows and stations, and radio including ''[[PC Magazine]]'', ''[[Popular Science]]'', ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[BBC]], [[CNN]], ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Weekly World News]]'', ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', [[TechTV]], ''[[USA Today]]'', [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], ''[[Inside Edition]]'', and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worth1000.com/faq.asp#C8][http://www.worth1000.com/faq.asp#13 Worth1000 media mentions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Worth1000 and its members have created three books on image manipulation: ''When Pancakes Go Bad'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|1-59200-524-1}} Hardcover, 280 pages, Publisher Course Technology PTR; 1 edition (October 7, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; ''I've Got a Human in My Throat'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|1-59863-070-9}} Paperback, 304 pages, Publisher Course Technology PTR; 1 edition (January 19, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''More Than One Way to Skin a Cat''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/More-Than-One-Way-Skin/dp/1598634720&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contests==
Competition mostly took place in a series of themed contests.  A subject title is given along with a sample photo manipulation from a previous or similar contest and a brief description of what contestants should try to do.  Entries were then accepted for a fixed period of time, after which they are posted so that people can vote on them, and the results were then compiled. Examples of contests are:
*'''Reality [[manga]]''' - Alter photos of real people (celebrities are popular) so that they look like [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] drawings come to life.
*'''[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimaera]]''' – Create a new animal by mating three or four other animals to one.
*'''Invisible world''' - Take any object or person in an image and make it invisible using photoshop. No indication or outline of the object/animal/person should be seen, except through its function/interaction with other objects and/or people in the image. Some images, are based in the 1897 [[H.G. Wells]] [[science-fiction]] [[novella]], ''[[The Invisible Man]]''.
*'''If Goths ruled''' – Show what the world would look like if Goths ruled it.
Others include mating animals with instruments or plants, zombifying or aging celebrities, combining several movies to one, and many others.

Even if the Photoshop contests were the main attraction of Worth1000, it also had a vast variety of contests for photography, writing, illustration, and a multimedia. Along with the regular contests, members of Worth1000 could challenge each other in head-to-head competitions as well.

==Forums==
The Worth1000 website had a large community as well as a large selection of [[Internet forum|forums]]. The forums were a place for general discussions and humor, and questions and answers regarding techniques for the various types of contests.  Due to the many active Admins and a word-filter that monitored the forums, a high level of [[Troll (Internet)|troll]] control existed.

==Intramural competitors==
Similar sites have competed in an intramural tournament with Worth1000.com, including:
*[[Something Awful]]'s Photoshop Phriday
*[[Fark.com]]

==Shutdown, Static Museum and Resurrection==

On August 12, 2013, Worth1000's founder, Avi Muchnick, announced in the community forums that Worth1000 would be closed and converted into a static museum. The final contest was scheduled to end on the midnight changeover (Worth time) of September 29/30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The future of Worth1000 - EVERYONE PLEASE READ|url=http://www.worth1000.com/discussions/70353/|work=All Arenas \ Community \ General Stuff|publisher=worth1000.com|accessdate=2013-09-29|date=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worth1000 was scheduled to close at midnight on 30 September 2013, but problems with the transfer of the site to the Static Museum status meant that it stayed open for a further 24 hours. However, once that period had passed users were greeted with a single page with the message that the site was now closed and would resurface within the next few days as a museum.

However, after a brief hiatus, Muchnick announced via a cryptic [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|1 Corinthians 15:4]] message and an image from Worth's archives of the Turin Shroud. Posted to Worth's 'refugee' website communities on Google+ and Reddit, former users found that the site had been sold to [http://www.emergemedia.com Emerge Media] and would re-open soon.

Worth1000 returned to the version of the site that existed in the week before the shutdown one week after the instigation of the museum. Over the following months, the new team transferred the site to new servers. However, ongoing technical issues and with declining popularity and an alienated user base, the new owners announced the intention to rebrand, redesign and invigorate the site. Contests were hosted to create logos for the new site, and admin level users were invited into discussions on the redesign. 

In June 2014, graphic design crowdsourcing company DesignCrowd announced that it had acquired Worth1000 for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref name="theoz-wait"&gt;{{cite web|title=DesignCrowd reckons deal worth wait|date=17 June 2014|first=Stuart|last=Kennedy|publisher=[[The Australian]]|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/technology/designcrowd-reckons-deal-worth-wait/story-e6frgakx-1226956510827|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DesignCrowd announced its intent to port all user accounts and artistic content to DesignCrowd servers, while attempting to keep the user experience unchanged.  The company announced the acquisition would help "create a bigger and better marketplace for freelance designers". &lt;ref name="DC Blog-bigger marketplace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worth1000 Joins the DesignCrowd Creative Community|date=18 June 2014|first=Jo|last=Sabin|publisher=[[DesignCrowd]]|url=http://blog.designcrowd.com/article/475/worth1000-joins-the-designcrowd-creative-community}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer, however, was repeatedly delayed and by the end of 2015 had not been completed.  Member frustration was exacerbated by the decision that Worth1000 members not wishing to become DesignCrowd members would have to “opt out” of the migration, rather than “opt in". 

On February 26, 2016 the plug was finally pulled on Worth1000.  Searches for the Worth1000 website are redirected to the DesignCrowd “community contest” page or to [http://blog.designcrowd.com/article/898/worth1000-on-designcrowd an article] explaining where users can find tutorials, contests, galleries, and paid design jobs. The most popular tutorials from Worth1000 were republished on DesignCrowd.

[[File:Poster for Twelfth Night William Shakespeare Yale University Dramatic Association.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Poster]] for [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Twelfth Night]], performed by the Yale Dramatic Association, 1921]]
The '''Yale Dramatic Association''', also known as the "Yale Dramat," is the second oldest college [[theater]] company in the United States, and the oldest continuously producing one.&lt;ref&gt;http://psuthespians.com/pages/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dramat.org/index.php/about-us/what-is-the-dramat&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1901 by undergraduates at [[Yale University]], the Dramat has been producing some of the finest student theatre in the United States for over a century.

== Background ==
Though no formal theatre company existed at Yale during its first two centuries of existence, dramas and comedies were enjoyed by students from the earliest days. When Professor [[William Lyon Phelps]], '87, commenced his teaching during the 1890s, he began a literary Renaissance that culminated in his sponsorship of the Dramatic Association, founded by Henry D. Wescott, Class of 1901, as a club for students interested in public performances of plays. The first meeting of the organization, chaired by Wescott, occurred on February 2, 1900.

== History ==
As archivist Gerasimos Tsourapas described its first days: "For its premiere production, the new organization chose ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'', the medieval English comedy that offers both sacred and profane variation on the birth of Christ: the religious could take comfort in the play's theological interests; the secular could delight in the naughty pranks of the protagonist. All in all, a good choice to allay the fears of those distrustful of the theater. As if to reinforce the high moral tone of the inaugural performance, the Dramat Executive Committee added Wescott's own adaptation of [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Pardoner's Tale]]''. Frank Lea Short, a New York theatrical figure, was hired to direct; Phelps and Professor Albert Cook served as literary advisors. Although both plays called for small casts, an "audience-within-the-play"— some one hundred extras—was placed on stage as well; no doubt someone realized the importance of getting as many people involved in the new venture as possible. On May 13, 1900, the first production of the Yale Dramatic Association opened to the universal applause of town and gown."

[[Cole Porter]] was undoubtedly the best-known of the Dramat's early Twentieth-Century figures. Not only did he perform both male and female roles, but he wrote and directed three "smoker" productions and composed the totemic song "The Queen of the Yale Dramat" (1911) satirizing drag roles. His first show, ''And Still the Villain Pursued Her'', poked fun at melodramas, while the second, ''Kaleidoscope'', was a send-up of college life.

Since Porter's days the Dramat has fostered the careers of many distinguished actors in the World Premiere production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'' in 1958, (in two acts) prior to Broadway. In 1960 [[Sam Waterston]] and [[Austin Pendleton]] starred in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''. The Dramat was the first company to perform [[Thornton Wilder]]'s one act play, ''[[The Long Christmas Dinner]]''.

During the 1970s the company expanded its range and sophistication, with daring productions such as ''[[The Frogs]]'', a musical adaptation of the [[Aristophanes]] comedy by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[Burt Shevelove]], staged in the pool of [[Payne Whitney Gymnasium]]. [[Ted Tally]], a future Academy Award winning screenwriter for ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'' starred opposite [[Alley Mills]] of television's [[The Wonder Years]]. While [[Meryl Streep]] trod the boards at the Drama School, [[Mark Linn-Baker]] and [[Robert Picardo]] delighted audiences on the Dramat stage.

The 1980s saw additional steps forward, with original works by undergraduates such as [[Tina Landau]], class of 1984. Her ''In the Image of Kings'' was a provocative treatment of lunatic monarchs. Since then the Dramat has maintained its high standards with both classics and modern masterpieces, musicals, reviews, light operas, and the occasional spoof in the tradition of Porter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dramat.org/dramat-history|title=Dramat History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Administration ==
The Dramat is run by a ten undergraduate member executive board&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dramat.org/about/board.php&lt;/ref&gt; which oversees the daily business of the Dramat, which includes selecting repertoire for performance and choosing or hiring [[Theatre director|directors]] for its productions. The Dramat's membership includes around 100 [[Yale University|Yale]] undergraduates as well as many honorary and life-time members. 

The Dramat played a large part in the founding of the [[Yale School of Drama]] and the construction of its main facility, the University Theater (also known as the UT).

'''Zemirot''' or '''Z'mirot''' ({{lang-he|זמירות}}) (Yiddish: Zmiros; Biblical Hebrew: Z'miroth; singular: '''zemer/z'mer''') are [[Jew]]ish hymns, usually sung in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic]] languages, but sometimes also in [[Yiddish]] or [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]].  The best known ''zemirot'' are those sung around the table during [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday]]s.  Some of the Sabbath ''zemirot'' are specific to certain times of the day, such as those sung for the Friday evening meal, the Saturday noon meal, and the third Sabbath meal just before sundown on Saturday afternoon.  In some editions of the Jewish prayerbook ([[siddur]]), the words to these hymns are printed after the opening prayer ([[kiddush]]) for each meal.  Other ''zemirot'' are more generic and can be sung at any meal or other sacred occasion.

The words to many ''zemirot'' are taken from poems written by various rabbis and sages during the [[Middle Ages]].  Others are anonymous [[folk songs]] that have been passed down from generation to generation.  The words generally focus on the themes of the Sabbath or the specific holiday being celebrated.

The melodies vary greatly from one Jewish community to another, as local tunes and styles of music are adapted to the same liturgical poems. One famous hymn, ''[[Adon Olam]],'' (Ruler of the Universe) has been set to countless tunes.  Jews of different backgrounds enjoy sharing the various versions when they meet around the Sabbath table.   New tunes continue to be written today for the same ancient lyrics. It is now rare, however, for new zemer-type lyrics to be written.

The term ''zemirot'' is used by [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] to refer to the sequence of psalms in the [[Jewish services#Shacharit (morning prayers)|morning service]], known to other communities as ''pesuke de-zimrah''.
