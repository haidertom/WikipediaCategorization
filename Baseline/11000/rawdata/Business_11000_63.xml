'''Alois Hugo Nellmapius''' 5 May 1847 - 27 July 1893, was a South African businessman, industrialist and pioneer conservationist.

==Life and career==
Born in Bielitz Poland on the 5th May 1847. His given name was Alois Hugo Neumann the son of Albert and Charlotte Neumann, but upon coming to South African changed his last name for reasons unknown. He trained as an engineer in the Netherlands and arrived in South Africa on board the ship ''Nathan'' in 1873 - one of his fellow passengers was [[John X. Merriman]], later Prime Minister of the Cape Colony. This was the year that gold was first found in the [[South African Republic|ZAR]]. He was successful at gold mining near [[Pilgrim's Rest, Mpumalanga|Pilgrim's Rest]] in the [[Eastern Transvaal]], and managed to obtain the first transport concession to [[Delagoa Bay]] in 1875. He constructed what is now known as the Nellmapius Road, from Mac-Mac and the goldfields, crossing the Crocodile River at Nellmapius Drift near [[Hectorspruit]] to Matalha Poort in [[Mozambique]]. For these services he was granted 4 farms. Nellmapius made and lost several fortunes in his lifetime and was a close friend of [[Paul Kruger]],there is a plaque in the National Kruger Park commemorating this very thing.  He was the first digger on the Transvaal goldfields to make use of dynamite.

Nellmapius served in the Sekhukhune Wars and the Mapoch campaign. He established [[Irene, Gauteng|Irene]] Estate (named after his daughter) near [[Pretoria]] and bought a number of farms on the Hennops River. He employed horticulturists Richard Wills Adlam, who had been the Curator of the [[Pietermaritzburg]] Botanical Garden, and his successor, Hans Fuchs. Under their management and with a temperate climate, ample water and fertile soil, they transformed the land into an extensive flower, fruit and vegetable garden of world renown. Flora Shaw of "[[The Times]]" of London, visited the Irene Estate in 1892 and was astounded at the scale of the farm and gardens: "With the exception of cherries, gooseberries and currants, all European fruits flourish well. Throughout the estate the water courses, which divided the fields, were bordered by hedges of quince, pear, apple, plum and peach...acres of roses, violets and ornamental plants surrounded the house..."

[[Kruger House (Pretoria)|Kruger House]], situated in Church Street West, Pretoria, and built in a Victorian veranda style, was designed by Tom Claridge, one of Pretoria’s first architects and was erected on the instructions of Nellmapius.

He also owned the Pretoria newspaper ''De Pers''. Due to lack of funds he lost a Government manufacturing contract at Eerste Fabrieken to [[Sammy Marks]]. His first enterprise was the ''Hatherley Distillery'' that produced gin and whisky on the farm Hatherley, opened by President Kruger on 6 June 1883 and named ''Volkshoop''. He started the first gunpowder factory in South Africa and the Irene Lime Works. On the death of Nellmapius, Marks took over his concessions for the distillery, canning fruit and a ceramics factory. A portrait of Nellmapius is to be seen on the second floor of the Sammy Marks Museum.

Nellmapius often entertained in grand style at Irene and a frequent guest was Transvaal president, Paul Kruger. [[Arnold Theiler]]'s first employment in South Africa was with Nellmapius. He married Johanna Corlydia Hoffman in 1882, and lived at the Irene Estate until his death in 1893, he was buried in the 'Golden Acres Cemetery' in Church street in Pretoria where Paul Kruger and many others of that time were buried.

== History ==

The first survey was conducted in 1999-2000 to assess the business environment and performance of firms in the countries of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]]. The sample included about 4000 firms.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Since then three other rounds of the survey have been conducted.&lt;ref name="TurleyLuke2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OECD2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Progress in Policy Reforms to Improve the Investment Climate in South East Europe Investment Reform Index 2006: Investment Reform Index 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtLVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92|date=13 November 2007|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-03724-3|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2008-2009 survey covered more than 11,000 firms.  The 2008 round survey questionnaire and the sampling methodology were significantly modified, making direct cross-period comparisons problematic.
This survey was conducted in the following 28 countries: [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Hungary]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz Republic]], [[Montenegro]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Poland]], [[Russia|Russian Federation]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia|Slovak Republic]], [[Slovenia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]].

== Other business surveys ==

Several other projects are conducted with a similar purpose of describing business environment in different countries, most notably ''The [[Doing Business Report]]''. Unlike ''The Doing Business Report'', BEEPS are only conducted in the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.&lt;ref name="BourguignonJacquet2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, Joel, et al.

The '''Banking Ombudsman Scheme''' in New Zealand is a free and independent dispute resolution service established in 1992. They look into complaints by customers about (New Zealand) banks and some non-bank deposit takers. A full list of scheme participants can be found on [https://bankomb.org.nz/the-complaint-process/bank-participant/ their website].

It is an approved dispute resolution scheme under the Financial Service Providers (Registration and Dispute Resolution) Act 2008.

In the 2016 [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|MBIE]] [http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/consumer-protection/consumer-research-and-reports/national-consumer-survey National Consumer Survey] the Banking Ombudsman Scheme was listed as the most well known financial services dispute resolution scheme, and rated second overall.

The current Banking Ombudsman is Nicola Sladden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bankomb.org.nz/about-us/banking-ombudsman/|title=Banking Ombudsman Scheme website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bart Decrem''' is a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who, most recently, headed the Mobile Games business for [[The Walt Disney Company]] between July 2010 and the Fall of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1269265/billboard-qa-tapulous-co-founder-Decrem-decrem | title=Billboard Q&amp;A: Tapulous Co-Founder Bart Decrem|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born and raised in [[Belgium]].

== Early life ==
His first entrepreneurial venture was at the age of 13, when he started a weekly magazine for Belgium’s leading underground radio station while working as a DJ there. Decrem moved to the US to study law at Stanford University. After graduation, Decrem founded Plugged In, a non-profit organization in East Palo Alto that provided community members with Internet access and related educational programs. Plugged In was one of the first such Digital Divide programs in the United States.

== Career ==
In 1999, Decrem co-founded [[Eazel]], an open source [[Linux]] desktop start-up. Their software, Nautilus, continues to be popular among Linux users. Among other projects, he coordinated the creation of the [[GNOME Foundation]]. After Eazel shut down in 2001, Decrem spent 18 months in Seoul, doing business development for several local startups.

In 2003-2004, Decrem headed marketing and business affairs for the [[Mozilla Foundation]]. He coordinated [[Firefox]] marketing activities, including branding, the Firefox 1.0 launch and the creation of Spread Firefox, the community marketing effort for Firefox. He also headed up partnerships with [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and [[Mozilla]]. His work for Mozilla was sponsored by [[Mitch Kapor]]’s Open Source Applications Foundation.

After leaving Mozilla, he started [[Flock, Inc.|Flock]], a startup building a social web browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/10/24/new-social-web-browser-based-on-firefox | title=New 'Social' Web Browser Based on Firefox|work=[[FoxNews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/applications/flock-founder-hopes-new-browser-will-fly-users-752 | title=Flock founder hopes new browser will fly with users|work=[[InfoWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angel investors in Flock included [[Josh Kopelman]], [[Gil Penchina]], [[Joe Kraus]], [[Scott Kurnit]], [[Stratton Sclavos]] and others. VC investors included [[Bessemer Venture Partners]], Catamount Ventures and Shasta Ventures. He was Flock’s CEO through its Series C, and left the company in the Summer of 2006.

In 2007, Decrem worked as an Entrepreneur In Residence at DCM (Doll Capital Management).

In January, 2008, Bart Decrem was Founder and CEO at [[Tapulous]], one of the first iPhone startups. [[Andrew Lacy]] was the Co-Founder at [[Tapulous]]. Tapulous is the company behind [[Tap Tap Revenge]]
one of the first major game hits on the App Store.

In April, 2009, [[comScore]] announced that Tap Tap Revenge was the most popular App Store app of all times on the occasion on Apple’s announcement of the first one billion app downloads. At that time, according to comScore, Tap Tap Revenge was installed on 32% of all iPhones in the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/technology/start-ups/22tap.html | title=Music Games for iPhone Give Artists New Spotlight| work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ir.comscore.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=375787 | title=Top 25 All-Time iPhone Apps Mostly Games| work=[[ComScore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green Week Berlin 2013 AS img 15.jpg|thumb|One of the exhibition halls, 2013]]

'''Berlin International Green Week''' ({{lang-de|Internationale Grüne Woche Berlin}}), also called simply '''Green Week''', is an important international trade fair held annually in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], for processors and marketers in agriculture, horticulture and various food industries. Green Week traditionally takes place at the beginning of the year in the [[Messe Berlin]] exhibition halls under the [[Funkturm]] and is open to the general public. In 2010 it had around 400,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gruenewoche.de/ Internationale Grüne Woche at Messe Berlin], in German. Retrieved 27-Feb-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[Paris International Agricultural Show]] ({{lang-fr|Salon International de l'Agriculture}}) had 650,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon-agriculture.com Salon International Press site], in French. Retrieved 27-Feb-2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fair is accompanied every year by protests themed ''[[We are fed up|We are fed up!]]''. Since to 2011 between 15,000 and 30,000 people join the demonstrations against [[industrial livestock production]] and for more sustainable farming.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09139, Berlin, Geflügelzüchter bei der Grünen Woche.jpg|thumb|Green Week in 1930]]
The first green week (at that time still not "international") was held from 20 to 28 February 1926, when an employee at the Berlin Tourism Office had the idea to combine the traditional winter meeting of the [[German Agricultural Society]] with an agricultural exhibition as a secondary showcase for fair participants. Green Week owes its name to the green felt coats ({{lang-de|Lodenmäntel}}) worn by German foresters and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/gruenewoche/article1239078/Woher-die-Gruene-Woche-ihren-Namen-hat.html Article in the Berliner Morgenpost, 15 January 2010], in German. Retrieved 27-Feb-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year, there were 50,000 visitors and the fair had covered an area of 7,000 m².  

Green Week took place every year until 1939, with the exception of 1938 because of an outbreak of European [[foot-and-mouth disease]]. After the devastation of [[World War II]], Green Week resumed in 1948. After a break in 1951 due to major postwar construction, the fair was held again in 1951 and every year since. Participation of foreign exhibitors increased continuously: by 1963 they accounted two-thirds of exhibitors. After [[German reunification]] in the 1990s, Green Week grew substantially. Special shows on topics such as "German Cheese" and since 2005 a technical program of over 250 lectures, seminars and symposia round off the exhibition.

The '''Carriage of Goods By Sea Act 1992''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Act of Parliament|Statute]] that repeals the [[Bills of Lading Act 1855]] and makes new provisions.

==Background to the Act==
The Bills of Lading Act 1855 was commendably brief and proved useful, but as time went by certain defects became apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/lqr6&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=On Some Defects in the Bills of Lading Act 1855 6 Law Quarterly Review 1890 |website=Heinonline.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English courts devised some ways round the problem: in ''[[Brandt v Liverpool]]'' 1924 &lt;ref&gt;[1924] 1 KB 575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandt v Liverpool, Brazil and River Plate Steam Navigation Co. Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of implied contracts was developed.  Nevertheless, there were difficulties relating to passing of property and passing of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ieD5nT0ndHcC&amp;pg=PA380&amp;lpg=PA380&amp;dq=brandt+v+liverpool&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k3jEh0TXOY&amp;sig=H-6rwaWdS2fqnNOKQdApnR0-pt4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7ivPYpvjNAhWhAcAKHYPsBy8Q6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=brandt%20v%20liverpool&amp;f=false |title=Clive M. Schmitthoff's Select Essays on International Trade Law |author=Clive Maximilian Schmitthoff |page=380 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Law Commission]] and the [[Scottish Law Commission]] addressed the issue in a report, "Rights of Suit in respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea".&lt;ref&gt;LAW COM No. 196 &amp; SCOT LAW COM No. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rights-of-suit-in-respect-of-carriage-of-goods-by-sea-date |title=Rights of suit in respect of carriage of goods by sea - Publications |website=Gov.uk |date=1991-03-20 |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160918064449/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228559/0250.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; The Report contained a draft [[Bill (law)|bill]] which Parliament adopted in full without amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Except that, for obvious reasons, the proposed short title was changed from "Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1991'' to " ~~~ 1992"&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Act's provisions==
The statute makes provision for Bills of Lading and other documents of carriage, as follows:
*s.1:	The CoGSA 1992 now applies to: [[bill of lading|bills of lading]],  sea waybills, and ship's delivery orders. A bill of lading must be [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable]], and includes a "received for shipment" bill.
*s.1 also empowers the Minister to make regulatory provision (by way of a [[Statutory Instrument]]) in respect of electronic transactions and electronic bills of lading.
*s.2:	A person who becomes the lawful holder of a bill of lading (or sea waybill, or delivery order)  shall have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to the contract.
*s.3:	Where such a person (s.2) takes or demands delivery of the goods (or makes a cargo claim), that person becomes subject to the same liabilities under that contract as if he had been a party to that contract.
*s.4:	A bill of lading which represents goods to have been shipped, and which is signed by the ship’s master or his agent is '''conclusive''' evidence of receipt for shipment.
*(s.4 quashes the rule in ''[[Grant v Norway]]'' 1851).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maritimelawdigital.com/uploads/HTML/Grant_Norway_1851.htm |title=Grant v Norway |website=Maritimelawdigital.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pntodd.users.netlink.co.uk/cases/cases_g/grant_n.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517174039/http://pntodd.users.netlink.co.uk/cases/cases_g/grant_n.htm |archivedate=17 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bills of Lading==
{{main|Bill of lading}}
A [[bill of lading]] serves three main functions: 
*  it is a conclusive receipt, i.e. an acknowledgement that the goods have been loaded; 
* it contains or evidences the terms of the contract of carriage; and 
* it serves as a document of title to the goods, subject to the ''[[nemo dat quod non habet]]'' rule.

Although the term "bill of lading" is well known and well understood, it may become obsolete.  Articles 1:15 &amp; 1:16 of the [[Rotterdam Rules]] create the new term "transport document"; but (assuming the Rules come into force) it remains to be seen whether shippers, carriers and "maritime performing parties" (another new Rotterdam Rules coinage) will abandon the long-established and familiar term, "bill of lading".

== The Carriage of Goods By Sea Act 1971 ==
The [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] incorporates the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] into English Law.  These rules require (where the Article X invokes the Rules) that, on demand, the carrier must provide the shipper with a bill of lading that meets the requiirements of Article III.  Although CoGSA 1992 cannot amend the Hague-Visby Rules, which are an [[Public international law|International Convention]], s.4 of the 1992 Act (above) upgrades the status of a bill of lading to be conclusive evidence of receipt for shipment.

The '''Clerk of Works''' (or '''Clerk of the Works'''), often abbreviated CoW, is employed by an [[architect]] or a client on a [[construction site]]. The role is primarily to represent the interests of the client in regard to ensuring that the quality of both materials and workmanship are in accordance with the design information such as [[specification]] and [[engineering drawing]]s, in addition to recognized quality standards. The role is defined in [[standard forms of contract]] such as those published by the [[Joint Contracts Tribunal]]. "Clerks of works" are also the most highly qualified [[non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned]] tradesmen in the [[Royal Engineers]]. The qualification can be held in three specialisms: electrical, mechanical and construction.

Historically the Clerk of Works was employed by the architect on behalf of a client, or by local authorities to oversee public works. The CoW can also be employed by the client (state body/local authority/private client) to monitor design and build projects where the traditional role of the architect is within the design and build project team.

''Maître d'oeuvre'' (master of work) is a term used in many [[Francophone]] jurisdictions for the office that carries out this job in major projects; the [[Channel Tunnel]] project had such an office. In [[Italy]], the term used is ''direttore dei lavori'' (manager of the works).

==Origins of the title==
The job title is believed to derive from the 13th century when monks and priests (i.e. "clerics" or "clerks") were accepted as being more literate than the builders of the age and took on the responsibility of supervising the works associated with the erection of churches and other religious property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icwgb.org/page_viewer.asp?page=History+of+ICWCI&amp;pid=27 |title=History of ICWCI |publisher=Institute of Clerks of Work |date= |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As craftsmen and masons became more educated they in turn took on the role, but the title did not change. By the 19th century the role had expanded to cover the majority of building works, and the clerk of works was drawn from experienced tradesmen who had wide knowledge and understanding of the building process.

==The role==
The role, to this day, is based on the impartiality of the clerk of works in ensuring that value for money for the client - rather than the contractor - is achieved through rigorous and detailed inspection of materials and workmanship throughout the building process. In many cases, the traditional title has been discarded to comply with modern trends, such as site inspector, architectural inspector and quality inspector, but the requirement for the role remains unchanged since the origins of the title.

The clerk of works is a very isolated profession on site. He/she is the person that must ensure quality of both materials and workmanship and, to this end, must be absolutely impartial and independent in decisions and judgments. He/she cannot normally, by virtue of the quality role, be employed by the contractor - only the client, normally by the architect on behalf of the client. His/her role is not to judge, but simply to report all occurrences that are relevant to the role.

Clerks of Works are either on site all the time or make regular visits. They must be vigilant in their inspections of a large range of technical aspects of the work. This involves:
* making sure that work is carried out to the client's standards, specification, correct materials, workmanship and schedule
* becoming familiar with all the relevant drawings and written instructions, checking them and using them as a reference when inspecting work
* making visual inspections
* taking measurements and samples on site to make sure that the work and the materials meet the specifications and quality standards
* being familiar with legal requirements and checking that the work complies with them.
* having a working knowledge of health and safety legislation and bringing any shortfalls observed to the attention of the resident engineer.
* advising the contractor about certain aspects of the work, particularly when something has gone wrong, but this advice should not be interpreted as an instruction

==Notable clerks of works==
* [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1343–1400) was an English author, poet, philosopher, bureaucrat, courtier, diplomat and Clerk of the King's Works.
* John Louth was appointed first clerk of works of the [[Board of Ordnance]] by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] in 1414 along with Nicholas Merbury, Master of Ordnance. The [[Royal Artillery]], [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] can all trace their origins to this date.
* [[William of Wykeham]], [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Bishop of Winchester]] (1323–1404) was Clerk of the King's Works.
* William Dickinson, Clerk of the King's Works from 1660 to his death in 1702 and Controller Clerk at Windsor Castle. His son, [[William Dickinson (architect)|William Dickinson]], was architect and Deputy Surveyor of [[Westminster Abbey]] under [[Sir Christopher Wren]].
* James Needham, was appointed Clerk of the King's Works on 30 April 1530, and during that and the two following years devised and superintended the building alterations at Esher, York Place, and [[Westminster Palace]]. In September 1532, he was engaged in the ‘re-edifying’ of St. Thomas's Tower within the [[Tower of London]], and was occupied on that and other works in the Tower during the next three years. In April 1533, he was appointed by grant Clerk and Overseer of the King's Works in England.

==The Institute of Clerks of Works and Construction Inspectorate of Great Britain Incorporated==
The ICWCI - motto: ''Potestate, Probitate et Vigilantia'' (Ability, Integrity and Vigilance) - is the professional body that supports quality construction through systematic inspection. As a membership organisation, it provides a support network of meeting centres, technical advice, publications and events to help keep members up to date with the ever-changing construction industry.

Post-nominals for members are FICWCI (Fellow), MICWCI (Member) and LICWCI (Licentiate).

===History===
The Institute was founded in 1882 as the Clerk of Works Association, becoming the Incorporated Clerk of Works Association of Great Britain in 1903. In 1947, its name was amended again to the Institute of Clerks of Works of Great Britain Incorporated, a title it retained until 2009 when it was expanded to the Institute of Clerks of Works and Construction Inspectorate of Great Britain Incorporated.

The organisation was founded to allow those who were required to operate in isolation on site, a central organisation to look after the interests of their chosen profession, be it through association with other professional bodies, educational means or simply through social intercourse among their own peers and contemporaries. Essential to this, as the Institute developed, was the development of a central body that could lobby Parliament in relation to their profession, and the quality issues that it stands for.
 
Though the means of construction, training of individuals, and the way individuals are employed have changed dramatically over the years, the principles the Institute originally formed for remain sacrosanct. Experience in the many facets of the building trade is essential and, in general terms, most practitioners have ''come from the tools'', though further third level education in the built environment is essential.

==='Building on Quality' Awards===
The Institute of Clerks of Works and Construction Inspectorate hold the biannual Building on Quality Awards, and nominations are accepted from all involved in quality site inspection regardless of whether they are members of the Institute. Judging is based on the Clerk of Works' ability, his/her contribution to the projects he/she is involved with, his/her record keeping and reports, and his/her commitment to the role of Clerk of Works.

Awards given in each category are Winner, Highly Commended and Commended. The Overall Winner is chosen from all categories and is widely considered the highest accolade that can be awarded to a clerk of works in recognition of his work. Newly introduced in 2013 was the Peter Wilson Memorial trophy, which has now had two deserving recipients. The trophy was donated by the Cumbria and North Lancashire Chapter to the ICWCI in memoriam of Vice President Peter Wilson FICWCI.

===Clerk of Works in Canada===
The earliest record of a Clerk of Works in Canada was John Mactaggart who was the Clerk of Works for the Rideau Canal project in 1826. John MacTaggart was a British civil engineer and the chief clerk of works in charge of the project, reporting to Lt. Col. John By. John Morris is a notable Clerk of Works from the mid 1800's completing several notable projects such as University College, Univ. of Toronto, (1856–59), Parliament Building, the Departmental Buildings, and for Government House.

During the renovations to Pembroke City Hall, W.J. Moore was Clerk of the Works for the addition in 1912 and J.L. Morris for the alterations in 1914.

Boulder: Sounds True. {{ISBN|978-1591795179}}&lt;/ref&gt; enterprises and people (also sometimes referred to under the label '''conscious capitalism'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/01/15/john-mackey-why-companies-should-embrace-conscious-capitalism/ John Mackey: Why Companies Should Embrace Conscious Capitalism.] [[Forbes]], 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;) are those that choose to follow a business strategy, in which they seek to benefit both human beings and the environment. The Conscious Business movement in the US, which emerged from the theory of [[corporate social responsibility]], pushes for "values-based" economic values where [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] represent social and environmental concerns at both global and local scales.  This effort is related to not-just-for-profit business models, conscious consumerism, and [[socially responsible investing]].

There is an alternative way of thinking about Conscious Business emerging in the UK, and perhaps other countries, which tries to avoid [[wikt:reification|reification]], regarding it less as a thing or a type of business which can be categorised, and more as an ongoing process including [[awareness]], [[self-awareness]], awareness of purpose, [[practice (social theory)]] and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amed.org.uk/page/welcome-to-e-o-p-winter-2013/ Pete Burden and Rob Warwick: Exploring Conscious Business Practice: Sensing as we act, reacting to what we sense] AMED, 2 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conscious business criteria==

===Doing no harm===
It is generally agreed upon that the product or service of a conscious business should not be intrinsically harmful to humans or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howes|first1=Lewis|title=5 Secrets to Building a Business{{snd}}With Heart|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236171|website=Entrepreneur Magazine|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for such a business to be taking part in the conscious business movement if it is taking conscious steps to be more aware of its social and environmental effects, and to adopt more beneficial social or environmental practices.

===Triple Bottom Line Model===
Most conscious businesses subscribe to a [[Triple Bottom Line]] model of success. They aim to provide positive value in the domains of people, planet, and [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Triple bottom line|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14301663|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=The Economist|publisher=The Economist|date=Nov 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Profit ====

This is what distinguishes the entity as a [[business]] from the general social enterprise. The degree of understanding or "consciousness" of any [[conflict of interest]] between the [[profit motive]] and social goods varies widely from the standard sloganeering capital accumulating firm ("[[don't be evil]]") to those who seek nothing more than [[break-even]] to pay for their operations, are completely employee owned, etc..

==== People ====
A conscious business seeks to benefit both the external livelihood as well as the internal lives of its shareholders and employees.  Furthermore, the business seeks to benefit all stakeholders including manufacturers, affected communities, and humanity at large. Some trends in conscious business which have arisen out of these efforts include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLMLcyR0B2sC|title=Maximizing the Triple Bottom Line Through Spiritual Leadership|last=Fry|first=Louis|last2=Nisiewicz|first2=Melissa|date=2013-01-09|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804784290|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  The forming of wellness affirming workplace cultures
*  Improved employee benefit programs
*  Use of [[fair trade]] materials for manufacture or sale
*  Assistance to communities who supply raw materials
*  Assistance to communities who manufacture materials
*  Local community outreach programs

==== Planet ====
A conscious business will seek to minimize its impact on the environment, and replenish the environment where it is able. Conscious businesses may choose to benefit the environment in many different ways, some trends include:
*  Robust recycling programs
*  Building "green" or "zero-impact" workplace facilities
*  Using solar or wind energy in the workplace
*  Purchasing materials from organic or sustainable farmers
*  Purchasing renewable and sustainable materials
*  Working with environmentally conscious distributors
*  Urging manufacturers and distributors to adopt better environmental practices
*  Adopting sustainable product packaging

===Above and beyond===
Many conscious businesses choose to use their resources to benefit social and environmental programs that are not directly related to the creation or distribution of the product or service.  Frequently, a conscious business will donate employee paid time, money, or products towards various non-profit organizations. Sometimes a conscious business will create a foundation, which works with one particular cause.  Also, some conscious businesses will become involved with social or political campaigns to protect the environment, animals, or people. Conscious businesses will sometimes use significant amounts of their profit towards these causes.
Furthermore, a conscious business will sometimes work closely with suppliers in either a farming or manufacturing community in a developing country, and help to develop the community economically and replenish it environmentally.

=== The Conscious Business Declaration ===
In 2015 [https://www.humanitysteam.org/ Humanity’s Team], an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], engaged with the [https://www.goipeace.or.jp/en/ Goi Peace Foundation of Japan], the [[Club of Budapest]], and the [https://weatherhead.case.edu/centers/fowler/ Fowler Center for Business as an Agent of World Benefit] at [[Case Western Reserve University]] to draft the [http://www.consciousbusinessdeclaration.org/ Conscious Business Declaration]. Self-described as "A New Standard for Business in the 21st Century," it took over a year to write the declaration, and it was officially made public in early 2016. People can show their support for the declaration by "signing" it online.

==== The Conscious Business Declaration consists of a preamble and seven principles ====

===== Preamble =====
As a global community of business leaders we are committed to developing the awareness and skills needed to consciously evolve our organizations in alignment with these principles:

===== The Principles =====
# We Are One with humanity and all of life.  Business and all institutions of the human community are integral parts of a single reality{{snd}}interrelated, interconnected and interdependent.
# In line with this reality, the purpose of Business is to increase economic prosperity while contributing to a healthy environment and improving human wellbeing.
# Business must go beyond sustainability and the philosophy of “do no harm” to restoring the self-renewing integrity of the Earth.
# Business must operate with economic, social, and ecological transparency.
# Business must behave as a positive and proactive member of the local and global communities in which it operates.
# Business that sees, honors, and celebrates the essential interconnected nature of all human beings and all life maximizes human potential and helps create a world that works for all.
# When aligned with Oneness, Business is the most powerful engine on Earth for creating prosperity and flourishing for all.

==Conscious business versus social responsibility==
To term a business a conscious business is different from the concept of a [[socially responsible business]]: although, of course, a conscious business is likely to be socially responsible. Being a conscious business does not only mean implementing a local community program, or creating a company foundation.  A business could implement one of these programs and still not be aware or respond to the fact that the business as a whole is doing more harm than good.

The term conscious business implies that a business will seek to be conscious of its impact on the world in various spheres, and continue this inquiry over time. It is concerned with both its impact on a human’s inner and outer world as well as animal and environmental well-being.  Furthermore, a conscious business considers both short-term and long-term effects of its actions or inactions.  A conscious business evolves as does the methods that a business can and chooses to be of benefit to the world and to function with awareness. Therefore, though conscious businesses will be socially responsible, the term "conscious business" holds larger connotations for the businesses' actions than does social responsibility.

==Conscious businesses movement==

Many believe that [[Anita Roddick]] pioneered the conscious business movement with her company, [[The Body Shop]] in 1976.  This company has been an environmental leader, and worked to support various activist causes including putting an end to animal testing, and defending human rights.

An overwhelming amount of conscious businesses can be found in the health food industry as well as the [[LOHAS]] (lifestyles of health and sustainability) market. However, today conscious businesses can be found emerging in almost all aspects of the business world.

Whole Foods cofounder, John Mackey, is another pioneer in the movement along with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. Large corporations as well as small boutique agencies and individuals embrace the movement despite pressure to earn money at any cost. They see business based on ethics and social responsibility versus personal gain. Public relations and brand specialist Sarni Jaye based her business on working only with conscious brands to help them grow and achieve their desired mission. USA Today reported about the wave of millennials embracing conscious business. Other businesses cited are Trader Joe's, The Container Store, Nordstrom, and more.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/21/starbucks-face-conscious-capitalism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/03/25/kindness-panera-bread-nordstrom-starbucks/1965183/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various agencies and companies that catalogue the social and environmental practices of businesses for consumer use, as well as companies which consult with businesses to increase their awareness and beneficial practices in the world.

Conscious business is about people who are aware of the impact each of their habits and actions has on their environment (people and planet). It is about people who live their lives based on knowing that everything is interconnected. It is about people, who know who they are:
*who know about their strengths and weaknesses and
*who desire to live and work with joy, creativity and ease instead of fear, power and domination.

==Conscious business versus sustainability==
There's a huge trend towards more sustainable business practices. Environmental sustainability, however, has little to do with conscious business. Organizations can be highly sustainable, but still run in an unconscious way. A conscious business, however, will not maintain unsustainable business practices.

==Reification==
Some&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amed.org.uk/page/welcome-to-e-o-p-spring-2014 Pete Burden and Rob Warwick: The Purpose and Practice of Conscious Business] AMED, Spring 2014&lt;/ref&gt; are expressing caution about the way that conscious business might be reduced to a formulaic framework and schema. The concern is that these play down the attention that we give to everyday practices and how people relate to each other.

The alternative view is that the practice of conscious business aims to raise awareness of the hurly-burly of everyday life and help people notice those assumptions that influence our perceptions and practice – to become more aware. From that emerges consciousness of purpose; it also leads to adoption of many of the approaches outlined by Kofman, Mackey and others, and to the outcomes they point to (better long term business performance, for example).

This approach is aligned with a view of business derived from [[Complexity theory and organizations]].

==Impact on Professionals==

The idea of conscious business as a reflexive approach – through noticing and awareness as we act – suggests that there are practical implications for OD ([[Organization Development]]) and HR ([[Human Resources]]) professionals. For example, such professionals may find it useful to highlight the importance of noticing group dynamics, power, and other group phenomena. And ultimately to question their own assumptions about the purpose of business.

In this way, this reflexive approach links back to the more ethical, but perhaps sometimes reified definitions, of conscious business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://app.croneri.co.uk/strategic-briefings/conscious-business-impact-and-implications-hr-and-od?product=3 Pete Burden and Rob Warwick: Conscious business – impact and implications for HR and OD], Croner, January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Converting companies''' are companies that specialize in combining raw materials such as [[polyester]]s, adhesives, [[silicone]], [[adhesive tape]]s, foams, plastics, felts, rubbers, liners and metals, as well as other materials, to create new products.

Materials such as [[paper]], [[plastic film]], foil and cloth often are produced in long, continuous sheets that are rolled up for more convenient handling and transportation.  These rolls of material vary significantly in size and weight — ranging from {{convert|2|-|203|inch|cm|0}} wide and weighing as much as several tons. The converting industry takes these continuous rolls of thin, flat materials — known as webs — threads them through processing machines (such as printing presses, laminating, coating and slitting machines) and converts or changes the web of material into an intermediate form or final product.  For example, a converter’s equipment might take a web of plastic film, cut it into lengths, and fuse their edges, thus converting it into plastic bags.  This activity is known as web processing.

==Processes==
Typical converting processes are coating, laminating and printing. [[Coating]] technologies can include hot melt coating, gravure coating, [[curtain coating]] and slot-die coating. The most common printing techniques are [[flexo]] printing and [[rotogravure]] (gravure) printing. Both print processes are suited to high speed roll-to-roll processing.

Many converting companies will process large diameter, wide rolls of material as this increases the converting efficiency by minimising changes. On completion of the converting process the rolls may be cut into smaller rolls on a [[roll slitting|slitting machine]]. These rolls are then a convenient size for handling on packaging and other machines.  Alternatively, the rolls may be sheeted-cut into sheets — as happens in newspaper and book printing.  Further processes such as collation may occur after sheeting.

==Web alignment==
Web alignment is an important part of a converting operation as a moving web of material has a tendency to track off course and wander out of alignment during the converting processes. To avoid these problems, engineers have developed a variety of automatic web-guiding systems that assure production accuracy and reduce waste. Web-guiding systems typically are positioned just before a critical stage on a converting machine (for example, just before a print station on a printing press).

Each type of [[Web-guiding systems|web guiding system]] uses a sensor to monitor the web position for lateral tracking, and each has an actuator to shift the running web mechanically back on course whenever the sensor detects movement away from the set path. Actuators may be pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, or some kind of electromechanical device. Because the web may be fragile — particularly at its edge — non-contact sensors are used.  These sensors may be [[Pneumatic web guides|pneumatic]], photoelectric, ultrasonic, or infrared. The system’s controls must put the output signals from the sensors in to a form that can drive the actuator. Many controls today are electronic, typically using an amplifier to convert signals from the sensor, then commanding a special servo motor incorporating a lead or ball screw for guiding actuation. The latest web guiding systems have touch screen controls to simplify the setup procedure. Some web guiding systems have been designed specifically for the converting industry.

==Services==
Many converters specialize in 
* Adhesive coating to make [[labels]] and [[adhesive tape]]
* Silicone coating to make a [[release liner]]
* [[Die (manufacturing)|Die]]-cutting materials into finished parts or labels
* Printing services
* [[Roll slitting]] of wide webs into narrow webs or coils
* Laminating services
* [[Vacuum forming]]

==Newer technology==
Some converting companies now incorporate electronics in their finished products.  For example, converters producing [[RFID]] stock labels must incorporate RFID chips and antenna inlays.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.abgint.com/news_archive/05_apr_rfid_converter.html Description of an RFID upgrade at a conversion company] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131016043335/http://www.abgint.com/news_archive/05_apr_rfid_converter.html |date=2013-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electronic components make up the [[RFID tag]].  The tag stores the information about the items that have been tagged.  These converters therefore sometimes incorporate volume electronics manufacturing practices including controlling static electricity, electronic manufacturing test and similar processes.  Solving some of the issues of inclusion of materials sensitive to external influences has led to more tech companies embracing roll-based manufacturing processes, with particular success in the lithium ion and solar cell manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref name="lithium"&gt;[http://www.universalconvertingequipment.com/lithium-ion-and-solar-cell-manufacturers-increasingly-embracing-web-processes Lithium ion and solar cell manufacturers increasingly embracing converter web processes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paper converting==
{{advert|date=January 2018}}
The process of processing pre-cut cartons or "blanks" and folding them into the appropriate shape to become finished packaging containers is known as tray forming or carton erecting. These machines can create, for example, nacho trays, chinese noodle soup boxes, pizza boxes, french fry trays, hamburger clamshells, etc.

'''Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW)''' is a trade organization for the [[cosmetics]], [[fragrance]] and personal care industry.

==History==
CEW was founded in 1954 as a social organization for female executives working in the beauty industry. In 1975, the group expanded, and began focusing on the recognition of the career achievements of women working in the industry. By 1985, CEW established itself as a professional network, offering seminars, speakers, and mentoring to aid its members in career development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cew.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=aboutcew]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
CEW's membership is now around 9,500, and includes women and men. CEW's members span entry-level to high-ranking executives of beauty companies or related businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cew.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=aboutcew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its lineup of programming for its members includes career workshops, networking events, online mentoring, a beauty career center, speaker series, news forums and industry newsletters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cew.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=aboutcew]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award programs==
CEW has become well known for its recognition programs. One, the Achiever Awards, are presented to individuals who have demonstrated "strong leadership" in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stylelist.com/2010/10/04/2010-cosmetic-executive-woman-achiever-awards-honor-beautys-bes/]&lt;/ref&gt; Previous winners of this award include Linda Wells, the editor in chief of ''[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]'' magazine; Leslie Blodgett, CEO of mineral cosmetic company Bare Escentuals; Lisa Price, founder of African American hair care company [[Carol's Daughter]]; [[Procter &amp; Gamble#Operations|Gina Drosos]], Global Head of Beauty at [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]; and Alex Keith, an executive with P&amp;G's beauty sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stylelist.com/2010/10/04/2010-cosmetic-executive-woman-achiever-awards-honor-beautys-bes/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcimagazine.com/networking/coverage/4442956.html]&lt;/ref&gt; CEW is also known for its Beauty Awards, where cosmetic, fragrance, skin care, hair care and body care products of various categories are judged for quality and innovation by CEW's members. After a selection of finalist products is announced, the final winning products (and companies) are honored at a gala event in New York City. Many influential cosmetic executives, journalists, and celebrities attend this event, and a CEW Beauty Award is widely recognized as the most prestigious honor a company can receive for its products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/beauty/cosmetic-executive-women-beauty-awards-167960/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2001, the CEW Foundation&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cew.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=CEW&amp;WebKey=e2c041e5-6921-4aa5-bcc4-183e6a428461&lt;/ref&gt; began a program called "Cancer and Careers," designed to provide support, education, and inspiration to cancer patients and survivors who are beginning or developing careers, as well as supporting newly diagnosed members of the workforce. Cancer and Careers focuses on supporting those affected by cancer in any industry, not strictly the beauty industry. It is supported by donations from CEW members as well as corporate and individual sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancerandcareers.org/en/about-us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEW Foundation is headed by Executive Director Rebecca V. Nellis, MPP, Chairwoman Heidi Manheimer, Surratt Beauty, President Carlotta Jacobson of CEW, and Treasurer Kim Kelleher, Conde Nast

'''David Gregory Jeaffreson''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] ({{zh|t=謝法新}}, 23 November 1931 – 30 October 2008) was a British colonial government official and [[civil servant]]. He arrived in [[Hong Kong]] in 1961 serving as [[Administrative Officer]], and was [[Secretary for Economic Services]] and [[Secretary for Security]] in [[1970s in Hong Kong|1970s]] and [[1980s in Hong Kong|1980s]], during which he had also been appointed as official [[Legislative Councillor]] for more than ten years.

Jeaffreson was appointed as [[Commissioner of ICAC]] by [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]] [[David Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn|Sir David Wilson]] in 1988. Retiring from the government in 1991, he chose to reside in Hong Kong and had become the deputy chairman of Big Island Asia Limited and an independent non-executive director of [[Buildmore International Limited]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Jeaffreson was born on 23 November 1931 in the [[United Kingdom]] from a well-known surgical family descended from [[Framlingham]], [[Suffolk]], which is said to have performed the first successful [[ovariotomy]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="a"&gt;''[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119783541/abstract British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology] Volume 60 Issue 4'', BJOG, August 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeaffreson was born to Bryan Leslie Jeaffreson (1896&amp;ndash;1953) and Margaret Jeaffreson. His father was a [[Physician]] who was qualified as a [[Medical Doctor]], [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]] and [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|Member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]].&lt;ref name="b"&gt;''Who's Who'', A &amp; C Black, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeaffreson attended [[Bootham School]] in [[York]] and then went up to [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], obtaining an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]].&lt;ref name="c"&gt;Edited by Kevin Sinclair, ''Who's who in Hong Kong'', Hong Kong: Who's Who in Hong Kong Ltd.: Asianet Information Services Ltd., 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation, called up into the [[British Army]] in 1950 to carry out his [[National Service]]. He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Artillery]] on 4 November 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39096|supp=y|pages=6383–6384|date=22 December 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After almost a year's service with the regular army, he was transferred to the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] list on 22 October 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39459|supp=y|pages=768–770|date=5 February 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was promoted to acting [[first lieutenant|lieutenant]] on 22 July 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39683|supp=y|page=5730|date=5 February 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He completed his service on 23 September 1955, transferring to the reserve of officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=40590|supp=y|page=5346|date=20 September 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, he joined the [[Colonial Service]] and was sent to the British mandate of [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] in [[East Africa]] in where he served as Administrative Officer until 1958. From 1959 to 1960, he was employed by Henricot Steel Foundry, becoming an assistant manager.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

===Hong Kong Government===
In 1961, Jeaffreson joined the [[Hong Kong Government]] as an Administrative Officer. He firstly worked in the Department of Trade Industry and Customs under the Finance Branch, and was promoted to the post of Assistant Secretary for Trade and Industry in 1967 and [[Financial Secretary|Deputy Financial Secretary]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; He became [[Secretary for Economic Services]] in September 1976. In this capacity, he oversaw the economic affairs of Hong Kong and occasionally served as acting Financial Secretary.&lt;ref name="legco"&gt;''[http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr87-88/chinese/lc_sitg/hansard/h880210.pdf 立法局會議過程正式紀錄]'',香港: 香港立法局, 10 February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeaffreson was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[New Year Honours]] of 1981 for his public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=48467|supp=y|page=17|date=30 December 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeaffreson was [[Secretary for Security]] from November 1982 to February 1988 and had briefly served as acting [[Chief Secretary for Administration|Chief Secretary]] for [[David Robert Ford|Sir David Ford]] for six days before the end of his term of office.&lt;ref&gt;"保安司謝法新突然「官運亨通」，月底任署理布政司", page one, second section of ''華僑日報'', 10 February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Secretary for Security, he was responsible for some sensitive and important issues such as settling the [[boat people]] and the introduction of the nationality of [[British National (Overseas)]] for Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=legco/&gt; Apart from that, he also paid much attention on issues related to [[security]], [[crime]], the [[Triad (underground societies)|Triad]]s and [[illegal drug]]s.&lt;ref name=legco/&gt;

From September 1976 to February 1988, Jeaffreson also served as official [[Legislative Councillor]] with the exception of the 1985 to 1986 Session. His ten and a half years' service in the Council was praised by the Governor, Sir David Wilson, and the Senior Unofficial Member of the Council, [[Lydia Dunn]], when he retired from the Council.&lt;ref name=legco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"謝法新服務立局十年，獲港督及鄧蓮如讚揚", page five, second section of ''大公報'', 11 February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February 1988, Jeaffreson was appointed the [[Commissioner, Independent Commission Against Corruption]] (ICAC) by the Governor, succeeding [[Geoffrey Thomas Barnes|Geoffrey Barnes]]. During his term, the ICAC cracked down a number of commercial [[Corporate corruption|corruption]] and [[fraud]] cases. The ICAC had made a closer cooperation with its counterparts in the [[People's Republic of China]] also. Jeaffreson retired from the post on 30 November 1991 and was succeeded by [[Peter James Allan|Peter Allan]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;"[http://appledaily.atnext.com/template/apple/art_main.cfm?iss_id=20081031&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;subsec_id=11867&amp;art_id=11787098 前任廉政專員謝法新逝世] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102085710/http://www1.appledaily.atnext.com/template/apple/art_main.cfm?iss_id=20081031&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;subsec_id=11867&amp;art_id=11787098 |date=2 November 2008 }}", ''蘋果日報'', 31 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown''' is the largest business district in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], located near the geographic center of the metropolitan area at the confluence of [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]], [[Interstate 45]], and [[Interstate 69]]. The {{convert|1.84|mi2|km2|adj=on}} district, enclosed by the aforementioned highways, contains the original townsite of Houston at the confluence of [[Buffalo Bayou]] and [[White Oak Bayou]], a point known as [[Allen's Landing]]. Downtown has been the city's preeminent commercial district since its founding in 1836.

Over 100,000 people commute through Downtown daily.&lt;ref name="DD" /&gt; An extensive [[Houston Downtown Tunnel System|network of pedestrian tunnels]] and skywalks connects a large number of buildings in the district; this system also serves as a subterranean mall.

After the [[Texas Revolution]], two New York real estate investors, [[John Kirby Allen]] and [[Augustus Chapman Allen]], purchased {{convert|6642|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land from Thomas F.L. Parrot and his wife, Elizabeth ([[John Austin (soldier)|John Austin]]'s widow), for US$9,428 ({{inflation|US|9428|1836|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpa85|title=PARROTT, THOMAS F.

A team of three surveyors, including [[Gail Borden, Jr.]] (best known for inventing [[condensed milk]]) and [[Moses Lapham]], platted a 62-square-block townsite in the fall of 1836, each block approximately 250 by 250 feet, or  {{convert|62500|ft2|m2}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstontx.gov/planning/HistoricPres/landmarks/11PL103_Stuart_Bldg_304_Main_St.pdf|title=Protected Landmark Designation Report – Stuart Building|last=|first=|date=2011-03-21|website=|publisher=City of Houston|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[grid plan]] was designed to conform to the winding route of Buffalo Bayou; east-west streets were aligned at an angle of north 55º west, while north-south streets were at an angle of south 35º west.&lt;ref name="Glass"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glass|first=James L.|date=1994|title=The Original Book of Sales of Lots in the Houston Town Company from 1836 Forward|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/16.3-The-Original-Book-fo-Sales-of-Lots-of-the-Houston-Town-Company-from-1836-Forward-James-Glass.pdf|journal=The Houston Review|volume=16|pages=167–194|via=Houston History Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each block was subdivided into 12 lots – five 50-by-100 foot lots on each side of the block, and two 50-by-125 foot lots between the rows of five.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt; The Allen brothers, motivated by their vision for urban civic life, specified wide streets to easily accommodate commercial traffic and reserved blocks for schools, churches, and civic institutions.&lt;ref name="Hogg"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hogg Family and Houston: Philanthropy and the Civic Ideal|last=Kirkland|first=Kate Sayan|first2=|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2009|isbn=9780292748460|location=Austin, Texas|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The townsite was then cleared and drained by a team of Mexican prisoners and [[History of slavery in Texas|black slaves]].&lt;ref name="Hogg" /&gt; By April 1837, Houston featured a dock, commercial district, the capitol building of the [[Republic of Texas]], and an estimated population of 1,500.&lt;ref name="Hogg" /&gt; The first city hall was sited at present-day [[Market Square Park]] in 1841; this block also served as the city's preeminent retail market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketsquarepark.com/site_media/uploads/files/2011-03/Back_to_the_Future.pdf|title=Back to the Future|last=Theis|first=David|date=2010|website=Market Square Park|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relocation of the Texan republic's capital to Houston required a significant political campaign by the Allen brothers. The Allens gifted a number of city blocks to prominent Texas politicians and agreed to construct the new capitol building and a large hotel at no cost to the government.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt; The Allens also donated blocks to celebrities, relatives, prominent lawyers, and other influential people in order to attract additional investment and speculation to the town.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt; During the late 1830s and early 1840s, Houston was in the midst of a [[real estate bubble|land boom]], and lots were selling at "enormous prices," according to a visitor to the town in 1837.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt;

Despite the efforts of the Allen brothers and high economic interest in the town, first few years of Houston's existence were plagued by [[yellow fever]] epidemics, flooding, searing heat, inadequate infrastructure, and crime.&lt;ref name="Hogg" /&gt; Houston suffered from woefully inadequate city services; the Allens failed to accommodate transit, water service, sewerage, road paving, trash service, or gas service in their plans.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt; As a result, in 1839 the Texas Capitol was moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref name="Hogg" /&gt;

In 1840, Houston adopted a [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward system]] of municipal governance, which, at the time, was considered more democratic than a [[Mayor–council government|strong-mayor system]] and had already been adopted by the United States' largest cities.&lt;ref name="Trapp"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Betty Trapp|date=Fall 2010|title=A System of Government Where Business Ruled|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ward-system-of-government.pdf|journal=Houston History Magazine|volume=8|pages=29–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries of the original four wards of Houston radiated out from the intersection of Main and Congress streets; the First Ward was located to the northwest, Second to the northeast, Third to the southeast, and Fourth to the southwest.&lt;ref name="Trapp" /&gt; Fifth Ward was created in 1866, encompassing the area north of Buffalo Bayou and east of White Oak Bayou; Sixth Ward, the final addition to the system, replaced the section of Fourth Ward north of Buffalo Bayou in 1877.&lt;ref name="Trapp" /&gt; The ward system, which featured elected [[aldermen]] who served as representatives of each neighborhood, remained Houston's form of municipal government until 1905, when the city switched to a [[city commission government|commission government]] and the wards, as political entities, were dissolved.&lt;ref name="Trapp" /&gt;

Houston grew steadily thorughout the late 19th century, and the neighborhoods within the boundaries of modern Downtown diversified. To the northeast, around present-day [[Minute Maid Park]], Quality Hill emerged as an elite neighborhood, occupied by entrepreneurs like [[William Marsh Rice]] (namesake of [[Rice University]]), [[William J. Hutchins]], and William L. Foley (namesake of [[Foley's]] department stores).&lt;ref name="Sturrock"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturrock|first=Sidonie|date=Spring 2015|title=Uncovering the Story of Quality Hill, Houston’s First Elite Residential Neighborhood: A Detective on the Case|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Quality-Hill.pdf|journal=Houston History Magazine|volume=12-2|pages=7–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood was well known for its opluent residential architecture, often in the [[Greek Revival]] style.&lt;ref name="Sturrock" /&gt; To the north, along a bend in Buffalo Bayou, the working-class neighborhood of Frost Town welcomed immigrants from Europe and Mexico during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Frost-Town-a-peek-into-past-9203176.php|title=Frost Town offers a peek into the past|last=George|first=Cindy|date=2016-09-04|website=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the arrival of the first [[streetcar]]s in Houston in the 1870s, most development in the city had been centered in and around the present-day Downtown area. One of the first systems, the Houston City Street Railway, opened in 1874 with four lines along the principal commercial thoroughfares in the heart of the business district.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baron|first=Steven|date=1994|title=Streetcars and the Growth of Houston|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/16.2-Streetcars-and-the-Growth-of-Houston-Steven-M-Baron.pdf|journal=The Houston Review|volume=16|pages=67–100|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While generally focused on the most prosperous areas of town, the Houston City Street Railway extended one line a full mile south of the center of the city, making it the first streetcar network designed to spur residential development.&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; By the 1890s, new, larger local streetcar companies finally accumulated the capital necessary to begin constructing [[streetcar suburb]]s beyond the conventional boundaries of the city.&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; This led to the development and rapid growth of areas like the [[Houston Heights]] and [[Montrose, Houston|Montrose]].&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; Residential development subsequently moved out of the central business district; Quality Hill was virtually abandoned by the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Sturrock" /&gt;

Downtown's growth can be attributed to two major factors:  The first arose after the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], when investors began seeking a location close to the ports of Southwest Texas, but apparently free of the dangerous hurricanes that frequently struck Galveston and other port cities.  Houston became a wise choice, as only the most powerful storms were able to reach the city.  The second came a year later with the 1901 discovery of oil at [[Spindletop]], just south of [[Beaumont, Texas]].  Shipping and oil industries began flocking to east Texas, many settling in Houston. From that point forward the area grew substantially, as many skyscrapers were constructed, including the city's tallest buildings. In the 1980s, however, economic recession canceled some projects and caused others to be scaled back, such as the [[Bank of the Southwest Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=bankofstreetsouthwesttower-houston-tx-usa Information from Emporis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century much of what was the [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]], the present day east side of Downtown Houston, was what Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who lectured at [[Rice University]], referred to as "the elite neighborhood of late 19th-century Houston." Ralph Bivins of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote that Fox said&lt;!--While Fox actually said it, the wording is Bivins'--&gt; that area was "a silk-stocking neighborhood of Victorian-era homes." Bivins said that the construction of Union Station, which occurred around 1910, caused the "residential character" of the area to "deteriorate." Hotels opened in the area to service travelers. Afterwards, according to Bivins, the area "began a long downward slide toward the skid row of the 1990s" and the hotels devolved into [[flophouse]]s. Passenger trains stopped going to [[Union Station (Houston)|Union Station]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Bivins, Ralph.

Beginning in the 1960s the development of the [[610 Loop]] caused the focus of the Houston area to move away from Downtown Houston. Joel Barna of ''Cite 42'' said that this caused [[Greater Houston]] to shift from "a fragmenting but still centrally focused spatial entity into something more like a doughnut," and that Downtown Houston began to become a "hole" in the "doughnut." As interchange connections with the 610 Loop opened, according to Barna Downtown "became just another node in a multi-node grid" and, as of 1998, "has been that, with already established high densities and land prices." In the mid-1980s, the bank [[savings and loan crisis]] forced many tenants in Downtown Houston buildings to retrench, and some tenants went out of business. Barna said that this development further caused Downtown Houston to decline.&lt;ref name="Barna73"&gt;Barna, Joel Warren.

The [[Gulf Hotel fire]] occurred in 1943.

Areas which are now considered part of Downtown were once within [[Third Ward, Houston, Texas|Third]] and the [[Fourth Ward, Houston, Texas|Fourth]] wards; the construction of Interstate 45 in the 1950s separated the areas from their former communities and placed them in Downtown. Additional freeway construction in the 1960s and 1970s solidified the current boundaries of Downtown. Originally, Downtown was the most important retail area of Houston. Suburban retail construction in the 1970s and 1980s reduced Downtown's importance in terms of retail activity.&lt;ref name="Study11" /&gt;

On April 5, 1986, the entire Downtown area was transformed as part of a concert by French musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]]. Called [[Rendez-Vous Houston]], the open-air show used the skyscrapers as giant projection screens, and as launchpads for fireworks.

In the 1960s, downtown comprised a modest collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown into one of the largest [[skyline]]s in the United States. In 1960, the central business district had 10 million square feet (930,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of office space, increasing to about 16&amp;nbsp;million square feet (1,500,000&amp;nbsp;m²) in 1970. Downtown Houston was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with 8.7&amp;nbsp;million square feet (800,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of office space planned or under construction and huge projects being launched by [[real estate developer]]s. The largest proposed development was the 32-block [[Houston Center]]. Only a small part of the original proposal was ultimately constructed, however. Other large projects included the Cullen Center, Allen Center, and towers for [[Shell Oil Company]]. The surge of skyscrapers mirrored the skyscraper booms in other cities, such as Los Angeles and [[Dallas]]. Houston experienced another downtown construction spurt in the 1970s with the energy industry boom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[File:Chase Tower, a block away.jpg|150px|thumb|[[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]]]]
The first major skyscraper to be constructed in Houston was the 50-floor, 218&amp;nbsp;m (714&amp;nbsp;ft) [[One Shell Plaza]] in 1971. A succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s, culminating with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, 305&amp;nbsp;m (1,002&amp;nbsp;ft) [[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]] (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), which was completed in 1982. In 2002, it was the tallest structure in Texas, ninth-tallest building in the United States, and the 23rd tallest skyscraper in the world. In 1983, the 71-floor, 296&amp;nbsp;m (970&amp;nbsp;ft) [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Houston)|Wells Fargo Plaza]] was completed, which became the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas, and 11th-tallest in the country. Skyscraper construction in downtown Houston came to an end in the mid-1980s with the collapse of Houston's energy industry and the resulting economic recession.

Twelve years later, the Houston-based [[Enron Corporation]] began constructing a 40-floor, 1,284,013sq.ft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1500 Louisiana St|url=https://www.credifi.com/ui/freemium/propertydetails/1500-Louisiana-St-Houston-TX/552e5ac5cbda711f18d1c172|website=CrediFi|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; skyscraper in 1999 (which was completed in 2002)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/US/TX/HoustonEnronSouth.html Architecture of Enron Center South – Houston, Texas, United States of America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with the company collapsing in one of the most dramatic corporate failures in the history of the United States only two years later.

Other smaller office structures were built in the 2000–2003 period.

Notable buildings that form Houston's downtown skyline:

* The [[Sweeney, Coombs, and Fredericks Building]] is a late Victorian commercial building with a 3-story corner turret and Eastlake decorative elements that was designed by George E. Dickey in 1889. Evidence indicates that the 1889 construction may have been a renovation of an 1861 structure built by William A. Van Alstyne and purchased in 1882 by John Jasper Sweeney and Edward L. Coombs.  Gus Fredericks joined the Sweeney and Coombs Jewelry firm before 1889.  The building is on the corner of Main Street and Congress Street at 301 Main Street.  The jewelry firm is still in business.  It is one of the very few Victorian structures in the Bayou City.

* The [[Hobby Center for the Performing Arts]] was started in 2000 and completed in 2002.
* The Lyric Centre, named for its adjacency to the Theater District.
* The [[Carter Building (Houston)|Carter Building]], once the tallest building in Texas, more recently re-purposed as a hotel.

'''Eduardo Eurnekian''' ({{lang-arm|Էդուարդո Էռնեկյան}}; born 1932) is an Argentine [[billionaire]] businessman of Armenian descent. As of March 2013, he is the second richest person in Argentina.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

==Early life==
Eduardo Eurnekian was born to Armenian immigrant parents on 4 December 1932. His family established a textile manufacturer which prospered with the [[Argentine economy]] and became an important supplier to international sporting apparel firm [[Puma AG|Puma]]; but which, like many Argentine textile makers, nearly collapsed after Economy Minister [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]]'s round of [[free trade]] and deregulatory policies led to a severe crisis, in 1981.&lt;ref name=cilicia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cilicia.com/armo22_eduardo_eurnekian.html |title=Eduardo Eurnekian |publisher=cilicia.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The Eurnekian family reportedly borrowed heavily from the former Argentine small business lender, BANADE, and in 1988, Eduardo Eurnekian purchased "Cablevisión S.A," then a failing local [[cable tv]] station. His investment became increasingly lucrative following Economy Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]]'s implementation of the [[Argentine Currency Board|Convertibility Plan]] in 1991, which brought financial and price stability to Argentina during the 1990s. Eurnekian in 1994 sold a 51% stake in Cablevision S.A. (by then Argentina's second-largest cable operator), to [[Tele-Communications Inc.]] for US$350&amp;nbsp;million and in 1997, netted US$320&amp;nbsp;million by selling most of his remaining shares to local investment giant CEI Citicorp Holdings SA.&lt;ref name=cilicia/&gt;

Eurnekian also held controlling interest in "América TV", four radio stations and a Buenos Aires financial daily, ''[[El Cronista]]''. "[[Aeropuertos Argentina 2000]]," a consortium led by Eurnekian won a 30-year concession in 1998 to run 33 of the Argentina's main airports. He also bought the [[Howard Johnson's]] master franchise in Argentina from [[Cendant]], and invested in a regional airline company, [[Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas|LAPA]].&lt;ref name=cilicia/&gt;

==Investments in Armenia==
On 17 December 2001, Eurnekian's [[Corporación América]] signed a 30-year concession agreement with the [[Armenian government]] for the management of operations of [[Zvartnots International Airport]], which is Armenia's largest airport.&lt;ref name="rferl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2001/12/2-TCA/tca-181201.asp |title= Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Newsline 2001-12-18 |publisher=rferl.org|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company launched the construction of a new [[Airport terminal|terminal]] which brought the airport into conformity with international standards. The total cost of the project was more than $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="hyeforum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyeforum.com/index.php?showtopic=6029 |title= HyeForum - Argentine Tycoon Ernekian To Manage Zvartnots Airport |publisher=hyeforum.com|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurnekian also unveiled plans to invest millions of dollars into Armenia's agribusiness sector as he set up a [[joint venture]] with a local firm. Senior executives from ''Tierras de Armenia'', a [[Yerevan]]-based company belonging to Eurnekian, and the Max Group (owned by [[Harutiun Pambukian]], a parliamentarian close to former President [[Robert Kocharian]]), reported a US$25&amp;nbsp;million joint venture to develop 60&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (24&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of arid land in the southern [[Armavir (province)|Armavir]] region into fruit orchards and a fruit processing plant.

Eurnekian has built an almost $1&amp;nbsp;billion media empire since the early 1990s and is now the majority owner of a consortium operating 76 airports worldwide, mostly across Argentina and elsewhere in South America as well as in Armenia. He also owns 2,000 square kilometres of land and food processing factories in northern Argentina. He has been awarded as the "Business Man of the year" in 1995. In 1999 he received in Italy the "Leonardo Award", given to the foreign businessman of the year. He also received the highest awards in Armenia for his activities.&lt;ref name=cilicia/&gt; In 2012 he was awarded the Business for Peace award in Oslo, Norway.&lt;ref name="businessforpeace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessforpeace.no/2012-honourees/|title=Unsupported Browser|publisher=businessforpeace.no|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Eurnekian is single, and his "chosen successor" is his nephew Martin Eurnekian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-10/argentine-billionaire-to-pass-baton-to-nephew-with-airport-ipo|title=Argentine Billionaire to Pass Baton to Nephew in Airport IPO|author= Charlie Devereux |date=10 January 2018 |website=www.bloomberg.com |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-22/how-a-billionaire-argentine-family-manages-succession-and-strife|title=How a Billionaire Argentine Family Manages Succession and Strife|author= Tom Metcalf

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17596">'''Educator effectiveness''' is a [[K–12 (education)|K-12 school system]] education policy initiative that measures the quality of an [[Teacher|educator]] performance in terms of improving student learning. It describes a variety of methods, such as observations, student assessments, student work samples and examples of teacher work, that education leaders use to determine the effectiveness of a K-12 educator.

The drive for educator effectiveness programs stem from [[Race to the top]] where states were awarded points for meeting educational policies based on the teacher's effectiveness. This policy was the basis of the emergence of statewide educator effectiveness programs.

Educator effectiveness programs vary from state to state.  Typically, an educator effectiveness program describes a cycle of observations and assessments that apply to different groups of teachers during an academic year. New teachers are evaluated more frequently, and veteran teachers are evaluated across multiple year cycles. Evaluated teachers have multiple scheduled classroom observations and conferences with the evaluator in addition to unannounced classroom observations. A controversial aspect of  The purpose of evaluations is to help educators determine what is effective in their practices and provides them a medium to reflect upon and change their practice to help teachers become more effective.

== Definition ==
Educator effectiveness is a method used in the K-12 school system that uses multiple measures of assessments including classroom observations, student work samples, assessment scores and teacher artifacts, to determine the impact a particular teacher has on student's learning outcomes. While schools have used teacher evaluation practices and policies for many years, the emergence of educator effectiveness policies combines these existing practices with rubrics and test scores to provide more robust perspectives on the work of teachers. Educator effectiveness initiatives often use descriptions of effective teaching practices, such as [[Charlotte Danielson]]'s "Framework for Teaching", to organize teaching separate domains for assessment. Danielson's domains include: Planning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Professional Responsibilities, and Instruction.

== Purpose ==
Teacher evaluations have changed over time and have had different standards across the United States. Evaluation systems often have been comprised an administrator observing a teacher a couple times per year. In some locations, teacher observations were only done on a three-year or longer cycle. In the past, a Widget Effect, as described by [[The New Teacher Project]] has been established that has developed a culture where all teachers feel as though they deserve the highest marks on evaluations. Schools used to see their job as filling positions and thought that any teacher who was given a license was high quality, and thus scored them according to that thought process. Therefore, all teachers were getting scores that were good or great and no variation was able to be determined between any two teachers.

Today, federal and state policies have encouraged school systems to design more comprehensive evaluation systems that rely on multiple measures of how a teacher performs by looking at items such as student performance gains, classroom observations, teacher reflections, content specific knowledge and student reflections. Some policy makers and researchers encourage the design of systems to identify and sort good and bad teachers; others are designed to provide meaningful feedback and professional development to teachers in order to enhance their skills.

Overall, the purpose of educator effectiveness is to build the capacity for teachers to enhance their skills. The effective teachers have an effect on student's ability to have a higher level of conceptual understanding of a topic and have displayed the ability to think more abstractly than peers taught by less effective teachers. Quality teaching also has been identified as a key influence for positive learning outcomes for the diverse body of students in the classroom.

== How it is being used ==
As of 2013, US schools United States had very little cohesiveness in their teacher effectiveness requirements and implementations. In 2013, 25 states required that student achievement is a big or the biggest part of teacher evaluations. Twenty-seven states required teacher evaluations be based on a variety of student assessments and work samples and 44 states required classroom observations to be put into teacher evaluations. Overall, 11 states require a statewide teacher evaluation system; 10 states gave a statewide evaluation model that districts can either do or decide to do a similar model. To date only a small handful of states have adopted policies connecting the performance of students to their teachers and the colleges where the teachers were trained.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S. (2013).  State of the States 2013: Connect the Dots – Using evaluations of teacher effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Washington, D.C. The National Council on Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have national policies that decide what teacher evaluation systems that schools will have to follow. Some countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], Iceland, Norway and [[Sweden]] provide annual feedback on teaching practices. Other countries, such as Norway and Iceland leave the decision about how the teacher evaluations systems will be done to be determined at a local level. The quality of teaching in these countries is compared to the curriculum they follow and with the school instructional plan. Finland does not use any standardized testing as a measure of teacher effectiveness. Singapore is another country that does not use test scores but rather focuses on how teachers work together as a main part of their evaluation system. Singapore also focuses heavily on professional development around evaluation, coaching, mentoring and collaborating with other educators with an overall goal of getting a high quality teaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T. (2013, March 25). How Do High-Performing Nations Evaluate Teachers? - NEA Today. Retrieved April 22, 2015, from http://neatoday.org/2013/03/25/how-do-high-performing-nations-evaluate-teachers/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant debate in the U.S. about how to reward teachers for performance as measured by educator effectiveness policies. Some schools rewards teachers by paying them more based upon their student's test scores, which is linked to the Race to the Top funding in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, J. (2004). Pay based on test scores? What educators need to know about linking teacher pay to student achievement. National Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other reward systems are being created based on the idea that improving a teacher's capacity to learn and improve upon their practice will have a direct impact on student achievement. These schools increase pay for teachers who have a  National Board Certification using [[National Board for Professional Teaching Standards]], advanced degrees, engaging in professional development, mentor new colleagues and paying more for these qualified teachers in hard to staff schools &lt;ref&gt;Flannery, M.E. &amp; Jehlen, A. (2008). Where is your pay plan heading? National Education Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection of teacher effectiveness and merit pay varies in different countries. In Finland and Canada, they do not to use merit-pay approaches but encourage conversations between the evaluator and teacher about student progress and success. In contrast, Chinese and Singaporean teachers, get financial bonuses and promotions for high performance. High-performing countries have a strong system of professional and school-level accountability but look at success on things such as school improvement goals, professional contributions, and indicators of student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, V. (2010). Raising Teacher Quality Around the World. Educational Leadership, 68(4), 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods of evaluating teachers ===
Most educator effectiveness programs rely two kinds of data: observations of teaching practices and student outcomes data. There are four main sources of observational data collected by schools:
# Classroom observations happen when someone comes into a teacher's classroom to observe their teaching practice, typically done by a school administrator. The methods of commenting on teaching practice within classroom observations varies from district created to purchased evaluation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some schools use Self-Evaluation as a reflective tool for teachers to look at their current practice and change what they are doing to have a greater educational impact on students. Teachers often use a variety of tools to reflect and change their practice including self-monitoring, recording their own practice, and student's feedback through survey's and questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2015). Self-Evaluation of Teaching. Ryerson University: The Learning and Teaching Office.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Teacher Portfolios are used to compile a variety of evidence of teacher practices for the purpose of showing development of teaching over time. It is often used in conjunction with self-reflection or peer-reviewing of teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching. (2015) Teaching Portfolios from http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/teaching-portfolios/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Peer-Review of Teaching is a method for teaching to discuss their practice with another teacher or group of teachers that gives feedback about teaching and learning. Often an evaluation of the teaching materials is done with the purpose of providing feedback to change teaching practices.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Teaching and Learning (2015). Peer Review of Teaching.  University of Minnesota from http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/teachlearn/resources/peer/&lt;/ref&gt;

The new part of educator effectiveness policies is the integration of outcome data into the evaluation process. The biggest component of the outcome data is growth of student learning as measured by standardized tests. Most educator effectiveness programs rely on some form of value-added measures to determine student growth. Value-added measure use longitudinal measures of student achievement to estimate the growth in student learning that can be attributed to individual teachers. If the students of a specific teacher demonstrate growth in learning better than predicated on standardized tests, the teacher is said to be effective; if the students score below the predicted scores, the teacher is said to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Goe, L. &amp; Croft, A. (2008). Methods of Evaluating Teacher Effectiveness. Research-to-Practice Brief. National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality.&lt;/ref&gt;  Parent and student surveys are another method of collecting data on teachers and their educational practices.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching and Learning Center (2015).  General Education Improvement. University of the Science from http://www.usciences.edu/teaching/tips/improvement.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Many argue that it is difficult to measure the effect that teachers have on student learning. Many teachers who are in the K-12 system, teach subjects that are not assessed on state mandated testing. In order to effectively implement an educator effectiveness system, some argue that states need to create different evaluation systems for the teachers who teach students in non-tested areas such as submitted portfolios of student work, lesson logs, video clips of them teaching and reflective commentaries on lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue about the methodology as some districts are using value added models to determine the effectiveness to teachers. They state that it is an unreliable measurement tool because the makeup of classes differ greatly from teacher to teacher and from year to year. Some say that it ends up penalizing teachers who traditionally do not score well on standardized assessments such as students who receive free and reduce lunch and students with disabilities. They state that this may cause the highly effective teachers to work at schools with a low disability rate and a middle to high socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;Darling-Hammond, . (2012). Creating a comprehensive system for evaluating and supporting effective teaching. Stanford, CA. Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education.&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways to calculate the value-added effect of teachers that changes depending on how they define value-added and what they use to calculate it.  It typically does not account for the expectations put on students who go into a classroom reading below grade level and are expected to have a much higher growth rate than their peers.  Through many research studies, it has shown that the estimates of teacher effectiveness were not through the same throughout different years or content areas  such as reading and math and may be difficult to compare gains from tests from year to year when they don't measure the same content &lt;ref&gt;David, J.L ( 2010). What research says about using value-added measures to evaluate teachers. Educational Leadership (67)8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have commented that evaluators in states with teacher evaluation systems do not have through enough training. Furthermore, these evaluators often do not have to prove themselves as effective teachers themselves. As of 2013, only 13 states require a certification for their evaluators that require evaluators are effective teachers. Furthermore, often the same evaluator is observing students every time. In order to have high quality teacher feedback, some would argue that multiple perspectives by highly effective educators would create the dialogue and feedback that would help teachers to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, K.M &amp; Jacobs, S.

The "Fast Five" were a group of publicly traded [[Consultant|consulting]] firms that developed in the mid 1990s to capitalize on the rapid commercial development of the [[Internet]]. 
The term "Fast Five" was coined to draw a contrast with the established [[Big Eight auditors#Big_5_.281998-2001.29|"Big Five"]] accounting firms with
management consulting arms, and to make the point that the new breed of consulting firms was more nimble and could produce more [[rapid results]].

== Business performance and rapid growth ==

The firms innovative in both technology and methodology, developing new techniques better adapted for Web site design and construction, along with back-end internet infrastructure.  For example, [[Viant]] created a service model to obtain maximum utilization of the three essential disciplines (Creative, Business Strategists, and Technical professionals/software developers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viant Powers Della &amp; James for E-commerce success|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=59596|publisher=PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliverables move forward based on team consensus, with input from all three disciplines.  Prior to the service model, most professional services firms utilized a [[waterfall model]] of [[Software development|system development]] where results from one phase were thrown "over the wall" with limit input from the team that would handle the next phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANDERSEN CONSULTING LAUNCHES FOUNDATION SOFTWARE ORGANIZATION; CREATES WORLD'S LARGEST ENTERPRISE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ANDERSEN+CONSULTING+LAUNCHES+FOUNDATION+SOFTWARE+ORGANIZATION%3B...-a017599219|accessdate=20 July 2010|newspaper=Business Wire|date=13 Oct 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinctive cultures ==
Most of the firms felt a need to differentiate themselves in their approach to employees and their appearance to clients.  Razorfish created uniquely styled business cards.  VIANT had strong ideas about office space needing to be located around the energy of a downtown area of a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing a Business-Driven, Outcomes-Focused Talent Strategy |url=http://www.hda.co.uk/candidate/images/misc/careermanagement/29520071310HDA%20Talent%20Presentation.pdf |author=KAY THORNE |author2=CLAYTON GLEN |pages=57–64 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309090536/http://www.hda.co.uk/candidate/images/misc/careermanagement/29520071310HDA%20Talent%20Presentation.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Welles |first=Edward O |title=New Economy, New Culture |url=http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18816661;jsessionid=T3G2OQKYPTL1LQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN |accessdate=19 July 2010 |newspaper=CRN - computer reseller news |date=1 Dec 1999 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staff and knowledge management ==
Another area of innovation was in knowledge management.  The firms created internal [[intranets]], office spaces, and organizational incentives and structures designed to encourage information sharing, as opposed to [[knowledge hoarding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Thomas A|title=The Wealth of Knowledge: Intellectual Capital and the Twenty-first Century Organization  |year=2003|isbn=978-0-385-50072-2|pages=207–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viant ===
Viant's office space was created with [[Dunbar's number]] in mind, so that an office that grew to over 100 consultants would 'spawn' a new office with a small nucleus of experienced consultants.  The goal was to limit the size of any one office to no more than 125 to 130 consultants, keeping the total number in the office well below Dunbar's estimate of 150.  The effect was that each consultant in the office could maintain stable social relationships with everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welles|first=Ed|title=Mind gains|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/19991201/15700_pagen_3.html|publisher=Inc. magazine|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rapid business growth ==
The firms grew rapidly, often increasing their annual revenues and staff at over 100% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malik|first=Om|title=VIANT: We Only Do Digital|url=https://www.forbes.com/1999/02/17/feat_print.html|accessdate=19 July 2010|newspaper=Forbes (magazine)|date=17 Feb 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decline during the Dot-com downturn ==
Despite the aggressive growth of their businesses, most of the firms stock prices and prospects collapsed by late 2000 or early 2001, due to the collapse of the Internet bubble as well as increased competition from the "Big Five" and other established technology consulting firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green |first=Heather |title=A web hotshot learns humility |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_12/b3724635.htm |accessdate=19 July 2010 |newspaper=Business Week |date=19 March 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204155047/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_12/b3724635.htm |archivedate=4 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A '''gentlemen's agreement''' or '''gentleman's agreement''' is an informal and legally non-binding [[wikt:agreement|agreement]] between two or more parties. It is typically oral, though it may be written, or simply understood as part of an unspoken agreement by convention or through mutually beneficial [[etiquette]]. The essence of a gentlemen's agreement is that it relies upon the [[honor]] of the parties for its fulfillment, rather than being in any way enforceable. It is, therefore, distinct from a [[contract|legal agreement or contract]], which can be enforced if necessary.

==History==
The phrase appears in British Parliamentary records of 1821,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Royal Commission of the Press |volume=2 |author= Great Britain. Parliament |publisher= G.E. Eyre and W. Spottiswoode, printers to the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty |year= 1812 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ChY0AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22gentlemen%27s+agreement%22&amp;dq=%22gentlemen%27s+agreement%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mFH6Uvn2DYjprAGn9YGADw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjiqAQ |page= 267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Massachusetts public records of 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Public documents of Massachusetts |volume=4 |author= Massachusetts |year= 1835 |page= 150 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b3tKAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22gentlemen%27s+agreement%22&amp;dq=%22gentlemen%27s+agreement%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mFH6Uvn2DYjprAGn9YGADw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBTiqAQ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] cites [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s 1929 story collection ''[[Mr Mulliner Speaking]]'' as the first appearance of the term.&lt;ref&gt;"gentleman, n.". OED Online. December 2013. Oxford University Press. 11 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
A gentleman's agreement, defined in the early 20th century as "an agreement between gentlemen looking toward the control of prices," was reported by one source to be the loosest form of a "[[pooling (resource management)|pool]]".&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book

A report from the [[United States House of Representatives]] detailing their investigation of the [[United States Steel Corporation]] asserted that there were two general types of loose associations or [[Consolidation (business)|consolidations]] between steel and iron interests in the 1890s, in which the individual concerns retained ownership as well as a large degree of independence: the "pool" and the "gentleman's agreement".&lt;ref name="United States House of Representatives"&gt;{{cite book

===International relations===
Intense anti-Japanese sentiment developed on the West Coast. US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] did not want to anger Japan by passing legislation to bar Japanese immigration to the US, as had been done for Chinese immigration. Instead, there was an informal [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|"Gentlemen's Agreement" (1907–8)]] between the United States and Japan, whereby Japan made sure there was very little or no movement to the US. The agreements were made by Secretary of State, [[Elihu Root]], and Japan's Foreign Minister, [[Tadasu Hayashi]]. The agreement banned emigration of Japanese laborers to the US and rescinded the segregation order of the San Francisco School Board in [[California]], which had humiliated and angered the Japanese. The agreement did not apply to the [[Territory of Hawaii]], which was treated at the time as separate and distinct from the US. The agreements remained effective until 1924, when Congress forbade all immigration from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Carl R. Weinberg, "The 'Gentlemen's Agreement' of 1907-08," ''OAH Magazine of History'' (2009) 23#4 pp 36-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade policies===
Gentlemen's agreements have come to regulate international activities such as the coordination of [[monetary policy|monetary]] or [[trade policy|trade policies]].&lt;ref name="Oda"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kotera |first=Akira  |editor-last=Oda
|editor-first=Hiroshi |title=Law and Politics of West-East Technology Transfer |volume=1988 |year=1991 |publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]] |isbn= 9780792309901 |pages=34–38 |chapter=Western Export Controls Affecting the Eastern Bloc }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edmund Osmańczyk]] in the ''Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements'', it is also defined as "an international term for an agreement made orally rather than in writing, yet fully legally valid".&lt;ref name="Osmańczyk"&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmańczyk |first=Edmund Jan |authorlink=Edmund Osmańczyk |editor-last=Mango |editor-first=Anthony |title=Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements: G to M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSIMXHMdfkkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 28, 2010 |edition=Third |volume=2: G-M |year=2003 |publisher=[[Routledge]]
|location=[[New York (state)|New York]] |page=792 |chapter=|chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of agreement may allow a nation to avoid the domestic legal requirements to enter into a formal [[treaty]],&lt;ref name="Oda"/&gt; or it may be useful when a government wants to enter into a secret agreement that is not binding upon the next administration.&lt;ref name="Shafritz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shafritz |first=Jay M. |title=The Dictionary of Public Policy and Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6hMfnoJJSkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |location=[[Boulder, Colorado]] |isbn= 9780813342603 |page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another author, all international agreements are gentlemen's agreements because, short of war, they are ''all'' unenforceable.&lt;ref name="Shafritz"/&gt; Osmańczyk pointed out that there is a difference between open gentlemen's agreements and secret diplomatic agreements.&lt;ref name="Osmańczyk"/&gt; In the [[United States]], a prohibition against gentlemen's agreements in commercial relations between states was introduced in 1890, because the secretive nature of such agreements was beyond anyone's control.&lt;ref name="Osmańczyk"/&gt;

In [[English contract law]], for an agreement to be binding, there must be an [[Intention to be legally bound|intention to create legal relations]]; but in commercial dealings (i.e. agreements that are not between family members or friends) there is a legal presumption of an "intention to create legal relations".  However, in the 1925 case of ''[[Rose &amp; Frank Co v JR Crompton &amp; Bros Ltd]]'', the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that the phrase, "This arrangement is not ... a formal or legal agreement ... but is only a record of the intention of the parties" was sufficient to rebut the said presumption.&lt;ref&gt;Rose &amp; Frank Co v JR Crompton &amp; Bros Ltd [1925] AC 445 HL, [1924] UKHL 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a discriminatory tactic===
{{see also|Old boys network}}
Gentlemen's agreements were a widely used [[discriminatory]] tactic reportedly more common than [[restrictive covenants]] in preserving the homogeneity of [[upper-class]] neighborhoods and suburbs in the United States.&lt;ref name="Higley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Higley |first=Stephen Richard |title=Privilege, Power, and Place: The Geography of the American Upper Class|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WCJTNLyee-kC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 28, 2010 |year=1995 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location=[[Lanham, Maryland]] |isbn= 9780847680214 |pages=40–41, 61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of these agreements made them extremely difficult to prove or to track, and were effective long after the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s rulings in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' and ''[[Barrows v. Jackson]]''.&lt;ref name="Higley"/&gt; One source states that gentlemen's agreements "undoubtedly still exist", but that their use has greatly diminished.&lt;ref name="Higley"/&gt;

Until [[Jackie Robinson]] was hired by the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1946, a gentlemen's agreement ensured that [[African American]] players were [[baseball color line|excluded from organized baseball]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Jeremi Duru, ''Friday Night ‘Lite’: How De-Racialization in the Motion Picture Friday Night Lights Disserves the Movement to Eradicate Racial Discrimination from American Sport'', 25 CARDOZO ARTS &amp; ENT. L.J. 485, 530 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a net worth of $21.9 billion as of June 2018, according to Bloomberg.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Farigliano]], Italy, the son of [[Maria Franca Fissolo]] and [[Michele Ferrero]], the owner of the multinational confectionery corporation Ferrero.

'''''Holiday Island''''' is a [[Business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] developed by German games design company [[Sunflowers Interactive Entertainment Software|Sunflower]]. Much of the game play involves juggling funds to build hotels, accommodation, leisure activities and restaurants. The number and location of these is important, as is the interconnectivity between different facilities. There are also other people like the player constructing and starting businesses in the island. The player can hire a Mafia style hitman to ruin the other people's businesses.

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also awards a ''Seal of Approval'' that companies may display in their promotional materials if the colour ranges they use are appraised by the ICA.

ICA forecasts were launched in 1968.

The selection is published 22 months ahead of the retail selling season, thus constituting the earliest colour trend prediction available to the [[furniture]] design and [[textile industry|textile]] industries. Nowadays the ICA is one of the leading colour forecasters for the industry, along with the [[Color Marketing Group]]. Their products are ''"high-quality forecast publications containing an abundance of accurate information on market trends"'', which ranks them among ''"the favourite publications of many professionals"'', according to an article published by the [[International Trade Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tradeforum.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/418/Don%92t_Be_Off-colour.html Don't Be Off-colour]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". ''International Trade Forum'', '''1''' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Colours in the ICA colour guides are referenced using the [[Pantone]] standard, the [[Natural Color System]] (NCS) standard, or both.

ICA has now launched an online service through which subscribers can download the forecasts, and is creating an online newsletter, World Colour News.

'''International Workers' Olympiads''' were an international sporting event arranged between 1925 and 1937 by [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]] (SASI). It was an organisation supported by [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties and [[International Federation of Trade Unions]]. Workers' Olympiads were an alternate event for the [[Olympic Games]]. The participants were members of various labor sports associations and came mostly from Europe.&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/story/2012/08/01/workers-olympics |title= A workers' Olympics? |publisher= Workers' Liberty |date=1 August 2012 | language = |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays [http://www.csit.tv/en/world-sports-games the CSIT World Sports Games] are the successor sports events of the International Workers' Olympiads. The "World Sports Games" is the main highlight and a new Brand of the [[International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation|CSIT]]. It is a unique major sports event for thousands of workers and amateurs every two years. [[International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation|The CSIT (International Workers and Amateurs in Sports Confederation)]] is an international Multi-Sports Organization.

== History ==
[[File:Opening march 1931 Vienna.JPG|thumb|Opening march of the 1931 Workers' Olympiad in Vienna.]]
The Workers' Olympiads were created as a counterweight for the Olympic Games, which were criticized for being confined for the upper social classes and privileged people. The international workers' sports movement did not believe that the true Olympic spirit could be achieved in an Olympic movement dominated by the aristocratic leadership. [[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the [[International Olympic Committee]], had always opposed women's participation and supported the cultural superiority of white Europeans over other races. His followers, [[Henri de Baillet-Latour]] and [[Avery Brundage]], were openly anti-semitic and both collaborated with the Nazis. On the contrary, the Workers' Olympiads opposed all kinds of chauvinism, sexism, racism and social exclusiveness. The Olympic Games were based in rivalry between the nations, but the Workers' Olympiads stressed internationalism, friendship, solidarity and peace.&lt;ref name=riordan&gt;Riordan, James: ″Sport, Politics, and Communism″, p. 38–40. Manchester University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|978-071-90285-0-2}}. [https://books.google.fi/books?id=Rc1RAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=1921+olympiad+prague&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qmua0exF57&amp;sig=OYtYQPyvi6_UKl2nqH2hz3z6wpk&amp;hl=fi&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m9BjVaTNFYqesAHd0YHQBg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lucerne Sport International]] (later known as Socialist Workers' Sport International) was established in [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]] in 1920. The first unofficial Workers' Olympiads were held a year later in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. The IOC had banned the losing side of the [[World War I]] from the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] (Germany even from the 1924 games), but the Workers's Olympiads were open for the "enemy" side as well. The number of participating countries was thirteen. The first official Worker's Olympiads were the 1925 winter games in the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Schreiberhau]], which today is a part of [[Poland]]. They were followed by the first Summer Olympiads in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref name=riordan/&gt; 

National flags were not used, but a red flag of international workers' movement.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt; The best athletes were awarded with diplomas, they did not receive medals like in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.helsinki.fi/shentila/files/2005/04/TUL_ja-kansainv%C3%A4linen.pdf Hentilä, Seppo: ″Työväen Urheiluliitto ja kansainvälinen työläisurheilu″] (in Finnish). University of Helsinki. Retrieved 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The visiting athletes stayed mostly at private accommodation of local families.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;

International Workers' Olympiads were more than just a games for the top athletes. The festival was based on a mass participation, it did not restrict entry on the grounds of sporting ability. [[1931 Workers' Summer Olympiad]] in [[Vienna]] was the largest event with the participation of 100,000 athletes from 26 countries. The Vienna Workers' Olympiad attracted some 250,000 spectators. It was much bigger event than the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] at [[Los Angeles]], both in number of participants as well as spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcn.bc.ca/outlook/library/articles/jewsontheleft/p05SocialistSports.htm Roni Gechtman: "Socialist Sports in Yiddish – The Bundist Sport Organization Morgnshtern in Interwar Poland".] Retrieved 2 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praterstadion]] (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion) was constructed between 1929 and 1931 for the 1931 Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien.gv.at/freizeit/sportamt/annodazumal/sportstaetten/stadion.html |title= Wiener Praterstadion - Ernst-Happel-Stadion - Historische Sportstätte der Stadt Wien |publisher= City of Vienna |date= | language = German|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Workers' Olympiad at [[Antwerp]] in 1937 was a joint event with the [[Red Sport International]] organized [[Spartakiads]].&lt;ref&gt;John Nauright &amp; Charles Parrish (ed.): "Sports Around the World – History, Culture and Practice" (p. 463).

'''Issad Rebrab''' (born 1944), is an Algerian [[billionaire]] businessman, CEO of the [[Cevital]] industrial group, the largest private company in Algeria, active in steel, food, agribusiness and electronics.

According to ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'', Rebrab is the ninth richest person in Africa, with an estimated net worth of US$4.31 billion, as of June 2017.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|title=Issad Rebrab|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/issad-rebrab/|website=Forbes|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
After graduating from a professional school, Rebrab taught accounting and commercial law. He soon left teaching, and started his own accounting firm.

==Career==
His industrial career started in 1971, when one of his clients proposed he take shares in a metallurgical construction company. He took 20% of the shares in Sotecom. After that, he created other companies in the steel industry: Profilor in 1975 and Metal Sider in 1988.

In 1995, his main installations were destroyed in a terrorist attack. After he recognized the risks of staying, Rebrab decided to leave Algeria. He came back in 1998 with Cevital, the biggest group in agricultural business, which later became the largest private Algerian company. Cevital owns one of the largest sugar refineries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nsehe|first1=Mfonobong|title=Algeria's Richest Man Issad Rebrab to Construct $150 Million Sugar Refinery in Sri Lanka|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2016/10/15/algerias-richest-man-issad-rebrab-to-construct-150-million-sugar-refinery-in-sri-lanka/#a971be64eea2|website=Forbes|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Rebrab acquired El Khabar media group, for $45 million. This was his second investment into media, as he already owns the French-Algerian daily paper ''Liberte''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nsehe|first1=Mfonobong|title=Algeria's Richest Man Issad Rebrab Acquires Newspaper Publisher|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2016/04/12/algerias-richest-man-issad-rebrab-acquires-newspaper-publisher/#539a6c9b22eb|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebrab is listed on the Bloomberg Billionaires index, and is currently valued at $4.28 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomberg Billionaires Index: Issad Rebrab|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/issad-rebrab/|website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1998) Nr 22-25. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Writings ===
Collins has authored or co-authored six books based on his research, including the classic ''[[Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies]]'', a fixture on the ''[[Business Week]]'' best-seller list for more than six years, which has been translated into 25 languages.  His most recent book is ''Great by Choice''. Before that he wrote ''How the Mighty Fall: And Why Some Companies Never Give In''.

=== Level 5 leader ===
Collins often discusses a "Level 5 leader" in his writings.  This refers to the peak of a five-tier hierarchy of [[leadership]] characteristics presented in the books.  A Level 5 Leader is someone who embodies a “paradoxical mix of personal humility and professional will&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/level-5-leadership.htm|title=Level 5 Leadership: Achieving "Greatness" as a Leader|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.”

=== ''Test Pilot'' ===
Collins re-published an autobiography called ''Test Pilot'' ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co.]], 1935), written by his grandfather Jimmy Collins, after whom Collins is named. Jimmy Collins was the chief test pilot for the [[Grumman]] military aircraft company during the 1930s, and [[Clark Gable]] portrayed him in the movie version of his book. Jimmy Collins died in a crash while testing the [[Grumman F3F|F3 biplane]], having predicted and described his death before it happened&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.strategy-business.com/article/14367?gko=63ad3|title=Climbing to Greatness with Jim Collins|last=Kleiner|first=Art|work=strategy+business|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The foundation of a formal school for these disciplines in 2000 also established a larger range of courses and subjects at both Campuses.&lt;ref name="schoolhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.it.jcu.edu.au/general-info/school.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831183432/http://www.it.jcu.edu.au/general-info/school.shtml |archivedate=31 August 2005 |title=JCU School of Information Technology |accessdate=2005-08-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facilities for the school were housed in the Tropical Environmental Sciences and Geography (TESAG) building until the merger with the School Maths and Physical Sciences in 2006 when the school was entirely moved to the nearby building 17. In January 2009 the former School of Information Technology was detached from The School of Maths and Physical Sciences and merged with the School of Business as part of a large restructuring of James Cook University.
It's one of the best universities in the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4077">The '''Joint Forum''' (previously known as '''The Joint Forum on Financial Conglomerates''') is an international group bringing together financial regulatory representatives from [[banking]], [[insurance]] and [[securities]].  It works under the international bodies for these sectors, the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] (BCBS), the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) and the [[International Association of Insurance Supervisors]] (IAIS).  The group develops guidance, principles and identifies best practices that are of common interest to all three sectors.

It was initially set up in response to an increasing number of large financial organisations providing services in all three sectors  across multiple countries.  Today the Forum deals with issues that are common to all three sectors, including [[financial regulation]] of [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s.

==History==
The Joint Forum was established in 1996, from a suggestion of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] (Basel Committee) to take forward the work of the Tripartite Group whose report was released in July 1995. The Joint Forum can trace its origins from the Tripartite Group which was formed in early 1993 to address a range of issues relating to the supervision of financial conglomerates. The Tripartite group was composed of bank, securities and insurance supervisors and looked at issues related to the supervision of large financial conglomerates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.org/bcbs/jfhistory.htm Bank of International Settlements - Joint Forum history]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and Membership==
The Joint Forum is a group of technical experts and is composed of an equal number of senior bank, insurance and securities supervisors.

Thirteen countries are represented in the Joint Forum: [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]]. The EU Commission attends in an observer capacity. The Chairmanship of the Joint Forum rotates between the three sector committees and is named for a two-year term.

A number of countries have integrated financial regulatory authorities where one organisation covers all financial regulation, including banking, insurance and securities.  In these cases this national agency is typically a member of all three international organisations and a combined Joint Forum is a natural fit with the way they operate at a national level.

'''Khagendra Chandra Das (K.C. Das)''' was a [[Bengal]]i entrepreneur and proprietor of the [[Calcutta Chemical Company]]. Under his leadership, the company became one of the most well-known businesses of the [[Swadeshi movement]], and was well-known for [[Margo (soap)]] and a number of other products. 

== Early life ==
K.C. Das was born into an affluent [[Baidya]] family in Bengal. He was the son of [[Rai Bahadur]] Tarak Chandra Das, a judge, and Mohini Devi, who was later a staunch Gandhian and Independence activist. Mohini Devi was also a former President of the [[Mahila Atma Raksha Samiti]], an organisation committed to women's self defence. Amongst his siblings, the most notable was Dr. Prabhavati Das Gupta, a graduate from [[Heidelberg University]] and a trade union activist along with her husband and Congress MP Bakar Ali Mirza. 

After completing his education in [[Calcutta]], he became a lecturer at Shibpur College (now [[Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur]]). At this time, there could be seen a substantial growth in anti-British activity in Bengal, highlighted by the growth of Revolutionary thought and action. Das got involved with a number of other youths who subscribed to this brand of thinking. His father, who was known to be close to certain officials in the British Indian government, was informed that his son would soon be arrested if he did not take any preventive action. He then encouraged his son to go abroad to pursue higher studies. Das, who wanted nothing to do with Britain, instead chose to go to the [[United States]].

== Foreign education ==

=== United States of America ===
Das sailed for the United States on a scholarship from the Indian Society for the Advancement of Scientific Industry, and enrolled at [[UC Berkeley]]. However, he and another student, S.M. Bose (later founder of Duckback Waterproof) eventually transferred to [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC19070117.2.28.8|title=San Francisco Call 17 January 1907 — California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both graduated with degrees in Chemistry in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scribbler.co/r/5690ed8f7385ab2f7c419719/bengals-long-lost-entrepreneurial-spirit|title=Bengal's Long Lost Entrepreneurial Spirit|website=www.scribbler.co|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Das was very closely involved with Indian independence activities in the United States, forming the California chapter of the [[Indian Independence League]] and working closely with [[Lala Har Dayal]]. 

=== Japan ===
Before returning to India, both Bose and Das proceeded to Japan, where each delved further into processes that would come to define their later businesses - waterproofing for Bose, and pharmaceuticals for Das.

== Calcutta Chemical Company ==

=== Establishment ===
Das, along with R.N. Sen and B.N. Maitra, incorporated the [[Calcutta Chemical Company]] in 1916. It had its registered office at 35 Panditia Road and an additional factory in [[Tiljala]]. The company was established in keeping with the prevailing air of the [[Swadeshi movement]], of which Das was a staunch supporter. He believed that one of the most important industries that was still cornered by the British was the pharmaceutical industry. 

=== Popularity ===
The company became highly successful due to its toilet products. Das perfected the process to extract the essence of the Neem plant, which he believed to be symbolic of Indian products, which led to the creation of two enduring brands - [[Margo (soap)]] and Neem toothpaste. He priced them in such a way as to allow them to be affordable to every strata of society. He also created and marketed a number of other products, including Lavender Dew Powder (for a more upmarket segment). 

With growing demand, the company expanded by creating distribution offices in all major cities in the country, and set up additional manufacturing plants in present day [[Tamil Nadu]]. The company then began international distribution in South East Asia, establishing a distribution chain in Singapore. 

By the time of Das' death in the 1960s, the company had become amongst the most well-known and recognisable businesses in the South Asian region. It was also known for the manufacture of a number of important chemical compounds that were essential to industrial processes. 

After his death, his son, Samarendra Chandra Dasgupta took over the business as Chairperson. 

== Personality ==
K.C. Das was a much beloved figure in [[Calcutta]], and was a lifelong believer in the Swadeshi philosophy and continued to be staunchly anti-British even post-Independence. Since his return from the United States and Japan, he chose to wear only [[Khadi]] clothing. 

He was immensely popular in the [[Baidya]] community as well, providing scholarships to a number of young boys who came to Calcutta for their education. He was intensely committed to the ideals of entrepreneurship, and was known to dislike the idea of 'service'. At the time of his funeral, a number of people came forward and recounted how, on his walks around the lakes in Calcutta, Das would stop them and encourage them to give up the idea of looking for a job and start something of their own - no matter how small. Often he would provide the seed capital for the ventures, and never asked for the money back.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scribbler.co/r/5690ed8f7385ab2f7c419719/bengals-long-lost-entrepreneurial-spirit|title=Bengal's Long Lost Entrepreneurial Spirit|website=www.scribbler.co|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Trivia ==
* While he was staunchly anti-British, K.C. Das' only son married the daughter of noted Solicitor Susil C. Sen [[CBE]], a lawyer who had very close ties to the British government.
*His family name is Dasgupta, but being staunchly against the caste system, his father dropped the 'Gupta' which associated them with the Baidya community. 
* K.C. Das gave an opportunity to Debu Barik, the owner of a small eatery behind Bijoli Cinema in Calcutta, to run the canteen at the [[Calcutta Chemical Company]] office in Panditia Road, recognising an entrepreneurial spark in him. That eatery is now the famous Bijoli Grill, one of the most popular restaurants for Bengali food in the country. 
* K.C. Das is the grandfather of noted columnist and [[Rajya Sabha]] MP [[Swapan Dasgupta]].

The '''KEBA Student Investor Challenge''' (in Hungarian: KEBA Tőzsdeverseny) is a national, academic competition that provides high school students (grades 9-12) with an insider's view of the global capital [[Market (economics)|markets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kebaverseny.hu/index.php/verseny-leirasa/roviden.html KEBA verseny]&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsors of the competition include prominent [[financial]] institutions in [[Hungary]] such as [[Budapest Stock Exchange]], [[Equilor Investments Ltd.]], Hungarian subsidiary of [[X-Trade Brokers]] DM SA, [[:hu:Concorde Csoport|Concorde Securities]], [[:hu:Központi Elszámolóház és Értéktár Rt.|Central Clearing House and Depository of Hungary]] and [[International Training Center for Bankers]]. KEBA Student Investor Challenge was first held in 1999 and since then it is held annually by [[Central European Training Centre for Brokers]] in association with the Hungarian subsidiary of [[Erste Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/kebaverseny/photos_albums Facebook albums]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.hu/hirdetes/a-legfiatalabb-tozsdecapak-399112 VG.hu: A legfiatalabb tőzsdecápák], 2013. 03. 05. (Hungarian news portal)&lt;/ref&gt;

KEBA Student Investor Challenge qualification round takes place over three months in which each team, consisting of three students, receive a virtual capital of $50,000 to [[trade]] with [[stocks]], commodities, [[currency]] pairs, and futures aiming to achieve as high returns as possible;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baon.hu/helyi-ertek/seta/otvenezer-dollarral-tozsdeztek-487362 BAON.hu: Ötvenezer dollárral tőzsdéztek], 2013. 03. 08.

'''Leonard John Keys''' (3 August 1880 – 1958) was a New Zealand [[bowls|lawn bowls]] player who competed for his country at the [[New Zealand at the 1934 British Empire Games|1934 British Empire Games]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24429">The '''Michelin Cup''' refers to a number of competitions sponsored by the French tyre manufacturer [[Michelin]] for long distance flight made in [[aeroplane]]s.
[[File:Coupemichelin.jpg|thumb|]]
The first Michelin prize was announced in March 1908. The principal prize, to be awarded annually for an initial period of eight years, was a prize for long distance flight, and consisted of a bronze statue as a trophy (valued at 10,000 FF-[[French francs]]) and a money prize of 20,000 FF. The flying club of the winner also received a replica of the trophy if they did not already own one. Administration and determination of the exact conditions for each year were delegated to the [[Aéro-Club de France]] (AeCF). Attempts to win the prize could be made anywhere in the world where there was a flying club associated with the AeCF.

At the same time, '''Prix d'Aviation Michelin''' was a special prize of 100,000 francs offered for a flight by an aircraft carrying a passenger, taking off from either the department of [[Seine]] or [[Seine-et-Oise]], flying over the [[Arc de Triomphe]] and the cathedral of [[Clermont-Ferrand]], and landing on the summit of the {{convert|1456|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Puy de Dôme]] inside six hours starting from the time at the Arc de Triomphe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6550620m/f125.image.r=Michelin.langEN|page=115|language=French|date=March 1908|title=La Coupe d'Aviation et les Prix d'Aviation Michelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was won by [[Eugène Renaux]] on 7 March 1911, flying a [[Farman MF.7|Maurice Farman biplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200205.html|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|date=11 March 1911|title =Renaux wins the Michelin Puy de Dome Prize|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, a second award, the '''British Empire Michelin Cup''', was announced, for flights made by aviators who were citizens of the British Empire, flying aircraft of all-British manufacture. The original award therefore became known as the '''International Michelin Cup'''.

When the prizes were first instituted, 25 [[French franc]]s were worth one [[pound Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200181.html|title=Prize Treatise on Aerial Navigation|date=27 March 1909|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Michelin Cup==

===1908===
Won by [[Wilbur Wright]] with a flight made on 31 December 1908 at [[Le Mans]] officially reckoned as {{convert|124.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The course over which the flight was made was an isosceles triangle with two sides of 1&amp;nbsp;km and a third of 200&amp;nbsp;m, totalling 2.2&amp;nbsp;km. The flight had to be made before sunset and only complete circuits counted. Wright took off at 2&amp;nbsp;pm and completed 56 circuits before sunset. He then landed, flying a further 1.5&amp;nbsp;km to set a new world distance record of 124.7&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200022.html|date=9 Jan 1924|title=Wright's Final Effort for the 1908 Michelin Prize. |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1909===
For the greatest distance exceeding 123.2&amp;nbsp;km. in a closed circuit made before the end of the year: 20,000 francs, and a bronze replica of the Michelin trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title=Michelin Cup Rules for 1909  |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200050.html|date=23 January 1909|page= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Won by [[Henry Farman]] with a flight of {{convert|234.212|km|mi|abbr=on}} lasting 4h 6m 25s made on 3 November 1909 at [[Châlons-en-Champagne|Chalons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65523525/f13.image.|title=Pour la Coupe Michelin|date=1 January 1911|page=7|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1910===
Won by [[Maurice Tabuteau]] flying a [[Farman MF.7|Maurice Farman biplane]] with a flight of {{convert|584.745|km|mi|abbr=on}}, taking 7hr 48m 36.6s at Buc on 30 December 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65523525/f32.image.n|title=La Coupe Michelin|date=1 January 1911|page=26|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1911===
In 1911, the closing date for the competition was brought forward to 31 October.

Won by E. Helen flying a [[Nieuport II]] monoplane on 8 September 1911, when he covered {{convert|1,252.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 14&amp;nbsp;hr 7&amp;nbsp;min.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200964.html|title=Helen wins Michelin Cup|date=4 November 1911|page=966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1912===
For the 1912 competition, the rules were considerably elaborated. The flight had to be made over a course made up of three different circuits, each starting from the same point. The first and third, each of about {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}}, had to have three or four compulsory landing-places, and the second, of {{convert|255|km|mi|abbr=on}}, one or two landing places. Refuelling was only allowed at the starting point of each circuit. The circuits had to be covered in order, and if a competitor landed somewhere other than a nominated airfield, they had to start that circuit again. For every 75&amp;nbsp;kg of useful load carried apart from the pilot and necessary fuel, a bonus of 25% was allowed on the time, up to a maximum of 100 per cent. The extra load could be made up of passengers or ballast. Competing aircraft had to carry a sealed [[barograph]], and an average speed of at least {{convert|40|kph|mph|abbr=on}} had to be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200179.html|title=1912 International Michelin Competition|date=24 February 1912|page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1912 prize was not won by any competitor, and the prize money was added to the prize for the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6552332d/f386.image.r=coupe%20michelin378|date=15 August 1913|title=Pour La Coupe Michelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1913===
The 1913 competition was very different. It was awarded for the greatest distance flown on a series of consecutive days, flying over a {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} course, with a compulsory landing after each circuit.

The Cup was won by Emmanuel Helen flying a Nieuport monoplane, with a total distance of {{convert|16096.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} flown between 22 October and 29 November 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title=Helen's Record for the Michelin Cup|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1913/1913%20-%201305.html|page=1331|date=6 December 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1914===
The nature of the competition was changed again for the 1914 competition, the prize being awarded for the fastest time over a circuit of about {{convert|3000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
Won by [[Eugène Gilbert]] flying a Morane-Saulnier monoplane. Starting from [[Villacoublay]] at 03:04 on 8 June 1914, he flew via [[Péronne, Somme|Peronne]], [[Rheims]], [[Saint-Dizier]], [[Gray, Haute-Saône|Gray]], [[Joigny]], [[Beaune]], [[Vienne]] and [[Nimes]], landing at [[Mirande]] before reaching [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], owing to running out of fuel. On the next day he flew via Pau, [[Saint-André-de-Cubzac|St. André de Cubzac]], [[Romorantin]], [[Angers]], [[Evreux]] and [[Calais]] back to Villacoublay, landing at 18:37 p.m, having covered a distance of {{convert|2970|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 39h 35m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1914/1914%20-%200636.html|title=Gilbert Flies Round France in Two Days|date=June 12, 1914|page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6585089x/f29.image|title=Performances de la Quinzaine|page=301|date= 1 July 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1921===
After the [[First World War]], the competition was resumed in 1921. The competition was for the fastest time over a (3,000&amp;nbsp;km {1,860&amp;nbsp;mi) circuit: the French circuit was [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]&amp;mdash;[[Amiens]]&amp;mdash;[[Mourmelon-le-Grand]]&amp;mdash;[[Saint-Dizier]]&amp;mdash;[[Dijon]]&amp;mdash;[[Joigny]]&amp;mdash;[[Beaune]]&amp;mdash;[[Lyon]]&amp;mdash;[[Nîmes]]&amp;mdash;[[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]&amp;mdash;[[Bordeaux]]&amp;ndash;[[Romorantin]],&amp;mdash;[[Angers]]&amp;mdash;[[Évreux]]&amp;mdash;[[Calais]]&amp;mdash;Versailles, and the aircraft had to land at each of these airfields.

The result was the cause of considerable controversy. The best French time was achieved by [[Alphonse Poiré]] flying a [[Caudron C.60]], who completed the circuit in 37h 23m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200608.html|title= The International Michelin Cup|date=8 September 1921|page= 608}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A faster time of 35h 45m over an Italian circuit was achieved by Capt Raffaele Martinetti-Bianchi&lt;ref&gt;L'Aéreophile 1-15 octobre 1921&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200859.html|date= 29 December 1921|page=859|title=The Michelin Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he had not landed at the same aerodrome as he had departed from, since this had become waterlogged and he was not allowed to land there. The dispute between the Italian authorities, who had ratified his performance, and the Aéro-Club de France was taken to a specially appointed [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] committee, which found in Martinetti's favour, but the AeCF disputed their judgement: eventually the prize was held to have been won by neither man, although in recognition of his performance the AeCF awarded the Gold Medal of the AeCF and a sum of money equal to the Michelin Prize to Poiré.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6555017m/f162.image.r=Martinetti|title=Comité de Direction|date=1 May 1923|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1922-3===
A five-year extension, with annual prizes of 20,000 francs, was announced in 1922. The time period of the annual competition was altered to run from the beginning of July in one year to the end of the following June.

Won by Capt Girier flying a [[Breguet 14]], taking 20hr 41m 57sec, covering the course [[Lyons]]&amp;mdash;[[Nimes]]&amp;mdash;[[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]&amp;mdash;[[Bordeaux]]&amp;mdash;[[Angers]]&amp;mdash;[[Saint-Inglevert|St. Inglevert]]&amp;mdash;[[Mourmelon-le-Grand|Mourmelon]]&amp;mdash;[[Metz]]&amp;mdash;[[Strasbourg]]&amp;mdash;[[Dijon]]&amp;mdash;[[Avord]]&amp;mdash;Lyons at an average speed (including time on the ground) of {{convert|136.2|kph|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6555017m/f213.image|page=201|date=1 July 1923|title= La Coupe Michelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1923-4===
The 1924 French circuit was [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]&amp;mdash;[[Saint-Inglevert]]&amp;mdash;[[Valenciennes]]&amp;mdash;[[Mourmelon-le-Grand|Mourmelon]]&amp;mdash;[[Metz]]&amp;mdash;[[Strasbourg]]&amp;mdash;[[Dijon]]&amp;mdash;[[Clermont-Ferrand]]&amp;mdash;[[Lyon]]&amp;mdash;[[Nimes]]&amp;mdash;[[Toulouse]]&amp;mdash;[[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]&amp;mdash;[[Bordeaux]]&amp;mdash;[[Angers]]&amp;mdash;Versailles

Won by Lieut. [[Ludovic Arrachart]] flying a  [[Breguet 19]], completing the {{convert|2935|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 19h 22m 26s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]] 1924 ''Salon Aéronautique'' issue |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6554816n/f429.image|title=Les Moteurs d'Aviation Renault|page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1924-5===
Won by [[Pelletier d'Oisy]] flying a [[Blériot-SPAD S.61]], completing the course in 15h 8m.&lt;ref name=Raids&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6553816b/f203.image|title=Raids, Records et Performances|page=197|date=1 July 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1925-6===
At the request of the military aviation authorities, the 1925-6 competition was limited to competitors flying the principal French bombing aircraft, the [[Breguet 19]].&lt;ref name=Raids/&gt;
The best time was achieved by Capt. Coslin, with Lieut Gérard as observer, with a time of 18h 0m 24s, a speed of {{convert|163.6|kph|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65547488/f205.image|title=La Coupe Michelin|date=1 July 1926|  page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since this time did not better the previous best, the cup did not change hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6553815x/f242.image|title=Les Coupe Michelin |  date=1 August 1927   |page=236  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1926-7===
There were two competitions in 1926-7, one restricted to the Breguet 19. The course for both competitions was Paris ([[Paris–Le Bourget Airport|Le Bourget]])&amp;mdash;[[Nancy, France|Nancy]]&amp;mdash;[[Metz]]&amp;mdash;[[Strasbourg]]&amp;mdash;[[Dijon]]&amp;mdash;[[Bourges]]&amp;mdash;[[Clermont-Ferrand]]&amp;mdash;[[Lyons]]&amp;mdash;[[Istres]]&amp;mdash;[[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]&amp;mdash;[[Cazaux Air Base|Casaux]]&amp;mdash;[[Châteauroux]]&amp;mdash;[[Tours]]&amp;mdash;[[Romorantin-Lanthenay|Romorantin]]&amp;mdash;[[Chartres]]&amp;mdash;Paris, a distance of {{convert|2727.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65547488/f165.image|date= 1 May 1926|title=Nouvell Coupe Michelin|page=159|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main competition was won by Capitain Challes flying a [[Blériot-SPAD S.61]] in 12h 14m 37s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1927/1927%20-%200470.html|title=The Michelin Cup|date= 30 June 1927|page= 428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military competition was won by Capt Delaître and Sgt Cailloge, who covered the course in 14h 51m 55s, a speed of {{convert|187.95|kph|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65538437/f30.image|title=Réception des Lauréats des Militaries|date=1 February 1928|page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1927-8===
Again, the competition was restricted to the Breguet 19, with the added condition that an altitude of {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}} be reached at least once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6553846g/f27.image.r=coupe%20michelin|title=Les Militaries 1928|date=1 May 1928|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1928-9===
In 1928, the prize was offered for a further four years. The winning flight had to be made in France, although the competition was open to all nationalities, and the competition was restricted to single-seater aircraft with an engine of 230&amp;nbsp;hp or less. A minimum average speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} had to be maintained over the circuit, including time spent on the ground at the fifteen cities making up the circuit.&lt;ref name=F32_623&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1932/1932%20-%200671.html|date= 8 July 1932|page=623  |title=The Michelin Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Michelin cup==
In 1909, Michelin instituted a United Kingdom award, offering an annual award for five years of a trophy and £500. The competition was limited to British subjects flying aircraft of British construction. Administration of the competition was entrusted to the [[Royal Aero Club|Aero Club of Great Britain]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200185.html|date= 27 March 1909 |page=187|title=A British Michelin Cup }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]| url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200758.html|date=17 September 1910|page=756|title=The British Empire Michelin Cup }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1909&amp;ndash;10===
For the first year, the flight was to be around a closed circuit made up of two or more markers, and a minimum distance of {{convert|5|mi|km}} was specified. The closing date for the first competition was 31 March 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200189.html|page= 185|date=8 March 1910|title=The British Empire Michelin Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Won by [[John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara|J. T. C. Moore-Brabazon]] with a flight of {{convert|18.75|mi|km|abbr=on}} at [[RNAS Eastchurch|Eastchurch]] on 1 March 1910, flying the [[Short Biplane No. 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title=British Michelin Trophy Winner|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200279.html|page=277|date =9 April 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1910===
The rules for the 1910 competition, for which the closing date was 31 December 1910, were as before except that the minimum qualifying distance was raised to {{convert|38|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200758.html|date= 17 September 1910|title=The British Empire Michelin Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Announcement of a second prize, to be competed for during the following three years, with a trophy and a cash prize of £400 for 1911, £600 for 1912 and £800 for 1913, for the fastest time over a cross-country circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]  |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200292.html|date= April 1911|title=British Empire Michelin Cup No.2|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 1911, the Michelin Cup No.&amp;nbsp;1 was again won by Samuel Cody, flying his [[Cody Circuit of Britain biplane|Circuit of Britain biplane]] {{convert|261.5|mi|km}} in 5&amp;nbsp;hr 15&amp;nbsp;min at Laffan's Plain, also setting a new British duration record.&lt;ref name= FL1911/&gt;

The No.&amp;nbsp;2 cup was also won by Cody, with a flight made on 11 September 1911 of a circuit starting at Laffan's Plain, [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]]&amp;mdash;[[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]]&amp;mdash;[[Hendon Aerodrome|Hendon]]&amp;mdash;[[Brooklands]]&amp;mdash;Farnborough, taking 3 hr 6 min 30 sec to complete the {{convert|125|mi|km}} course.&lt;ref name= FL1911&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200980.html|title=Official Notices |date=11 November 1911  |page=982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1912===
The rules were redefined for the 1912 competition: the No.&amp;nbsp;1 cup and cash prize of £5,000 was purely for endurance, all flying to be done between sunrise and sunset. The No.&amp;nbsp;2 cup and prize of £600 was for distance covered over a cross-country course of about {{convert|186|mi|km|abbr=on}} of the competitor's choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200468.html|date=25 May 1912  |title=Notices to Members  |page=   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The No.&amp;nbsp;1 cup was won by [[Harry Hawker]] flying the [[Sopwith-Wright biplane]], with a flight lasting 8 hours 23 minutes made on 24 October 1912 at [[Brooklands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%201005.html|date=2 November 1912|title=British Duration Records|page=1005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The No.&amp;nbsp;2 cup was won by Samuel Cody flying the [[Cody V]], with a flight of 186 miles in 3hr 26m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200946.html|title= Col.

===1913===
Michelin Cup No.&amp;nbsp;1 for the longest distance flight round the course Brooklands&amp;ndash;Hendon&amp;ndash;[[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], with a minimum distance of 300 miles. Competitors had to make periodical stops of not less than five minutes, with engine stopped, on completing an entire circuit of the course plus one section: e.g., starting from Brooklands the competitor would pass Hendon, Farnborough, Brooklands, and alight at Hendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title=The British Empire Michelin Cup No. 1|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1913/1913%20-%200404.html|date= 12 April 1913|page= 412}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prize had not been won by the closing date of 31 October 1913, so the closing date was extended to 14 November 1913.

The No.&amp;nbsp;1 Cup was won by [[Reginald H. Carr]] flying the [[Grahame-White Type X|Grahame White "Charabanc"]], with a flight of over {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title= Reginald H.

The No.&amp;nbsp;2 cup, for the fastest time round a circuit of the competitor's choice of about 450&amp;nbsp;km, was not awarded. Although the prize was carried over to the next year, competition was terminated by the outbreak of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1914/1914%20-%200342.html|title=Notices to members|date=28 March 1914|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''naval stores industry''' collects, processes, and markets [[forest product]]s refined from the [[oleoresin]] of the [[slash pine]] and [[longleaf pine]] trees (genus ''Pinus''). The industry was associated with the maintenance of the [[wooden ship]]s and sailing tackle of pre-20th century navies, which were [[caulk]]ed and [[waterproof]]ed using the pitch (or resin, also known as [[pine tar|tar]]) of the pine tree.&lt;ref&gt;Earley, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:CupGutterSystem.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Herty|Herty system]] in use on turpentine trees in northern Florida, circa 1936]]
[[File:Herty turpentine cup.jpg|thumb|Herty turpentine cup, made of clay.  The hole is for nailing to a pine tree.]]
[[File:Turpentine cup.jpg|thumb|Turpentine cup made of tin, was attached to a pine tree.]]

With the demise of wooden ships, those uses of pine resin ended, but the industry remained vigorous as new products created new markets. First extensively described by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in his book ''A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States'' (1856),&lt;ref&gt;Olmsted, Ch. 5, pp. 110-173&lt;/ref&gt; the naval stores industry was one of the economic mainstays of the southeastern [[United States]] until the late 20th century. Despite a rapid decline of the gum naval stores industry in the last quarter of the 20th century, a few places in the southeastern United States still rely on it as a major part of their livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;Outland, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gum naval stores cultivation''' refers to the labor-intensive method of extracting pine resin from the trees (the raw gum). The method of collection—tapping the trees—vaguely resembles that used on a rubber plantation or in a maple sugar grove.  However, instead of preparing the tree to receive a pipe or tap, the tree is gashed with an inch-wide curved blade, called a "hack," to remove all of the bark down through the cambium layer. An angled piece of galvanized tin is then placed below the eight-inch-long, one-inch-wide gash (also known as "the streak") to direct the oozing [[Sap (plant)|sap]] into a quart-sized rectangular cup fixed to the tree. Each new "streak" is put onto the tree above the preceding one, and gradually a vertical "cat face" more than thirty inches in height is formed. Through the mid-twentieth century, a "puller," a type of hack that had a long handle, was used to extend the streak up the tree to a height of more than seven feet.

Once, large operators, known as "factors," controlled huge tracts of forests, some in the hundreds of thousands of acres, which they leased to "operators," and also advanced them capital, usually in the form of tools and other equipment and goods with which to operate. The operators satisfied their debt to the factors by returning the produce, barrels of resin. The name "Factors Walk" on the riverfront in [[Savannah, Georgia]], commemorates an area on the Savannah River harbor where thousands of barrels of produce were collected for [[transshipment]]. Between 1880 and 1920, Savannah was the largest port for naval stores products and continued to set the world price of naval stores until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Outland, pp. 56-57; 147-150; 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earley, pp. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic processes==

The basic raw material, [[pine resin]], once collected, is converted into two major products — [[rosin]] and [[turpentine]]. For many years rosin and turpentine were used unprocessed in common household products such as soap, paper, paint, and [[varnish]]. Today most rosin is altered to be used in a wide range of products that includes paper sizing, surface coatings, adhesives, printing inks, and rubber compounds. Turpentine, like rosin, has become a versatile material exploited to develop uses in fragrances, flavors, vitamins, household cleaning products, medicines, and [[polyterpene resin]].

==Industry today==

Because of a shortage of workers willing to perform the heavy manual labor involved in the streaking of many acres of trees and in collecting the resin tree by tree as well, the gum naval stores industry entered a period of steep decline beginning in the 1960s. As of 2001, only one large-scale facility (begun as [[Filtered Rosin Products]]) in [[Baxley, Georgia]], continued in operation, serving the remaining naval stores producers in the surrounding area. Gradually, the method of tapping trees to obtain naval stores products has become overshadowed by industries which yield these products as [[byproduct]]s of other operations.&lt;ref&gt;Outland, pp. 300-307&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|net}}

A '''net''' (sometimes written '''nett''') value is the resultant amount after accounting for the [[summation|sum]] or [[difference (mathematics)|difference]] of two or more variables.

In [[economics]], it is frequently used to imply the remaining value after accounting for a specific, commonly understood deduction.  In these cases it is contrasted with the term ''[[Gross (economics)|gross]]'', which refers to the pre-deduction value. For example, [[net income]] is the total income of a [[company]] after deducting its [[expenses]]—commonly known as [[Profit (economics)|profit]]—or the total income of an individual after deducting his or her [[income tax]].  Profit may be broken down further into pre-taxed or [[gross profit]] and profit after taxes or [[net profit]].  Similarly, an individual's [[net worth]] the difference between their [[asset]]s (what they own) and their [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] (what they owe to others).

Similarly, [[net investment]] in physical [[capital (economics)|capital]] such as machinery equals [[gross investment|gross (total) investment]] minus the dollar amount of replacement investment that offsets [[depreciation (economics)|depreciation]] of pre-existing machinery, thus giving the change in the amount of machinery available for use. Likewise, [[net national product]] equals [[gross national product]] minus depreciation.

==Etymology==
The word ''net'', in this sense, originally derives from the Latin ''nitere'' (to shine) and ''nitidus'' (elegant, trim), and more recently from the French ''net'' (sharp, neat, clean).&lt;ref&gt;New World Dictionary of the American Language, Simon and Schuster, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammatical usage==
In this sense, it may appear, separated by a comma, ''following'' the noun it modifies, e.g., "earned two million dollars, net".

==See also==
* [[Net metering]], electricity policy
* [[Net 30]], form of trade credit
* [[Net profit]], gross profit minus overhead and interest
* [[Net weight]], weight of a product, not counting packaging
* [[Net pay]], salary after deductions
* [[Net operating loss]]

'''Niels Carlsen''' (8 January 1734 &amp;ndash; 3 May 1809) was a Norwegian timber merchant, landowner, shipowner and banker. Carlsen was one of the biggest ship owners in Norway of his time. &lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Niels Carlsen |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Bernhard |last=Magnussen |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Niels_Carlsen/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Carlsen was born in [[Drøbak]] in [[Akershus]], Norway.  He was the son of Jacob Carlsen (ca. 1685-1749) and Maria Jørgensdatter Frost. His father had married the widow of his employer and took over the trading business. Drøbak had a favorable location situated on east side of [[Drøbak Sound]], at the narrowest part of the [[Oslo Fjord]]. It was near the capital, had good anchoring and mooring facilities and a protective harbor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Dr%C3%B8bak|title=Drøbak|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author=  Svein Askheim|accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Niels Carlsen and his half brothers Christian went into their father's business and expanded it. The brothers were shipowners, forest owners, traded in both imports and exports and took part in the financing operations that came with the profession. Carlsen bought up forest lands on both sides of the bay, floated the logs into circulation plots which he had acquired along Drøbak Sound, operated a sawmill and built bulwark against the sea to facilitate the loading of ships.  He owned a large part of the property along the seafront as well as the small islands where [[Oscarsborg Fortress]] is now situated. With these acquisition, he initiated the operation of a ferry landing, plus guest house and coaching inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Niels Carlsen |first= |last= |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Niels_Carlsen |language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlsen married Martha Zachariassen (1743–1821), the daughter of Zacharias Simonsen Wesseltoft (1701-1777), a wealthy merchant and shipowner in [[Skien]]. She and her family contributed to the further development of Carlsen's business and to the development of Drøbak. Carlsen and his wife donated funds for a  wooden cruciform church, hospital and school. Drøbak Church (''Drøbak kirke'') was fully furnished and was inaugurated in 1776. Facing the church is the building which was dedicated as a hospital and hostel for poor widows in 1793. A bust of Carlsen, made by [[Arne Vinje Gunnerud]], is located between  Drøbak Church and the old Drøbak Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://www.frogn.kirken.no/kirkene/drobak-kirke|title=Drøbak kirke|publisher=  kirken i  Drobak og Frogn|author=  Leif Lund-Berg|date=   17 July 1996|accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://verneforeningen.no/international-visitors/history-of-drobak/|title=  History of Drøbak|publisher =  verneforeningen.no |accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://verneforeningen.no/walks-around-drobak/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2999">{{for|the role of registered agent in the US|Registered Agent}}

A '''process agent''' is a [[agent (law)|representative]] upon whom [[court]] papers may be served. In the US, the role is generally a requirement of US State law and is known as a [[registered agent]], a resident agent or statutory agent. However, process agents are utilized in the US by [[truck drivers]], [[brokers]] or [[freight forwarders]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration/process-agents&lt;/ref&gt; for similar purposes. Process agents that provide nationwide coverage for motor carriers are commonly referred to as blanket companies&lt;ref&gt;http://li-public.fmcsa.dot.gov/LIVIEW/pkg_html.prc_limain&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In the UK, a process agent is a contractual relationship, permitted by the Civil Procedure Rules.

==England and Wales==

Under English Civil Procedure Rules,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil Civil Procedure Rules]&lt;/ref&gt; it is necessary to serve papers to start proceedings correctly.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Procedure Rules, Part 6&lt;/ref&gt;  If a party does not have an address within the United Kingdom, the procedure for serving these papers can be lengthy and complicated, with proof of service particularly difficult in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Procedure Rules, Practice Direction 6A&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is therefore customary to appoint a process agent and contractually agree that service at the address of the agent will constitute proper service for the purposes of Rule 6.1.1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. In order to meet the requirements of Rule 6.1.1 an appropriate contractual clause needs to be inserted into the agreement specifying the details of the appointment.

It is also possible to appoint a Process Agent for the purposes of arbitration proceedings in a similar manner.

The role of a process agent&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawdebenture.com/our-services/united-kingdom/process-agent/what-is-the-role-of-a-process-agent/ What Is The Role of a Process Agent?]&lt;/ref&gt; is a vitally important service for many businesses dealing with suppliers, banks or tenders in the UK. Process agents accept service of notices, proceedings or documents on behalf of their overseas clients in situations where it is not possible for them to be served abroad. A process agent can act in a broad capacity for a company including but not limited to; acting as a process agent for court actions, receiving documents in connection with arbitration proceedings and receiving notices under contracts where an independent party is needed. 

A typical example of a process agency arrangement is where an overseas entity raises a loan from a city institution. Often the lending bank will require the appointment of a UK-based process agent&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawdebenture.com/our-services/united-kingdom/process-agent/ UK-based Process Agent]&lt;/ref&gt; to receive formal notices should the borrower default on the loan.

'''Resource distribution''' refers to the distribution of [[resource (economics)|resources]], including [[Land (economics)|land]], [[water]], [[mineral]]s, [[fuel]] and [[distribution of wealth|wealth in general]] among corresponding geographic entities (states, countries, etc.).

== Unequal resource distribution ==
{{Main|Economic inequality}}

The most common use of this concept has not been in examining the unequal distribution of resources among nation states. Such unequal distribution of resources was commonly related to land for [[agriculture]], necessary for [[population growth]].  A more recent emphasis has been on differences from the unequal dispersion of [[technological progress]].

== International trade ==

The growth of [[international trade]] is an aspect of [[globalization]] in the later 20th Century (see [[OECD]]), which has affected [[international relations]]. Increased international trade from the removal of [[trade barrier]]s has narrowed income distribution among some nation states. Many wealthier countries export non-land-intensive goods and services in return for  agricultural and animal products, as illustrated by Japan.

In 1991, he was made a Member of the [[Order of Canada]].

==Businessman==

==Montreal Canadiens executive==
On November 12, 1982, Corey was appointed [[president]] of the Canadiens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |work=The Globe and Mail
 |title=ROUNDUP Hockey |page=S7 |date=November 13, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his term as president, the team won two [[Stanley Cup]]s;  in [[1985–86 NHL season|1986]] and [[1992–93 NHL season|1993]]. Corey was president for the building of the [[Bell Centre]], however during the 1990s, the team's business declined under the indirect ownership of parent company [[Molson Brewery]] by [[Foster's Group|Foster's]].&lt;ref name="gaz-1999"&gt;{{cite news

Corey was known for his good treatment of past Canadiens' stars [[Maurice Richard]] and [[Guy Lafleur]]. In 1986, he also brought [[Doug Harvey (ice hockey)|Doug Harvey]] back into the Canadiens' organization, as a scout and arranging the retirement of his jersey number 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

One famous action of Corey's was the firing, four games into the 1995–96 season, of  the entire Canadiens' hockey management - general manager [[Serge Savard]] and coaches [[Jacques Demers]], [[Carol Vadnais]] and [[Andre Boudrias]], and replaced them with [[Rejean Houle]] and [[Mario Tremblay]]. Houle had no previous general manager experience while Tremblay had no coaching experience, and the moves would indirectly lead to the departure of star goaltender [[Patrick Roy]] weeks later. Earlier, however, Savard had been hired by Corey with no prior front-office experience and went on to put together 2 Stanley Cup-winning teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Canadiens were soon sold to American businessman [[George Gillett (American businessman)|George Gillett]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4105">A [[company (law)|company]] is said to be '''thinly capitalised''' when the level of its debt is much greater than its [[equity capital]], i.e. its [[Gearing (finance)|gearing]], or leverage, is very high. An entity's debt-to-equity funding is sometimes expressed as a ratio. For example, a gearing ratio of 1.5:1 means that for every $2 of equity the entity has $3 of debt. 

A high gearing ratio can create problems for:
* creditors, which bear the solvency risk of the company, and
* revenue authorities, which are concerned about excessive interest claims.

==Credit risk==
If the shareholders have introduced only a nominal amount of paid-up [[share capital]], then the company has lower financial reserves with which to meet its obligations. If all or most of the company's capital comes from debt, which (unlike equity) needs to be serviced, and ultimately repaid, it means that the providers of capital are ultimately competing with the company's trade creditors for the same capital resources.

In general, most common law countries tend not to employ thin capitalisation rules in relation to [[Capital requirement|raising and maintenance of capital]]. However, a number of civil law jurisdictions do.

However, in almost all jurisdictions there are certain types of regulated entity which require a certain amount, or a certain proportion, of paid-up share capital to be licensed to trade. The most common examples of this are [[bank]]s and [[insurance company|insurance companies]]. This is because if such companies were to fail and go into [[liquidation]] the economic effect of such failures can lead to a [[domino effect]], which can have catastrophic consequences for other businesses and, ultimately, national economies.

==Tax issues==
Even where countries’ corporate laws permit companies to be thinly capitalised, revenue authorities in those countries will often limit the amount that a company can claim as a tax deduction on interest, particularly when it receives loans at non-commercial rates (e.g. from connected parties). However, some countries simply disallow interest deductions above a certain level from all sources when the company is considered to be too highly geared under applicable tax regulations.

Some tax authorities limit the applicability of thin capitalisation rules to corporate groups with foreign entities to avoid “tax leakage” to other jurisdictions. The United States “earnings stripping” rules are an example. Hong Kong protects tax revenue by prohibiting payers from claiming tax deductions for interest paid to foreign entities, thus eliminating the possibility of using thin capitalisation to shift income to a lower-tax jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/pdf/e_dipn13a.pdf Profits tax: Deductibility of interest expense].

'''Thin capitalisation rules''' determine how much of the interest paid on corporate debt is deductible for tax purposes. Such rules are of interest to [[Financial Sponsor|private-equity firm]]s, which use significant amounts of debt to finance [[leveraged buyout]]s, and in the context of strategic acquisitions, where the purchaser wishes to push debt into higher taxed countries with significant pre-tax income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.com/casefor/sectors/2004/nz4664.php Article on thin capitalisation rules on AltAssets.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930123139/http://www.altassets.com/casefor/sectors/2004/nz4664.php |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trade Empires''' is a PC game developed by [[Frog City Software]] in [[San Francisco]] and published by [[Eidos Interactive]]. During development its working title was '''The Silk Road'''; however, this was changed by Eidos Interactive as they were concerned about the title being too [[highbrow]].

Trade Empires is a pausable real-time strategy game about building a merchant empire. Gamers build vast transport and trade networks that change over thousands of years as new technologies are developed and more modern products are discovered. The rules of the game are simple; the variety comes in through the discovery of new products to trade and new ways to transport those products.

==Gameplay==
*  Play the first trading and transporting simulation to emphasize the effects of technological change over thousands of years on the relatively simple model of producing and delivering commodities to make more money than the competition.
* Start out simple, with one merchant and his donkeys. Gradually build up your merchant empire until you control a vast trading web.
* Manipulate the supply and demand economy to dominate the other merchant families. Corner the market. Undercut their prices.
* Explore and Exploit: Continually discover new markets and products, from silk in the Far East to steel in industrial Europe.
* Adapt your family's trading network to an ever-changing economy or instead face defeat when your competitors purchase advanced technology and deliver superior products.
* Span the centuries and the world, in regions from Ancient Sumeria to 19th century Europe.
* Build vast transportation networks, using anything from dirt trails to railroads.
* Compete against other merchant families who are powered by a clever artificial intelligence that plays by the same rules you do.
* Rendered units and buildings on a 3D map.
* More than 200 structures and 30 units in 15 different episodes.

==Campaigns==
The game features 19 campaign scenarios based on historical trading periods in human history. A step-by-step walkthrough is playable by users on the ''Learn to Play'' mode for the [[Shang Dynasty]] of [[People's Republic of China|China]] (1700-1100 BC). The game imitates the historical period through the supply and demand process of that time. Goods such as [[rice]], [[millet]], [[silk]] cloth and [[Chinese jade|jade idols]] are traded during the campaign. The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] &amp; [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Era (AD 615-1280) of China is also depicted, although not as a ''Learn to Play'' option.

Other [[Asia]]n trading periods include ''First Civilization'' (2500-2310 BC); based around the regions of the [[Indus Valley]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Assyria]].

The '''Zosimades''' ({{lang-el|Ζωσιμάδες}}) or '''Zosimas brothers''' were 18th-19th century [[Greeks|Greek]] benefactors and merchants.

The Zosimades were six brothers:

*Ioannis Zosimas (1752–1771)
*[[:File:Anastasios Zosimas.JPG|Anastasios Zosimas]] (1754–1828)
*[[Nikolaos Zosimas]] (1758–1842)
*Theodosios Zosimas (1760–1793)
*[[Zois Zosimas]] (1764–1828)
*Michael Zosimas (1766–1809)

They were born in [[Ioannina]], a city that was under [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman]] rule and a major center of the [[Greek Enlightenment]] that time. Their father was a local merchant, Panagis Zosimas. At 1875, Nikolaos, Theodosios and Michael started their trading activities in [[Livorno]], [[Italy]], while Ioannis, Anastasios and Zois ran their trade business in [[Nizhyn]] ([[Ukraine]]) and then in [[Moscow]]. Their trade network soon became profitable and they managed to make a fortune.

==Benefaction==
After Theodosis' death (1793), he wrote in his testament that they should financially support the education of their home city Ioannina. So they donated astronomical amounts of money for the establishment and function of various schools and public libraries. Another huge donation went for the ''National Library'', of [[Adamantios Korais]], one of the major contributors of the Greek Enlightenment movement. Apart from educational institutions, orphanages were also financed.  The Zosimades also subsidized the publication of several books.

At 1820, after Zois' death, they supported the establishment of a new school in their home place, which became known as [[Zosimaia School|Zosimaia]]. This institution would become the center of Greek education the following century in the region of [[Epirus]].

During the following outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–1830) the remaining Zosimades became active members of the patriotic organization [[Philiki Etaireia]] and supported financially the struggle. Zosimades also completely financed the erection of the Monetary Museum of Athens, donating their personal collection of Ancient Greek and Roman currency, as well as the orphanage in [[Patmos]].
