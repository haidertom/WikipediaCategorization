'''Abdul Latif Galadari ''' (born on 1939) is the youngest son of Ebrahim Galadari. The late Abdul Latif, along with his elder brother, Abdul Rahim, who died in 1994, headed the Galadari Group, which was involved in a variety of industrial and business activities. He along with his brother created a new wave of companies.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/rich-list-2009/list?view=profile&amp;itemid=150343#.VZY0A_kirIV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Abdul Latif Galadari was born in 1939, as the youngest son of Ebrahim Galadari and grandson of merchant Hassan Galadari. The business tradition stretched as far back as his grandfather, Hassan Galadari, who was a businessman in 1879.As a young man, Abdul Latif Galadari studied in [[Beirut]] [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/rich-list-2009/list?view=profile&amp;itemid=150343#.VZY0A_kirIV |title=Rich List |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
The Galadari Brother’s Group was fuelled initially by the entrepreneurial vision of the late Abdul Rahim E. Galadari, the late Abdul Latif E. Galadari, and the late Abdul Wahab E. Galadari in the early 1960s.This group created a new wave of companies and furthered the entrepreneurial vision to the family business. The three brothers were also involved in the gold business, which had made them multimillionaires by the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/BankruptinDubai1983.shtm&lt;/ref&gt; It was from this generation that another three brothers created the Ilyas &amp; Mustafa Galadari Group, started by Ilyas &amp; Mustafa Galadari, as well as Galadari Investment Office, formed by their younger brother Rashid A.W. Galadari. Abdul Latif Galadari and his two brothers were well placed to take advantage of Dubai's 1970s Oil Boom. Together they started a major conglomerate, building the Intercontinental Hotel, opening Dubai Bank, establishing a Mazda Vehicle Dealership, starting Dubai's first English Language Daily Newspaper - the Khaleej Times - and opening a string of construction, engineering, and trading companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/BankruptinDubai1983.shtm |title=AW Galadari Dubai's First Bankrupt 1983 |publisher=Dubaiasitusedtobe.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also started GICC,which is the flagship company of the Galadari Brothers Group. GICC is the master franchisee for the Baskin-Robbins brand in the GCC, and is the world's largest franchisee for Baskin-Robbins with close to 700 stores spread across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman,Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. GICC has been the first company to introduce an international brand of ice cream in the area and has the largest store network in the Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) industry in the [[Persian Gulf]] region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/galadari-ice-cream-company-receives-developer-of-the-year-award-from-dunkin-brands-269935611.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galadari's wealth is largely invested in real estate, including in the City of Arabia, a 20 million sq.ft.plot on Emirates Road. The land is earmarked for the Mall of Arabia, a project that will see the Galadaris build the largest and most expensive mall in the world.
The brothers' other assets include manufacturing concerns, a major taxi firm, a driving school, restaurants, hotels, and Sunseeker Yachts Middle East. They have Galadari Hotel in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"/&gt; They have already introduced over 30 global brands into the region. And their business is multi-industry, multi-product, multi-service and multi-national, overseeing operations across the Persian Gulf, Asia, and Australia. Until now, the Galadari Brothers have held a significant market share in the industries of Media, Automobiles, Food &amp; Beverage, Industrial and Technical products, Trucks &amp; Heavy Equipment, Engineering, Real Estate and Hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jd.ae/CompanyProfile.aspx?cid=7801 |title=J.D :: Galadari Rent A Car |publisher=Jd.ae |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wawira Njiru''', is a [[human nutrition|human nutritionist]], [[businesswoman]], [[entrepreneur]] and [[philanthropist]], in [[Kenya]] who serves as the [[executive director]] of '''Food 4 Education''', an organization that cooks, prepares and distributes nutritious meals, at subsidized prices to over 2,000 poor school children in [[Ruiru]], a suburb of [[Nairobi]], the capital city of Kenya.&lt;ref name="1R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=28 September 2018 |date=September 2018 |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |publisher=[[Nation Media Group]] |location=Nairobi | url=https://cdn.nation.co.ke/pdfs/Top40under40Women2018.pdf | title=Top 40 Under 40 Kenyan Women 2018  |author=Business Daily Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
She was born circa 1991, in the town of Ruiru, in [[Kiambu County]], immediately northwest of the capital city of Nairobi.&lt;ref name="2R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=28 September 2018 | url=http://www.transformnutrition.org/what-we-do/nutrition-champions/ann-wawira-njiru-kenya/ |title=2013 Nutrition Champions: Ann Wawira Njiru: Kenya |date=2014 |location=United Kingdom |
publisher=Transformnutrition.org |author=Transformnutrition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended local schools for her primary and secondary education. In 2010, she was admitted to the [[University of South Australia]], in [[Adelaide]], where she graduated with a [[Human nutrition|Bachelor of Nutrition Science]] degree.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

==Career==
In 2011, at the age of twenty, Wawiru then an undergraduate in Adelaide, Australia invited 80 friends to a Kenyan themed meal. She charged $20 per plate, raising the equivalent of KSh126,000 at that time.&lt;ref name="3R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=28 September 2018 |url=http://www.voicesofyouth.org/en/posts/inspire--with-wawira-njiru---food-4-education |title=Inspire! With Wawira Njiru: Food 4 Education |date=7 December 2015 |publisher=Voicesofyouth.org | last=Marketer |first=Carrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With those funds, Food 4 Education (F4E) was founded. Starting with the construction of a make-shift kitchen, F4E started feeding their 25 first students. That was followed by fundraising campaigns on the internet. Over time, the number of children receiving subsidized school lunches increased.&lt;ref name="3R"/&gt; 

According to Wawira Njiru, it costs Ksh25 (approx. US$0.25) to provide a meal to an elementary school child in Kenya. The parents or guardians are asked to contribute KSh10 (approx. US$0.10). F4E provides the balance.&lt;ref name="4R"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/women/Wawira-Njiru/1950830-3978312-14w2ktb/index.html |title=Take 5: Founder of Food 4 Education, Wawira Njiru |access-date=28 September 2018 |date=20 June 2017 |newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] |first=Abigail |
last=Arunga |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To bridge the financial gap, F4E hired a full-time [[chef]], constructed a new modern kitchen and began to deliver cooked-to-order-meals to corporate clients in the nearby Nairobi neighborhoods of [[Kilimani]], [[Kileleshwa]], [[Westlands]], [[Upper Hill, Nairobi|Upper Hill]] and the [[central business district]] of the city.&lt;ref name="4R"/&gt;

'''Avaloq''' is a Swiss company that develops and provides software for [[core banking]]. The software system, '''Avaloq Banking Suite''', is used by more than 140 banks worldwide.&lt;ref name="bbchs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smale|first1=Will|title=High security: The man who protects our bank accounts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38800176|website=BBC News|accessdate=7 February 2017|date=6 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207000336/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38800176|archivedate=7 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Core banking is the activity, at the heart of any bank, that deals with information about customers, transactions and account balances. Banks have traditionally bought in software for these purposes rather than developing it internally. More and more functions have had to be added over the years as requirements have changed, for example for online banking. The result has been very complex computer programs that can be difficult to manage. Also,  coding changes for compliance to new regulations and for accommodating new products can be problematic.&lt;ref name="abank"&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Big Four Core Banking Vendors' Oligopoly Be Broken?|url=https://www.americanbanker.com/news/can-big-four-core-banking-vendors-oligopoly-be-broken|website=American Banker|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanbanker.com%2Fnews%2Fcan-big-four-core-banking-vendors-oligopoly-be-broken&amp;date=2017-02-07|first1=Penny|last1=Crosman|date=7 October 2013|archivedate=7 February 2017|deadurl=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, banks have tended to buy in modern comprehensive software from large, specialist firms. This may be run by the bank itself or by an agency running the computing service on behalf of the bank.&lt;ref name=abank /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckert|first1=Martin|title=Swiss Banking Software Goes Worldwide|url=http://www.worlditlawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Swiss-Banking-Software-goes-worldwide_Martin_Eckert_MME-Partners2.pdf|website=worlditlawyers.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worlditlawyers.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F06%2FSwiss-Banking-Software-goes-worldwide_Martin_Eckert_MME-Partners2.pdf&amp;date=2017-02-07|archivedate=7 February 2017|pages=20-21|date=June 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
Avaloq was founded in Zurich in 1985, under the name "BZ Informatik Aktiengesellschaft", functioning as the [[information technology]] subsidiary of {{ill|BZ Bank|de}}. In 1991, 30% of the share capital was taken by the employees as a result of a partial [[management buyout]]. At that time there were five staff and the cost of the buyout was $200,000.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;

The first customer was [[Swiss National Bank]], rapidly followed by five other commercial banks in Switzerland. The system then spread worldwide although it has had little impact in America.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;&lt;ref name=abank /&gt; Initially the firm was called BZ Informatik, and its product “AdvAntAge”.

In 1996 the current name was adopted.&lt;ref name="avaloqhistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=History – Avaloq|url=https://www.avaloq.co.uk/about-us/history/|website=www.avaloq.co.uk|publisher=Avaloq|accessdate=7 February 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avaloq.co.uk%2Fabout-us%2Fhistory%2F&amp;date=2017-02-07|archivedate=7 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the company split from BZ Bank, as the employees acquired 100% of the share capital.

==Current activities==

Avaloq Banking Group AG employs 2,500 staff, 500 of which are programmers. It has annual revenues of over $500 million and its software accounts for bank deposits to the sum of $4 trillion.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt; The founder and chairman is Francisco Fernandez.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Management Team – Avaloq|url=https://www.avaloq.co.uk/about-us/our-management-team/|website=www.avaloq.co.uk|publisher=Avaloq|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208032929/https://www.avaloq.co.uk/about-us/our-management-team/|archivedate=8 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Avaloq Banking Suite software is used by over 450 customers including [[HSBC]], [[Barclays]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[UBS]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Nomura]] and [[Societe Generale]].&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt; Some of the customers have performed [[business process outsourcing]] to Avaloq itself for the actual running of the core computing service which uses [[cloud computing]].&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minetti|first1=Maurizio|title=Bankensoftware: Avaloq greift nach der Krone aloq greift nach der Krone|url=http://www.inside-it.ch/articles/15852|website=inside-it.ch|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inside-it.ch%2Farticles%2F15852&amp;date=2017-02-07|archivedate=7 February 2017|date=23 October 2008|language=de|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pütter|first1=Christiane|title=Business Process Outsourcing Avaloq und Quirin Bank rollen BPO-Markt auf|url=http://www.cio.de/a/avaloq-und-quirin-bank-rollen-bpo-markt-auf,2903921|website=www.cio.de|publisher=CIO|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=de|date=14 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309042201/http://www.cio.de/a/avaloq-und-quirin-bank-rollen-bpo-markt-auf%2C2903921|archivedate=9 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security of the data stored by the system is of the utmost importance. To guard against [[cyber attack]] the firm engages a number of companies based in Israel to attempt to break through the security systems and then help plug the weaknesses uncovered.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11513">The concept of '''business process orientation''' (BPO) is based upon the work of Deming (Walton, 1996), Porter (1985), Davenport and Short (1990), Hammer (1993, 1996 and 1999), Grover et al. (1995), and Coombs and Hull (1996).  This body of work suggests that firms could enhance their overall performance by adopting a “process view” of the [[organization]].  Although many firms have adopted the BPO concept, little to no empirical data existed substantiating its effectiveness in facilitating improved [[business]] performance.  McCormack (2000) conducted an empirical study to explore the relationship between BPO and enhanced business performance. The research results showed that BPO is critical in reducing conflict and encouraging greater connectedness within an organization, while improving business performance. Moreover, companies with strong measures of BPO showed better overall business performance. The research also showed that high BPO levels within organizations led to a more positive [[corporate climate]], illustrated through better organizational connectedness and less internal conflict. Another empirical study by Kohlbacher (2009) reveals that BPO is positively associated with customer satisfaction, product quality, delivery speed and time-to-market speed.&lt;ref name="SMS"&gt;Kohlbacher, M. (2009): The Effects of Process Orientation on Customer Satisfaction, Product Quality and Time-Based Performance. Paper presented at the 29th International Conference of the Strategic Management Society, Washington DC, October 11–14, [http://dc.strategicmanagement.net Conference Website].&lt;/ref&gt;

For a central concept, one that has become something of a [[Holy Grail]] for 1990s managers, BPO has remained remarkably hard to pin down.  Its champions argue that it is a new approach to management that replaces the rigid hierarchies of the past ("I report to my boss") with structures that are much flatter, more cooperative, more process-oriented  ("I report to my customer.").  Many of us have had experience with both types of organization and we know intuitively what BPO feels like.  Yet, if you're like me, you want a more solid foundation on which to make decisions and recommendations{{Fact|date=February 2014}}.

Most of the literature on business process orientation has been in the popular press and lacks a research or empirical focus. Although empirical evidence is lacking, several models have emerged during the last few years that have been presented as the high performance, process oriented organization needed in today and tomorrow’s world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cleven A, Mettler T, Rohner P, Winter R |title=Healthcare quality innovation and performance through process orientation: Evidence from general hospitals in Switzerland |journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change |volume=113 |issue=Part B |pages=386–395 |year=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Deming, Porter, Davenport, Short, Hammer, Byrne, Imai, Drucker, Rummler-Brache and Melan have all defined what they view as the new model of the organization.  According to each model’s proponent, the “building” of this model requires a new approach and a new way of thinking about the organization which will result in dramatic business performance improvements.  This “new way of thinking” or “viewing” your organization has been generally described as business process orientation.

Process centering or building an organization with a business process orientation has led to many reported successes.  [[Texas Instruments]], [[Progressive Insurance]] and [[American Standard Companies]] have all been reported, albeit anecdotally, as receiving improved business performance from building a process orientation within an organization (Hammer 1996).

Process orientation, and its relationship to improved cross-functional interaction, was introduced almost fifteen years ago by [[Michael Porter]].  He introduced the concept of interoperability across the value chain as a major issue within firms (Porter 1985).  W. Edwards Deming also contributed with the “Deming Flow Diagram” depicting the connections across the firm from the customer to the supplier as a process that could be measured and improved like any other process (Walton 1986).  [[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]] and James Short (1990) described a process orientation within an organization as a key component in the “New Industrial Engineering: Information Technology and Business Process Redesign.”

[[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] also presented the business process orientation concept as an essential ingredient of a successful “reengineering” effort.  Hammer coined this term to describe the development of a customer focused, strategic business process based organization enabled by rethinking the assumptions in a process oriented way and utilizing information technology as a key enabler (Hammer, 1993).   Hammer offers reengineering as a strategy to overcome the problematic cross-functional activities that are presenting major performance issues to firms and cites many examples of successes and failures in his series of books and articles.  Hallmark and Wal-Mart are often put forward as success stories and IBM and GM as the failures.

Culture is a major theme in the examples cited.  A  “business process culture” is a culture that is cross-functional, customer oriented along with process and system thinking.  This can be expanded by Davenport’s definition of process orientation as consisting of elements of structure, focus, measurement, ownership and customers (Davenport 1993).  Davenport also stressed commitment to process improvement that directly benefits the customer and business process information oriented systems as a major component of this culture

Finally, Hammer (Hammer 1993, 1995, 1996, 1999) described “process thinking” as cross-functional and outcome oriented.  He also used four categories to describe the components of an organization.  These are:

#Business Processes
#Jobs and Structures
#Management and Measurement Systems
#Values and Beliefs

==The Definition of BPO==

To establish a more solid foundation, I would like to propose a definition and an approach to measuring BPO.  The BPO concept has sufficient practitioners and researchers and has been implemented in enough companies that we now have the information we need to develop a testable statistical model. The trick, of course, is getting at that broad range of experience and boiling it down in scientifically acceptable ways to a point where practitioners can use it easily in the field.

Our approach to building this foundation began with an extensive literature review, interviews with experts both in the U.S. and Europe and testing with experienced practitioners and experts to determine the key definition and variables within BPO.  Using various statistical techniques (domain sampling, coefficient alpha testing, and factor analysis), we both determined the validity of various BPO variables and condensed those variables into a simpler composite list (survey instrument) that offered easy use in measuring BPO within an organization (McCormack 1999).

Our research found that the practitioners and experts said a Business Process Oriented Organization comes down to this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An organization that emphasizes process as opposed to hierarchies, a process oriented way of thinking, outcomes and customers."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We also found that BPO also breaks into three elements:

*Process Management and Measurement – measures that include aspects of the process like output quality, cycle time, process cost and variability compared to the traditional accounting measures.
*Process Jobs – "product development process owner" rather than "research manager".
*Process View – thorough documentation from top to bottom and beginning to end of a process.

Recent research extends the elements of McCormack (1999) and concludes that the concept of BPO consists of the following components:&lt;ref name="BPMJ2011"&gt;Kohlbacher, M. and Gruenwald S. (2011): Process orientation: conceptualization and measurement. Business Process Management Journal 17(2), pp. 267-283.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Design and documentation of business processes
*Management commitment towards process orientation
*Process ownership (see [[process owner]])
*Process performance measurement
*Corporate culture in line with the process approach &lt;ref name="BPD2011"&gt;Kohlbacher, M., Gruenwald, S. and Kreuzer, E. (2011): Corporate culture in line with business process orientation and its impact on organizational performance. In: zur Muehlen M. and Jianwen S. (Eds): Business Process Management Workshops, Springer, Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Application of continuous process improvement methodologies (see [[continuous improvement process]] or business process improvement), and
*Process-oriented organizational structure.

The '''CAGE Distance Framework''' identifies Cultural, Administrative, Geographic and Economic  differences or distances between countries that companies should address when crafting international strategies.&lt;ref name=cases&gt;''Cases about Redefining Global Strategy'', Pankaj Ghemawat and Jordan Siegel, Harvard Business Review Press, 2011, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be used to understand patterns of trade, capital, information, and people flows.&lt;ref name=world&gt;''World 3.0: Global Prosperity and How to Achieve it'', Pankaj Ghemawat, Harvard Business Review Press, 2011, pp.54-60&lt;/ref&gt; The framework was developed by [[Pankaj Ghemawat]], a professor at the [[University of Navarra]] - [[IESE Business School]] in Barcelona, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Pankaj Ghemawat official website: http://www.ghemawat.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The impacts of CAGE distances and differences have been demonstrated quantitatively via gravity models.  Such models "resemble [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravitation]] in linking interactions between countries to the product of their sizes (usually their gross domestic products) divided by some composite measure of distance."&lt;ref name=world /&gt;

==Components==

The table&lt;ref name=redefining /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Distance still matters. The hard reality of global expansion.'', Pankaj Ghemawat, Harvard Business Review , 79, no.8, 2001, p137-147&lt;/ref&gt; shown below provides more detail on each of the CAGE categories, and how they can manifest themselves depending on whether one is comparing a pair of countries or looking at one in isolation.  One of the distinctions between the CAGE Framework and other country analysis frameworks is its inclusion of '''bilateral''' as well as '''unilateral factors'''.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Cultural Distance
! Administrative Distance
! Geographic Distance
! Economic Distance
|-
| '''Country Pairs (Bilateral)'''
|
* Different languages
* Different ethnicities; lack of connective ethnic or social networks
* Different religions
* Lack of trust
* Different values, norms, and dispositions
| 
* Lack of colonial ties
* Lack of shared regional trading bloc
* Lack of common currency
* Political hostility
| 
* Physical distance
* Lack of land border
* Differences in time zones
* Differences in climates / disease environments
| 
* Rich/poor differences
* Other differences in cost or quality of natural resources, financial resources, human resources, infrastructure, information or knowledge
|-
| '''Countries (Unilateral / Multilateral)'''
| 
* Insularity
* Traditionalism
| 
* Nonmarket/closed economy (home bias vs. foreign bias)
* Lack of membership in international organizations
* Weak institutions, corruption
| 
* Landlockedness
* Lack of internal navigability
* Geographic size
* Geographic remoteness
* Weak transportation or communication links
| 
* Economic size
* Low per capita income
|}&lt;ref name=redefining&gt;''Redefining Global Strategy: Crossing Borders in a World Where Differences Still Matter'', Pankaj Ghemawat, Harvard Business School Press, 2007, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical Use==
Ghemawat offers some advice on how the CAGE Framework can help managers considering international strategies:
* It makes distance visible for managers.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;
* It helps to pinpoint the differences across countries that might handicap multinational companies relative to local competitors.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;
* It can shed light on the relative position of multinationals from different countries.  For example, it can help explain the strength of Spanish firms in many industries across Latin America.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;
* It can be used to compare markets from the perspective of a particular company.  One method to conduct quantitative analysis of this type is to discount (specifically, divide) raw measures of market size or potential with measures of distance, broadly defined.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;

Ghemawat emphasizes that different types of distance matter to different extents depending on the industry.  Because geographic distance, for instance, affects the costs of transportation, it is of particular importance to companies dealing in heavy or bulky products.  Cultural distance, on the other hand, affects consumers’ product preferences. It should be a crucial consideration for a consumer goods or media company, but it is much less important for a cement or steel business.&lt;ref name=cases /&gt;

To facilitate quantitative analysis based on the CAGE framework, Prof. Ghemawat has developed an online tool called the CAGE Comparator. The CAGE Comparator covers 163 home countries and 65 industries, and allows users to customize the impacts of 16 types of CAGE distance.&lt;ref name=cage&gt;CAGE Comparator: http://www.ghemawat.com/cage/&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Ghemawat recommends using the CAGE framework together with the '''ADDING Value Scorecard''' and the '''AAA Strategies'''.&lt;ref name=casesone&gt;''Cases about Redefining Global Strategy'', Pankaj Ghemawat and Jordan Siegel, Harvard Business Review Press, 2011, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Cite canlaw|short title  ='''Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act'''|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =C-36| |link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/index.html}}("CCAA") ({{lang-fr|Loi sur les arrangements avec les créanciers des compagnies}}) is a statute of the [[Parliament of Canada]] that allows [[insolvent]] corporations owing their creditors in excess of $5 million to [[restructuring|restructure]] their business and financial affairs.

==The CCAA within the Canadian insolvency regime==

In 1990, the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] discussed the background behind the introduction of the CCAA in one of its rulings:

{{quote|The ''CCAA'' was enacted by Parliament in 1933 when the nation and the world were in the grip of an economic depression. When a company became insolvent liquidation followed because that was the consequence of the only insolvency legislation which then existed - the ''Bankruptcy Act'' and the ''Winding-Up Act''. Almost inevitably liquidation destroyed the shareholders' investment, yielded little by way of recovery to the creditors, and exacerbated the social evil of devastating levels of unemployment.  The government of the day sought, through the ''CCAA'', to create a regime whereby the principals of the company and the creditors could be brought together under the supervision of the court to attempt a reorganization or compromise or arrangement under which the company could continue in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Chef Ready Foods Ltd. v. Hongkong Bank of Canada|link=|year=1990|court=bcca|num=529|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1991] 2 WWR 136|date=1990-10-29|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] did not have a chance to explain the nature of the CCAA until the groundbreaking case of ''[[Century Services Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'' in 2010. In it, a detailed analysis was given in explaining the nature of insolvency law in Canada.

The ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'' (BIA) provides a more rules-based approach for resolving a corporate debtor's insolvency, which must be observed strictly. The CCAA, on the other hand, provides a more discretionary approach that is remedial in nature, which therefore must be broadly construed.

Although the CCAA was originally enacted in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;''Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, 1933'', S.C. 1932‑33, c. 36&lt;/ref&gt; extensive use of it only began in the economic downturn of the early 1980s. Recent legislative amendments of the BIA and CCAA have served to harmonize key aspects, such as the use of single proceedings, a common priority of claims structure, and encouraging reorganization over liquidation.

===Discretionary power of the court in a CCAA reorganization===

{{quote|The legislation is remedial in the purest sense in that it provides a means whereby the devastating social and economic effects of bankruptcy or creditor initiated termination of ongoing business operations can be avoided while a court-supervised attempt to reorganize the financial affairs of the debtor company is made.|- {{cite CanLII|litigants=Elan Corp. v. Comiskey|link=|year=1990|court=onca|num=6979|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=1 OR (3d) 289|date=1990-11-02|courtname=auto|juris=}}, per Doherty J.A., dissenting}}

This is noted together with s. 11 of the CCAA, which states that a court may, "subject to the restrictions set out in this Act, . . . make any order that it considers appropriate in the circumstances".&lt;ref name ="ccaas11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision notes the interrelated nature of proceedings under the CCAA and BIA:

{{quote|[77] The CCAA creates conditions for preserving the ''[[status quo]]'' while attempts are made to find common ground amongst stakeholders for a reorganization that is fair to all.  Because the alternative to reorganization is often bankruptcy, participants will measure the impact of a reorganization against the position they would enjoy in liquidation. In the case at bar, the order fostered a harmonious transition between reorganization and liquidation while meeting the objective of a single collective proceeding that is common to both statutes.}}

==Application of the Act==
{{See also|Commercial insolvency in Canada}}

===Eligibility===
The scope of the CCAA is quite broad. It applies to any [[debtor]] company (or group of affiliated companies) that owes more than $5 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-2.html#h-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; other than:
:*banks
:*insurance companies
:*trust and loan companies
:*railway and telegraph companies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 2, definition of "company" | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-1.html#h-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and:
:* is either [[bankrupt]] or [[insolvent]]
:* has committed an act of bankruptcy under the  ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'' ("BIA") or is deemed insolvent under the ''[[Winding-Up and Restructuring Act]]'' ("WRA"), whether or not proceedings have been initiated under either of those Acts
:* has made an assignment, or has been made subject to a bankruptcy [[Court order|order]], under the BIA, or
:* is being [[winding up|wound up]] under the WRA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 2, definition of "debtor company" | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-1.html#h-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debtor protection===
No person may terminate or amend — or claim an accelerated payment or forfeiture of the term under — any agreement, including a security agreement, with any debtor company subject to the CCAA by reason only that proceedings commenced under the CCAA or that the company is insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 34(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agreements can be assigned&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or disclaimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 32 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the debtor company as a result of the proceeding, by following prescribed procedures. These provisions extend beyond being used only within restructuring plans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Timminco Limited|link=|year=2012|source=onsc|num=4471|pinpoint=par. 51|parallelcite=|date=2012-08-03|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the courts have held that there is "no reason…why the same analysis cannot apply during a sale process that requires the business to be carried as a going concern",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Sproule v. Nortel Networks Corporation|link=|year=2009|source=onca|num=833|pinpoint=par. 46|parallelcite=|date=2009-11-26|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1 = Aubrey E. Kauffman|author2 = R. Graham Phoenix|title = Ontario Court reinforces use of CCAA disclaimer provisions in the context of a sale process|url = http://www.fasken.com/en/ontario-court-reinforces-use-of-ccaa-disclaimer-provisions-the-context-sale-process/|publisher = [[Fasken Martineau]]|date = 2012-08-15|accessdate = 2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* there is no requirement that a plan of compromise or arrangement be imminent
:* the court will take into account whether refusing a disclaimer would have the effect of enhancing the position of the counter-party
:* whether a counter-party would suffer significant financial hardship if the disclaimer is allowed is a subjective test

===Approval of the compromise or arrangement===

Negotiated compromises and arrangements may deal with any matter, including claims against directors and amendments to the [[articles of incorporation]] or [[letters patent]] incorporating the company. When they have been approved by each participating class of creditors (by a two-thirds vote by value of the claims involved) the court may then approve it, and it will be binding on all persons, including trustees in bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 6 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They cannot be approved by the court if provision is not made for settling "super priority" claims (as they are known under the BIA) relating to:
:* compensation and reimbursement claims by employees other than officers and directors&lt;ref&gt;CCAA, S. 6(5)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* pension plan contributions (except where agreement has been reached with the relevant pension regulator)&lt;ref&gt;CCAA, S. 6(6)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* source deductions due on employee withholdings&lt;ref&gt;CCAA, S. 6(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, no amounts relating to "equity claims"&lt;ref&gt;defined under CCAA, S. 22.1&lt;/ref&gt; may be authorized by the court under a compromise or arrangement until all other claims are first paid in full.&lt;ref&gt;CCAA, S. 6(8)&lt;/ref&gt; "Equity claims" have been held to include any claims shareholders may have against third parties in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Sino-Forest'' {{emdash}} Subordination of equity interests and collateral damage| url = http://www.blg.com/en/home/publications/Documents/Publication_3126.pdf|publisher = [[Borden Ladner Gervais]]|date = August 2012|accessdate = 2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Sino-Forest'': Ontario Court of Appeal Agrees that Indemnity Claims of Auditors and Underwriters are Equity Claims| url = http://www.dwpv.com/en/Resources/Publications/2012/Sino-%20orest%20Ontario%20Court%20of%20Appeal%20Agrees%20that%20Indemnity%20Claims%20of%20Auditors%20and%20Underwriters%20are%20Equity%20Claims|publisher = [[Davies Ward Phillips &amp; Vineberg]]|date = 2012-11-29|accessdate = 2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Sino-Forest Corporation (Re)|link=|year=2012|source=onca|num=816|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2012-11-23|courtname=|juris=}}, affirming {{cite CanLII|litigants=Sino-Forest Corporation (Re)|link=|year=2012|source=onsc|num=4377|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2012-07-27|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers of the court==
Any interested person may apply to the court for an order under the Act.&lt;ref name ="ccaas11" /&gt; This is normally the debtor company, but a [[creditor]] can also do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Stephanie A.F. Grace |title = Creditor Initiated CCAA Proceedings | url = http://www.airdberlis.com/Templates/Articles/ArticleEdit.aspx?ArticleID=596&amp;page=14 | publisher = Aird &amp; Berlis | date = 2009-12-02 | accessdate = 2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court having jurisdiction is the superior court for the province in which the company's head office or chief place of business in Canada, or, in the absence of that, where any of its assets are situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 9 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-4.html#h-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the application is made, the court is required to appoint a monitor with respect to the business and financial affairs of the company, who must be a [[trustee in bankruptcy]] under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.7 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monitor is required to investigate and report back to the court on the company, advise the court with respect to any actions that need to be taken, and to carry out any other functions in relation to the company that the court may direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 23 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-23.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a creditor is secured or unsecured is governed by the BIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Jackie Moher |title = SCC Holds No Priority for GST Claims in CCAA Proceedings | url = http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=4539 | publisher = [[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon]] | date = 2011-02-02 | accessdate = 2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the court is not bound to accept an application under the Act, and it can terminate previously granted orders (and even declare them to have been void ''[[ab initio]]'') where an applicant has not made full and fair disclosure of all material facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = Pamela Huff|author2 = Matthew Kanter|title = CanaSea Group: Full and Fair Disclosure Required in ''ex parte CCAA'' Applications|url = http://www.blakes.com/English/Resources/Bulletins/Pages/Details.aspx?BulletinID=2055|date = 22 January 2015|publisher = [[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon]]}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re CanaSea PetroGas Group Holdings Limited|link=|year=2014|court=onsc|num=824|date=2014-11-20|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a petition for CCAA relief appears to be more like a defensive tactic than a ''[[bona fide]]'' attempt to restructure, it may prefer to order receivership instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = Steven Golick|author2 = Andrea Lockhart|title = To Restructure or Liquidate? – That is the Question: Dueling CCAA and Receivership Applications|url = http://business-finance-restructuring.weil.com/north-of-the-border-update/to-restructure-or-liquidate-that-is-the-question-dueling-ccaa-and-receivership-applications/|date = 27 February 2012|publisher = Bankruptcy Blog}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Callidus Capital Corp v Carcap Inc|link=|year=2012|court=onsc|num=163|date=2012-01-05|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stay of proceedings===

Where no such compromise or arrangement has been negotiated, the court, on application, may issue an order, lasting for 30 days,
:* staying,
:* restraining from continuing, or
:* prohibiting from commencing,

:* it will be difficult for a secured party to obtain relief where the effect of doing so would be to prevent the debtor from continuing to carry on business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lifting the stay – is the "doomed to fail" argument doomed to fail?|author1 = Adam Maerov|author2 = Jennifer Cockbill|url = http://www.mcmillan.ca/lifting-the-stay--is-the-doomed-to-fail-argument-doomed-to-fail|publisher = [[McMillan LLP]]|date = September 2012|accessdate = 2012-09-21}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Azure Dynamics Corp.|link=|year=2012|court=bcsc|num=781|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2012-04-13|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* however, lifting a stay may be more possible in a liquidating CCAA proceeding, having regard for the need to balance stakeholder interests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lift Stay Motion More Likely to Succeed in a Liquidating CCAA|author1 = Jeffrey Levine|author2 = Stephen Brown-Okruhlik|url = http://www.mcmillan.ca/Lift-Stay-Motion-More-Likely-to-Succeed-in-a-Liquidating-CCAA|publisher = [[McMillan LLP]]|date = November 2013|accessdate = 2013-11-29}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Puratone et al|link=|year=2013|court=mbqb|num=171|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2013-07-08|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provision is made for such stays not affecting investigations undertaken by any regulatory body (other than with respect to any payment that may be ordered), but the court can order the cancellation of such exemption where:

:* a viable compromise or arrangement could not otherwise be made in respect of the company, and
:* it is not contrary to the public interest that the regulatory body be affected by such order&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as noted in ''[[Newfoundland and Labrador v. AbitibiBowater Inc.]]'', not all payments required under regulatory orders constitute claims under the ''CCAA'' and are thus subject to stay. Subsequent jurisprudence suggests that determining the status of such orders will be case-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Court of Appeal weighs conflicting MOE and CCAA orders|url = |publisher = [[Borden Ladner Gervais]]|date = 2013-10-10}}, discussing {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Nortel Networks Corporation|link=|year=2013|court=onca|num=599|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2013-10-03|courtname=|juris=}} and {{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Northstar Aerospace Inc.|link=|year=2013|court=onca|num=600|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2013-10-03|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope===

In addition, the court has broad discretion in administering any other issues that may arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = John Sandrelli | title = Jurisdiction of the court in CCAA proceedings: Inherent jurisdiction vs statutory discretion | url = http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/2634262_Jursidiction_of_the_Court_in_CCA.pdf | publisher = [[Fraser Milner Casgrain]] | date = 2005-09-15/16 | accessdate = 2011-09-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120329040843/http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/2634262_Jursidiction_of_the_Court_in_CCA.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Act says,

{{quote| ...the court, on the application of any person interested in the matter, may ... make any order that it considers appropriate in the circumstances.&lt;ref name ="ccaas11" /&gt;}}

===Stability during proceedings===

In order to assure that the company's operations will continue during the proceedings, the court has power to declare that the assets of the company are subject to a security or charge with respect to certain matters, and may further order that such charges rank ahead of those of secured creditors. They include:

:* arrangements similar to [[debtor-in-possession financing]] for sustaining the company's operations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.2 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Carole Hunter |author2=Jonathan Levin |author3=Edmund F.B.

:* payments to specified suppliers for continuing to provide goods or services that are critical to the company's operation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 11.4 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* indemnification for directors and officers for actions done after the commencement of proceedings, where appropriate insurance coverage is not in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 11.51 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.51.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "super priority" status is construed broadly, and has been held to even defeat statutory deemed trusts (such as those concerning pension plan deficiencies and vacation pay that exist in Ontario),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v. United Steelworkers|link=Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v.

===Other powers===

The court may also order:

:* the removal of directors if they are unreasonably impairing (or likely to unreasonably impair) the possibility of a viable compromise or arrangement being made in respect of the company, or are acting (or likely to act) inappropriately as a director in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 11.5 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-11.5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* recovery of amounts arising from [[fraudulent preference]]s and [[undervalue transaction]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 36.1 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/section-36.1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of CCAA with other bankruptcy protection proceedings==

The CCAA has been described as being similar in nature to [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] proceedings in the United States and to [[Administration (law)|administration proceedings]] and [[Insolvency Act 1986|company voluntary arrangements]] ("CVAs") in the United Kingdom. Differences between the various proceedings include the following highlights:

'''EASA CS-23''' is the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] '''C'''ertification '''S'''pecification for Normal, Utility, Aerobatic, and Commuter Category Aeroplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EASA CS-23 Takes Effect On Aug. 15 |url=http://aviationweek.com/bca/easa-cs-23-takes-effect-aug-15 |website=Aviation Week |publisher=Aviation Week |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The somewhat relaxed certification procedure is available for aircraft satisfying the following criteria:

* Single-engine aeroplanes in the normal, utility and aerobatic categories that have a seating configuration, excluding the pilot seat(s), of 9 or fewer and a maximum certificated take-off weight MTOW of 5670&amp;nbsp;kg (12 500&amp;nbsp;lb) or less (these aircraft are also known as class B under EU-OPS 1),
* Twin-engined propeller-driven aeroplanes in the commuter category that have a seating configuration, excluding the pilot seat(s), of 19 or fewer and a maximum certificated take-off weight of 8618&amp;nbsp;kg (19 000&amp;nbsp;lb) or less (some of these aircraft are also known as class C under EU-OPS 1),
* Aeroplanes in this category can be used for flying in VFR, SVFR, NVFR and IFR conditions day and night and also in known icing conditions if they are equipped so,
* Aeroplane in this category can be pressurized

The main part of professional pilots training is done on this category. Example of typical CS-23 aeroplanes: [[Cessna 152]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safety Aspects of Light Aircraft Spin Resistance Concept |url=https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/EASA_REP_RESEA_2008_3.pdf |website=EASA |publisher=EASA |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diamond DA20]], [[Cessna 172]], [[Piper PA-28 Cherokee]] [[Cessna 182]], [[Mooney M20]], [[Beechcraft Bonanza]], [[Diamond DA42]], [[Piper PA-34 Seneca]], [[Piper PA-46]], [[Beechcraft King Air]], [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19427">'''Fair debt collection''' broadly refers to regulation of the United States debt collection industry at both the federal and state level. At the Federal level, it is primarily governed by the [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]] (FDCPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Debt Collection Practices Act|url=https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text|website=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDCPAel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Your Rights Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer-protection/your-rights-under-fair-debt-collection-practices-act-fdcpa|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many [[U.S. state]]s also have debt collection laws that regulate the credit and collection industry and give consumer debtors protection from abusive and deceptive practices.&lt;ref name="CFBP1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are there laws that limit what debt collectors can say or do?|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/329/are-there-laws-that-limit-what-debt-collectors-can-say-or-do.html|website=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many state laws track the language of the FDCPA, so that they are sometimes referred to as ''mini-FDCPAs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stӑnescu|first1=Cătălin Gabriel|title=Self-Help, Private Debt Collection and the Concomitant Risks: A Comparative Law Analysis|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-21503-7|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State regulation ==
U.S. state laws on fair debt collection generally fall into two categories:  laws which require persons who are collecting debts from consumers to be licensed, registered or bonded in order to collect from consumers in their states, and laws that protect consumers from specific unfair practices by debt collectors, which may include [[collection agency|collection agencies]] and sometimes original [[creditor]]s.&lt;ref name="CFBP1"/&gt;  Unlike the FDCPA, many state laws also apply to the debt collection activity of original creditors, thus providing greater protections to consumers than the Federal FDCPA.&lt;ref name="FDCPAel"/&gt;

Although not all states have such laws, some states track violations of debt collection practices laws.  Some states bar debt collectors from engaging in collection activity against residents of the state unless the collection agency has complied with state licensing or bonding requirements, while others exempt out-of-state collectors from those requirements. Many state fair debt collection laws provide for a private right of action (consumers can sue the debt collector) by consumers against debt collectors that violate their provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Statutes Regarding Collection Practices for Commercial / Business Debt.|url=http://www.burtcollect.com/debt-collection-laws-state/|website=Burt &amp; Associates|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of prohibitions of unfair practices by collectors include contacting employers after having been given notice not to do so, pretending to be a government agency, pretending to be an attorney or falsely threatening a debtor with a lawsuit.&lt;ref name="FDCPAel"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3273">'''Fairfax Mastick Cone''' (21 February 1903 &amp;ndash; June 20, 1977) or '''Fax Cone''', was an [[United States|American]] [[businessperson]], advertising [[corporate officer|executive]] and the former director of the [[American Association of Advertising Agencies]].

== Early years ==
Cone's father was a prospector and a mining engineer. His mother, Isabelle Fairfax Williams (1869–1940), was a schoolteacher in [[San Francisco]]. In 1921 Cone enrolled at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], originally intending to be an illustrator.  Eventually he graduated with a degree in [[English language|English]].  Due to a problem with his credentials, Cone got a job as an advertising clerk with the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' rather than a teaching fellowship.  In 1928, Cone left the paper for an advertising agency, thus embarking on a career that would leave an indelible mark on his life.

== Advertising career ==
After a year with the L.H. Waldron advertising agency, Cone joined [[Lord and Thomas]] as a copywriter.  Despite health problems stemming from an over-active [[pancreas]], Cone steadily rose up the corporate ladder, eventually impressing the head of the firm, [[Albert Lasker]].

In 1941, Lasker wished to retire and liquidate Lord and Thomas, but he passed of the bulk of the agency's clients to three of his rising stars; [[Emerson Foote]], [[Don Belding]], and Cone.  On December 29, 1942, the three opened a new agency, [[Foote, Cone and Belding]].

Following the retirements of Foote and Belding (whose positions were subsequently filled by others), Cone became the last of the three founders on the [[Board of Directors]], a position he retained until 1975.  In 1946, he became the director of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. He is sometimes called the "father of modern advertising" and is a member of the [[American National Business Hall of Fame]]. He died in [[Monterey, California]].

== Quotations ==
* Advertising is what you do when you can't go see somebody. That's all it is.{{citationneeded|date=April 2013}}
* There is no such thing as a Mass Mind. The Mass Audience is made up of individuals, and good advertising is written always from one person to another. When it is aimed at millions it rarely moves anyone.{{citationneeded|date=April 2013}}
* The inventory goes down the elevator every night.

Out came Fairfax Mastick Cone, then 38, with what soon became the cigarette slogan of the '40s: 'With men who know tobacco best . . . it's Luckies two to one.' When he retired a year later, Lasker was apparently still amazed by his upstart protége's Lucky stroke: in any event, Lasker sold his agency to Cone and two other staffers at a gift price of $167,500. Now known as Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Inc."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2197">The '''Financial Stability Institute''' (FSI) is one of the bodies hosted by the [[Bank of International Settlements]] (BIS) at its headquarters in [[Basel]]. Established in 1999 by the BIS and the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]], its primary role is to improve the co-ordination between national [[Banking|banks]] [[Regulatory agency|regulators]] through holding seminars and acting as a [[wikt:clearing house|clearing house]] for information on regulatory practice.

It was set up in response to the [[East Asian financial crisis]] of 1997, as the result of a perceived weakness in co-ordination between national regulators in matters of training and general understanding of financial systems. As a result, its work is concentrated in the regulators of the non-[[Group of Ten (economic)|G-10]] nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/conf/conf44/cf44_11.pdf A speech John G.

== Life ==
In 1931 Gerald Nagler and his family moved from Vienna to [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Nagler/nagler-con1.html&lt;/ref&gt; After earning his degree Gerald Nagler worked at his father's company, which he eventually left in 1982. He became deeply involved with the support of Soviet dissidents and Jewish refuseniks working together with Andrei Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner.

From 1992 to 2004 he was leading the Swedish Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and he has been its honorary president up to now. The organisation has changed its name to Civil Rights Defenders.

Since 2009 Nagler is member of the [[Austrian Service Abroad#International Council|International Council]] at the [[Austrian Service Abroad]].

Gerald Nagler, Honorary Chair of the Board of Civil Rights Defenders and founder of the Swedish Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, was presented the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art by the Republic of Austria on October 18, 2011.

At the prize ceremony Gerald Nagler’s commitment to human rights and his support of human rights activists in the former Eastern bloc countries was highly praised. By doing this he significantly contributed to [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]].

Between 1984 and 1992 Gerald Nagler was the Secretary General of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights (IHF) in Vienna and Chairman of the Swedish Helsinki Committee (1992-2004). During his career he has built a network of people and organisations to raise awareness about human rights violations and engaged many fellow fighters for the cause of human rights in many countries.

'''Grand Cinemas''' is a [[movie theatre]] chain operating in the [[Middle East]]. 

Established in 2000, the Grand Cinemas franchise was originally run by [[Dubai]]-based [[Gulf Film|Gulf Film LLC]], branding several theatres throughout the [[United Arab Emirates]] it had been operating since 1989. In 2007, one of Gulf Film LLC's co-founders, Lebanese businessman Selim Ramia, established a separate corporation in [[Lebanon]] called Selim Ramia &amp; Co. (SR&amp;CO) as the owner of the Grand Cinemas franchise in the country. Since July 2007, Grand Cinemas took over several established theatres in Lebanon, mostly outlets formerly run by [[Circuit Planète]]. In 2012, SR&amp;CO have successfully expanded the Grand Cinemas franchise into [[Jordan]] and [[Kuwait]]. Gulf Film LLC itself expanded Grand Cinemas into Qatar and Bahrain in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

Circa 2012, the original franchise owner Gulf Film LLC was acquired by the [[ELAN Group]] (formerly Qatar Media Services), and by 2014, all Grand Cinemas theatres it operated at the time were rebranded as [[Novo Cinemas]]. The Grand Cinemas theatres in Lebanon, Jordan, and Kuwait continue under the management of the SR&amp;CO group.

==History==
The Grand Cinemas brand name was launched in [[Dubai]], United Arab Emirates, in 2000.

Established in 1989 in UAE, [[Gulf Film]] was acquired in 2012 by Qatar Media Services (q.media) (now known as the [[ELAN Group]]). The Grand Cinemas UAE operation is owned by Gulf Film and was relaunched as Novo Cinemas on May 6, 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1430">A '''Greenfield agreement''' is an agreement between a union and a new employer, that does not yet have employees. [http://www.oea.gov.au/graphics.asp?showdoc=/employers/unionGreenfieldAgreement.asp] [http://www.workplaceinfo.com.au/nocookie/alert/2005/051027730.htm].

This has a number of benefits for the [[employer]]. A key advantage is that a greenfield agreement does not require the approval of any employees whose [[employment]] would be subject to the agreement. Basically, there are no employees to negotiate with. Another key benefit is that a greenfield agreement provides an employer with the opportunity to shut out less desirable [[Trade union|unions]] as parties and therefore effectively having a presence at the new business before the employment of any employees.

Greenfield agreements must involve a ''genuinely'' new [[Business|enterprise]]; a business cannot simply initiate a new project and use this as grounds to negotiate a greenfield agreement. [http://www.ablawyers.com.au/ThemakingofGreenfieldAgreementsfornewprojects.htm]

The '''Guggenheim family''' is an American family known for their involvement in the [[mining]] industry and later in [[philanthropy]]. The family is named after the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] village [[Gougenheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D24696.php ''Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
[[Meyer Guggenheim]], a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] citizen of [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] ancestry, arrived in America in 1847.  Over the next few decades, the family became known for their global successes in [[mining]] and [[smelting]], including the [[American Smelting and Refining Company]]. Eventually the family possessed one of the largest fortunes in the world. They sold their global mining interests following [[World War I]], then later purchased [[nitrate]] mines in [[Chile]]. Subsequently, the family largely left direct involvement in running businesses.

Family members became known for their [[philanthropy]] in diverse areas such as [[modern art]] and [[aviation]], including several [[List of Guggenheim Museums|Guggenheim Museum]]s, the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] and [[I. M. Pei]]'s Guggenheim Pavilion at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Medical Center]] in New York City.

A '''high heel policy''' is a regulation or law about the wearing of [[high heels]], which may be required or forbidden in different places and circumstances.

Historically, high heels were used by aristocratic women for cosmetic reasons, to raise their height or to keep their feet and long dresses clean.  The style was then subject to [[sumptuary law|sumptuary]] laws.  In more modern times, [[stiletto heels]] have been restricted when they might damage the floor surface or cause accidents.

Some [[dress code]]s, however, require women to wear high heels so that they appear to be taller and more attractive.  Such footwear may be painful and damage the feet, and there have been repeated protests by women workers against such policies.  In 2016, a British receptionist was dismissed for not wearing high heels and she then started a petition which attracted sufficient support to be considered by the UK Parliament.

== Regulations preventing the wearing of high heels ==

===In history===
In 1430, ''[[chopine]]s'' were {{convert|30|in|cm|0}} high, at times. [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] law then limited the height to three inches—but this regulation was widely ignored.&lt;ref name="DeMello2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&amp;pg=PA311|year=2009|publisher=Greenwood Press/ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 17th-century law in [[Massachusetts]] announced that women would be subjected to the same treatment as witches if they lured men into marriage via the use of high-heeled shoes.&lt;ref name=demello323&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKTACQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA323|date=10 September 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35715-2|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770, an act was introduced into the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British parliament]] which would have applied the same penalties as witchcraft to the use of high heels and other cosmetic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Manners and Customs of the English Nation |author=John Brookes |pages=261–262 |publisher=James Blackwood |year=1859 |quote=In the year 1770 an act was introduced into Parliament against hoops, false hair, high heels...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floor surface concerns===
The pressure under a stiletto heel is greater (per unit of the very small area) than that under the feet of an elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JackGreen.shtml|title=Pressure Under High Heels|last=Green|first=Jack|year=2003|accessdate= 20 December 2012|publisher= ''The Physics Factbook''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as  the very narrow [[stiletto heel]] became more widespread in the 1950s, the owners of many types of buildings became concerned about the effects of large numbers of such heels on their floors, especially in historic and high-traffic public buildings. Specifically, there was concern that the heels would either damage certain types of floor covering or cause minor accidents through heels getting jammed in floor-grills, the gaps in planking, or uneven surfaces. Soft outdoor ground also caused problems, affecting both the surface and the wearer.   Wood flooring was the most vulnerable, but carpets, [[linoleum]], and mosaic floors were also considered at risk of damage.  Signs were frequently posted attempting to ban stiletto heels, though they were generally ineffective.  A 1963 article in a US building maintenance magazine stated, "Replacement of floors is estimated to have cost at least half a billion dollars throughout the country since the advent of the stiletto heel fashion."&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Sanitation and Building Maintenance'', Volume 15, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

When stiletto heels were first sold in Africa, many of the wearers fell through the floors of their homes, not realizing that the floor timbers had been partly removed by [[termite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut van Emden, ''Handbook of Agricultural Entomology'', 2013, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|1118469593}}, 9781118469590, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=79ELgtB-yQQC&amp;pg=PT101 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The  [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] claimed in 1963 that "with style changes the stiletto-heel problem has diminished".&lt;ref&gt;''United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, research note, Forest Products Laboratory'', 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

High heels can represent [[contributory negligence]] by the [[plaintiff]] in American [[personal injury]] cases involving [[slip and fall]] accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Bakken, H. Harvey Cohen, Jon R. Abele, ''Slips, Trips, Missteps, and Their Consequences'', p. 170, Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company, 2007, {{ISBN|1933264012}}, 9781933264011, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aWatvfoR7vQC&amp;pg=PA170 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many high heel policies in the US are related to concerns over the potential for legal claims.{{Citation needed|date = June 2016}}

== Regulations requiring the wearing of high heels ==

=== In media and fashion ===
Some women have challenged the expectation that women should wear high heels in formal social situations. In 2015, a group of women were turned away from a film première at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in France for wearing flat shoes, including a woman physically unable to wear heels due to an operation on one of her feet.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/cannes-festival/emily-blunt-cannes-heel-row/|title=Emily Blunt on Cannes heels row: 'everybody should wear flats'|website=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women complained that this was a sexist policy which forced women into a stereotyped appearance; festival organisers later responded that there was no official policy on footwear and stated that they would remind red carpet officials of this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/cannes-denies-high-heel-rule-women-red-carpet-173653799.html?ref=gs|title=Cannes denies high-heel rule for women on red carpet|website=www.yahoo.com|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In workplaces===
Guidelines on acceptable [[dress code]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the workplace are permitted by Canadian law in order to ensure that employees are able to complete their work safely and effectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millerthomson.com/en/blog/canadian-labour-employment-law-blog/high-heels-in-the-workplace-could-be-high|title=Canadian Labour &amp; Employment Law Blog {{!}} High Heels in the Workplace could be High Risk for Employers {{!}} Miller Thomson|website=www.millerthomson.com|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the inclusion of the wearing of high heels in these guidelines has created controversy. Some workplace studies show that women in the hospitality industry who wear high heels have suffered injuries after tripping, falling or slipping.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, requirements for appearance which differ for male and female employees have the potential to be considered discriminatory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the mid-1990s, several US-based airlines required female [[flight attendants]] to wear shoes with heels. Minimum heel heights ranged from one-half inch to the two inches mandated by [[USAir]].&lt;ref name=marc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=law_pubs |author=Marc Linder |title=Smart Women, Stupid Shoes, and Cynical Employers |publisher=[[University of Iowa]] |date=1 January 1997 |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flight attendants at times avoided censure by changing into more comfortable shoes during flights, since their supervisors were less likely to be present there.&lt;ref name="Banaszak-HollLevitsky2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jane C.

In 2009, the UK [[Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists]] released a report outlining the dangers of wearing high heels for extended periods and approached unions and employers to collaborate on measures to ensure risk assessments would be completed on women's footwear, and to offer alternatives to high heels where these were deemed unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-shoes-heels-idUSTRE58F3WL20090916|title=UK unions spark debate over high heels at work|date=16 September 2009|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies that force women to wear heels have been challenged in a number of locations. In 2001, [[cocktail waitress]]es in [[Las Vegas]] organised a "Kiss My Foot" campaign which was successful in getting casinos to relax their requirement to wear high heels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=43 |title=Casino Women: Courage in Unexpected Places |first1=Susan |last1=Chandler |first2=Jill |last2=Jones |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780801450143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, waitresses at three restaurant chains in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada, claimed that they were required to wear high heels at work despite complaining of pain and injury. Management responded that there was no written policy on wearing high heels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2052233/original-joes-boston-pizza-servers-claim-mandatory-high-heel-policies/ |title=Original Joe's, Boston Pizza servers claim mandatory high heel policies |last=Hart |first=Danielle |website=Global News |access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Israeli airline [[El Al]] introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2063591/i-dont-think-the-girls-thought-they-could-question-it-high-heels-policy-study-author/|title='I don't think the girls thought they could question it': high heels policy study author |last=Tucker |first=Erika |website=Global News |access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airline's workers' union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule.

Similar policies were tested again in the UK in 2016 when a [[temporary work|temporary receptionist]], [[Nicola Thorp]], was sent home unpaid after she refused to follow the dress code at the office of accountants [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. Outsourcing firm Portico stated that Thorp "had signed the appearance guidelines" but after Thorp launched an online petition—"Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work"—the firm changed their policy. The new guideline states that all female employees "can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer."&lt;ref name="Guard-1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Chris |title=Woman's high-heel petition receives 100,000-plus signatures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/nicola-thorp-high-heel-petition-receives-100000-plus-signatures|accessdate=13 May 2016|work=the Guardian|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition gained widespread support from public figures such as Scotland's First Minister [[Nicola Sturgeon]] and [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] [[Caroline Dinenage]], [[Margot James]] and [[Tulip Siddiq]].&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite news|last=McIntosh|first=Lindsay|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heel-loving-sturgeon-steps-into-shoe-debate-vv2nlh825 |title=Heel-loving Sturgeon steps into shoe debate |work=The Times|location=London |date=16 May 2016|accessdate=7 March 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tele-1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yorke|first1=Harry|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/12/firm-accused-of-sexism-in-high-heels-row-forced-to-change-its-dr/ |title=MPs back temp worker’s campaign to end 'sexist' high heel policy |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; the company had already changed its terms of employment.&lt;ref name="McIntosh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilefsky|first=Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/europe/uk-parliament-nicola-thorp-heels.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0|title=British Woman’s Revolt Against High Heels Becomes a Cause in Parliament|work=The New York Times|date=6 March 2017|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The petition gained over 130,000 signatures, sufficient for a debate in the British parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kaur Grewal|first=Herpreet |url=http://www.fm-world.co.uk/news/fm-industry-news/temps-high-heels-petition-heads-for-parliament/ |title=Temp's 'high heels' petition heads for Parliament |date=17 May 2016 |journal=FM World}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took place on 6 March 2017, when MPs decided the UK government should change the law to prevent the demand being made by employers.&lt;ref name="Hansard"&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |title=Workplace Dress Codes (High Heels) |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-03-06/debates/58CDA5AC-D655-43F4-BDD8-3D1370BCB076/WorkplaceDressCodes%28HighHeels%29 |house=[[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]] |date= 6 March 2017 |column_start=198WH |column_end=216WH |speaker=[[Helen Jones]] |position=the [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] for [[Warrington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Warrington North]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; However, this was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was "adequate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39667912|title=High heels row: Petition for work dress code law rejected|date=21 April 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=21 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] amended workplace legislation to prevent employers from requiring women to wear high heels at work. British Columbia premier [[Christy Clark]] stated that the government was "changing this regulation to stop this unsafe and discriminatory practice."&lt;ref name="guardian-8apr2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collig|first1=Pádraig|title=Canadian province makes it illegal to require women to wear high heels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/08/canadian-province-makes-it-illegal-to-require-women-to-wear-high-heels|accessdate=8 April 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2017, [[the Philippines]] forbid companies from mandating that female employees have to wear high heels at work.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/philippines-women/philippines-bans-mandatory-high-heels-at-work-idUSL8N1M637F&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute of Accounting and Commerce (IAC) was established in 1927 as a provider of distance learning education and a professional management institute.
In 2009 the Institute changed to become a professional [[accounting]] membership body only and is registered in [[South Africa]] as a non-profit company (NPC) (Reg. No. 1981/011981/08).

In terms of section 60 of the close corporations act 69 of 1984, the IAC registers Accounting Officers

'''Sir James Burns''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] (10 February 1846{{spaced ndash}}22 August 1923) was a noted businessman, shipowner and philanthropist in Australia. In particular, he is known as the co-founder of [[Burns Philp]] and Company, a shipping and trading company, and for establishing the Burnside Presbyterian Homes for Children in [[North Parramatta, New South Wales|North Parramatta]] (now known as UnitingCare Burnside), a children and family welfare organisation.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

==Early life==

Burns was born at [[Polmont]], Stirlingshire, [[Scotland]], the son of a merchant, David Burns, and educated at [[University of Edinburgh|Newington Academy]] and the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] in Edinburgh.  He migrated to [[Queensland]] in 1862 and worked for three years in Western Queensland as a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]].  In 1865 he formed a [[Brisbane]] store, Burns &amp; Scott, in partnership with his brother, and established the first stores in [[Gympie]] and nearby One Mile Creek and [[Kilkivan, Queensland|Kilkivan]] in 1867, when gold was found there.  He sold his interests and returned to Scotland in 1870 after the death of his father.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; He briefly visited France as an observer and assistant in relief efforts after the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871 before returning to Queensland.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Business and other Activities==

In 1871, Burns returned to North Queensland to establish a new trading company in [[Townsville]]. He later loaned [[Robert Philp]] enough money to become a partner in the enterprise. The company thrived through ownership of sail and steam powered trading ships, initially leased to ensure a steady supply of goods between Queensland and Sydney. This formed the basis of the Queensland Steam Shipping Company Limited, later amalgamated into [[Burns Philp|Burns Philp and Company]], which remains as a major trading company today. The shipping expanded into various ports in the [[East Indies]] and the [[Pacific Islands]], and the company branched into various trading endeavours throughout the following decades.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;
 
In addition to establishing [[Burns Philp and Company]], his business interests include serving as chairman of the (North) Queensland Insurance Co. Ltd in 1886–1923, the New South Wales Mortgage, Land, and Agency Co. and the Solomon Islands Development Co. Ltd. He was also a director of the [[AMP Limited|Australian Mutual Provident Society]], the Sydney Exchange Co., the Bank of North Queensland, and various collieries, as well as owning extensive Queensland pastoral properties.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 4 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns served on a royal commission of inquiry into railway administration in 1906 and was appointed to the [[Legislative Council of New South Wales]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt; 
He joined the Parramatta troop of the 1st Light Horse Regiment (New South Wales Lancers) as a trooper in June 1891 and was immediately promoted Captain, and became Major in January 1896. From September 1897 to June 1903 he commanded the regiment as its Lieutenant-Colonel. He was promoted to Colonel in July 1903 and commanded the 1st Australian Light Horse Brigade until January 1907, when he retired.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Burns was president of the Caledonian Society for twenty years. During [[World War I]] Burns helped establish a scheme for insuring enlisted men with dependants, personally contributing £2000 a year during the duration of the war.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

==Later life==
From the 1880s, Burns was based at a property known as Gowan Brae, North of [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]]. He retired from government and business activities due to ill health in 1908, and lived at Gowan Brae from that time on. Shortly afterwards, he approached the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]], suggesting that they establish a Presbyterian home for children. In 1910 he endowed some of the Gowan Brae property, to establish the Presbyterian Homes for Children (later renamed Burnside and currently known as UnitingCare Burnside&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title =About Burnside
  | publisher =UnitingCare Burnside
  | url =http://www.burnside.org.au/organisation/page.cfm?id=4
  | accessdate = 5 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and was chairman of its board for ten years.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; It became his passion in his "retired" years, as he made numerous contributions towards new homes and the children. His business and government connections ensured that donations from other sources were also forthcoming, with houses named after sponsors and officially opened by dignitaries.

Burns continued to live at Gowan Brae until his death and was buried there in a family cemetery.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He left the property to his son, James, but suggested that, should James not need the property, it should be given to the (then) Burnside Presbyterian Orphans Homes. James honoured this request, and the property was donated.&lt;ref name=stb/&gt;
  
Much of the land has since been sold or leased to other organisations, or as residential developments.  The property immediately around Gowan Brae is now owned by [[The King's School, Sydney|The Kings School]], while sections of the property are now owned by the [[Redeemer Baptist School]] and [[Tara Anglican School for Girls]], with some still owned by the [[Synod of New South Wales and the ACT]] of the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] for Burnside's own operations and the synod's activities such as the archives, Camden Library and the Uniting Theological College.

'''Juha Petri Sipilä''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈjuhɑ ˈsipilæ}}; born in [[Veteli]], 25 April 1961) is the current [[Prime Minister of Finland]]. A relative newcomer to politics, he has a successful background in business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euronews.com/2015/04/19/opposition-leader-juha-sipila-wins-elections-in-finland/&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been the [[Centre Party (Finland)|leader of the Centre Party]] since 9 June 2012. After leading the Centre party to victory in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2015|2015 general election]], Sipilä formed a [[Sipilä Cabinet|centre-right coalition]] and was appointed Prime Minister by the [[Finnish Parliament]] on 29 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://yle.fi/uutiset/mps_vote_sipila_in_as_prime_minister__result_not_unanimous/8025742 YLE News: MPs vote Sipilä in as prime minister- result not unanimous. 28 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and military service==
Sipilä graduated from [[Puolanka]] [[Gymnasium (school)#Northern European countries|lukio]] (Finland's university-preparatory high school), completing the [[Matriculation exam (Finland)|matriculation examination]] with high marks in 1980.&lt;ref name="Koskinen1"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iltasanomat.fi/vaalit2015/art-1427799759029.html| title = Näin Juha Sipilä on muuttunut – katso lukio-, hää- ja lapsuuskuvat| work = Iltasanomat| author=Mika Koskinen | date=March 31, 2015| accessdate = August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Sipilä earned his [[diplomi-insinööri|Master's degree in science (technology)]] from the [[University of Oulu]].

Sipilä has the rank of Captain in the reserves of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]].&lt;ref name="military"/&gt;

==Business==
Sipilä's career started at Lauri Kuokkanen Ltd., first as a thesis worker and later as a product development manager.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Changing jobs, he became a partner and later CEO at Solitra Oy.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In 1998, Sipilä started his own business, Fortel Invest Oy. In 2002–2005 he worked as the CEO of [[Elektrobit]] Oyj, then returned to his own business.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Sipilä was managing director of Solitra in 1992 and became the main owner in 1994. Sipilä sold Solitra to American [[ADC Telecommunications]] in 1996, becoming a multimillionaire from the proceeds. Business ADC Mersum Oy was resold to Remec in 2001.&lt;ref name=0Kaleva&gt;[http://htf.kaleva.fi/index.cfm?j=371030 Yritysuutiset8.1.2004]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kilpailuvirasto.fi/cgi-bin/suomi.cgi?luku=yrityskauppavalvonta/yrityskaupparatkaisut&amp;sivu=ratk/r-2001-81-0935 Yrityskaupan hyväksyminen; Remec, Inc. / ADC Mersum Oy] 26.10.2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Sipilä's income was the highest in Finland. According to ''Ilta-Sanomat'' he has been on the Board of Directors of 120 companies.&lt;ref&gt;Vaatimaton miljonääri Ilta-Sanomat 12.6.2012 s.6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chempolis Involvement ===
Juha Sipilä was part-owner in the start-up company Chempolis. According to MOT Program (YLE) in 2012, Chempolis had received 10 million euros in public funds over 15 years along with extra funds from the Finnish Innovation Fund [[SITRA]] and Finnish state-owned financing company [[Finnvera]]. According to YLE TV News in 2017, the majority state-owned energy company [[Fortum]] saved Chempolis from bankruptcy by investing 6 million euros into the company in October 2016. Thereafter, children of Sipilä owned 5% of the company and Fortum 34%. Sipilä had been in control of the state owned companies including Fortum since the end of 2015. The Prime Ministers of Finland have not had the control of state companies previously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9395763 Valtionyhtiö Fortum pelasti konkurssikypsän teknologiayhtiön – omistajaohjauksesta vastaavan pääministeri Sipilän lapset yhtiön omistajina] YLE 10.1.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Juha Sipilä lobbied for Chempolis in India in 2016. Chempolis issued a press release on its joint venture with India's Numaligarh Refinery to build a biorefinery in North East India (Assam) for the production of bioethanol following meetings between Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], India’s Finance Minister [[Arun Jaitley]] and Finland’s Prime Minister Juha Sipilä on 12–14 February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/iltalehti_pm_lobbied_for_finnish_biotech_in_india_company_partly_owned_by_his_children_received_110_million_euro_deal/9395277 ltalehti: PM lobbied for Finnish biotech in India – company partly owned by his children received 110 million euro deal] YLE News 10.1.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
As a student, Sipilä worked for a short time in the [[Finnish Centre Youth]], but otherwise he did not have experience in party politics before being elected to the Finnish Parliament in 2011 with 5,543 personal votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/Juha+Sipil%C3%A4+Keskustan+johtoon/a1305573721743 Juha Sipilä] accessed 9 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miska Rantanen 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hs.fi/english/print/1329104294448 |title=PROFILE: Juha Sipilä |author= Miska Rantanen |date=2012 |work= |publisher=Helsingin Sanomat |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Sipilä announced his candidacy for the chairman's position in the party congress of the summer. On June 9, 2012, the party congress elected him chairman.  He beat [[Tuomo Puumala]] in the second round by 1251 to 872 delegate votes.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Sipilä led his party to victory in the 2015 election, where the Centre Party gained 14 seats compared to the previous election. With 30,758 personal votes he was the most popular candidate in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/E-2015/fi/kokomaaval.html |title=Valitut ehdokkaat Koko maa |date=22 April 2015 |publisher=Ministry of Justice |accessdate=9 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625063910/http://tulospalvelu.vaalit.fi/E-2015/fi/kokomaaval.html |archivedate=25 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, he was tasked with forming a government coalition; and as the leader of the Centre Party, he began formal negotiations with the [[Finns Party]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] and formed a [[Sipilä cabinet|three-party majority coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/kolmen_assan_humppa__seuraa_hallitusohjelmavaantoa_smolnassa_hetki_hetkelta/7978517 |title= Kolmen ässän humppa – seuraa hallitusohjelmavääntöä Smolnassa hetki hetkeltä |date= 8 May 2015 |publisher=Yle |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Sipilä's Government===
Sipilä's government has struggled with Finland's poor economic performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35656150|title=Finland: The sick man of Europe?|last=Walker|first=Andrew|date=2016-02-29|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused according to [[Paul Krugman]] and others by the constraints of its [[eurozone]] membership and aftershocks from the [[European debt crisis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Paul Krugman]]|title=Northern Discomfort|website=The Conscience of a Liberal|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=26 October 2016|location=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/northern-discomfort/|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Paul Krugman]]|title=The Finnish Disease|website=The Conscience of a Liberal|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=26 October 2016|location=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/the-finnish-disease/?_r=0|date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also by the decline of the paper industry, the fall of [[Nokia]] and a diminution in exports to [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/beyond-brussels/132860|title=In Finland, the euro is not the real problem|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=|newspaper=EUobserver|access-date=2016-11-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2015/12/finland-and-asymmetric-shocks/|title=Finland and asymmetric shocks {{!}} Bruegel|website=bruegel.org|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Andrew|title=Finland: The sick man of Europe?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35656150|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 November 2016|date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland's economic winter|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21689751-nordic-laggard-can-forge-ahead-reforms|website=''[[The Economist]]''|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its attempts to address the problems through policies of spending cuts and reducing labour costs have been controversial, particularly cuts to education spending that are seen as threatening Finland's successful public education system.&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="macdougall"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacDougall|first1=David|title=Down and Out in Helsinki|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/finland-economy-crisis-alexander-stubb-finnish-education/|website=[[Politico]]|accessdate=26 October 2016|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These austerity measures have partly been implemented due to [[European Commission]] pressure, which has urged Finland to improve its adherence to the [[Stability and Growth Pact]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goulard|first1=Hortense|title=Commission tells six EU countries to cut budget deficit|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/commission-tells-six-eu-countries-to-cut-budget-deficit/|website=[[Politico]]|accessdate=26 October 2016|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reform its labour market to improve competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council recommendation on the 2016 national reform programme of Finland  and  delivering a Council opinion on the 2016 stability programme of Finland|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/csr2016_finland_en.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=26 October 2016|pages=4–5|date=18 May 2016|quote=(8) To restore Finland's competitiveness, the functioning of the labour market must be improved in several ways. On an aggregate level, wage increases have been moderate since the centrally agreed wage deal was agreed in late 2013. Under the agreement, the year-on-year increase in negotiated wages slowed from 1.3% in the last quarter of 2013 to 0.5 % in the fourth quarter of 2015. In June 2015, the social partners decided to extend the agreement into 2016. However, labour productivity growth has not yet recovered and therefore nominal unit labour costs are forecast to increase, albeit more slowly. Negotiations have been carried out to restore cost-competitiveness.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2015, Sipilä announced his government's commitment to reducing Finnish wage costs by 5% by 2019, an [[internal devaluation]] caused by Finland's loss of the ability to devalue its currency to boost competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=Tomas|title=What's happening to Finland's economy?|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/whats-happening-to-finland-economy/|website=[[World Economic Forum]]|accessdate=14 November 2016|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been protests against the government's austerity measures.&lt;ref name="macdougall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland: Economic forecast summary (June 2016)|url=http://www.oecd.org/economy/finland-economic-forecast-summary.htm|website=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 summer [[Finns Party|Finns]] [[Finns Party|Party]] split into two parties The [[Blue Reform]] and the current [[Finns Party]]. The Blue Reform members of the former Finns Party, including all ministers, remained in the government after the split.

=== Talvivaara and Yleisradio scandal ===
In 2016, Sipiläs close relatives were revealed to be part-owners of the bankrupt [[Talvivaara Mining Company]], later renamed and re-organised into the company Terrafame, which had received considerable funds from the Finnish government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9288420 Antaisitko 150 euroa Talvivaaran kaivokselle? Tavallaan annoit jo] 11.11.2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/firm_owned_by_pms_relatives_gets_half-million_euro_order_from_terrafame/9317488 Firm owned by PM's relatives gets half-million euro order from Terrafame] 25.11.2016 YLE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yle.fi"&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9315671 Pääministerin sukulaisten omistamalla yrityksellä noin puolen miljoonan euron tilaus Terrafamesta] 25.11.2016 YLE&lt;/ref&gt; A Parliamentary Ombudsman later decided that Sipilä didn't face a conflict of interest over mine deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/parliamentary_ombudsman_to_decide_whether_pm_faced_conflict_of_interest_over_mine_deal/9320997 Parliamentary Ombudsman to decide whether PM faced conflict of interest over mine deal] 28.11.2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9434359 Oikeusasiamies: Pääministeri ei ollut esteellinen Terrafame-asiassa]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was later revealed that Sipilä had contacted [[Yleisradio]] in order to instruct them on how to report on the Talvivaara and Terrafame incidents, leading to suspicion that YLE had been politically pressured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mistä pääministerin ja Ylen välisessä jupakassa on kyse?

==Personal life==

===Family===
Sipilä grew up in the small town of [[Puolanka]], northern Finland, east of Oulu, the firstborn of four children to mother Pirkko and father Pentti Sipilä, an elementary school teacher.&lt;ref name="Koskinen1"/&gt;

In 1981, Sipilä married Minna-Maaria Juntunen at [[Oulu Cathedral]]. They have five children.&lt;ref name="Koskinen1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koskinen2"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1427787326707.html| title = Juha Sipilän suhde vaimoonsa alkoi 16-vuotiaana erikoisesta tarjouksesta| work = Iltasanomat| author=Mika Koskinen | date=March 31, 2015| accessdate = August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their youngest son, Tuomo (born in 1993), died on 18 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/juha_sipila_steps_back_from_election_campaign_after_son_dies/7815272|title=Juha Sipilä steps back from election campaign after son dies|publisher=[[Yle]]|date=19 February 2015|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wood Gas Venture===
Sipilä is known for his interest in [[wood gas]] electricity generation, which began as a hobby.&lt;ref name="Miska Rantanen 2012"/&gt; The cost to bring power to his summer cottage seemed too high, and he became interested in [[wood gas]]. First, he produced the electricity with wind power and with a diesel generator, but then he started building wood gas plants. He converted an old Chevrolet El Camino into "El Kamina" (''Kamiina'' means "stove" in Finnish.) powered by wood gas, with electronic control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZdPkrghUZM|title=El Kamina – häkäpönttöauto|date=4 June 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hobby was spun off into a company, Volter Oy, which produces wood gas power plants. A 10-house [[ecovillage]] in Kempele is powered by one such power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volter.fi/fi/portfolio/kempeleen-ekokortteli/|title=Kempeleen ekokortteli|work=Volter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/kempeleen_ekokortteli_pyrkii_energiaomavaraisuuteen/5888863|title=Kempeleen ekokortteli pyrkii energiaomavaraisuuteen|work=Yle Uutiset}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious affiliation===
The Sipiläs are members of Rauhan Sana (transl. "Word of Peace", affiliated in North America with [[Apostolic Lutheran Church of America|ALCA]]), a small [[Laestadian]] revivalist denomination within the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|state Lutheran church of Finland]]. The Sipiläs first met at a Laestadian summer camp as teenagers.&lt;ref name="Koskinen2"/&gt;  Sipilä has stated he does not consider himself a legalistic Laestadian, and in interviews he has carefully distinguished his own Laestadian denomination from his home region's other, predominant, exclusive Laestadian group ([[Conservative Laestadianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/eduskuntavaalit-2015/2015041419515861_eb.shtml | title=Tällainen on Sipilän herätysliike – ei abortille ja eutanasialle | date = April 15, 2015 | accessdate = July 24, 2015 | work = Ilta-Lehti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/oulu/sipila-linjasi-suhdettaan-lestadiolaisuuteen/594972/ | title = Sipilä linjasi suhdettaan lestadiolaisuuteen| work = Kaleva| date=May 30, 2012| accessdate = June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3029205/Finland-poll-leader-open-deal-eurosceptic-populists.html| title = Finland poll leader open to deal with eurosceptic populists| work = Daily Mail UK| date=April 7, 2015| accessdate = August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of board in Juha Sipilä's religious community was his wife’s brother in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iltalehti.fi/eduskuntavaalit-2015/2015041419515861_eb.shtml  Tällainen on Sipilän herätysliike - ei abortille ja eutanasialle] Iltalehti 15.4.2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to Juha Sipilä, in 2012 he participated in the International Christian Chamber of Commerce ICCC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/oulu/sipila-linjasi-suhdettaan-lestadiolaisuuteen/594972/ Sipilä linjasi suhdettaan lestadiolaisuuteen] Kaleva 30.5.2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="939">The '''Nigerian Economic Summit Group''' (NESG) was formed in 1996 as a platform for public-private sector cooperation on [[Nigeria]]'s economic development. The NESG was an offshoot of the [[Nigerian Economic Summits (NES)|Nigerian Economic Summits]] (NES) which was initiated in 1993 by the Chief [[Ernest Shonekan]]-led Interim National Government.  The summit has held annually since then. The NESG aims to foster open and continuous dialogues on Nigeria's economic development.

NESG'S vision is "to become Nigeria's leading private sector think-tank committed to the development of a modern globally competitive economy". It seeks to achieve this through three focus activities comprising policy advocacy, research, and communication and education.

'''Nitya Gopal Kundu''' (3 December 1935 – 15 September 2006) was a Bangladeshi artist, sculptor and entrepreneur. He founded the furniture company [[Otobi]].&lt;ref name=pass&gt;{{cite news |date=16 September 2015 |title=Artist Nitun Kundu passes away |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/09/16/d6091601044.htm |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

==Education and early career==
Kundu graduated from Dhaka Art College (now the Institute of Fine Arts) in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hossain |first1=Takir |title=Liberation War in art |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=118388 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years leading up to 1971, he worked at the [[United States Information Agency|United States Information Service]] (USIS) in [[Dhaka]] designing exhibits and graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kristula |first=Michael |date=December 2012 |title=Nitun Kundu: A Success |url=http://www.afsa.org/sites/default/files/flipping_book/1212/files/assets/seo/page34.html |journal=Foreign Service Journal |page=34 |access-date=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberation War==
During the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], Kundu worked with the artist [[Quamrul Hassan]] at the public relations department of the Bangladesh Government-in-Exile at [[Mujibnagar]]. In collaboration with Hassan and a group of notable artists namely [[Debdas Chakraborty]], Nasir Biswas, Pranesh Mandal and Biren Shome; Kundu worked on numerous posters and works of art aimed at arousing the newly formed [[Mukti Bahini]] liberation army and also raising awareness of the genocide being unleashed by the [[Pakistan Army]] on the people of Bangladesh.

It was during this period he designed two posters which became among the most recognized&lt;ref name="Nitun Kundu: Our role model"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nitun Kundu: Our role model |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=202741 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
works of art produced during the war. They were titled ''Sada Jagrata Banglar Mukti Bahini'' and ''Banglar Hindu, Banglar Bouddha, Banglar Christian, Banglar Musalman; Amra Sabai Bangali''.

The Liberation War was the inspiration for Kundu's most famous work, the sculpture ''[[Shabash Bangladesh]]'', a tribute to the fallen freedom fighters of the Mukti Bahini. This is situated on the campus of [[Rajshahi University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mirdha |first=Refayet Ullah |title=The 75,000 taka bed |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=24994 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a relatively short period, Otobi became the most prominent Bangladeshi furniture brand. He started the company with an initial investment of 5000 taka.&lt;ref name="Nitun Kundu: Our role model"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2307">'''Paul Baan''' (born 1951), together with his older brother [[Jan Baan]], headed the information technology firm [[Baan Corporation|Baan Company]], which made a name for itself between 1995 and 2000.

==Baan Company==

Baan Company was listed at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in mid 1995. Through mid 1998 the share price increased at an average of 110% per annum, thus multiplying by a staggering nine times. In the following two years, however, the stock crashed.&lt;ref&gt;M. Houben and J. Wester (2001), ''Baan: Opkomst en ondergang van een softwarebedrijf'', Uitg. Business Contact/ Het Financieele Dagblad: Amsterdam, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baan Business Systems==

Paul Baan resigned as an executive director of Baan Company in December 1995 in order to build up Baan Business Systems (BBS), which had been separated from Baan Company a few months before the latter started trading as a public company. BBS remained a private company, owned exclusively by the Baan brothers, while it marketed the software developed within Baan Company. The sale of shares of Baan Company enabled the financing of BBS. The Baan brothers, thus, let their ownership interest in Baan Company, held through Stichting Oikonomos (Oikonomos Foundation), slip to 47% in mid 1996, but kept their interest in marketing-arm BBS at 100%.&lt;ref&gt;Houben and Wester (2001), pp. 56-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baan brothers focussed on the development and  sale of software, which lent itself to nearly costless duplication onto computer diskettes, leaving advisory and support at client sites, i.e. the actual implementation, to third parties, such as [[Capgemini]]. Paul Baan was, therefore, often heard saying in these years: “Software is allemaal winst!” (Software is all profit!) &lt;ref&gt;Houben and Wester (2001), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noaber Foundation==

In 2000, Oikonomos Foundation, which remained in the hands of the elder brother, saw the younger brother’s business interests spun off as Noaber Foundation. Noaber Foundation manages exclusively Paul Baan’s wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kosters, De teloorgang van Jan Baan, ''Follow the Money'', 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon., Vier Barneveldse miljonairs in Quote 500, ''[[Barneveldse Krant]]'', 6 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter A. Herrndorf''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|OOnt}} (born October 27, 1940) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] lawyer and media businessman. He is the president and chief executive officer of the [[National Arts Centre]].

Born in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[political science]] and English from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1962 and a law degree from [[Dalhousie University]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Judy |last= Steed |title= The big shakers at the corp|publisher= Globe and Mail |page= P10|date= May 22, 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, he received an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[Harvard Business School]].

Herrndorf joined the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) as a TV reporter/editor in Winnipeg beginning in 1965 a day after graduating from Dalhousie. Later that year, he moved to CBC Edmonton as a current affairs producer. In 1967, he transferred to Toronto as a producer of the network current affairs series ''The Way It Is''.  In 1979, he became Special Assistant to the Vice President and General Manager of the CBC English Network. Herrndorf was appointed head of TV current affairs in 1979, and later network vice-president. Herrndorf is credited with moving CBC Television's nightly network newscast, ''The National'' from 11 p.m. to 10 p.m. and for helping to create the nightly, network public affairs program, ''The Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://nac-cna.ca/en/bio/peter-herrndorf | title = Biographies: Peter Herrndorf | publisher = National Arts Centre | accessdate = September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]]. He also received honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degrees from [[York University]] in 1989, from the [[University of Winnipeg]] in 1993, and from Dalhousie University in 2000. In 1998, he was awarded the [[John Drainie Award]]. In 2007, he was awarded the Order of Ontario for having "revolutionized Canadian broadcasting, publishing and the performing arts at organizations such as the CBC, Toronto Life Magazine, TV Ontario and the National Arts Centre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order of Ontario Recipients Announced|url=http://www.citizenship.gov.on.ca/english/news/2007/n20071219.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513214020/http://www.citizenship.gov.on.ca/english/news/2007/n20071219.shtml|archivedate=2008-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed to the board of directors of the CBC in February, 2005 for a five-year term. He is also on the board of governors of the [[University of Ottawa]].

On June 30, 2017, it was announced that he was named a [[Order of Canada|Companion of the Order of Canada]] by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[David Johnston]] for "his transformative leadership in Canada's artistic community and for his enduring commitment to building a thriving national arts scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/nine-ottawans-appointed-to-the-order-of-canada| title=Nine Ottawans appointed to the Order of Canada| first=Lauren| last=Malyk| date=June 30, 2017| publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rolling-wave planning''' is the process of [[project planning]] in ''waves'' as the project proceeds and later details become clearer; similar to the techniques used in [[agile software development]] approaches like [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]]..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager's Guide | last=Larman | first=Craig | year=2004 |page=253 | chapter=Chapter 11: Practice Tips |  ISBN=9780131111554 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76rnV5Exs50C&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;ots=o8--YqDPRX&amp;dq=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q=adaptive%20predictive%20%22rolling%20wave%22&amp;f=false | accessdate=Oct 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Work to be done in the near term is based on high-level assumptions; also, high-level milestones are set. As the project progresses, the risks, assumptions, and milestones originally identified become more defined and reliable. One would use rolling-wave planning in an instance where there is an extremely tight schedule or timeline to adhere to; whereas more thorough planning would have placed the schedule into an unacceptable negative schedule variance.

The concepts of rolling-wave planning and progressive elaboration are techniques covered in the [[Project Management Body of Knowledge]] &lt;ref name="Project Management Book Of Knowledge6.1.2.2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketplace.pmi.org/Pages/ProductDetail.aspx?GMProduct=00101388701|title="A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge ( PMBOK® Guide )—Fifth Edition", section 6.2.2.2 pg. 152|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Stewart Clegg''' (born 1947, [[Bradford]]) is a British-born Australian [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[organizational theory|organizational theorist]] and Professor at [[University of Technology, Sydney]] (UTS), where he is also Research Director of CMOS (Centre for Management and Organisation Studies).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://datasearch.uts.edu.au/business/staff/details.cfm?StaffId=250 UTS: Professor Stewart Clegg, Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Clegg is an Australian professor in the [[Organization Studies]] field and is the author and editor of over forty [[monographs]], textbooks, encyclopaedia, and handbooks&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Clegg, S.R. &amp; Haugaard, M. (eds) 2009, Sage handbook of power, Sage, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; including the ''Sage handbook of power'' (2009)&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; and ''Sage directions in organisation studies'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, S.R. (eds) 2009, and a Four-Volume Set, Sage directions in organization studies, Sage, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart's research interests include organisation and management theory and the theory of power,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; although he has written on other topics including 'food', 'strategy', 'modernity' and 'gossip'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 2003, a book listed Clegg as one of the top 200 business gurus in the world&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, T.H., Prusak, L. &amp; Wilson, H.J. 2003, What's the big idea? Creating and capitalizing on the best new management thinking, [[Harvard Business School]], Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; and this book has been translated into many languages, including Spanish, [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and French. He sits on Editorial Boards for research journals and is Editor of the AiOS (Advances in Organization Studies) for [[Benjamins]], the European and American publishers. Stewart has also acted as consultant to international newspapers, such as the ''[[British Sunday Times]]'' and the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'', for whom he has devised the methodology for their "Power Lists", as well as to universities, business firms, and health services.&lt;ref name="saxton1"&gt;[http://www.saxton.com.au/default.asp?sd8=2580 Stewart Clegg – Saxton Speakers Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of power==

Clegg's "circuits of power"&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, S.R. 1989, Frameworks of power, Sage, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; theory likens the production and organising of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits: episodic, dispositional, and facilitative. These circuits operate at three levels, two are macro and one is micro. The ''episodic circuit'' is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings, communication, conflict, and resistance in day-to-day interrelations. The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative. The ''dispositional circuit'' is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority. The ''facilitative circuit'' is constituted of macro level technology, environmental contingencies, job design, and networks, which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward, agency in the episodic circuit. All three independent circuits interact at “obligatory passage points” which are channels for empowerment or disempowerment.

To give a sense of how this model works, Clegg applies it to Crozier’s&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, M. 1964, The bureaucratic phenomenon, Tavistock, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; study of a tobacco factory in France where maintenance workers modified the plant equipment. This action empowered them with exclusive knowledge of the machinery unavailable in the manuals. It also represented taking control of an obligatory passage point, which altered all three circuits of power. The act directly altered the facilitative circuit of technology. The knock-on effect at the dispositional circuit was that it changed what it meant to be a maintenance worker. At the episodic circuit it altered the worker’s power in day-to-day interaction and control of resources and outcomes. The overall impact of taking control of an obligatory passage point was that it allowed the workers to negotiate increased freedoms and wage increases.

==Academic positions==

Before moving to UTS, Clegg was Reader at [[Griffith University]] (1976–84), Professor at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] (1985–89), Professor at the [[University of St. Andrews]] (1990–3), and Foundation Professor at the [[University of Western Sydney]], [[Macarthur, New South Wales|Macarthur]], (1993–96). He has also held positions at Universities in Scotland; Australia, England, France, [[New Zealand]], Hong Kong, [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Mexico]] and the United States.&lt;ref name="saxton1"/&gt; He currently also holds Visiting Professorships at European universities and research centres. In 2010 he spent time as a Visiting distinguished Fellow in the Institute of Advanced Study, [[Durham University]], and in 2011 will be the Montezelomo Distinguished Visiting Professor at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Judge Institute]].

==Honorary Doctor of Philosophy==
Stewart is one of the 2017 honorary doctor recipients at [[Umeå University]]. The honorary doctorate was awarded for his scientific output which has far-reaching multidisciplinary content characterized by the ambition to place organization and management theory in a wider social science context all the while setting out from a critical and reflecting view. His research contribution on power mechanisms in organizations is indisputable. Stewart R. Clegg also held an active role as a member of the scientific reference group in the research project funded by the Swedish Riksbank Strategy, Design and Organizing in City Development Processes (Led by Nils Wåhlin at Umeå School of Business and Economics), that greatly dealt with the European Capital of Culture venture in Umeå. Stewart R.

[[Image:Pinkerton escorts hocking valley leslies.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton]] agents escort strikebreakers in [[Buchtel, Ohio]], 1884]]
A '''strikebreaker''' (sometimes derogatorily called a '''scab''', '''blackleg''', or '''knobstick''') is a person who works despite an ongoing [[strike action|strike]]. Strikebreakers are usually individuals who were not employed by the company prior to the [[trade union]] dispute, but rather hired after or during the strike to keep the organization running.  "Strikebreakers" may also refer to workers (union members or not) who cross [[picketing (protest)|picket line]]s to work.

The use of strikebreakers is a worldwide phenomenon; however, many countries have passed laws outlawing their use, as they undermine the collective bargaining process.  Strikebreakers are used far more frequently in the [[United States]] than in any other industrialized country.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, ''Strikebreaking and Intimidation,'' 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{source?|date=August 2018}}

==International law==
{{Wiktionary|strikebreaker}}
The right to strike is not expressly mentioned in any convention of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO);&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt; however, the ILO's Freedom of Association Committee established principles on the right to strike through ongoing rulings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_087987.pdf ILO principles concerning the right to strike] 2000 {{ISBN|92-2-111627-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among human rights treaties, only the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] contains a clause protecting the right to strike. However, like the Social Charter of 1961, the Covenant permits each signatory country to abridge the right to strike.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 8 (4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association and other ILO bodies have, however, interpreted all core ILO conventions as protecting the right to strike as an essential element of the [[freedom of association]]. For example, the ILO has ruled that "the right to strike is an intrinsic corollary of the right of association protected by Convention No. 87."&lt;ref name="ILO1994"&gt;International Labour Organization, ''Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining: General Survey of the Reports...'' 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ILO has also concluded striker replacement, while not in contravention of ILO agreements, carries with it significant risks for abuse and places trade union freedoms "in grave jeopardy."&lt;ref name="ILO1994" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Freedom of Association, ''Digest of Decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association,'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Social Charter]] of 1961 was the first international agreement to expressly protect the right to strike.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;Human Rights Watch, ''Unfair Advantage: Workers' Freedom of Association in the United States Under International Human Rights Standards,'' 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[European Union]]'s [[Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers]] permits EU member states to regulate the right to strike.&lt;ref name="MTEUPASP"&gt;Maastricht Treaty on European Union, Protocol and Agreement on Social Policy, February 7, 1992, 31 LL.M. 247, paragraph 13 under "Freedom of association and collective bargaining."&lt;/ref&gt;

==National laws==
[[Image:Chicago Tribune 1986 strikebreakers.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Strikebreakers outside the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' during a 1986 strike]]

===Asia===
*[[Japan]]ese labor law significantly restricts the ability of both an employer and a union to engage in labor disputes. The  law highly regulates labor relations to ensure labor peace and channel conflict into collective bargaining, mediation and arbitration. It bans the use of strikebreakers.&lt;ref&gt;Sugeno and Kanowitz, ''Japanese Employment and Labor Law,'' 2002; Dau-Schmidt, "Labor Law and Industrial Peace: A Comparative Analysis of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan Under the Bargaining Model," ''Tulane Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law,'' 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[South Korea]] bans the use of strikebreakers, although the practice remains common.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, "Labour Law Draws Roar of Rage From Asian Tiger," ''The Independent,'' January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In most European countries, strikebreakers are rarely used. Consequently, they are rarely if ever mentioned in most European national labor laws.&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt; As mentioned above, it is left to the [[European Union]] member states to determine their own policies.&lt;ref name="MTEUPASP"/&gt;

*[[Germany]] has employment law that strongly protects worker rights, but trade unions and the right to strike are not regulated by statute. The Bundesarbeitsgericht (the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany]]) and the Bundesverfassungsgericht (the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]]) have, however, issued a large number of rulings which essentially regulate trade union activities such as strikes. Work councils, for example, may not strike at all, but trade unions retain an almost unlimited ability to strike. The widespread use of work councils, however, channels most labor disputes and reduces the likelihood of strikes. Recent efforts to enact a comprehensive federal labor relations law that regulates strikes, lockouts and the use of strikebreakers failed.&lt;ref&gt;Körner, "German Labor Law in Transition," ''German Law Journal,'' April 2005; Westfall and Thusing, "Strikes and Lockouts in Germany and Under Federal Legislation in the United States: A Comparative Analysis," ''Boston College International &amp; Comparative Law Review,'' 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United Kingdom]] laws permit strikebreaking, and courts have significantly restricted the right of unions to punish members who act as strikebreakers.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, "Laws Against Strikes Revisited," in ''Future of Labour Law,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
*[[Canada]] has federal industrial relations laws that strongly regulate the use of strikebreakers. Although many Canadian labor unions today advocate for even stronger regulations, scholars point out that Canadian labor law has far greater protections for union members and the right to strike than American labor law, which has significantly influenced the development of labor relations in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, "How 'Anti-Union' Laws Saved Canadian Labour: Certification and Striker Replacements in Post-War Industrial Relations," ''Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations,'' January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Quebec]], the use of strikebreakers is illegal,&lt;ref&gt;Quebec Labour Code Section 109.1&lt;/ref&gt; but companies may try to remain open with only managerial personnel.&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt;
*[[Mexico]] has a federal labor law that requires companies to cease operations during a legal strike, effectively preventing the use of strikebreakers.&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt;
*The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] held in ''[[NLRB v. Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co.]],'' [[case citation|304 U.S. 333]] (1938) that an employer may not discriminate on the basis of union activity in reinstating employees at the end of a strike. The ruling effectively encourages employers to hire strikebreakers so that the union loses majority support in the workplace when the strike ends.&lt;ref&gt;Getman and Kohler, "The Story of ''NLRB v. Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co.''," in ''Labor Law Stories,'' 2005, pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mackay'' Court also held that employers enjoy the unrestricted right to permanently replace strikers with strikebreakers.&lt;ref&gt;Getman and Kohler, "The Story of ''NLRB v. Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co.''," in ''Labor Law Stories,'' 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synonyms==
Strikebreaking is also known as "black-legging" or "blacklegging". American [[Lexicography|lexicographer]] Stephanie Smith suggests that the word has to do with [[Shoeshiner|bootblacking]] or [[shoe polish]], for an early occurrence of the word was in conjunction with an 1803 American bootmaker's strike.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Household Words: Bloomers, Sucker, Bombshell, Scab, Nigger, Cyber'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; But British industrial relations expert J.G. Riddall notes that it may have a [[racism|racist]] connotation, as it was used in this way in 1859 in the United Kingdom: "If you dare work we shall consider you as blacks..."&lt;ref&gt;Riddall, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Lexicographer Geoffrey Hughes, however, notes that "blackleg" and "scab" are both references to disease, as in the [[Blackleg (disease)|blackleg]] infectious bacterial disease of sheep and cattle caused by ''[[Clostridium chauvoei]]''. He dates the first use of the term "blackleg" in reference to strikebreaking to the United Kingdom in 1859. Hughes observes that the term was once generally used to indicate a scoundrel, a villain, or a disreputable person.&lt;ref name="Hughes466"&gt;Hughes, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Northumbrian folk song ''[[Blackleg Miner]]'' is believed to originate from the 1844 strike, which would predate Hughes's reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=21 December 2016|quote=The song, Blackleg Miner, is thought to originate from the 1844 Miners' Lockout in the North East Coalfield.|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David John Douglass]] claims that the term ''blackleg''  has its origins in coal mining, as strikebreakers would often neglect to wash their legs, which would give away that they had been working whilst others had been on strike.&lt;ref name="StrikeNotTheEnd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglass|first1=David John|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|year=2005|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes notes that the use of the term "scab" can be traced back to the [[Elizabethan era]] in England, and is much more clearly rooted in the concept of disease (e.g., a diseased person) and a sickened appearance.&lt;ref name="Hughes466" /&gt;  The word is occasionally still used as a general insult in Britain; for example, during a mock funeral for [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013 in [[Goldthorpe]], the word "scab" was spelled out in flowers as part of the display.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-22183727 Goldthorpe hosts anti-Margaret Thatcher funeral]&lt;/ref&gt;  A traditional English proverb, which advises against gossip, is ''He that is a blab is a scab''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Apperson |first1=George Latimer |last2=Manser |first2=Martin H |date=2007 |title=Dictionary of Proverbs |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |page=57|isbn=9781840223118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John McIlroy has suggested that there is a distinction between a ''blackleg'' and a ''scab''.  He defines a ''scab'' as an outsider who is recruited to replace a striking worker, whereas a ''blackleg'' is one already employed who goes against a democratic decision of their colleagues to strike, and instead continues to work.&lt;ref&gt;McIlroy, John, Strike: How to fight and how to win, page 150 (London, 1984). in {{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=21 December 2016|pages=293-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fact that McIlroy specified that this should be a "democratic" decision has led the historian David Amos to question whether the Nottinghamshire miners in 1984-5 were true blacklegs, given the lack of a democratic vote on the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=21 December 2016|quote=If we use McIlroy's interpretation can the Nottinghamshire miners of 1984-85 be seen to have been 'blacklegging' as against 'scabbing'? However, there is one contentious point in McIlroy's interpretation, the breaking of the 'democratic process'. It is because there was some debate over the democratic process in the 1984-85 miners' strike that the question is raised as to whether the working Nottinghamshire miners were scabs at all. Jimmy Reid, leader of the 1971 Clyde Shipyard strike, was critical of the term being applied to working miners:|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strikebreakers are also known as "knobsticks". The term appears derived from the word "knob", in the sense of something that sticks out, and from the card-playing term "nob", as someone who cheats.{{sfn|Schillinger|2012|pages=104, 120}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2543">The '''Swedish Consumers' Association''' (Swedish: ''Sveriges Konsumenter'') is a [[consumer organization]] based in [[Sweden]]. It is a member of [[Consumers International]], [[BEUC]] and [[ANEC (organization)|ANEC]]. 

==Work==
Swedish Consumers' Association works national, international and within the EU. The organisation owns the consumer test magazine "Råd &amp; Rön".

The Swedish Consumers' Association strive to:
* Protect the interests of the Swedish consumers in regard to both publicly and privately produced goods and services
* Increase all consumers opportunities to use their consumer power
* Ensure that goods and services are available and accessible to everyone
* Advocate sustainability in line with the triple-bottom line: environmental, economical and social responsibility
* Advocate consumer rights together with the member organizations both nationally, internationally and in the EU
* Stimulate and support individuals to use their consumer power both individually and as groups
All work shall be based on the following often horizontal priorities: ethical consumption, availability, product safety, integrity, equality and non-discrimination with regards to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, age, sex or gender orientation.

Swedish Consumers’ Association has presently five top priorities – Food, Financial Services, Textile and Digital Services. [[Sustainable consumption]] is a crosscutting priority.

The organization advocates simpler [[end-user license agreement]]s, using Apple iTunes as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcforalla.idg.se/2.1054/1.363623/apples-anvandaravtal-ar-orimligt-krangliga|title='Apples användaravtal är orimligt krångliga!'|last=Jenselius|first=Michael|date=17 January 2011|work=pcforalla.idg.se|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish Consumers Association advocates consumer adoption of [[smart grid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyteknik.se/asikter/debatt/article3543983.ece|title=Smarta elnät – men för vem?|last=Bertoft|first=Jan|date=25 September 2012|work=[[Ny Teknik]]|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Kimball Lifecycle''' is a methodology for developing [[data warehouse]]s, and has been developed by [[Ralph Kimball]] and a variety of colleagues.

== Program/Project planning ==
According to Kimball et al., this phase is the start of the lifecycle. It is a [[planning]] phase in which project is a single iteration of the lifecycle while program is the broader coordination of resources. When launching a project/program Kimball et al. suggests following three focus areas:
* Define and Scope project
* Plan project
* [[Project management]]

== Program/Project Management ==
This is an ongoing discipline in the project. The purpose is to keep the project/program on course, develop a communication plan and manage expectations.

== Business Requirements Definition ==
This phase/milestone of the project is about making the project team understand the [[business requirements]]. Its purpose is to establish a foundation for all the following activities in the lifecycle. Kimball et al. makes it clear that it is important for the project team to talk with the business users and be prepared to focus on listening and to document the interview. An output of this step is the [[Enterprise bus matrix]].

== Technology Track ==
The top track holds two milestones:

#'''Technical Architecture''' Design is supposed to create a framework for the DW/BI system. The main focus in this phase is to create a plan for the application architecture, while considering business requirements, technical environment and the planned strategic technical directions.
#'''Product Selection &amp; Installation''' use the architecture plan to identify what components are needed to complete the DW/BI project. This phase then selects, installs and tests the products.

== Data Track ==
'''Dimensional Modeling''' is a process in which the business requirements are used to design dimensional models for the system. 

'''Physical Design''' is the phase where the database is designed. It involves the database environment as well as security. 

'''ETL Design &amp; Development''' is the design of some of the heavy procedures in the DW/BI-system ([[Extract, Transform, Load]]). Kimball et al. suggests four parts to this process, which are further divided into 34 subsystems (Kimball et al., 2008):
* Extracting data
* Cleaning and conforming data
* Delivering data for Presentation
* Managing the ETL system

== Business Intelligence Application Track ==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
BI Application Design deals with designing and selecting some applications to support the business requirements. BI Application Development use the design to develop and validate applications to support the business requirements.

== Deployment ==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
When the three tracks are complete they all end up in the final deployment. This phase requires planning and should include pre-deployment testing, documentation, training and maintenance and support.

== Maintenance ==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
When the deployment has finished the system will need proper maintenance to stay alive. This includes data reconciliation, execution and monitoring and performance tuning.

== Growth ==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
As the project can be seen as part of the larger iterative program, it is likely that the system will want to expand. There will be projects to add new data as well as reaching new segments of the business areas. The lifecycle then starts over again.

'''Vilhelmína Lever''' (1802–1879) was an Icelandic shopkeeper and restaurateur from [[Akureyri]] in northern Iceland.

==Biography==
Born on 1 March 1802, Vilhelmína Lever was the daughter of Hans Vilhelms Lever, a merchant, and his wife Þuríður Sigfúsdóttir. She married Thord Daníelsson but obtained a divorce in 1824, becoming the first woman in Iceland to apply for a divorce.&lt;ref name=mbl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/1151373/|title=Jafnréttisáfanga minnst|publisher=''Morgunblaðið''date=19 June 2007|accessdate=17 February 2018 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; She bought a plot of land in Akureyri in 1834, built a small house and opened a shop in 1835.&lt;ref name=vid/&gt;  After spending a few years in Krossanes, she returned to Akureyri in 1852 to run a shop combined with a restaurant. In 1861, she opened a restaurant in the Oddeyri district of Akureyri. She ran it for years, gaining the nickname "Vertshús-Mína" or Tavern-Mina.&lt;ref name=vid/&gt;

New regulations in Danish stated that the town council could be elected by "alle fuldmyndige Mænd" (all men who have reached their majority) who had lived in the town for two years and paid municipal dues. Assuming "mænd" meant all people (as in Icelandic) and not just men, Vilhelmína voted in the municipal elections in both 1863 and 1866.&lt;ref name=vid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mbl/&gt;

Later Vilhelmína lived in Nonnahús (Nonni's House), Akureyri's oldest house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonni.is/?m=page&amp;f=viewPage&amp;id=15|title=Saga hússins|publisher=Nonnahús Akureyri|accessdate=17 February 2018 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in Akureyri on 19 June 1879.&lt;ref name=vid/&gt;

'''Yabacon Valley''' (YV) is a nickname for an area within [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]]. Yaba is a suburb of [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] and located at the mainland of the Lagos. This area is already growing as Nigeria’s technology hub and cluster of hundreds of banking institutions, educational institutions, technology and [[startup company|startup]] companies which steadily attracts angel investors, venture capitalists, enthusiasts and media people from all over the world. This cluster is the major reason many technology firms are considering opening up shops in Yaba.&lt;ref name=business&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/yaba-joins-race-to-become-africas-silicon-valley/#.U7sbv5RdU8o|title=Yaba to become Africa's Silicon Valley|website=BusinessDay|author= Ben, Uzo Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to the region is the [[Lagos Lagoon]] which lies on its south-western side, it empties into the Atlantic via Lagos Harbor, a main channel through the heart of the city, 0.5&amp;nbsp;km to 1&amp;nbsp;km wide and 10&amp;nbsp;km long. The term originally was born from an unintentional act of an absent mind, manipulating the [[Silicon Valley]] name to create a nick version for this cluster while writing a story title.&lt;ref name="Passion Incubator opens in Yabacon Valley]"&gt;[http://thebusinessaim.com.ng/passion-incubator-opens-shop-at-yabacon-valley-to-accelerate-startups/] from thebusinessaim.com.ng&lt;/ref&gt; More so, due to the [[lagoon]] near this region, the term Silicon lagoon has also been used to refer to this cluster although this is yet to stick and its origin or creator is unknown.

Regardless of the tech clusters in [[Africa]], Yabacon Valley (YV) or Silicon lagoon — whichever name you chose to call it — continues to be a leading hub for high-tech innovation and development, buoyed by the country’s budding, technology-savvy middle-class and massive online population of 45 million internet users. Nigeria’s fledgling technology start-up scene is witnessing a flurry of activities in the frame of new [[investment]] drive, acquisitions, strategic partnerships as well as plans to establish more incubation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://businessdayonline.com/2013/10/venture-capitalists-give-push-to-nigerias-technology-start-ups/#.U9tiSaN_3IU |title=Venture capitalists Propel Nigeria’s tech start-ups|publisher=BusinessDay|author=Ben, Uzo Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically, Yabacon Valley encompasses all Yaba Local Council Development area which was carved out of the old Lagos Mainland Local Government created in 1977 as a separate local government following the national reform of Local [[government]] in September 1976. The Lagos Mainland carved out of Lagos city [[council]] which administered the Lagos [[Metropolitan area|Metropolitan]] city consists of Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland. So with the creation of three more Local government on 27 August 1991, the former Lagos mainland was re-constituted with Surulere carved out of it. The present Yaba Local Council Area has the look of an urban setting; some areas however mirror rural features and these areas are simply referred to as blighted areas like Makoko and Iwaya. Nonetheless, Yabacon Valley is a development, a commercial nerve center for all regardless of their political and cultural affiliations.

==Origin of term==
It is not known if the term ''Yabacon Valley'' has been mentioned or used in reference of this tech cluster in the past, but its first published use is credited to [http://www.thebusinessaim.com.ng The Business Aim], an online publishing platform with focus on business, strategy, innovation, startup culture and everything new. According to Google search results, the name was first used by ''Blaise Aboh'', then an award-winning editor, now [[Data analysis|Data Analysis]]/Design Lead and Founding Partner at [http://www.orodataviz.com Orodata Science Nigeria] a [[Civic technology]] organization as part of a title for an [http://thebusinessaim.com.ng/passion-incubator-opens-shop-at-yabacon-valley-to-accelerate-startups/ article] on reasons for the arrival of startup accelerators, and also to announce the emergence of a new player named [http://passionincubator.ng Passion Incubator] in Yaba technology [[ecosystem]]. The article is dated 13 March 2014.&lt;ref name="Passion Incubator opens in Yabacon Valley]"/&gt; The term is still not widely known however it is been used in conversations among the geeks, players and enthusiasts in the tech ecosystem especially on technology focused blogs and social media. There's still [[controversy]] surrounding the name, arguments and comments made on [http://www.techcabal.com/lagos-angel-network-makes-first-investment-autobox-hutbay/ article] a popular Nigerian technology blog [http://www.techcabal.com Techcabal] confirms this as few are disgruntled and think a better nickname can be created. They feel the name ought to be something else without the ‘con’ and the ‘valley’ arguing why Nigeria must mimic the west in almost everything. But there are many who actually like the name. Weekly in conversations, this name pops up and there are those who are of the [[opinion]] that if the name is disliked so much, it should not be brought up regularly.&lt;ref name="Lagos Angel Network makes first investment]"&gt;[http://www.techcabal.com/lagos-angel-network-makes-first-investment-autobox-hutbay/] from techcabal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 2015, a tech blog's community post declared [https://radar.techcabal.com/t/yabacon-valley-is-dead-long-live-yaba-right/3376/34 Yabacon Valley is dead. Long live Yaba Right']. The conversation was about how the name Yabacon Valley was not a good branding of the tech cluster, and why other suggestions like 'Yaba Right' or 'Yaba District' or even 'Silicon Yaba' were more suitable names.  The Executive Director of [https://pinigeria.org/ Paradigm Initiative Nigeria (PIN)] a social enterprise, Gbenga Sesan in a comment said that 'If something wasn't broken, why fix it'? That the whole thing was but a fruitless argument. He was of the opinion that when the time was right, the right name would come, that 'instead of looking for a new name by all means, let all cities focus on real work without assumptions'. It must be noted that one person alone does not have the power to name a country, let alone a district. It comes from careful or careless deliberations, negotiation, discuss, or in the case of YV; incessant community debates and arguments over its origin, originality and suitability. 
  
Yabacon is a [[portmanteau]] of ‘Yaba’ the Lagos suburb and ‘Silicon’, a chemical element used to create most semiconductors commercially for [[electronic computer]]s. Although there are technology companies in this area, there are no companies involved in the making of semiconductors since the cluster is still at its green stage and [[Nigeria]] is yet to advance to the [[technology]] level of manufacturing electronics. Thus, the name is just a sheer but unconscious imitation of America's [[Silicon valley]]. The name Yabacon Valley (YV) is alive although proclaimed dead because the Yaba technology community made it a continuous topic of discussion on blogs, social media and community posts. The name was an ordinary creation of a creative writer while penning the title of an article. The tech community made it the monster it is today.

==Demographics==
The population of Yabacon Valley is between 200 and 300 thousand approximately. It is assumed that females outnumber males in the majority of the localities in Yabacon Valley due to concentration of tertiary institutions in the area.

==Boundaries==
North of this area is Shiro Street down to other side of Morocco road towards the roundabout. This also includes Abule- Ijesha South - Muritala Muhammed way from Jibowu to Wright street junction. To the East is the Lagos lagoon, Onike, Onitiri, Makoko, Iwaya, University of Lagos communities also overlooking lagoon. To the West; a descent of 3rd mainland bridge to Wright Street to Murtala Muhammed way to include Total services station at that junction.

==History==
Yaba is a part of Lagos Nigeria with many small towns and communities such as Onyigbo, Ebute metta, Makoko, Sabo, Akoka, Abule Ijesha, Onike, Jibowu, and Iwaya among others.

Yaba Local council development area as it is today has its secretariat at 198, Herbert Macaulay Street, carved out of the old Lagos Mainland local government which was created in 1977 as a separate Local government following the national reform of Local government in September 1976. Lagos Mainland carved out of Lagos city council which administered the Lagos Metropolitan city; this consists of Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland. So with the creation of three more Local government on 27 August 1991, the former lagos mainland was re-constituted with Surulere carved out of it.
Yaba Local council Development area as one of the Thirty Seven (37) newly created Local council Development areas was created out of Lagos Mainland by the administration of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu after the state assembly passed a law creating new local council Development areas.
The present Yaba local council area wears an urban setting; some part however mirrored rural features and these areas are simply referred to as blighted areas like Makoko and Iwaya. Nonetheless, Yaba Local council development area is the commercial nerve centre for all regardless of their political and cultural affiliations.

"Perhaps the strongest push responsible for this industrial powerhouse and cluster is the increase in demand of products leveraging technology for growth".

=== Presence of leading institutions of higher learning ===
Yabacon valley has two of Nigeria’s leading educational institutions in [[Yaba College of Technology]] (Yabatech) and [[University of Lagos]]. Both higher institutions are known to be of higher learning standards and have some of the country’s best brains as lecturers. There of course are the less seasoned institutions which are prestigious in their own right – the federal technical college Akoka (a teacher training institute) and Queens’ college one of Africa’s best post primary educational institutions.
Historical significance, landmarks and memorials. Yaba also has notable landmarks like the statue of Herbert Macaulay the father of nationalism in Nigeria. Many other landmarks such as Tejuosho Market, E-center, National library of Nigeria, Yabatech among other notable landmarks there are also historically significant landmarks, such as the tallest building on the mainland Corner stone house, the first filling station in Nigeria - (Total at Sabo) and many more.

=== An expanding middle class ===
Yaba has one of the fastest expanding middle class groups in Nigeria as a whole. This is why developers fall over themselves to renovate old buildings or expand them out rightly to create apartments for working class folks. Real estate boom is in no small way an issue to consider when middle-class families demand for accommodation.

===Reduced crime rate===
Crime rate in most parts of yaba is low. Perhaps the heavy presence of security details around the place deters criminals or could be that the ever busy nature of the place seems to inconvenience criminals. Also there is the possibility that many so called criminals may consider productive work readily available for idle hands to be more rewarding whatever the case crime rate is relatively low.

===Nearness to the island===
Lagos island is the nerve center of commerce and the service based industry in Nigeria as a whole. Living in Yaba keeps you close to the Victoria island, Ikoyi and Lekki and thereby reduces your transportation expenses, stress due to heavy traffic jams which has found common place in these aforementioned areas.

===Rapid economic expansion===
The local economy in this part of Lagos is rapidly expanding. Eateries, banks, hotels, retail stores, insurance companies, night clubs are booming implying a lot of opportunities both for investors and employment seekers. The expansion of this area is rapid and many companies are setting up so as to not miss out of its financial benefits.

===The birth and thrive of a startup cluster===
In 2011, Wennovation Hub in partnership with [[Africa Leadership Forum|African Leadership Forum]] started incubating startups in the tech ecosystem but not much noise was made till 2012 when [[Bosun Tijani]] a social innovator &amp; entrepreneur and a group of individuals set out to help animate a community of change agents who believe in building a strong base for Nigeria through technology. They were certain they could help accelerate a movement of people who are driven by the need to disrupt the status quo in Nigeria through smart application of technology. The name was later changed to [[Co-Creation Hub|Cc-HUB]], and it became Nigeria’s first startup incubator. With investment and support in cash and kind from organisations such as the Indigo Trust, Omidyar Network, MainOne Cable Company and the Lagos State government, it soon gained momentum and proceeded to install a fibre-optic-powered information superhighway. In 2011, former banker Seun Onigbinde co-founded BudgIT, a fiscal transparency project, on the third floor of CC Hub’s six-storey building in Yaba. As one of the first early-stage startups to benefit from CC Hub’s incubation drive in 2011, it received $5,000 of its $90,000 seed funding from billionaire businessman Tony Elumelu. Big names like Konga, eCommerce company valued at approximately $200 million as after raising $20 million in Series C rounds, arrived in 2013, while Africa Internet Group which has $469 million in 4 Rounds from six investors transferred six of its companies to Yaba in 2014. In same 2014 BudgIT received $400,000 grant from Omidyar. Mid 2016, Andela – a Nigerian-founded talent accelerator for programmers that has campuses in Lagos, Nairobi and New York – received $24 million in investment from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In 2015 Hotels.ng, which claims to be the largest hotel booking site in Nigeria secured $1.2 million in funding from Omidyar Network to expand its listings across Africa.

A number of startups including Iroko – the biggest digital retailer of Nollywood worldwide with total funding of $40 million – and Paystack, an alternative e-payments company which raised $1.3 million investment in December 2016 from international investors Tencent, Comcast Ventures and more, have offices outside the cluster but still intermingle with those from Yabacon Valley.

===The coming of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder===
A day after [[Mark Zuckerberg]], the founder of Facebook, a social media company with $350 billion market valuation walked on the streets of Yaba in Lagos Nigeria, local and international media went agog as to why Yaba is [https://www.thecable.ng/videos-zuckerberg-walks-freely-on-the-streets-of-yaba/ 'Nigeria's Silicon Valley'] after all. In Zuckerberg’s first visit to Africa, his first stop was at Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) in Yaba, Lagos, ground zero for start-ups in order to listen, learn and take ideas back to California on how Facebook can better support tech development and entrepreneurship across Africa. In a Facebook post he said; "the energy here is amazing and I’m excited to learn as much as I can, I’m looking forward to meeting more people in Nigeria" after he met and interacted with kids at a summer coding camp in CCHub, developers and entrepreneurs in the startup ecosystem in Nigeria. Then he went to Andela where his wife foundation Chan Zuckerberg foundation had made an investment months back. The visit was part of a series of global town hall meetings.
