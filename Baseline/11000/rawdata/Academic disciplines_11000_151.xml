[[File:FMIB 45415 Investigator in Rangoon River in 1889.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|''Investigator'' in [[Myanmar|Burma]]]]
'''''A Naturalist in Indian Seas''''', or, '''''Four Years with the Royal Indian Marine Survey Ship Investigator''''' is a 1902 publication by [[Alfred William Alcock]], a British [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[crustacean|carcinologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1903/02/14/archives/indian-seas-story-of-a-cruise-of-the-investigator-a-survey-ship.html INDIAN SEAS.; Story of a Cruise of the Investigator, a Survey Ship] ''New York Times'', February 14, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is mostly a narrative describing the ''Investigator''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s journey through areas of the [[Indian Ocean]], such as the [[Laccadive Sea]], the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Andaman Sea]].  It also details the history of the ''Investigator'', as well as the [[marine biology]] of the Indian Ocean.

The book is considered a classic in natural history travel,&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[William Thomas Calman|W. T. C.]], [[Stanley Wells Kemp|S. W. K.]] &amp; P. M.-B. |year=1933 |title=Alfred William Alcock. 1859–1933 |journal=[[Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=119–126|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1933.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1903, ''[[The Geographical Journal]]'' described it as "a most fascinating and complete popular account of the deep-sea fauna of the Indian seas. The book is one of intense interest throughout to a [[zoologist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Oceanography in Indian Seas |journal=The Geographical Journal|year=1903 |volume= 21 |page=179 |publisher=Royal Geographical Society (Great Britain) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its original edition, ''A Naturalist in Indian Seas'' was 328 pages long and published in 8 volumes in [[London]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3611">:''In [[Hindu mythology]], [[Consorts of Ganesha#Buddhi (Wisdom)|Buddhi]] is one of the wives of [[Ganesha]].''

'''Buddhi''' is a [[Vedic Sanskrit]] word that means the intellectual faculty and the power to "form and retain concepts, reason, discern, judge, comprehend, understand".&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ianwhicherp18/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Buddhi'' ({{lang-sa|बुद्धि}}) is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit root ''Budh'' (बुध् ), which literally means "to wake, be awake, observe, heed, attend, learn, become aware of, to know, be conscious again".&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sir Monier Monier-Williams|author2=Ernst Leumann|author3=Carl Cappeller|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3105-6|page=733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears extensively in [[Rigveda]] and other Vedic literature.&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"/&gt; ''Buddhi'' means, states Monier Williams, the power to "form, retain concepts; intelligence, reason, intellect, mind", the intellectual faculty and the ability to "discern, judge, comprehend, understand" something.&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinha2013p120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jadunath Sinha |title=Indian Psychology Perception |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmBGAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-34605-7 |pages=120–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhi is a feminine [[Sanskrit]] noun derived from ''*budh'', to be [[awake]], to [[understanding|understand]], to [[know]]. The same root is the basis for the more familiar masculine form ''[[Buddha]]'' and the [[abstract noun]] ''[[bodhi]]''.

Buddhi contrasts from ''manas'' (मनस्) which means "mind", and ''[[ahamkara]]'' (अहंंकाऱ) which means "ego, I-sense in egotism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sir Monier Monier-Williams|author2=Ernst Leumann|author3=Carl Cappeller|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3105-6|pages=124, 783-784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinha2013p120"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ianwhicherp18&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Whicher|title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3815-2|pages=18, 71, 77, 92–95, 219, 231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
In [[Samkhya]] and [[yoga|yogic philosophy]] both the mind and the ego are forms in the realm of nature (''[[prakriti]]'') that have emerged into materiality as a function of the three ''[[gunas]]'' (ग़ुण) through a misapprehension of ''[[purusha]]'' (पुरूष) (the consciousness-essence of the ''[[jiva]]tman''). Discriminative in nature (बुद्धि निश्चयात्मिका चित्त-वृत्ति), ''buddhi'' is that which is able to discern truth (''[[satya]]'') from falsehood and thereby to make wisdom possible.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

[[File:CALIFA HexDR2 mandala.png|thumb|A composite of panels depicting maps of some of the properties of galaxies obtained from CALIFA data.]]
The '''CALIFA Survey''' (''Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey'') is an astronomical project to map 600 galaxies with [[Integral field spectrograph|integral field spectroscopy (IFS)]], to allow detailed studies of these objects. The data are taken at the [[Calar Alto Observatory]] in Spain.

==Project==
The CALIFA project addresses a number of open questions in galaxy evolution, among them: 
# The chemical evolution of galaxies: how, when, and where metals are produced in galaxies  
# Galaxy masses from different tracers: how much mass there is in stars, gas, and dark matter, and how it is distributed 
# Galaxy assembly as traced from the kinematic structure: what the motions of stars and gas tell us about the structure of the galaxies 
# Galaxy assembly as traced through the stellar population content: how, when, and where did stars form throughout the history of the galaxies

CALIFA data are made public through regular releases (DR). DR1, containing 200 data cubes of 100 galaxies, was released 1 November 2012.&lt;ref name=CALIFA-DR1&gt;{{cite journal |title= CALIFA, the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey. II.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4643">'''Cassini's laws''' provide a compact description of the motion of the [[Moon]]. They were established in 1693 by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]], a prominent scientist of his time.&lt;ref name=Beletskii&gt;For the original statement of the laws, see {{cite book |title=Essays on the Motion of Celestial Bodies |author=V V Belet︠s︡kiĭ |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byWZusmVSecC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=%22Cassini%27s+laws%22 |isbn=3-7643-5866-1 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |page=181  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refinements of these laws to include physical [[libration]]s have been made,&lt;ref name=Beletskii/&gt; and they have been generalized to treat other satellites and planets.&lt;ref name="Peale1969" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YseboodtMargot2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Beletskii2&gt;{{cite book |title=Essays on the Motion of Celestial Bodies |author=V V Belet︠s︡kiĭ |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byWZusmVSecC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=%22Cassini%27s+laws%22 |isbn=3-7643-5866-1 |year=2001 |publisher=Birkhäuser |page=179  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cassini's laws==
[[File:Earth-Moon.PNG|thumb|Orbital inclination and rotation.]]
# The Moon has a 1:1 [[orbital resonance|spin–orbit resonance]]. This means that the [[rotation]]–[[orbit]] ratio of the Moon is such that the same side of it always faces the [[Earth]].
# The Moon's rotational axis maintains a constant angle of [[inclination]] from the [[plane of the ecliptic|ecliptic plane]]. The Moon's rotational axis precesses so as to trace out a cone that intersects the ecliptic plane as a circle. 
# A plane formed from a [[surface normal|normal]] to the ecliptic plane and a normal to the Moon's [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] will contain the Moon's rotational axis.

In the case of the Moon, its rotational axis always points some 1.5 degrees away from the North [[ecliptic pole]]. The normal to the moon's orbital plane and its rotational vector are always on opposite sides of the ecliptic plane.

Therefore, both the normal to the orbital plane and the Moon's rotational axis precess around the ecliptic pole with the same period. The period is about 18.6 years and the motion is [[Retrograde motion|retrograde]].

==Cassini state==

A system obeying these laws is said to be in a '''Cassini state''', that is: an evolved rotational state where the spin axis, orbit normal, and normal to the [[Laplace plane]] are coplanar while the obliquity remains constant.&lt;ref name="Peale1969" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YseboodtMargot2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Calisesi&gt;{{cite book |title=Solar Variability and Planetary Climates |author=Y. Calisesi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzXZs_xSLk4C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22Cassini+state%22    |isbn=0-387-48339-X |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |page= 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laplace plane is defined as the plane about which a planet or satellite orbit precesses with constant inclination.&lt;ref name=Calisesi/&gt;

Cassini state 1 is defined as the situation in which both the spin axis and the orbit normal axis are on the same side of the normal to the Laplace plane.  Cassini state 2 is defined as the case in which the spin axis and the orbit normal axis are on opposite sides of the normal to the Laplace plane.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Winn and M. J. Holman (2005),"Obliquity Tides on Hot Jupiters", ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Volume 628, Issue 2, pp. L159-L162.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earth's moon is in Cassini state 2.

The '''ICAR - Central Tuber Crops Research Institute''', often abbreviated to '''ICAR - CTCRI''', is a constituent institute under the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] (ICAR) is the only [[research]] organization in the world dedicated solely to the research on [[tropical]] [[tuber|tuber crops]]. The Institute established in 1963&lt;ref name=ctcritvm-institute/&gt; with its Headquarters at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kerala]] has with an area of 48.19 [[hectare]]s. The headquarters of ICAR - CTCRI is located at [[Sreekaryam]] at a distance 12&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Thiruvananthapuram International Airport]] and 10&amp;nbsp;km from [[Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station]] as well as [[Central Bus Station Thiruvananthapuram]]. The Institute has a regional centre at [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] established in 1976 &lt;ref name=ctcribbs-institute&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctcri.org/regional_center.html|title=Regional Center|publisher=Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with an area of 20 [[hectare]]s located 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bhubaneswar Airport]] and 7&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bhubaneswar railway station]] to cater the needs of [[East India|Eastern India]].

==Research==
Research on [[tropical]] [[tuber|tuber crops]] is the primary mandate of CTCRI. Each division of CTCRI concentrate its research programmes on separate aspects of tuber crops. '''Crop improvement division focus''' its activities on collection [[germplasm]] of different tuber crops from different parts of the world and conserving it in field gene bank as well as [[in vitro]]. Development of new varieties of tuber crops with higher yield and other attributes suitable for industrial applications as well as for food purpose is another important activity of this division. '''Crop production division''' is engaged in developing new agro techniques for tropical tuber crops in different agro climatic regions. '''Crop protection division''' develop strategies and products for managing pests and diseases affecting tropical tuber crops. '''Crop utilization division''' concentrates its activities on value addition and post harvest processing of tropical tuber crops. '''Section of Extension and social sciences''' is involved in transferring the technologies developed by CTCRI to its clienteles.

'''Certified wood''' and paper products come from responsibly managed forests – as defined by a particular standard. With third-party forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore Forest Certification Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
'''Forest certification''' programs typically require that forest management practices conform to existing laws. Other basic requirements or characteristics of forest certification programs include:

Basic requirements of credible forest certification programs include:
* Protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration (e.g., replanting and reforestation).
* Third-party certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies.
* Publicly available certification audit summaries.
* Multi-stakeholder involvement in a standards development process.
* Complaints and appeals process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf National Association of State Foresters Policy Statement 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Today there are more than 50 certification programs worldwide &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Sustainable_Forests/Third_Party_Forest_Certification.pdf Third-Party Forest Certification in British Columbia]&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the many types of forests and tenures around the world. The two largest international forest certification programs are the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) and the [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC).

The PEFC is the largest certification framework in terms of forest area, with approximately two-thirds of the total certified area. The FSC program is the fastest growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 115] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party forest certification was pioneered in the early 1990s by the FSC, a collaboration between [[Environmental organizations|environmental]] [[Non-governmental organizations|NGOs]], forest product companies and social interests. Competing systems quickly emerged throughout the world. Some commentators, including [[Jared Diamond]], have suggested that many competing standards were set up by logging companies specifically aiming to confuse consumers with less rigorously enforced but similarly named competing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== United States and Canada ===

In the United States and Canada, there are a number of forest certification programs. Three of these programs are endorsed by the PEFC. They are the [[American Tree Farm System]] (ATFS), the [[Canadian Standards Association]]’s [[Sustainable Forest Management Standard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ CSA International Forest Products Marking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019030053/http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ |date=2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] (SFI) Program. ATFS is applicable only in the United States; the Canadian Standards Association SFM Standard is applicable only in Canada. SFI is applicable to both the United States and Canada. The FSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsccanada.org/forestmanagementstd.htm Forest Stewardship Council Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fscus.org FSC United States]&lt;/ref&gt; program is applied throughout North America. SFI is the world’s largest regional forest certification program in terms of total certified forest area[1].

The [[National Association of State Foresters]] in the USA passed a resolution in 2008 that supports ''all'' of the forest certification systems used in the USA and recognized the value of their differences: “... the ATFS, FSC, and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability.... No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility. Forest ecosystems are complex and a simplistic ‘one size fits all’ approach to certification cannot address all sustainability needs.”.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf Forest Certification as it Contributes to Sustainable Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Council of Forest Ministers]] issued a statement in 2008 on forest certification standards in Canada, which said: “In Canada, each jurisdiction’s forest laws, policies and administrative requirements comprise an {{sic|hide=y|over-|arching}} framework that fully characterizes what sustainable forest management (SFM) means in that jurisdiction, and what actions may take place on public and/or private forest land. Governments in Canada support third-party forest certification as a tool to demonstrate the rigor of Canada’s forest management laws, and to document the country’s world-class sustainable forest management record. The forest management standards of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the FSC and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) are all used in Canada. Governments in Canada accept that these standards demonstrate, and promote the sustainability of forest management practices in Canada.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccfm.org/pdf/CCFM_Statement_FRandEN.pdf#page=2 Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Statement on Forest Certification Standards in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain-of-custody certification==

Chain of Custody certification tracks the certified material through the production process – from the forest to the consumer, including all successive stages of processing, transformation, manufacturing and distribution. It also provides evidence that certified material in a certified product originates from certified forests.

The United Nations reports that between January 2009 and May 2010, the total number of PEFC and FSC chain-of-custody certificates issued worldwide increased by 88% for a total of 23,717 certificates (this does not include SFI certificates).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 118] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future expansion==

Forest certification is a voluntary process. About 10% of the world’s forest under at least one certification program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 113] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers that choose to buy certified products are supporting land managers, land owners and forest product companies that have made a commitment to meeting the standards of forest certification.

Third-party forest certification is a useful tool for those seeking to purchase paper and wood products that come from forests that are well-managed and use materials that are legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product buying practices can be a centerpiece for responsible wood and paper purchasing policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009-2010 United Nations Market Review reported that companies that produced or traded in certified forest products often had a market advantage during the 2008-2009 recession because, in a buyers’ market, buyers could be more selective in choosing their sources of supply. The report cites four demand drivers for certification:&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 114] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paper, publishing, printing and packaging – commitments to increase the use of responsible paper sources by large publishers such as Time Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeinc.com/community/sustainability.php Time Inc. Sustainability Report 2009-2010 page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; has probably been the most significant factor driving growth in forest and chain-of-custody certification.
* Green public procurement – governments such as the UK and the Netherlands have adopted green timber procurement policies, including recognition of FSC and PEFC endorsed programs. An example is the UK’s Central Point of Expertise on Timber (set up by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and operated by ProForest).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpet.org.uk/evidence-of-compliance/category-a-evidence/introduction Central Point of Expertise on Timber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Green building – standards for green building incentivize and reward the use of certified wood products.
*Illegal logging – new legislation designed to minimize the risk of illegal wood entering supply chains such as the amended Lacey Act in the United States has created a strong incentive to demand independently certified wood that can address illegal logging concerns.

The World Resources Institute, in partnership with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate import declaration information to U.S. government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/stories/2009/12/fact-sheet-are-you-ready-lacey-act World Resources Institute fact sheet Are You Ready for the Lacey Act?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryo-Electron Microscopy''' ('''Cryo-EM''') is an [[electron microscopy]] (EM) technique applied on samples cooled to [[cryogenic]] temperatures and embedded in an environment of vitreous water. An aqueous sample solution is applied to a grid-mesh and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. While development of the technique began in the 1970s, recent advances in detector technology and software algorithms have allowed for the determination of biomolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng Y, Grigorieff N, Penczek PA, Walz T | title = A primer to single-particle cryo-electron microscopy | journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 3 | pages = 438–449 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25910204 | pmc = 4409659 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.03.050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has attracted wide attention to the approach as an alternative to [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[NMR spectroscopy]] for macromolecular structure determination without the need for crystallization.

In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to [[Jacques Dubochet]], [[Joachim Frank]], and [[Richard Henderson (biologist)|Richard Henderson]] "for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1960s, scientist were faced with the issue of structure determination methods using electron microscopy damaging the specimen due to high energy electron beams, so cryogenic electron microscopy was considered to overcome this issue as it was expected that low temperatures would reduce beam damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubochet J, Knapek E | title = Ups and downs in early electron cryo-microscopy | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = e2005550 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29672565 | pmc = 5929567 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005550# | url = https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005550# | doi-broken-date = 2018-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Erwin Knapek and Jacques Dubochet published commenting on beam damage at cryogenic temperatures sharing observations that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thin crystals mounted on carbon film were found to be from 30 to 300 times more beam-resistant at 4 K than at room temperature... Most of our results can be explained by assuming that cryoprotection in the region of 4 K is strongly dependent on the temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knapek E, Dubochet J | title = Beam damage to organic material is considerably reduced in cryo-electron microscopy | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 141 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–61 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 7441748 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(80)90382-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, these results were not reproducible and amendments were published in the Nature international journal of science just 2 years later informing that the beam resistance was less significant than initially anticipated. The protection gained at 4 K was closer to “tenfold for standard samples of L-valine,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/299386c0.pdf|title=Cryo-transmission microscopy Fading hopes|last=Newmark|first=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |date=30 September 1982|website=Nature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; than what was previously stated.

In 2017, three scientists, Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing a technique that would image biomolecules.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cressey D, Callaway E | title = Cryo-electron microscopy wins chemistry Nobel | journal = Nature | volume = 550 | issue = 7675 | pages = 167 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29022937 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2017.22738 | url = https://www.nature.com/news/cryo-electron-microscopy-wins-chemistry-nobel-1.22738 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Chemists realized that electron diffraction can be used to readily determine the structures of small molecules that form needle-like crystals, structures that would otherwise need to be determined from X-ray crystallography, by growing larger crystals of the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gruene T, Wennmacher JT, Zaubitzer C, Holstein JJ, Heidler J, Fecteau-Lefebvre A, De Carlo S, Müller E, Goldie KN, Regeni I, Li T, Santiso-Quinones G, Steinfeld G, Handschin S, van Genderen E, van Bokhoven JA, Clever GH, Pantelic R | title = Rapid structure determination of microcrystalline molecular compounds using electron diffraction | journal = Angewandte Chemie | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30325568 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201811318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The term '''deep sea creature''' refers to organisms that live below the [[photic zone]] of the ocean. These creatures must survive in extremely harsh conditions, such as hundreds of [[Bar (unit)|bars]] of pressure, small amounts of oxygen, very little food, no sunlight, and constant, extreme cold. Most creatures have to depend on [[marine snow|food floating down]] from above.

These creatures live in very demanding environments, such as the [[abyssal zone|abyssal]] or [[hadal zone|hadal]] zones, which, being thousands of meters below the surface, are almost completely devoid of light. The water is between 3 and 10 degrees [[Celsius]] and has low oxygen levels. Due to the depth, the pressure is between 20 and 1,000 [[Bar (unit)|bars]]. Creatures that live hundreds or even thousands of meters deep in the ocean have adapted to the high pressure, lack of light, and other factors.

== Barometric pressure ==

These animals have [[natural selection|evolved]] to survive the extreme pressure of the sub-[[photic zone]]s. The pressure increases by about one [[Bar (unit)|bar]] every ten meters. To cope with the pressure, many fish are rather small. These  have also eliminated all excess cavities that would collapse under the pressure, such as [[swim bladders]].&lt;ref name= "name"&gt;[http://marinebio.org/Oceans/Deep/ The Deep Sea at MarineBio.org - Ocean biology, Marine life, Sea creatures, Marine conservation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lack of light ==

The lack of light requires creatures to have special adaptations to find food, avoid predators, and find mates. Most animals have very large eyes with retinas constructed mainly of rods, which increases sensitivity. Many animals have also developed large feelers to replace peripheral vision. To be able to reproduce, many of these fish have evolved to be [[hermaphroditic]], eliminating the need to find a mate. Many creatures have also developed a very strong sense of smell to detect the chemicals released by mates.

== Lack of resources ==

[[Image:Bathynomus giganteus.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[giant isopod]] (''Bathynomus giganteus'')]]
At this depth, there is not enough light for photosynthesis to occur and not enough oxygen to support animals with a high metabolism. To survive, creatures have slower metabolisms which require less oxygen; they can live for long periods without food. Most food either comes from organic material that falls from above or from eating other creatures that have derived their food through the process of [[chemosynthesis]] (the process of changing chemical energy into food energy). Because of the sparse distributions of creatures, there is always at least some oxygen and food. Also, instead of using energy to search for food, these creatures use particular adaptations to ambush prey.

=== Hypoxic environment ===
Creatures that live in the sub-abyss require adaptations to cope with the naturally low oxygen levels.

=== Deep-sea gigantism ===
{{main|Deep-sea gigantism}}
[[Image:humpback anglerfish.png|thumb|150px|right|[[Humpback anglerfish]]: ''Melanocetus johnsonii'']]
The term ''[[deep-sea gigantism]]'' describes an effect that living at such depths has on some creatures' sizes, especially relative to the size of relatives that live in different environments. These creatures are generally many times bigger than their counterparts. The [[giant isopod]] (related to the common [[pill bug]]) exemplifies this. To date, scientists have only been able to explain deep-sea gigantism in the case of the [[giant tube worm]]. Scientists believe these creatures are much larger than shallower-water [[tube worm (body plan)|tube worm]]s because they live on hydrothermal vents that expel huge amounts of resources. They believe that, since the creatures don't have to expend energy regulating body temperature and have a smaller need for activity, they can allocate more resources to bodily processes.

There are also cases of deep-sea creatures being abnormally small, such as the [[lantern shark]], which fits in an adult [[human]]'s palm.

=== Bioluminescence ===
[[Image:Nur04512.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Smaller cousins of [[giant tube worm]]s feeding at a [[hydrothermal vent]]]]
[[Bioluminescence]] is the ability of an organism to create light through chemical reactions. Creatures use bioluminescence in many ways: to light their way, attract prey, or seduce a mate. Many underwater animals are bioluminescent&amp;mdash;from the [[viper fish]] to the various species of [[flashlight fish (disambiguation)|flashlight fish]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, named for their light.&lt;ref name="Name6"&gt;[http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/living_species/default.asp?hab=9 Monterey Bay Aquarium: Online Field Guide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some creatures, such as the [[angler fish]], have a concentration of [[photophores]] in a small limb that protrudes from their bodies, which they use as a lure to catch curious fish. Bioluminescence can also confuse enemies. The chemical process of bioluminescence requires at least two chemicals: the light producing chemical called luciferin and the reaction causing chemical called luciferase.&lt;ref name="name2"&gt;[http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/~biolum/chem/ BL Web: Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin causing light and resulting in an inactive oxyluciferin. Fresh luciferin must be brought in through the diet or through internal synthesis.&lt;ref name="name2"&gt;[http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/~biolum/chem/ BL Web: Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemosynthesis ===
Since, at such deep levels, there is little to no sunlight, [[photosynthesis]] is not a possible means of energy production, leaving some creatures with the quandary of how to produce food for themselves. For the [[giant tube worm]], this answer comes in the form of bacteria. These bacteria are capable of chemosynthesis and live inside the giant tube worm, which lives on [[hydrothermal vent]]s. These vents spew forth very large amounts of chemicals, which these bacteria can transform into energy. These bacteria can also grow free of a host and create mats of bacteria on the sea floor around hydrothermal vents, where they serve as food for other creatures. Bacteria are a key energy source in the food chain. This source of energy creates large populations in areas around hydrothermal vents, which provides scientists with an easy stop for research. Organisms can also use chemosynthesis to attract prey or to attract a mate.

== Deep sea research ==
[[Image:ALVIN submersible.jpg|right|thumb|120px|''Alvin'' in 1978, a year after first exploring [[hydrothermal vent]]s.]]
Humans have explored less than 3% of the ocean floor, and dozens of new species of deep sea creatures are discovered with every dive. The submarine [[DSV Alvin]]&amp;mdash;owned by the US Navy and operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] (WHOI) in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]]&amp;mdash;exemplifies the type of craft used to explore deep water. This 16 ton submarine can withstand extreme pressure and is easily manoeuvrable despite its weight and size.

The extreme difference in pressure between the sea floor and the surface makes the creature's survival on the surface near impossible; this makes in-depth research difficult because most useful information can only be found while the creatures are alive. Recent developments have allowed scientists to look at these creatures more closely, and for a longer time. A marine biologist, Jeffery Drazen, has explored a solution, a pressurized fish trap. This captures a deep-water creature, and adjusts its internal pressure slowly to surface level as the creature is brought to the surface, in the hope that the creature can adjust.&lt;ref name="name4"&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/07/0701_040701_oceantrap.html New Trap May Take Deep-Sea Fish Safely Out of the Dark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientific team, from the [[Universite Pierre et Marie Curie]], has developed a capture device known as the [[PERISCOP]], which maintains water pressure as it surfaces, thus keeping the samples in a pressurized environment during the ascent. This permits close study on the surface without any pressure disturbances affecting the sample.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|last=Lever|first=Anna-Marie|title=Live fish caught at record depth|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7525552.stm|accessdate=18 February 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duodenal lymphocytosis''', sometimes called '''lymphocytic duodenitis''', lymphocytic duodenosis, or duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis, is a condition where an increased number of intra-epithelial [[lymphocytes]] is seen in biopsies of the [[duodenum|duodenal]] [[intestinal mucosa|mucosa]] when these are examined microscopically.  It is often a feature of [[coeliac disease]] but may be found in other disorders. 

==Characteristics==
The condition is characterised by an increased proportion of lymphocytes in the [[epithelium]] of the duodenum, usually when this is greater than 20-25 per 100 [[enterocytes]].&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lauwers | first=Gregory Y | last2=Fasano | first2=Alessio | last3=Brown | first3=Ian S | title=Duodenal lymphocytosis with no or minimal enteropathy: much ado about nothing? | journal=Modern Pathology | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=28 | issue=S1 | year=2015 | issn=0893-3952 | doi=10.1038/modpathol.2014.135 | pages=S22–S29|pmid=25560597}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Intra-epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) are normally present in intestine and numbers are normally greater in the [[intestinal crypt|crypts]] and in the [[jejunum]]; these are distinct from those found in the [[lamina propria]] of the intestinal mucosa.  IELs are mostly [[T cell]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt;  Increased numbers of IELs are reported in around 3% of in duodenal biopsies, depending on case mix, but may be increasingly being found, in up to 7%.&lt;ref name="pmid23991733"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24565068"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shmidt | first=Eugenia | last2=Smyrk | first2=Thomas C. | last3=Boswell | first3=Christopher L. | last4=Enders | first4=Felicity T. | last5=Oxentenko | first5=Amy S. | title=Increasing duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis found at upper endoscopy: time trends and associations | journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=80 | issue=1 | year=2014 | issn=0016-5107 | doi=10.1016/j.gie.2014.01.008 | pages=105–111|pmid=24565068}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Causes==
The list of possible causes is wide, including coeliac disease, [[environmental enteropathy]] ([[tropical sprue]]), [[autoimmune enteropathy]], [[small intestinal bacterial overgrowth]], [[NSAID]] damage, ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', other infections and [[Crohn's disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt;
==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made by accurate counting of intraepithelial lymphocytes during histological examination of the duodenum.&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt;  The definition of the condition includes the requirement that the duodenal histological appearances are otherwise unremarkable, specifically with normal [[intestinal villus|villous]] architecture.&lt;ref name="pmid23991733"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hammer | first=Suntrea T. G. | last2=Greenson | first2=Joel K. | title=The Clinical Significance of Duodenal Lymphocytosis With Normal Villus Architecture | journal=Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine | publisher=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine | volume=137 | issue=9 | year=2013 | issn=0003-9985 | doi=10.5858/arpa.2013-0261-ra | pages=1216–1219|pmid=23991733 |url=http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.5858/arpa.2013-0261-RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[coeliac disease]] (also known as [[gluten-sensitive enteropathy]]), duodenal lymphocytosis is found in untreated or partially treated cases. This is the least severe type of change, known as the Marsh I stage, in the classification of histological changes in coeliac disease. Additional features including villous atrophy and [[intestinal crypt|crypt]] [[hyperplasia]] are the other findings in other Marsh stages of coeliac disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marsh | first=Michael N. | title=Gluten, major histocompatibility complex, and the small intestine | journal=Gastroenterology | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=102 | issue=1 | year=1992 | issn=0016-5085 | doi=10.1016/0016-5085(92)91819-p | pages=330–354|pmid=1727768}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt;

Antibodies associated with coeliac disease were reported in around 11% of cases.&lt;ref name="pmid25560597"/&gt; These IgA [[endomysial antibodies]] and [[anti-transglutaminase antibodies]] are very sensitive and specific for coeliac disease implying that this proportion of duodenal lymphocytosis cases has definite coeliac disease.  Around 33% of cases have the [[HLA-DQ|HLA-DQ2]] allele, which is found in over 90% of people with coeliac disease.  Absence of HLA-DQ2 (and the rarer HLA-DQ8) makes coeliac disease most unlikely.&lt;ref name="pmid25014240"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aziz | first=Imran | last2=Key | first2=Tim | last3=Goodwin | first3=John G. | last4=Sanders | first4=David S. | title=Predictors for Celiac Disease in Adult Cases of Duodenal Intraepithelial Lymphocytosis | journal=Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | publisher=Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health) | year=2014 | issn=0192-0790 | doi=10.1097/mcg.0000000000000184 | page=1|pmid=25014240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As antibody-negative coeliac disease is recognised, HLA status, persistence or progression of the duodenal IEL numbers following a gluten challenge, followed by symptomatic improvement on a gluten-free diet, has been used to be more certain about the diagnosis, which was made in 22% of one series of over 200 adult cases. &lt;ref name="pmid25014240"/&gt;

Helicobacter infection is a common finding at [[endoscopy]] and although duodenal IEL counts were found to be slightly higher with this infection, this was not considered to be a meaningful cause in children.&lt;ref name="pmid24702235"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Guz-Mark | first=A. | last2=Zevit | first2=N. | last3=Morgenstern | first3=S. | last4=Shamir | first4=R. | title=Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis is common in children without coeliac disease, and is not meaningfully influenced by Helicobacter pylori infection | journal=Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | publisher=Wiley | volume=39 | issue=11 | date=2014-04-07 | issn=0269-2813 | doi=10.1111/apt.12739 | pages=1314–1320|pmid=24702235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other infections, including [[Cryptosporidiosis]] and [[Giardiasis]] can also be associated with an increase in IELs.&lt;ref name="pmid23991733"/&gt;

==Management==
The management is that of any identified associated disorder such as a [[gluten free diet]] for cases with coeliac disease&lt;ref name="pmid25014240"/&gt; or treatment of associated infections.&lt;ref name="pmid23991733"/&gt; 

==Prognosis==
When duodenal lymphocytosis is associated with other features of coeliac disease, in particular positive antibodies, or HLA-DQ2/8 and a family history, treatment with a [[gluten]]-free diet produces an improvement in IEL numbers.&lt;ref name="pmid25014240"/&gt;  Diarrhoea, thyroiditis, weakness and folate deficiency were other predictors of the development of gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease, which developed in 23 of 85 patients over 2 years in one series.&lt;ref name="pmid26140001"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Losurdo | first=Giuseppe | last2=Piscitelli | first2=Domenico | last3=Giangaspero | first3=Antonio | last4=Principi | first4=Mariabeatrice | last5=Buffelli | first5=Francesca | last6=Giorgio | first6=Floriana | last7=Montenegro | first7=Lucia | last8=Sorrentino | first8=Claudia | last9=Amoruso | first9=Annacinzia | last10=Ierardi | first10=Enzo | last11=Leo | first11=Alfredo Di | title=Evolution of nonspecific duodenal lymphocytosis over 2 years of follow-up | journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology | publisher=Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.| volume=21 | issue=24 | date=2015-06-28 | pmid=26140001 | doi=10.3748/wjg.v21.i24.7545 | PMC=4481450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eternal return''' (also known as '''eternal recurrence''') is a theory that the [[universe]] and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a [[self-similar]] form an [[infinity|infinite]] number of times across infinite time or space.
The theory is found in [[Indian philosophy]] and in [[ancient Egypt]] and was subsequently taken up by the [[Pythagoreans]] and [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoics]. With the decline of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the spread of [[Christianity]], the theory fell into disuse in the [[Western world]], with the exception of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who connected the thought to many of his other concepts, including ''[[amor fati]]''. Eternal return is based on the philosophy of pre-determinism in that people are predestined to continue repeating the same events over and over again.

==Premise==
The basic premise proceeds from the assumption that the [[probability]] of a world coming into existence exactly like our own is nonzero. If [[space]] and time are infinite, then it follows logically that our existence must recur an infinite number of times.&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark M., "Parallel universes". Sci. Am. 2003 May; 288(5):40–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], assuming a Newtonian cosmology where time and space are infinite, claimed to have demonstrated eternal recurrence as a mathematical certainty.&lt;ref&gt;

== Classical antiquity ==

[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scarabaeus sacer|Scarab]] on a [[fresco]].]]

In [[ancient Egypt]], the scarab ([[dung beetle]]) was viewed as a sign of eternal renewal and reemergence of life, a reminder of the life to come. (See also [[Atum]] and [[Ma'at]].)

The [[Maya calendar#Maya concepts of time|Mayans]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] also took a cyclical view of time.

In [[ancient Greece]], the concept of eternal return was connected with [[Empedocles]], [[Zeno of Citium]], and most notably in [[Stoicism]] (see [[ekpyrosis]]).

== Indian religions ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=February 2018}}
{{See also|End time in Indian religions}}
The concept of cyclical patterns is prominent in [[Indian religions]], such as [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] among others. The important distinction is that events don't repeat endlessly but souls take birth until they attain salvation. The [[Bhavacakra|wheel of life]] represents an endless cycle of birth, life, and death from which one seeks liberation.  In [[Tantric Buddhism]], a [[wheel of time]] concept known as the [[Kalachakra]] expresses the idea of an endless cycle of existence and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;!--linked from 'Amor fati'--&gt; ==
The concept of "eternal recurrence", the idea that with infinite time and a finite number of events, events will recur again and again infinitely, is central to the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.lmu.edu/tshanahan/Nietzsche-Eternal_Recurrence.html&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence, in aphorism 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (cited below), presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.' "&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thought of eternal recurrence appears in a few of his works, in particular §285 and §341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' and then in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The most complete treatment of the subject appears in the work entitled ''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'', a work which was published in 2007 alongside [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s own version of eternal return, which he calls 'repetition'. Nietzsche sums up his thought most succinctly when he addresses the reader with: "Everything has returned. Sirius,  and the spider, and thy thoughts at this moment, and this last thought of thine that all things will return". However, he also expresses his thought at greater length when he says to his reader:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet here for the first time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us, and let me tell thee something of the thought which has suddenly risen before me like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as befits the nature of light. - Fellow man! Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'' - Vol. 16 of Oscar Levy Edition of Nietzsche's Complete Works (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This thought is indeed also noted in a posthumous fragment.&lt;ref&gt;1881 (11 [143])&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this thought is dated by Nietzsche himself, via posthumous fragments, to August 1881, at [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils-Maria]]. In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' (1888), he wrote that he thought of the eternal return as the "fundamental conception" of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, [[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]], "Why I Write Such Good Books", "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Am Stein der Ewigen Wiederkunft.JPG|thumb|Scene of Nietzsche's inspiration: „by a massive, pyramidally piled up block not far from [[Surlej|Surlei]]“.]]

Several authors have pointed out other occurrences of this hypothesis in contemporary thought. [[Rudolf Steiner]], who revised the first catalogue of Nietzsche's personal library in January 1896, pointed out that Nietzsche would have read something similar in [[Eugen Dühring]]'s ''Courses on philosophy'' (1875), which Nietzsche readily criticized. [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]] pointed out that Nietzsche referred to ancient cyclical conceptions of time, in particular by the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], in the ''Untimely Meditations''. [[Henri Lichtenberger]] and [[Charles Andler]] have pinpointed three works contemporary to Nietzsche which carried on the same hypothesis: J.G. Vogt, ''Die Kraft. Eine real-monistische Weltanschauung'' (1878), [[Auguste Blanqui]], ''[http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/blanqui_louis_auguste/eternite_par_les_astres/eternite_.html L'éternité par les astres]'' (1872) and [[Gustave Le Bon]], ''L'homme et les sociétés'' (1881). [[Walter Benjamin]] juxtaposes Blanqui and Nietzsche's discussion of eternal recurrence in his unfinished, monumental work ''[[The Arcades Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Benjamin]]. ''The Arcades Project''. Trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin. Cambridge: Belknap-Harvard, 2002. See chapter D, "Boredom Eternal Return," pp. 101-119.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gustave Le Bon is not quoted anywhere in Nietzsche's manuscripts; and Auguste Blanqui was named only in 1883. Vogt's work, on the other hand, was read by Nietzsche during this summer of 1881 in Sils-Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116044517/http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn/catalogues.html |title=revision of previous catalogues }} on the [[École Normale Supérieure]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; Blanqui is mentioned by [[Albert Lange]] in his ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]'' (History of Materialism), a book closely read by Nietzsche.&lt;ref name=Fouillee&gt;Alfred Fouillée, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Note_sur_Nietzsche_et_Lange_:_%C2%AB_le_retour_%C3%A9ternel_%C2%BB "Note sur Nietzsche et Lange: le "retour éternel"], in ''Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger''. An. 34. Paris 1909. T. 67, S. 519-525 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The eternal recurrence is also mentioned in passing by the Devil in Part Four, Book XI, Chapter 9 of Dostoevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is another possible source that Nietzsche may have been drawing upon.

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered this idea in the works of [[Heinrich Heine]], who once wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite. They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them is also determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again...&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche; Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist.'' 1959, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche calls the idea "horrifying and paralyzing",{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} referring to it as a burden of the "heaviest weight" ("''das schwerste Gewicht''")&lt;ref&gt;Kundera, Milan. ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being''. 1999, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; imaginable.  He professes that the wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.{{'}} [''[[The Gay Science]]'', §341]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate":&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;Dudley, Will. ''Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom''. 2002, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for human greatness is ''amor fati'': that one wants to have nothing different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely to bear the necessary, still less to conceal it—all idealism is mendaciousness before the necessary—but to ''love'' it.&lt;ref name=dudl /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Carl Jung's seminar on ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Jung claims that the dwarf states the idea of the eternal return before Zarathustra finishes his argument of the eternal return when the dwarf says, "'Everything straight lies,' murmured the dwarf disdainfully.  'All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.'" However, Zarathustra rebuffs the dwarf in the following paragraph, warning him against over-simplifications.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve, M. (2015). The Gay Science and the Rosarium Philosophorum. Agathos, 6(2), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albert Camus ==
The philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] explores the notion of "eternal return" in his essay on "The Myth of Sisyphus", in which the repetitive nature of existence comes to represent life's absurdity, something the hero seeks to withstand through manifesting what [[Paul Tillich]] called "The Courage to Be".  Though the task of rolling the stone repeatedly up the hill without end is inherently meaningless, the challenge faced by Sisyphus is to refrain from despair.  Hence Camus famously concludes that, "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."

Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has described an argument originally put forward by [[Georg Simmel]], which rebuts the claim that a finite number of states must repeat within an infinite amount of time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even if there were exceedingly few things in a finite space in an infinite time, they would not have to repeat in the same configurations. Suppose there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist''. (Fourth Edition)  Princeton University Press, 1974. p327&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus a system could have an infinite number of distinct physical configurations that never recur. However the example presupposes the possibility of perfect continuity: for instance, if the universe proves to have a [[quantum foam]] nature, then the exact quantity of an irrational number cannot be expressed by any physical object.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

'''Evidence-based conservation''' is the application of evidence in conservation management actions and policy making. It is defined as systematically assessing scientific information from published, [[peer-review]]ed publications and texts, practitioners' experiences, independent expert assessment, and local and [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] knowledge on a specific conservation topic.  This includes assessing the current effectiveness of different management interventions, threats and emerging problems and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence-based [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]] was organized based on the observations that decision making in conservation was based on [[:wikt:intuition|intuition]] and/ or practitioner experience often disregarding other forms of evidence of successes and failures (e.g. scientific information). This has led to costly and poor outcomes.&lt;ref name=Sutherland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sutherland|first1=William J|last2=Pullin|first2=Andrew S.|last3=Dolman|first3=Paul M.|last4=Knigh|first4=Teri M.|title=The need for evidence-based conservation|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=June 2004|volume=19|issue=6|pages=305–308|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.03.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence-based conservation provides access to information that will support decision making through an evidence-based framework of “what works” in conservation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sutherland|first1=William J.|title= Evidence-based Conservation|journal= Conservation in Practice|date=July 2003|volume=4|issue=3|pages=39–42|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4629.2003.tb00068.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence based approach to conservation is based on evidence-based practice which started in [[Evidence-based medicine|medicine]] and later spread to [[Evidence Based Nursing|nursing]], [[Evidence based education|education]], [[psychology]] and other fields. Evidence for evidence based conservation is broadly produced and published in three forms: systematic reviews, synopsis and summaries.

==Systematic review==
A systematic review consists of a non-subjective assessment of available data and evidence related to a management.&lt;ref name="Collaboration"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Collaboration for Environmental Evidence |date=March 2013 |title=Guidelines for Systematic Review and Evidence Synthesis in Environmental Management, Version4.2 |url=http://www.environmentalevidence.org/Documents/Guidelines/Guidelines4.2.pdf |accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthesizing results from different studies over different time periods, locations or sample sizes can reduce the bias present in individual studies. Systematic reviews differ from traditional reviews by being easily understood, peer reviewed and repeatable. Detailed protocols remain available for conducting a thorough, unbiased systematic review.&lt;ref name="Collaboration" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
Part of implementing an evidence-based conservation analysis requires generating a synopsis.  This refers to the brief description of a single study or a systematic review. Synopses form the building blocks of summaries when collated across specific themes.&lt;ref name="Dicks"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dicks | first1 = L. V. | year = 2014 | title = Organising evidence for environmental management decisions: a '4S' hierarchy | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 607–613 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2014.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
A summary is broader than a synopsis and refers to the standardized description of results extracted from several studies or systematic reviews on a particular topic. Summaries are regularly updated as more information becomes available and are ideally generated through a rigorous review process.&lt;ref name="Dicks" /&gt;

==History&lt;!--of the theory? of the website? of the program?  --&gt;==
Evidence-based conservation is inspired by [[evidence-based medicine]]. Evidence-based conservation was first noted in the literature in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, W.J. 2000. The conservation handbook: research, management and policy. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pullin, A. S. and Knight, T. M. 2001. Effectiveness in Conservation Practice: Pointers from Medicine and Public Health. Conservation Biology, 15: 50–54&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last decade, the methodology for generating systematic reviews (e.g. protocols, systematic maps) have been improved and standardized. In addition, several collaborative networks have been formed and two journals have been launched. The [[Collaboration for Environmental Evidence]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environmentalevidence.org/|title=Environmental Evidence|website=www.environmentalevidence.org|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a journal titled [http://www.environmentalevidence.org/journal Environmental Evidence] dedicated to the publication of systematic reviews, review protocols and systematic maps on impacts of human activity and the effectiveness of management interventions. It currently has centres located in [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|the UK]]. The [http://www.conservationevidence.com/ Conservation Evidence] group has a journal titled [http://www.conservationevidence.com/collection/view Conservation Evidence] that was launched in 2004 to document the effectiveness of conservation interventions. Conservation Evidence is a web-based database repository that systematizes and provides access to conservation efforts, programs, and research on the biodiversity and the environment based on high quality, reviewed publications. &lt;!--Conservation Evidence also produces broad summaries of management interventions for different taxa (e.g. birds and amphibians) and habitats (e.g. farmland).--&gt;

==Critique==
&lt;!-- Evidence-based conservation methodologies have not yet gained complete acceptance in environmental decision making.--&gt;
Since evidence-based conservation is based on the primary data on interventions, it is as good as the available data. Even when data are available, some authors have noted that evidence-based conservation may not be routinely used in decision making for management and conservation policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = K | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = Science and elephant management decisions in South Africa | url = http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/2263/15750/1/Young_Science%282010%29.pdf| journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 144 | issue = | pages = 876–885 | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.11.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pullin, A. S., and T. M. Knight. 2005. Assessing conservation management’s evidence base: a survey of management-plan compilers in the United Kingdom and Australia. Conservation Biology 19:1989–1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cook, C. N., et al., 2010. Conservation in the dark? The information used to support management decisions. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 8:181–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Often there may be a disconnect between the science that is produced and the management interventions taken. Three reasons have been suggested for this in the literature: 
# the scope of the scientific questions may not cover adequately the management requirements (this translates to lack of “actionable evidence” for management), 
# the scientific research produced covers the management needs, yet the recommendations from the evidence may not be feasible for implementation due to practical constraints (time, financial budgets etc.) or 
# the conservation practitioners do not have access to the evidence. Often peer reviewed journal articles produced by scientists are not freely available (open access) or use complicated jargon that managers may not always comprehend. In a survey in eastern England, it was found that park managers get only 2.4% of their information from primary scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt; These areas need further attention in the future.

Evidence-based conservation has also been criticised in the past for ignoring traditional forms of knowledge and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. M. &amp; Sandbrook, C. (2013) Conservation, Evidence and Policy. Oryx, 47(3), 329-335&lt;/ref&gt; However, the steps of evidence-based conservation can be designed to take traditional forms of knowledge also into consideration.

[[File:Passionfruit comparison.jpg|thumb|[[Ruler]]s make good fiducial markers.]]
A '''fiducial marker''' or '''fiducial''' is an object placed in the [[field of view]] of an [[imaging system]] which appears in the image produced, for use as a point of reference or a measure. It may be either something placed into or on the imaging subject, or a mark or set of marks in the [[reticle]] of an optical instrument.

==Accuracy==
In high-resolution optical microscopy, fiducials can be used to actively stabilize the field of view. Stabilization to better than 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm is achievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Carter |author-first1=Ashley R. |author-last2=King |author-first2=Gavin M. |author-last3=Ulrich |author-first3=Theresa A. |author-last4=Halsey |author-first4=Wayne |author-last5=Alchenberger |author-first5=David |author-last6=Perkins |author-first6=Thomas T. |title=Stabilization of an optical microscope to 01 nm in three dimensions |journal=Applied Optics |date=2007-01-04 |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=421 |doi=10.1364/AO.46.000421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{ Annotated image
 | image   = Apollo14Shadows.jpg
 | caption = On NASA photographs, crosshair reticles on a [[Réseau plate]] enable distortions due to processing and handling to be detected and corrected.
 | width   = 200 | height = 200 | image-width = 440 | image-left = -120 | image-top = -120
}}

===Physics===
In [[physics]], [[3D computer graphics]], and [[photography]], fiducials are reference points: fixed points or lines within a scene to which other objects can be related or against which objects can be measured. Cameras outfitted with [[Réseau plate]]s produce these reference marks (also called [[Réseau cross]]es) and are commonly used by [[NASA]]. Such marks are closely related to the [[timing mark]]s used in [[optical mark recognition]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Geographical survey===
Airborne [[geophysics|geophysical]] surveys also use the term "fiducial" as a sequential reference number in the measurement of various geophysical instruments during a survey flight. This application of the term evolved from [[Aerial photography|air photo]] frame numbers that were originally used to locate geophysical survey lines in the early days of airborne geophysical surveying. This method of positioning has since been replaced by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], but the term "fiducial" continues to be used as the time reference for data measured during flights.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Augmented reality===
In applications of [[augmented reality]], fiducials help resolve several problems of integration between the real world view and the synthetic images that augment it. Fiducials of known pattern and size can serve as real world anchors of location, orientation and scale. They can establish the identity of the scene or objects within the scene. For example, a fiducial printed on one page of an alternative reality [[popup book]] would identify the page to allow the system to select the augmentation content.  It would also serve to moor the coordinates of the  augmented content to the three dimensional location, orientation and scale of the open book, helping to create a stable and accurate fusion of real and synthetic imagery.

A slightly more complex example would be multiple fiducials, each attached to an individual piece in an alternative reality [[board game]]. 

=== Metrology ===
The appearance of markers in images may act as a reference for [[image scaling]], or may allow the image and physical object, or multiple independent images, to be [[correlated]]. By placing fiducial markers at known locations in a subject, the relative scale in the produced image may be determined by comparison of the locations of the markers in the image and subject. In applications such as [[photogrammetry]], the fiducial marks of a surveying camera may be set so that they define the principal point, in a process called "[[collimation]]". This would be a creative use of how the term collimation is conventionally understood.

=== Fiducial marker sets ===
Some [[barcode]] readers can estimate the translation, orientation, and vertical depth of a known-size barcode relative to the barcode reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author-first1=Chih-Chung |author-last1=Lo |author-last2=Chang |author-first2=C. A. |title=Neural networks for bar code positioning in automated material handling |doi=10.1109/IACET.1995.527607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sets of fiducial markers are specifically designed to allow rapid, low-latency detection of the 2D location, 2D orientation, and identity of hundreds of unique fiducial markers.
For example, the "amoeba" reacTIVision fiducials, the d-touch fiducials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first1=Ross |author-last1=Bencina |author-first2=Martin |author-last2=Kaltenbrunner |url=http://mtg.upf.edu/files/publications/376678-3rditeration2005-mkalten.pdf |title=The Design and Evolution of Fiducials for the reacTIVision System}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first1=Ross |author-last1=Bencina |author-first2=Martin |author-last2=Kaltenbrunner |author-first3=Sergi |author-last3=Jordà |url=http://mtg.upf.edu/files/publications/a0add7-Procams05-BencinaKaltenJorda.pdf |title=Improved Topological Fiducial Tracking in the reacTIVision System}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/ |title=reacTIVision: a toolkit for tangible multi-touch surfaces}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the TRIP circular barcode tags (ringcodes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-first1=Diego Lopez |author-last1=de Ipina |author-first2=Paulo R. S. |author-last2=Mendonca |author-first3=Andy |author-last3=Hopper |title=TRIP: a Low-Cost Vision-Based Location System for Ubiquitous Computing |date=2002 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.20.2455}} [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.20.2455&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical imaging===
Fiducial markers are used in a wide range of [[medical imaging]] applications. Images of the same subject produced with two different imaging systems may be correlated by placing a fiducial marker in the area imaged by both systems. In this case, a marker which is visible in the images produced by both imaging modalities must be used. By this method, functional information from [[SPECT]] or [[positron emission tomography]] can be related to anatomical information provided by [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/3/713 |title=Correlation of single photon emission CT with MR image data using fiduciary markers |author-first1=B.

R. |author-last2=Jack, Jr. |journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=713-720 |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, fiducial points established during MRI can be correlated with brain images generated by [[Magnetoencephalography#Magnetic source imaging|magnetoencephalography]] to localize the source of brain activity. Such fiducial points or markers are often created in tomographic images such as [[computed tomography]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] and [[positron emission tomography]] images using a device known as the [[N-localizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=Brown |author-first1=R.

====Electrocardiography====
In [[electrocardiography]] (ECG), fiducial points are landmarks on the ECG complex such as the isoelectric line (PQ junction), and onset of individual waves such as PQRST.

====Cell biology====
In processes that involve following a labelled molecule as it is incorporated in some larger polymer, such markers can be used to follow the dynamics of growth/shrinkage of the polymer, as well as its movement. Commonly used fiducial markers are fluorescently labelled monomers of bio-polymers. The task of measuring and quantifying what happens to these is borrowed from methods in physics and computational imaging like [[Speckle imaging]].

====Radio therapy====
In [[radiotherapy]] and radiosurgical systems, fiducial points are landmarks in the tumour to facilitate correct targets for treatment. In [[neuronavigation]], a "fiducial spatial coordinate system" is used as a reference, for use in neurosurgery, to describe the position of specific structures within the head or elsewhere in the body. Such fiducial points or landmarks are often created in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[computed tomography]] images by using the [[N-localizer]].

===Printed circuit boards===
[[Image:Cirrus Logic CL-GD5446 136309016 crop fiduciary.png|thumb|Fiducial marker for a chip to the right and the whole PCB beneath]]
In [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) manufacturing, fiducial marks, also known as circuit pattern recognition marks, allow [[SMT placement equipment]] to accurately locate and place parts on boards. These devices locate the circuit pattern by providing common measurable points. They are usually made by leaving a circular area of the board bare from [[solder-mask coating]]. Inside this area is a circle exposing the copper plating beneath. This center metallic disc can be solder-coated, gold-plated or otherwise treated, although bare copper is most common if not a current-carrying contact. Alternatively, it is possible to use clear solder-mask lacquer to cover the fiducials. In order to minimize [[rounding error]]s it was good practice to place fiducials in the same grid (or some multiple of it) that was used to place the parts, however, this isn't always possible on high-density boards nor is it a requirement any more with modern high-precision machines.

[[File:Round fiducial on pcb.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A gold-plated circular fiducial marker]]

Most placement machines are fed boards for assembly by a rail [[Conveyor system|conveyor]], with the board being clamped down in the assembly area of the machine. Each board will clamp slightly differently than the others, and the variance—which will generally be only tenths of a millimeter—is sufficient to ruin a board without proper calibration. Consequently, a typical PCB will have multiple fiducials to allow placement robots to precisely determine the board's orientation. By measuring the location of the fiducials relative to the board plan stored in the machine's memory, the machine can reliably compute the degree to which parts must be moved relative to the plan, called ''offset'', to ensure accurate placement.

Using three fiducials enables the machine to determine PCB offset in both the X and Y axes, as well as to determine if the board has rotated during clamping, allowing the machine to rotate parts to be placed to match. Such fiducials are also called global fiducials.
Global fiducials are also used in conjunction with [[stencil printing]]. Without them the printer would not print the solder paste in exact alignment with the pads. 
Parts requiring a very high degree of placement precision, such as [[ball grid array]] packages, may have additional local fiducials near the package placement area of the board to further fine-tune the targeting. Local fiducial, however, cannot be used in the stencil printing process.

Conversely, low end, low-precision boards may only have two fiducials, or use fiducials applied as part of the screen printing process applied to most circuit boards. Some very low-end boards may use the plated mounting screw holes as ersatz fiducials, although this yields very low accuracy.

For prototyping and small batch production runs, the use of a fiducial camera can greatly improve the process of board fabrication. By automatically locating fiducial markers, the camera automates board alignment. This helps with front to back and multilayer applications, eliminating the need for set pins.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tVZ-sdxG2o&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printing===
In [[color printing]], fiducials—also called "[[registration black]]"—are used at the edge of the cyan, magenta, yellow and black ([[CMYK color model|CMYK]]) printing plates so that they can be correctly aligned with each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5054">'''File integrity monitoring (FIM)''' is an [[internal control]] or [[process (computing)|process]] that performs the act of validating the [[integrity]] of [[operating system]] and [[application software]] [[Computer file|files]] using a verification method between the current file state and a known, good [[baseline (configuration management)|baseline]].  This comparison method often involves calculating a known cryptographic [[checksum]] of the file's original baseline and comparing with the calculated checksum of the current state of the file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ionx.co.uk/products/verisys/how-it-works |title=  Verisys - How it Works |publisher= Ionx|accessdate=2012-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other file attributes can also be used to monitor integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncircle.com/index.php?s=products_ccm_file-integrity-monitoring|title=File Integrity Monitoring|publisher=nCircle|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the act of performing file integrity monitoring is automated using internal controls such as an application or [[process (computing)|process]]. Such monitoring can be performed [[Randomness|randomly]], at a defined [[polling (computer science)|polling]] interval, or in [[Real-time computing|real-time]].

==Security objectives==
Changes to configurations, files and file attributes across the IT infrastructure are common, but hidden within a large volume of daily changes can be the few that impact file or configuration integrity. These changes can also reduce security posture and in some cases may be leading indicators of a breach in progress. Values monitored for unexpected changes to files or configuration items include: 
* Credentials
* Privileges and Security Settings
* Content
* Core attributes and size
* Hash values
* Configuration values

==Compliance objectives==
Multiple [[Regulatory compliance|compliance objectives]] indicate file integrity monitoring as a [[requirement]].  Several examples of compliance objectives with the requirement for file integrity monitoring include:

A '''forest kindergarten''' is a type of [[preschool education]] for children between the ages of three and six that is held almost exclusively outdoors. Whatever the weather, children are encouraged to play, explore and learn in a forest or natural environment. The adult supervision is meant to assist rather than lead. It is also known as ''[[:de:Waldkindergarten|Waldkindergarten]]'' (in German), ''outdoor nursery'', ''nature kindergarten'', or ''nature preschool''. &lt;ref&gt;Alice Gregory, "Running Free in Germany’s Outdoor Preschools". The New York Times Style Magazine, May 18, 2017 [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/t-magazine/germany-forest-kindergarten-outdoor-preschool-waldkitas.html?_r=0] &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Activities==
A forest kindergarten can be described as a [[kindergarten]] "without a ceiling or walls". The daycare staff and children spend their time outdoors, typically in a forest. A distinctive feature of forest kindergartens is the emphasis on play with toys that are fashioned out of objects that can be found in nature, rather than commercial toys. Despite these differences, forest kindergartens are meant to fulfill the same basic purpose as other nurseries, namely, to care for, stimulate, and educate young children.

Each forest kindergarten is different, partly because the organisations are independently minded. But typical activities and goals may include:&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="secretgardencurriculum"&gt;{{citation|last=Bache|first=Cathy|title=Pre-school curriculum|publisher=Secret Garden Outdoor Nursery|year=2008|url=http://www.secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/pre%20school%20curriculum.doc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219101917/http://secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/pre%20school%20curriculum.doc|archivedate=2009-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and organization==
Forest kindergartens operate mainly in woodland, although some other sites can be equally inspiring, for example beaches and meadows. There should be a building where children can shelter from extreme weather. They may also spend a small part of each day indoors, although that is more likely to be for administrative and organisational reasons, such as to provide a known location where parents can deliver and collect their children. If the woodland is too far away to walk, a vehicle might reluctantly be used for transport.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Children are encouraged to dress for the weather, with waterproof clothes and warm layers, according to the climate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There are some [[forest schools]] that take children of various ages to woodland less frequently, and with a stronger focus on environmental topics themselves. For example, the "Woods for Learning" strategy&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcfc106.pdf/$FILE/fcfc106.pdf|title=Woods for Learning Education Strategy|publisher=Forestry Commission|year=2005|isbn=0-85538-684-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the British Forestry Commission proposes "regular" access, for example once a week for eight weeks.

==History==
In rural areas, and historical times, access to nature has not been a problem. Over the last century, with increasing urbanisation and "[[nature deficit disorder]]", there have been many changes in stance on [[outdoor education]]. 

The first forest Kindergarten was created by Ella Flautau in [[Denmark]] in the early 1950s. The idea formed gradually as a result of her often spending time with her own and neighbors' children in a nearby forest, a form of daycare which elicited great interest among the neighborhood parents. The parents formed a group and created an initiative to establish the first forest kindergarten. 

In [[Sweden]] in 1957, an ex-military man, Goesta Frohm, created the idea of "Skogsmulle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skogsmullestiftelsen.org/eng/index.htm Skogsmulle Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; "Skog" means wood in Swedish. "Mulle" is one of four fictional characters he created to teach children about nature, along with "Laxe" representing water, "Fjällfina" representing mountains and "Nova" representing an unpolluted nature. [[Forest schools]] based on Frohm's model, called "I Ur och Skur" (Rain or Shine Schools) moved the idea from occasional activities to formal nursery schools, being set up by Siw Linde in 1985. Juliet Robertson's review of Skogsmulle is a valuable modern-day summary.&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 1|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084834/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-2"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 2|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084915/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest kindergartens have existed in [[Germany]] since 1968 but were first officially recognized as a form of daycare in 1993, enabling state subsidies to reduce the daycare fees of children who attended Forest Kindergarten. Since then, the forest kindergartens have become increasingly popular. As of 2005 there were approximately 450 forest kindergartens in Germany, some of which offer a mix of forest kindergarten and traditional daycare, spending their mornings in the forest and afternoons inside. By late 2017, the number of forest kindergartens in Germany surpassed 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvnw.de/uber-uns/|title=ÜBER UNS {{!}} Bundesverband der Natur- und Waldkindergärten in Deutschland e.V.|website=bvnw.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain in 2005, a Swedish early years educator, Helena Nilsson, started Wildflowers Kindergarten, where preschool-aged children spend each morning in nature, throughout the year.

[[Childminder]] Cathy Bache opened the [[Secret Garden (outdoor nursery)|Secret Garden]] in Scotland in 2008 with support from funding authorities and private donors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/Early-Education-Child-Care/17970/11874 Childcare regulations] of the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taxfreevouchers"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childcare/ Tax Free Childcare Regulations], UK government HMRC&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2018 on all forest kindergartens are invited to celebrate the [[:de:Liste_von_Gedenk-_und_Aktionstagen#Mai|"International Day of Forest Kindergarten"]] every year on the 3rd of May.

==Effects==
The fact that most forest kindergartens do not provide commercial toys that have a predefined meaning or purpose supports the development of language skills, as children verbally create a common understanding of the objects used as toys in the context of their play. Forest kindergartens are also generally less noisy than closed rooms, and noise has been shown to be a factor in the [[stress (biological)|stress]] level of children and daycare professionals.

Merely keeping sight of natural features improves self-discipline in inner-city girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Taylor|first=A.F|last2=Kuo|last3=Sullivan|first3=W.C|year=2001|url=http://www.outdoorfoundation.org/pdf/ViewsOfNature.pdf|title=Views of Nature and Self Discipline: Evidence from Inner City Children|periodical=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=21|doi=10.1006/jevp.2001.0241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visiting a [[Forest schools|forest school]] regularly is desirable for schools&lt;ref name="robertson2009"&gt;Robertson J., Martin P., Borradaile L. and Alker S.

Playing outside for prolonged periods has been shown to have a positive impact on children's development, particularly in the areas of balance and agility, but also [[manual dexterity]], physical [[motor coordination|coordination]], [[Touch|tactile]] sensitivity, and [[depth perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/Colleges/ArchitecturePlanning/discover/centers/CYE/Publications/Documents/Benefitsofnature-FactSheet1-April2007.pdf |title=Benefits of Nature for Children’s Health |date=April 2007 |publisher=[[Children Youth and Environments Center]] for Research and Design, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731075831/http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/Colleges/ArchitecturePlanning/discover/centers/CYE/Publications/Documents/Benefitsofnature-FactSheet1-April2007.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Grahn|first=P |last2=Martensson|first2=F | last3=Lindblad|first3=B | last4=Nilsson|first4=P | last5=Ekman|first5=A |year=1997 | chapter=Ute på dagis|title=Stad and Land| volume=145| place=Håssleholm, Sweden| publisher=Nora Skåne Offset}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these studies, children who attend forest kindergartens experience fewer injuries due to accidents and are less likely to injure themselves in a fall.

Other studies have shown that spending time in nature improves attention and medical [[prognosis]] in women&lt;ref&gt;Cimprich B. (2007).

Playing outdoors is said to strengthen the [[immune systems]] of children and daycare professionals.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

When children from German ''[[:de:Waldkindergarten|Waldkindergarten]]s'' go to primary school, teachers observe a significant improvement in reading, writing, mathematics, social interactions and many other areas.&lt;ref name="gorges"&gt;Gorges R. [http://bvnw.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Prof_Gorges_Schulfhigkeit.pdf] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Boys may be less intellectually able than girls at typical school tasks such as reading and mathematics, so forest kindergartens have been recommended in the early years.&lt;ref&gt;Sax L.

Roland Gorges found&lt;ref name="gorges"/&gt; that children who had been to a forest kindergarten were above average, compared by teachers to those who had not, in all areas of skill tested. In order of advantage, these were:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7533">{{For|the concept in geometry|Fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)}}

The '''fundamental plane'''  is a set of [[Bivariate data|bivariate]] correlations connecting some of the properties of normal [[elliptical galaxies]], including their radius, luminosity, mass, velocity dispersion, metallicity, surface brightness, colors, density (of luminosity, mass, or phase space), and, to a lesser degree, the shape of their radial surface brightness profiles.  It is usually expressed as a relationship between the [[effective radius]], average [[surface brightness]] and central [[velocity dispersion]] of normal elliptical galaxies.  Any one of the three parameters may be estimated from the other two, as together they describe a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] that falls within their more general three-dimensional space.

==Motivation==
Many characteristics of a galaxy are correlated. For example, as one would expect, a galaxy with a higher [[luminosity]] has a larger effective radius. The usefulness of these correlations is when a characteristic that can be determined without prior knowledge of the galaxy's distance (such as central velocity dispersion - the Doppler width of spectral lines in the central parts of the galaxy) can be correlated with a property, such as luminosity, that can be determined only for galaxies of a known distance. With this correlation, one can determine the distance to galaxies, a difficult task in astronomy.

==Correlations==
The following correlations have been [[empirically]] shown for elliptical galaxies:
*Larger galaxies have fainter effective surface brightnesses (Gudehus, 1973).&lt;ref&gt;Gudehus, D. "Radius-parameter and surface brightness as a function of galaxy total magnitude for clusters of galaxies", Astronomical J., vol. 78, pp. 583-593 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically speaking: &lt;math&gt;R_e \propto \langle I \rangle_e^{-0.83\pm0.08}&lt;/math&gt; (Djorgovski &amp; Davis 1987),&lt;ref&gt;Djorgovski, S., and Davis, M. "Fundamental properties of elliptical galaxies", Astrophys. J., vol. 313, pp. 50-69 (1987); downloadable through http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987ApJ...313...59D&lt;/ref&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;R_e&lt;/math&gt; is the effective radius, and &lt;math&gt;\langle I \rangle_e&lt;/math&gt; is the mean surface brightness interior to &lt;math&gt;R_e&lt;/math&gt;.
*As &lt;math&gt;L_e = \pi \langle I \rangle_e R_e^2&lt;/math&gt;, we can substitute the previous correlation and see that &lt;math&gt;
L_e \propto \langle I \rangle_e \langle I \rangle_e^{-1.66}
&lt;/math&gt; and therefore: &lt;math&gt;
\langle I \rangle_e \sim L^{-3/2}
&lt;/math&gt; meaning that more luminous ellipticals have lower surface brightnesses.
*More luminous elliptical galaxies have larger central velocity dispersions. This is called the [[Faber–Jackson relation]] (Faber &amp; Jackson 1976). Analytically this is: &lt;math&gt;L_e \sim \sigma_o^4&lt;/math&gt;. This is analogous to the [[Tully–Fisher relation]] for spirals.
*If central velocity dispersion is correlated to luminosity, and luminosity is correlated with effective radius, then it follows that the central velocity dispersion is positively correlated to the effective radius.

==Usefulness==
The usefulness of this three dimensional space &lt;math&gt; \left( \log R_e, \langle I \rangle_e, \log \sigma_o \right) &lt;/math&gt; is studied by plotting &lt;math&gt;\log \, R_e&lt;/math&gt; against &lt;math&gt;\log \sigma_o + 0.26 \, \mu_B&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu_B&lt;/math&gt; is the mean surface brightness &lt;math&gt;\langle I \rangle_e&lt;/math&gt; expressed in magnitudes. The equation of the regression line through this plot is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\log R_e = 1.4 \,\log \sigma_o + 0.36 \mu_B
&lt;/math&gt;

or 

:&lt;math&gt;
R_e = \sigma_o^{1.4}  \langle I \rangle_e^{0.9}
&lt;/math&gt;.


Thus by measuring observable quantities such as surface brightness and velocity dispersion (both independent of the observer's distance to the source) one can estimate the effective radius (measured in [[parsec|kpc]]) of the galaxy. As one now knows the linear size of the effective radius and can measure the angular size, it is easy to determine the distance of the galaxy from the observer through the [[small-angle approximation]].

==Variations==
An early use of the fundamental plane is the &lt;math&gt;D_n - \sigma_o&lt;/math&gt; correlation, given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{D_n}{\text{kpc}} = 2.05 \, \left(\frac{\sigma_o}{100 \, \text{km}/\text{s}}\right)^{1.33} 
&lt;/math&gt;

determined by Dressler et al. (1987). Here &lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter within which the mean surface brightness is &lt;math&gt;20.75 \mu_B&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship has a scatter of 15% between galaxies, as it represents a slightly oblique projection of the Fundamental Plane.

Fundamental Plane correlations provide insights into the formative and evolutionary processes of elliptical galaxies.  Whereas the tilt of the Fundamental Plane relative to the naive expectations from the Virial Theorem is reasonably well understood, the outstanding puzzle is its small thickness.


==Interpretation==
The observed empirical correlations reveal information on the formation of elliptical galaxies. In particular, consider the following assumptions
* From the [[virial theorem]] the velocity dispersion &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, characteristic radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 \sim GM/R&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;M \sim \sigma^2 R &lt;/math&gt;.
* The relation between luminosity &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and mean surface brightness (flux) &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;L \propto I R^2&lt;/math&gt;.
* Assume homology which implies a constant mass to light ratio &lt;math&gt;M/L&lt;/math&gt;. 

These relations imply that &lt;math&gt;M \propto L \propto I R^2 \propto \sigma^2 R&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 \propto IR&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;R \propto \sigma^2 I^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. 

However, there are observed deviations from homology, i.e. &lt;math&gt;M/L\propto L^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0.2&lt;/math&gt; in the optical band. This implies that &lt;math&gt;M \propto L^{1+\alpha} \propto I^{1+\alpha} R^{2+2\alpha} \propto \sigma^2 R&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;R \propto \sigma^{2/(1+2\alpha)} I^{-(1+\alpha)/(1+2\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;R \propto \sigma^{1.42} I^{-0.86}&lt;/math&gt;. This is consistent with the observed relation.

Two limiting cases for the assembly of galaxies are as follows.
* If elliptical galaxies form by mergers of smaller galaxies with no dissipation, then the specific kinetic energy is conserved &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = &lt;/math&gt;constant. Using the above mentioned assumptions implies that &lt;math&gt;R \propto I^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

* If elliptical galaxies form by dissipational collapse then &lt;math&gt;\sigma\propto (GM/R)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; increases as &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; decreases for constant &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy the virial theorem and &lt;math&gt;M\propto L \propto IR^2&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;R\propto I^{-0.5}&lt;/math&gt;. 

The observed relation &lt;math&gt;R_e \propto \langle I \rangle_e^{-0.83\pm0.08}&lt;/math&gt; lies between these limits.

==Notes==
Diffuse dwarf ellipticals do not lie on the fundamental plane as shown by Kormendy (1987).  Gudehus (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Gudehus, D. "Systematic bias in cluster galaxy data, affecting galaxy distances and evolutionary history", Astrophys. J., vol. 382, pp. 1-18 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; found that galaxies brighter than &lt;math&gt;M_V=-23.04&lt;/math&gt; lie on one plane, and those fainter than this value, &lt;math&gt;M '&lt;/math&gt;, lie on another plane.  The two planes are inclined by about 11 degrees.

The '''gag-onc fusion protein''' (also written as '''Gag-v-Onc''', with "v" indicating that the Onc sequence resides in a viral genome)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genes VII |last1=Lewin |first1=Benjamin |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0198792765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a general term for a [[fusion protein]] formed from a [[group-specific antigen]] ('gag') gene and that of an [[oncogene]] ('onc'), a gene that plays a role in the development of a cancer. ''Onc'' is a generic placeholder for a given specific oncogene, such as [[C-jun]]. (In the case of a fusion with [[C-jun]], the resulting "gag-jun" protein is known alternatively as [[RELA|p65]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?Db=mesh&amp;Cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;Term=%22Oncogene+Protein+p65(gag-jun)%22%5BMeSH+Terms%5D|title=Oncogene Protein p65(gag-jun) - MeSH - NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gag genes are part of a general architecture for [[Oncovirus#Description of virus|retroviruses]], viruses that replicate through [[reverse transcription]], where the gag region of the [[genome]] encodes proteins that constitute the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid of the mature virus particles. Like in [[HIV#Replication cycle|HIV's replication cycle]], these proteins are needed for [[Viral shedding#Via budding|viral budding]] from the host cell's plasma membrane, where the fully formed [[virion]]s leave the cell to infect other cells.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Virology'', 3rd edition, Vol. 1, Molecular Biology, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As a specific case, a Gag-v-Onc fusion protein from the [[Rous sarcoma virus]] is useful in illustrating the dual role that the fusion protein plays in both the viral and host cellular life cycle. For example, the viral gene [[Rous sarcoma virus#Src gene|Src]] (as in "sarcoma") is not necessary for viral reproduction, but does affect [[virulence]]. Due to evidence&lt;ref name="pmid6273838"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smart JE, Oppermann H, Czernilofsky AP, Purchio AF, Erikson RL, Bishop JM | title = Characterization of sites for tyrosine phosphorylation in the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus (pp60v-src) and its normal cellular homologue (pp60c-src) | journal = Proc.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These subsequent mutations are responsible for the oncogenic capabilities of the virus, as the normal (host) version of the Src gene, [[C-src tyrosine kinase|c-Src]] promotes survival, [[angiogenesis]], [[Cell growth|proliferation]] and invasion pathways. These native pathways are disrupted in the presence of the mutant Src gene (v-Src) such that oncogenesis becomes more likely for the infected host cells, since the v-Src gene is [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into a functionally distinct version of its host counterpart.

When a viral gene is introduced into the host cell and is sufficient to induce oncogenesis – the creation of cancerous cells – in the infected cell line, the gene is said to be a "viral transforming gene".&lt;ref name="Amazon-1555814808"&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Virology, Vol. 2: Pathogenesis and Control |isbn=978-1-55581-480-9 |date=December 1, 2008 |publisher=ASM Press |edition=3  |first=S. Jane |last=Flint}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this type of gene is [[Translation (biology)|translated]] to a protein, the protein is called a "transforming protein". Note that since the viral oncogenes originated from a host genome, the transformation event is different from [[Transduction (genetics)#More general uses of the term|transduction]], which describes the process of introducing non-native genes to a host organism via a viral infection.

In the case of the [[murine leukemia virus]]es, a species of viruses capable of causing cancer in [[murine]]s (mice), the viral life cycle can also be responsible for oncogenesis through a Gag-v-Onc fusion protein called "Mo-MuLV(src)", which is a Gag-v-Src protein capable of inducing oncogenesis in living mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Image:Survey instruments-2.png|thumb|A surveyor's shed showing equipment used for geomatics]]
'''Geomatics''' is defined in the [[ISO/TC 211]] series of standards as the "[[academic discipline|discipline]] concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of [[geographic data or geographic information]]".&lt;ref&gt;ISO/TR 19122:2004(en)
Geographic information/Geomatics — Qualification and certification of personnel [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:tr:19122:ed-1:v1:en]&lt;/ref&gt; Under another definition it "consists of products, services and tools involved in the collection, integration and management of geographic data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedgeomatics.net/about-us.html|title=About Us|author=|date=|website=Applied Geomatics Research Laboratory|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It includes '''geomatics engineering''' (and [[surveying engineering]]) and is related to geospatial science (also geospatial engineering and geospatial technology).

==Overview and etymology ==

Michel Paradis, a French-Canadian surveyor, introduced ''geomatics'' as a new scientific term in an article published in 1981 in ''The Canadian Surveyor'' and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the [[Canadian Institute of Geomatics|Canadian Institute of Surveying]] in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in history and in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Paradis|first1= Michel|title= De l'arpentage à la géomatique|journal= Le géomètre canadien|date= September 1981|volume= 35| issue = 3|page=262 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in [[land surveying]], [[remote sensing]], [[cartography]], [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), [[Satellite navigation|global-navigation satellite systems]] ([[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], [[Compass navigation system|Compass]]), [[photogrammetry]], [[geophysics]], [[geography]], and related forms of earth [[map]]ping. The term was originally used in [[Canada]], because it is similar in origin to both French and English,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} but has since been adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]], and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the [[United States]]) have shown a preference for the term ''geospatial technology''.{{ref}}{{verify source|date=April 2015}}

The related field of ''hydrogeomatics'' covers the area associated with surveying work carried out on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of water. The older term of [[hydrography|hydrographics]] was considered{{by whom|date=April 2015}} too specific to the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader concept of positioning or measurements in all marine environments.

A ''geospatial network'' is a network of collaborating resources for sharing and coordinating geographical data and data tied to geographical references. One example of such a network is the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]'s efforts to provide ''ready global access to geographic information''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

A number{{quantify|date=April 2015}} of university departments which were once titled "surveying", "survey engineering" or "[[topographic]] science" have re-titled themselves using the terms "geomatics" or "geomatic engineering".

The rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has been made possible by advances in [[computer]] hardware, [[computer science]], and [[software engineering]], as well as by airborne and space observation [[remote-sensing]] technologies.

The science of deriving information about an object using a sensor without physically contacting it is called remote sensing, which is a part of geomatics.

{{see also|Geographic information science}}
'''Geospatial science''' is an academic discipline incorporating fields such as [[surveying]], [[geographic information systems]], [[hydrography]] and [[cartography]]. Spatial science is typically concerned with the measurement, management, analysis and display of spatial information describing the Earth, its physical features and the built environment.&lt;ref name="QUT"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bee.qut.edu.au/study/courses/undergraduate/spatial.jsp |title=Queensland University of Technology, ''Undergratuate Program - Spatial Science (Surveying)'' |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719223038/http://www.bee.qut.edu.au/study/courses/undergraduate/spatial.jsp |archive-date=2008-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cleanup merge|Geomatics engineering|date=April 2016}}
'''Geomatics Engineering, Geomatic Engineering, Geospatial Engineering''' is a rapidly developing engineering discipline that focuses on spatial information (i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization. Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics Engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Civil Engineering.

Geomatics is a field that incorporates several others such as the older field of land [[surveying engineering]] along with many other aspects of spatial data management ranging from [[data science]] and [[cartography]] to [[geography]]. Following the advanced developments in digital data processing, the nature of the tasks required of the professional land surveyor has evolved and the term "surveying" no longer accurately covers the whole range of tasks that the profession deals with. As our societies become more complex, information with a spatial position associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making, both from a personal and a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-scale governmental viewpoint.

Therefore, the geomatics engineer can be involved in an extremely wide variety of information gathering activities and applications. Geomatics engineers design, develop, and operate systems for collecting and analyzing spatial information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and manmade features.

The more traditional [[land surveying]] strand of geomatics engineering is concerned with the determination and recording of boundaries and areas of [[real property]] parcels, and the preparation and interpretation of legal land descriptions.  The tasks more closely related to [[civil engineering]] include the design and layout of public infrastructure and urban subdivisions, and mapping and control surveys for construction projects.

Geomatics engineers serve society by collecting, monitoring, archiving, and maintaining diverse spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineers utilize a wide range of technologically advanced tools such as digital [[theodolite]]/distance meter total stations, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) equipment, digital aerial imagery (both satellite and air-borne), and computer-based [[geographic information system]]s (GIS). These tools enable the geomatics engineer to gather, process, analyze, visualize and manage spatially related information to solve a wide range of technical and societal problems.

Geomatics engineering is the field of activity that integrates the acquisition, processing, analysis, display and management of spatial information. It is an exciting and new grouping of subjects in the spatial and environmental information sciences with a broad range of employment opportunities as well as offering challenging pure and applied research problems in a vast range of interdisciplinary fields.

In different schools and in different countries the same education curriculum is administered with the name [[surveying]] in some, and in others with the names geomatics, geomatics engineering, geospatial (information) engineering, surveying engineering, or geodesy and geoinformatics. While these occupations were at one time often taught in [[civil engineering]] education programs, more and more universities include the departments relevant for geo-data sciences under [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[computer science]] or [[applied mathematics]]. These facts demonstrate the breadth, depth and scope of the highly interdisciplinary nature of geomatics engineering.
The job of ''geospatial engineer'' is well established in the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/construction-engineering/geospatial-engineer.html|title=Geospatial Engineer Jobs (12Y)|author=|date=|website=goarmy.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalguard.com/12y-geospatial-engineer|title=12Y Geospatial Engineer - National Guard|author=|date=|website=www.nationalguard.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green information system''' ('''green IS''') or Green IT as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT"  is a combination of [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[information technology]] (IT). The relationship between information technology and the environment is complex, because of  the negative environmental impact of IT production, use, and disposal then, making this effect greener has been termed [[Green Information Technology]], which considers IT's environmental impact primarily as a problem to be mitigated. Another effect involves the positive impact of using [[information system]]s (IS) to improve the eco-sustainability of businesses and society; this is termed green IS. This green IS viewpoint sees IS as a partial solution to many environmental problems. So green IS is a solution for the negative environmental effect of information technology. IS facilitates the reuse of waste and energy and can serve as a tool for industrial symbiosis, which involves "the mutualistic interaction of different industries for beneficial reuse of waste flows or energy cascading that results in a more resource-efficient production system and fewer adverse environmental impacts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gholami|first1=Roya|last2=Binti Sulaiman|first2=Ainin|last3=Ramayah|first3=T|last4=Molla|first4=Alemayehu|title=Senior managers’ perception on green information systems (IS) adoption and environmental performance: Results from a field survey.|journal=Information &amp; Management|date=2013|volume=50|issue=7|pages=431–438|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720613000724|doi=10.1016/j.im.2013.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Wölfli General view of the island Neveranger, 1911.jpg|thumb|Many paintings by [[outsider art]]ist [[Adolf Wölfli]] contain space filled with writing or musical notation]]
[[File:M73 13.jpg|thumb|''The Fall of Babylon'', [[engraving]] by [[Jean Duvet]] from the ''Apocalypse'' series, circa 1555, plate size: 11 ⅞ x 8 ⅜ in.]]

In [[visual art]], '''horror vacui''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|r|ər|_|ˈ|v|ɑː|k|juː|aɪ}}; from [[Latin]] "fear of empty space"), also '''kenophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] "fear of the empty"),&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Brown: ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Vol.&amp;nbsp;1:&amp;nbsp;A−M. [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]], Oxford 1993, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; is the filling of the entire surface of a space or an [[Work of art|artwork]] with [[Complexity|detail]].&lt;ref&gt;[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/horror%20vacui]] horror vacui as defined in the Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term is associated with the Italian art critic and scholar [[Mario Praz]], who used it to describe the suffocating atmosphere and clutter of interior design in the [[Victorian age]].&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William, and Kritina Holden, Jill Butler|title=Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=Beverly, Massachusetts|isbn=1592535879|pages=128–9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older, and more artistically esteemed examples can be seen on [[Migration period art]] objects like the [[carpet page]]s of [[Insular art|Insular]] illuminated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]]. This feeling of meticulously filling empty spaces also permeates [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] Islamic art from ancient times to the present. Another example comes from ancient Greece during the [[Geometric Art|Geometric Age]] (1100 - 900 BCE), when horror vacui was considered a stylistic element of all art. The mature work of the French Renaissance engraver [[Jean Duvet]] consistently exhibits horror vacui.

==Examples==
Some examples of horror vacui in art come from, or are influenced by, the [[mentally ill|mentally unstable]] and inmates of [[psychiatric hospitals]], such as [[Richard Dadd]] in the 19th century, and many modern examples fall under the category of [[Outsider Art]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Horror vacui may have also had an impact, consciously or unconsciously, on [[graphic design]] by artists like [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] or [[Vaughan Oliver]], and in the [[underground comix]] movement in the work of [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and on later comic artists such as [[Mark Beyer (comics)|Mark Beyer]]. The paintings of Williams, [[Faris Badwan]], Emerson Barrett, [[Joe Coleman (painter)|Joe Coleman]] and [[Todd Schorr]] are further examples of horror vacui in the modern [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow]] art movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The [[entheogen]]-inspired [[visionary art]] of certain [[indigenous peoples]], such as the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] yarn paintings and the [[ayahuasca]]-inspired art of [[Pablo Amaringo]], often exhibits this style, as does the [[psychedelic art]] movement of the [[1960s counterculture]]. Sometimes the patterned art in clothing of indigenous peoples of Middle and South America exhibits horror vacui. For example, the geometric [[Mola (art form)|molas]] of [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] people and the traditional clothing on [[Shipibo-Conibo]] people.

The artwork in the [[Where's Wally?]] series of children's books is a commonly known example of horror vacui, as are many of the small books written or illustrated by the macabre imagination of [[Edward Gorey]].

The [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]] painting style of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is a contemporary example of horror vacui. Other African artists such as Malangatana of Mozambique ([[Malangatana Ngwenya]]) also fill the canvas in this way.

The arrangement of [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[hieroglyphs]] suggests an abhorrence of empty space. Signs are repeated or [[phonetic complement]]s added to prevent gaps.

Horror vacui also strikes mapmakers. In the times of the [[Age of Discovery|Discoveries]], for instance, it was common for cartographers to fill in the ''[[Terra incognita]]'' or the poorly known oceans with [[Sea monster|monsters]] or simply with the [[Scale (map)|scale]] of the map, rather than to leave them blank.

==Current usage and meaning==
{{double image|right|Only Two Colours.jpg|150|Mango store in Barcelona.jpg|150|''Horror vacui'' and value perception}}
There is an inverse relationship between ''horror vacui'' and value perception, and commercial designers favour [[minimalism]] in shop window displays and advertising to appeal to affluent and well-educated consumers, on the premise that understatement and restraint appeals more to affluent and well-educated audiences.&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden" /&gt;


==Analogy==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The term is also used as an analogy to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Horror vacui (physics)|idea]] that a physical vacuum is impossible, and therefore the idea must be rejected.  This was widely believed up to the time of [[Rene Descartes]].

==Global Peace Index ==
The core asset of the IEP is the [[Global Peace Index]] (GPI), which is now considered the benchmark study in measuring peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-40118188|title=Global Peace Index 2017: World 0.28% more peaceful than last year|last=|first=|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/events/measuring-and-understanding-peace|title=Measuring and Understanding Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI has been recognized by leading analysts and institutions, and has been incorporated into reports such as the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]'s Year Book (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Appendix 2B.

The data for the GPI is collected and collated in collaboration with the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] (EIU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Detailed information can be found from | url= http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=corporate_landing_united_nations&amp;rf=0| accessdate =2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the research and analysis arm of the [[Economist Group]], and the methodology is informed and reviewed each year by an international panel of peace and statistics experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Peaceful Nations|publisher= Alliance for Peacebuilding |url= http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/documents/GSPNPeacefulNationsReportFinal_001.pdf| accessdate =2010-04-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI is released annually with presentations typically held in [[London]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Geneva]], [[Paris]], [[New York City]], [[Sydney]], [[Brussels]] and [[The Hague]].

The GPI is used by various international organizations, such as the [[United Nations|UN]] and [[World bank|World Bank]] as a source of data and information as well as being used by academics and universities around the world.

In addition, the GPI was the empirical basis for the Symposium of Peaceful Nations, a 3-day conference hosted in November 2009 to honor the most peaceful countries in each of nine regions of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/documents/GSPNPeacefulNationsReportFinal_001.pdf|title=Symposium of Peaceful Nations|accessdate=2010-04-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which [[Helen Clark]], UNDP Administrator, delivered the keynote address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2009/november/helen-clark-statement-at-the-global-symposium-of-peaceful-nations.en|title=Helen Clark: Statement at the Global Symposium of Peaceful Nations|accessdate=2010-04-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228165855/http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2009/november/helen-clark-statement-at-the-global-symposium-of-peaceful-nations.en|archivedate=2010-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Economics &amp; Peace, in 2016, marked 10 years of measuring and analysing global levels of peace. In celebration of this milestone, IEP along with the Diplomatic Courier Magazine hosted the Future of Peace Summit in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/event/2016/06/future-of-peace-summit/|title=Future of Peace Summit|work=Alliance for Peacebuilding|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th annual GPI launched in June 2017 includes 163 countries in the world, and the interactive map on [http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/ the website] explains the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/global-peace-index-us-middle-east-relations-donald-trump-syria-politics-iran-a7766561.html|title=Last year there were 10 countries in the world entirely free from war.

The 2017 GPI recorded a small improvement in average global peace, with 93 countries recording higher levels of peace and 68 recording a deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australian_outlook/global-peace-17/|title=The Status of World Peace May Surprise You|work=Australian Institute of International Affairs|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Peace Indices==
IEP has also launched a series of National Peace Indices. The first one was the United States Peace Index ([[United States Peace Index|USPI]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/us-peace-index/|title=US Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2011. The USPI ranks each state in the US by peacefulness and, unlike the [[Global Peace Index|GPI]], uses only 5 indicators: incarceration rate, the number of police officers, the number of homicides, the availability of small arms, and the number of violent crimes. In 2011 Maine was ranked the most peaceful state, while Louisiana was the least peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/our-uspi-findings&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/03/UK-Peace-Index-report-2013.pdf UK Peace Index] was conducted in 2013. The UK Peace Index provides a comprehensive measure of the levels of peacefulness within the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2012.

The [[Mexico Peace Index]] ([[Mexico Peace Index|MPI]]) is the latest in the series of National Peace Indices. There have been 4 editions of the MPI to date, the first published in 2013, and most recently 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/mexico-peace-index/|title=Mexico Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPI uses five indicators to gauge the level of peace in the 32 Mexican states from 2003-2016. The indicators are: ''Homicide rates, violent crime, detention without a sentence, weapons crime'' and ''organised crime''.

An expert panel is engaged to provide independent advice and technical guidance in developing the methodology, these experts are from independent, non-partisan, civil society and academic organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/mexico-peace-index/|title=Mexico Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 MPI found that peacefulness deteriorated by 4.3% in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/institute-for-economics-and-peace-releases-2017-mexico-peace-index/|title=Institute for Economics and Peace releases 2017 Mexico Peace Index|last=mexicoinstitute|date=2017-04-05|website=Mexico Institute|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the homicide rate rose by 18.4% in the same year. Yucatán is the most peaceful state in Mexico, while Guerrero is the least peaceful state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/peace-index-registers-first-decline-in-5-years/|title=Mexico Peace Index registers first decline in 5 years|date=2017-04-05|work=Mexico News Daily|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data used to calculate the MPI comes from government bodies in Mexico, and IEP uses survey data collection by the national statistical office to adjust the figures for under reporting.

==Global Terrorism Index==
Another flagship report of the IEP is the [[Global Terrorism Index]] ([[Global Terrorism Index|GTI]]) which provides a comprehensive summary of the key global trends and patterns in terrorism. The report analyses data spanning the past 16 years and four editions having been released to date.

The GTI is based on data from the [[Global Terrorism Database|Global Terrorism Database (GTD)]]. It ranks 163 countries based on four indicators, those indicators are; ''number of terrorist incidents in a given year, number of fatalities from terrorist incidents in a given year, number of injuries caused by terrorist in a given year'' and ''measure of the total property damage from terrorist incidents in a given year.''

The 2016 GTI report found a ten per cent decrease in the number of deaths from terrorism in 2015 resulted in 3,389 fewer deaths than 2014, a global total of 29,376 deaths made 2015 the second deadliest year on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/world/global-terrorism-report/index.html|title=Terror attacks in developed world surge 650% in one year|last=CNN|first=Kara Fox and Dave Gilbert|website=CNN|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Economic Value of Peace ==
The [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/The-Economic-Value-of-Peace-2016-WEB.pdf Economic Value of Peace report] estimates of the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy.

It provides an empirical basis to calculate the potential additional economic benefits from improvements in peace. It estimates the economic impact of violence for 163 countries and independent territories representing 99.5 per cent of the global economy and population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy/|title=How much does violence really cost our global economy?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] in 2016, equivalent to 12.6% of global GDP, or $1,953 per person, this figure represented the first decline in the economic impact of violence since 2011, which is the year that corresponded with the start of the Syrian war and ISIL's territorial gains in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-peace-index-idUSKBN0OX0AU20150617|title=Cost of violence hits $14 trillion in increasingly divided world|date=2015-06-17|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Peace Report==
On October 26, 2010, IEP and Peace and Media Tenor released “Measuring Peace in the Media”, the first study that takes a fact-based approach into understanding the accuracy of international television networks’ coverage of peace, violence and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/info-center/measuring-peace-in-the-media/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107121303/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/info-center/measuring-peace-in-the-media/# |archive-date=2011-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results show broad inconsistencies across geographies and networks, with US broadcasters much more focused on violence and conflict than their European and Middle Eastern counterparts. Al Jazeera was found to be the network providing the most balanced coverage on Afghanistan. BBC World led the way when it came to breadth of coverage. It regularly reported on 67 countries across six continents which is nearly twice as many countries as the average level of coverage.

The study analysed 37 TV news and current affairs programmes from 23 networks in 15 countries* and then cross-referenced this with the Global Peace Index which measures the levels of peace and violence in 149 countries. BBC 2 Newsnight and ZDF Heute Journal (Germany) were found to be the programmes whose editorial policies aligned their coverage most closely with the rankings of the GPI.

Positive-peace stories make up just 1.6% of the total number of stories examined in the study. These are stories that report on active steps taken to rectify violent situations. Such a small percentage may be partly related to what is considered newsworthy and dramatic, such as high-impact, violent or controversial events. However, the stereotyping of nations which are low on the GPI makes it harder for audiences to gain empathy and therefore to support governments and make headway towards creating peace.

== Positive Peace ==
Positive Peace is an innovative and empirically based framework which has been developed by IEP to identify and understand the factors which are statistically associated with peaceful and resilient societies. Positive Peace is measured by IEP on the [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/Positive-Peace-Report-2016.pdf Positive Peace Index (PPI)].

While the Global Peace Index measures 'Negative Peace' being the absence of violence or fear of violence, Positive Peace represents the capacity for a society to meet the needs of its citizens, reduce and deal with grievances without the use of violence.

The framework is based on the quantitatively identifiable common characteristics of the world's most peaceful societies.

The defining feature of IEP’s Positive Peace framework is the [[systems approach]] to peace. IEP research has demonstrated that high levels of peacefulness are associated with strength in not just one, but all eight factors of Positive Peace. All domains are highly interrelated and work together systemically in producing a peaceful society.

== Reception ==
The [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=think_tanks Global Go To Think Tank Index] listed the Institute for Economics and Peace as a "Think Tank to Watch", and as one of the top 20 most impactful Think Tanks worldwide with a Budget under $5 Million.

In 2013, Steve Killelea’s founding of IEP was recognized as one of the 50 most impactful philanthropic gifts in Australia’s history by a coalition including the Myer Family Company, [[Myer Foundation|The Myer Foundation]] and Sidney Myer Fund, Pro Bono Australia, [[Swinburne University]] and Philanthropy Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2013/10/australia%E2%80%99s-top-50-philanthropic-gifts-all-time#sthash.HlK828IS.dpuf|title=Australia’s Top 50 Philanthropic Gifts of All Time|date=2013-10-14|publisher=ProBono Australia|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Parker attended [[Boston University|Boston University's]] College of Engineering and graduated in 1989.  He earned a Master of Science degree in 1993 and a doctoral degree in applied physics in 1998 from [[Vanderbilt University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/professor-and-paratrooper/|title=Professor and Paratrooper - BU Today - Boston University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/kkparker|title=Kit Parker|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Parker is a paratrooper who has served in the United States Army since 1992. After the [[September 11 attacks]], he served two tours of duty in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lelaboratoirecambridge.com/kevin-kit-parker|title=Le Laboratoire Cambridge - Art and Design Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his combat tours, Parker conducted two missions into Afghanistan as part of the [[Gray Team]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/10/481568316/how-a-team-of-elite-doctors-changed-the-military-s-stance-on-brain-trauma|title=How A Team Of Elite Doctors Changed The Military's Stance On Brain Trauma|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6064/news-summaries|title=News this Week|first=American Association for the Advancement of|last=Science|date=6 January 2012|publisher=|volume=335|issue=6064|pages=18|via=science.sciencemag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian career ==
Initially, at Harvard the focus of his research was heart muscle cells.  He turned to traumatic brain injury in 2005 after realizing that an Army friend of his, who had received injuries in an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] blast in [[Iraq]] in 2005, was suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition rather than a psychological problem.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/08/480608042/an-army-buddys-call-for-help-sends-a-scientist-on-brain-injury-quest|title=Shots: An Army Buddy's Call For Help Sends A Scientist On A Brain Injury Quest |last=Hamilton|first=Jon|date=8 June 2016|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geo&gt;{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Alexander |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/healing-soldiers/blast-force.html |title=Blast Force: The Invisible War on the Brain |newspaper=National Geographic magazine |date=February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other research of Parker's includes designing camouflage using skin cells of [[cuttlefish]] and the use of a cotton candy machine to make dressings for wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/where-science-meets-war-kit-parkers-lab/|title=Where science meets war: Kit Parker's lab|date=4 August 2013|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker served on the Defense Science Research Council for nearly a decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyss.harvard.edu/team/core-faculty/kevin-parker/|title=Kevin Kit Parker, Ph.D.|date=5 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Defense Science Board Task Force on Autonomy, and has consulted to other US government agencies as well as the medical device and pharma industry.

In 2011, Parker headed Harvard's committee for reintroducing [[ROTC]] at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stacy Teicher |last=Khadaroo |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2011/0330/ROTC-returns-to-Harvard-Does-officer-training-program-need-Ivy-League |title=ROTC returns to Harvard: Does officer training program need Ivy League? |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, it was announced that The Disease Biophysics Group at Harvard, led by Kit Parker, created a tissue-engineered soft-robotic ray that swims using wave-like fin motions, and turns according to externally applied light cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diseasebiophysics.seas.harvard.edu/research/living-soft-robots/|title=Living Soft Robots «  SEAS DBG|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Levantine corridor''' is the relatively narrow strip between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the northwest and [[desert]]s to the southeast which connects [[Africa]] to [[Eurasia]]. This corridor is a land route of migrations of animals between Eurasia and Africa. In particular, it is believed that early [[hominin]]s [[Out of Africa I|spread from Africa]] to [[Eurasia]] via the Levantine corridor and [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Goren-Inbar, John D. Speth (eds.), "Human [[Paleoecology]] in the Levantine Corridor". 1994, {{ISBN|1-84217-155-0}} ([http://www.palarch.nl/wp-content/vos_de_j_2006_review_of_goren_inbar_n_and_jd_speth_eds_2004_human_paleoecology_in_the_levantine_corridor_published_by_oxbow_books.pdf book review])&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor is named after the [[Levant]].

The Levantine Corridor is the western part of  the [[Fertile Crescent]], the eastern part being [[Mesopotamia]].

Botanists recognize this area as a dispersal route of [[flora|plant]] species.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Yosef O. Pleistocene connections between Africa and Southwest Asia: an archaeological perspective,  ''[[African Archaeological Review]]'', 1987, vol. 5, pp. 29–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of Y-chromosome and mtDNA haplogroups suggests that during the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods, the Levantine corridor was more important for bi-directional human migrations between Africa and Eurasia than was the Horn of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/AJHG_2004_v74_p000-0130.pdf J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3906">'''Logic redundancy''' occurs in a [[logic gate|digital gate]] network containing circuitry that does not affect the static logic function. There are several reasons why logic redundancy may exist. One reason is that it may have been added deliberately to suppress transient glitches (thus causing a [[race condition]]) in the output signals by having two or more product terms overlap with a third one.

Consider the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = A B + \overline{A} C + B C.
&lt;/math&gt;

The third product term &lt;math&gt;BC&lt;/math&gt; is a redundant [[Consensus theorem|consensus term]]. If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; switches from 1 to 0 while &lt;math&gt;B = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; remains 1.  During the transition of signal &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in logic gates, both the first and second term may be 0 momentarily. The third term prevents a glitch since its value of 1 in this case is not affected by the transition of signal &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Another reason for logic redundancy is poor design practices which unintentionally result in logically redundantly terms. This causes an unnecessary increase in network complexity, and possibly hampering the ability to test manufactured designs using traditional test methods (single stuck-at fault models). (Note: testing might be possible using [[Iddq testing|IDDQ]] models.)

==Removing logic redundancy==
Logic redundancy is, in general, not desired.
Redundancy, by definition, requires extra parts (in this case: logical terms) which raises the cost of implementation (either actual cost of physical parts or [[CPU time]] to process).
Logic redundancy can be removed by several well-known techniques, such as [[Karnaugh map]]s, the [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]], and the [[Espresso heuristic logic minimizer|heuristic computer method]].

==Adding logic redundancy==
{{Main|hazard (logic)}}

[[Image:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.svg|thumb|A k-map showing a particular logic function]]

In some cases it may be desirable to ''add'' logic redundancy.  One of those cases is to avoid [[race condition]]s whereby an output can fluctuate because different terms are "racing" to turn off and on.  To explain this in more concrete terms the [[Karnaugh map]] to the right shows the minterms and maxterms for the following function:

:&lt;math&gt;f(A, B, C, D) = E(6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14).\ &lt;/math&gt;

The boxes represent the minimal AND/OR terms needed to implement this function:

:&lt;math&gt;F = A\overline{C} + A\overline{B} + BC\overline{D}.&lt;/math&gt;

The k-map visually shows where [[race condition]]s occur in the minimal expression by having gaps between minterms or gaps between maxterms.  For example, the gap between the blue and green rectangles.  If the input &lt;math&gt;ABCD=1110&lt;/math&gt; were to change to &lt;math&gt;ABCD=1010&lt;/math&gt; then a race will occur between &lt;math&gt;BC\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt; turning off and &lt;math&gt;A\overline{B}&lt;/math&gt; turning off.
If the blue term switches off before the green turns on then the output will fluctuate and may register as 0.
Another race condition is between the blue and the red for transition of &lt;math&gt;ABCD=1110&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;ABCD=1100&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:K-map 6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 anti-race.svg|thumb|left|Above k-map with the &lt;math&gt;A\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt; term added to avoid race hazards]]

The race condition is removed by adding in logic redundancy, which is contrary to the aims of using a k-map in the first place.
Both minterm race conditions are covered by addition of the yellow term &lt;math&gt;A\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt;.
(The maxterm race condition is covered by addition of the green-bordered grey term &lt;math&gt;A+\overline{D}&lt;/math&gt;.)

In this case, the addition of logic redundancy has stabilized the output to avoid output fluctuations because terms are racing each other to change state.

The [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of '''materials science''', also commonly termed '''materials science and engineering''' is the design and discovery of new materials, particularly [[solid]]s. The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when researchers began to use analytical thinking from [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]] to understand ancient, [[Empirical relationship|phenomenological]] observations in [[metallurgy]] and [[mineralogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Eddy|first1= Matthew Daniel|title= The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750–1800|date= 2008|publisher= Ashgate|url= https://www.academia.edu/1112014|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903230852/http://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_|archivedate= 2015-09-03|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Cyril Stanley |authorlink= Cyril Stanley Smith |title= A Search for Structure |date= 1981 |publisher= MIT Press |isbn= 978-0262191913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study, within either the Science or Engineering schools, hence the naming. 
:Materials science is a syncretic discipline hybridizing metallurgy, ceramics, solid-state physics, and chemistry. It is the first example of a new academic discipline emerging by fusion rather than fission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] (1979) interdisciplinary science on campus, pages 161–96 in ''Interdisciplinarity and Higher Education'', J.J. Kockelmans editor, [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to the limits of the materials that are available and how they are used. Thus, breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of technology significantly.&lt;ref name=BESAC2008&gt;{{Cite report |last= Hemminger |first= John C. |date= August 2010 |title= Science for Energy Technology: Strengthening the Link between Basic Research and Industry |url= http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |publisher= United States Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee |accessdate= 3 August 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150821010038/http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |archivedate= 2015-08-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carbcap&gt;{{Cite report |last1= Alivisatos |first1= Paul |last2= Buchanan |first2= Michelle |date= March 2010 |title= Basic Research Needs for Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020 |url= http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |publisher= United States Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee |accessdate= 3 August 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150821010038/http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |archivedate= 2015-08-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (its ''processing'') influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance. The understanding of processing-structure-properties relationships is called the {{Section link||materials paradigm}}. This paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas, including [[nanotechnology]], [[biomaterial]]s, and metallurgy. Materials science is also an important part of [[forensic engineering]] and [[failure analysis]] – investigating materials, products, structures or components which fail or do not function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to understanding, for example, the causes of various [[aviation accidents and incidents]].

==History==
{{Main|History of materials science}}
[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade.]]
The material of choice of a given era is often a defining point. Phrases such as [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], and [[Industrial Revolution|Steel Age]] are historic, if arbitrary examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of [[ceramic]]s and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. Modern materials science evolved directly from [[metallurgy]], which itself evolved from mining and (likely) ceramics and earlier from the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] demonstrated that the [[thermodynamic]] properties related to [[atom]]ic structure in various [[phase (matter)|phases]] are related to the physical properties of a material. Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the [[space race]]: the understanding and [[engineering]] of the metallic [[alloy]]s, and [[silica]] and [[carbon]] materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as [[rubber]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[biomaterial]]s.

Before the 1960s (and in some cases decades after), many ''materials science'' departments were named ''metallurgy'' departments, reflecting the 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals. The growth of materials science in the United States was catalyzed in part by the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]], which funded a series of university-hosted laboratories in the early 1960s "to expand the national program of basic research and training in the materials sciences."&lt;ref name=martin-pip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change? Solid State Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, and Materials Science|journal=Physics in Perspective|date=2015|volume=17|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s00016-014-0151-7|pages=3–32|bibcode= 2015PhP....17....3M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field has since broadened to include every class of materials, including [[Ceramic engineering|ceramics]], [[polymer]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[magnetism|magnetic]] materials, [[medical implant]] materials, biological materials, and nanomaterials, with modern materials classed within 3 distinct groups: Ceramic, Metal or Polymer. The prominent change in materials science during the last two decades is active usage of computer simulation methods to find new compounds, predict various properties.

[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The materials paradigm represented in the form of a tetrahedron.]]
A material is defined as a substance (most often a solid, but other condensed phases can be included) that is intended to be used for certain applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nmat/authors/index.html "For Authors: Nature Materials"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234616/http://www.nature.com/nmat/authors/index.html |date=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a myriad of materials around us—they can be found in anything from buildings to spacecraft. Materials can generally be further divided into two classes: [[crystal]]line and [[amorphous|non-crystalline]]. The traditional examples of materials are [[metal]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[ceramic]]s and [[polymer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. "Materials Science and Engineering – An Introduction" (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; New and advanced materials that are being developed include [[nanomaterials]], [[biomaterial]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. Materials Science and Engineering – An Introduction (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.10-12&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Photovoltaic cell|energy materials]] to name a few.
 
The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[Material properties|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a given application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

===Structure===
As mentioned above, structure is one of the most important components of the field of materials science. Materials science examines the structure of materials from the atomic scale, all the way up to the macro scale. [[Characterization (materials science)|Characterization]] is the way materials scientists examine the structure of a material. This involves methods such as diffraction with [[X-ray]]s, [[electron]]s, or [[neutron]]s, and various forms of [[spectroscopy]] and [[chemical analysis]] such as [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy-dispersive spectroscopy]] (EDS), [[chromatography]], [[thermal analysis]], [[electron microscope]] analysis, etc. Structure is studied at various levels, as detailed below.

====Atomic structure====
This deals with the atoms of the materials, and how they are arranged to give molecules, crystals, etc. Much of the electrical, magnetic and chemical properties of materials arise from this level of structure. The length scales involved are in angstroms([[Å]]).
The way in which the atoms and molecules are bonded and arranged is fundamental to studying the properties and behavior of any material.

====Nanostructure====
{{Main|Nanostructure}}
[[File:Buckminsterfullerene-perspective-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Buckminsterfullerene]] nanostructure.]]
Nanostructure deals with objects and structures that are in the 1—100&amp;nbsp;nm range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes |author= Cristina Buzea |author2= Ivan Pacheco |author3= Kevin Robbie |last-author-amp= yes |title= Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity |journal= Biointerphases |volume= 2 |date= 2007 |pages= MR17–MR71 |doi= 10.1116/1.2815690 |pmid= 20419892 |issue= 4 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120703014917/http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes |archivedate= 2012-07-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many materials, atoms or molecules agglomerate together to form objects at the nanoscale. This causes many interesting electrical, magnetic, optical, and mechanical properties.

In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the [[nanoscale]]. [[Nanotextured surface]]s have ''one dimension'' on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm. Nanotubes have ''two dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical [[nanoparticle]]s have ''three dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and [[ultrafine particle]]s (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometre range. The term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology. Nanoscale structure in biology is often called [[ultrastructure]].

Materials which atoms and molecules form constituents in the nanoscale (i.e., they form nanostructure) are called nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are subject of intense research in the materials science community due to the unique properties that they exhibit.

====Microstructure====
{{Main|Microstructure}}
[[File:Pearlite.jpg|thumb|right|Microstructure of pearlite.]]
Microstructure is defined as the structure of a prepared surface or thin foil of material as revealed by a microscope above 25× magnification. It deals with objects from 100&amp;nbsp;nm to a few cm. The microstructure of a material (which can be broadly classified into metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite) can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behavior, wear resistance, and so on. Most of the traditional materials (such as metals and ceramics) are microstructured.

The manufacture of a perfect [[crystal]] of a material is physically impossible. For example, any crystalline material will contain [[crystallographic defect|defects]] such as [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]], grain boundaries ([[Hall–Petch|Hall–Petch relationship]]), vacancies, interstitial atoms or substitutional atoms. The microstructure of materials reveals these larger defects, so that they can be studied, with significant advances in simulation resulting in exponentially increasing understanding of how defects can be used to enhance material properties.

====Macro structure====
Macro structure is the appearance of a material in the scale millimeters to meters—it is the structure of the material as seen with the naked eye.

===Crystallography===
{{Main|Crystallography}}
[[File:Perovskite.jpg|thumb|Crystal structure of a perovskite with a chemical formula ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Energetics and Crystal Chemical Systematics among Ilmenite, Lithium Niobate, and Perovskite Structures |author= A. Navrotsky |journal= Chem. Mater. |date= 1998 |volume= 10 |issue= 10 |pages= 2787–2793 |doi= 10.1021/cm9801901}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Crystallography is the science that examines the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids. Crystallography is a useful tool for materials scientists. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. Further, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects. Mostly, materials do not occur as a single crystal, but in polycrystalline form, i.e., as an aggregate of small crystals with different orientations. Because of this, the powder diffraction method, which uses diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals, plays an important role in structural determination.
Most materials have a crystalline structure, but some important materials do not exhibit regular crystal structure. [[Polymer]]s display varying degrees of crystallinity, and many are completely noncrystalline. [[Glass]], some ceramics, and many natural materials are [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]], not possessing any long-range order in their atomic arrangements. The study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic and mechanical, descriptions of physical properties.

===Bonding===
{{Main|Chemical bonding}}
To obtain a full understanding of the material structure and how it relates to its properties, the materials scientist must study how the different atoms, ions and molecules are arranged and bonded to each other. This involves the study and use of [[quantum chemistry]] or [[quantum physics]]. [[Solid-state physics]], [[solid-state chemistry]] and [[physical chemistry]] are also involved in the study of bonding and structure.

===Properties===
{{Main|List of materials properties}}
Materials exhibit myriad properties, including the following.
:*Mechanical properties, see [[Strength of materials]]
:*Chemical properties, see [[Chemistry]]
:*Electrical properties, see [[Electricity]]
:*Thermal properties, see [[Thermodynamics]]
:*Optical properties, see [[Optics]] and [[Photonics]]
:*Magnetic properties, see [[Magnetism]]
The properties of a material determine its usability and hence its engineering application.

===Synthesis and processing===
Synthesis and processing involves the creation of a material with the desired micro-nanostructure. From an engineering standpoint, a material cannot be used in industry if no economical production method for it has been developed. Thus, the processing of materials is vital to the field of materials science.

Different materials require different processing or synthesis methods. For example, the processing of metals has historically been very important and is studied under the branch of materials science named ''physical [[metallurgy]]''. Also, chemical and physical methods are also used to synthesize other materials such as [[polymer]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[thin film]]s, etc. As of the early 21st century, new methods are being developed to synthesize nanomaterials such as [[graphene]].

===Thermodynamics===
{{Main|Thermodynamics}}
[[File:Eutektikum new.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point.]]
Thermodynamics is concerned with [[heat]] and [[temperature]] and their relation to [[energy]] and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. It defines [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] variables, such as [[internal energy]], [[entropy]], and [[pressure]], that partly describe a body of matter or radiation. It states that the behavior of those variables is subject to general constraints, that are common to all materials, not the peculiar properties of particular materials. These general constraints are expressed in the four laws of thermodynamics.  Thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body, not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic constituents, such as molecules. The behavior of these microscopic particles is described by, and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from, [[statistical mechanics]].

The study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science. It forms the foundation to treat general phenomena in materials science and engineering, including chemical reactions, magnetism, polarizability, and elasticity. It also helps in the understanding of phase diagrams and phase equilibrium.

===Kinetics===
{{Main|Chemical kinetics}}
[[Chemical kinetics]] is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of equilibrium change under the influence of various forces. When applied to materials science, it deals with how a material changes with time (moves from non-equilibrium to equilibrium state) due to application of a certain field. It details the rate of various processes evolving in materials including shape, size, composition and structure. [[Diffusion]] is important in the study of kinetics as this is the most common mechanism by which materials undergo change.

Kinetics is essential in processing of materials because, among other things, it details how the microstructure changes with application of heat.

==In research==
Materials science has received much attention from researchers. In most universities, many departments ranging from [[physics]] to [[chemistry]] to [[chemical engineering]], along with materials science departments, are involved in materials research. Research in materials science is vibrant and consists of many avenues. The following list is in no way exhaustive. It serves only to highlight certain important research areas.

===Nanomaterials===
{{Main|Nanomaterials}}
[[File:CNTSEM.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[scanning electron microscopy]] image of carbon nanotubes bundles]]
Nanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 and 1000 nanometers (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; meter) but is usually 1—100&amp;nbsp;nm.

Nanomaterials research takes a materials science-based approach to [[nanotechnology]], leveraging advances in materials [[metrology]] and synthesis which have been developed in support of [[microfabrication]] research.  Materials with structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical, electronic, or mechanical properties.

The field of nanomaterials is loosely organized, like the traditional field of chemistry, into organic (carbon-based) nanomaterials such as fullerenes, and inorganic nanomaterials based on other elements, such as silicon. Examples of nanomaterials include [[fullerene]]s, [[carbon nanotube]]s, [[nanocrystal]]s, etc.

===Biomaterials===

A biomaterial is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological systems. The study of biomaterials is called ''bio materials science''. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into developing new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[tissue engineering]], and materials science.

Biomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in a laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches using metallic components, [[polymer]]s, [[bioceramic]]s, or [[composite material]]s. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be benign, like being used for a [[heart valve]], or may be [[Biological activity|bioactive]] with a more interactive functionality such as [[hydroxylapatite]] coated [[hip implant]]s. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time. A biomaterial may also be an [[autograft]], [[allograft]] or [[xenograft]] used as an [[organ transplant]] material.

Semiconductors, metals, and ceramics are used today to form highly complex systems, such as integrated electronic circuits, optoelectronic devices, and magnetic and optical mass storage media. These materials form the basis of our modern computing world, and hence research into these materials is of vital importance.

[[Semiconductor]]s are a traditional example of these types of materials. They are materials that have properties that are intermediate between [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductors]] and [[insulator (electricity)|insulators]]. Their electrical conductivities are very sensitive to impurity concentrations, and this allows for the use of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] to achieve desirable electronic properties. Hence, semiconductors form the basis of the traditional computer.

This field also includes new areas of research such as [[superconductivity|superconducting]] materials, [[spintronics]], [[metamaterial]]s, etc. The study of these materials involves knowledge of materials science and [[solid-state physics]] or [[condensed matter physics]].

===Computational science and theory===
With the increase in computing power, simulating the behavior of materials has become possible. This enables materials scientists to discover properties of materials formerly unknown, as well as to design new materials. Up until now, new materials were found by time-consuming trial and error processes. But, now it is hoped that computational methods could drastically reduce that time, and allow tailoring materials properties. This involves simulating materials at all length scales, using methods such as [[density functional theory]], [[molecular dynamics]], etc.

==In industry==
Radical [[Timeline of materials technology|materials advances]] can drive the creation of new products or even new industries, but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials. Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing methods ([[casting]], [[rolling]], [[welding]], [[ion implantation]], [[crystal growth]], [[thin-film deposition]], [[sintering]], [[glassblowing]], etc.), and analytic methods (characterization methods such as [[electron microscopy]], [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]], [[calorimetry]], [[Microprobe|nuclear microscopy (HEFIB)]], [[Rutherford backscattering]], [[neutron diffraction]], small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), etc.).

Besides material characterization, the material scientist or engineer also deals with extracting materials and converting them into useful forms. Thus ingot casting, foundry methods, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer. Often the presence, absence, or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will greatly affect the final properties of the materials produced. For example, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extracting and purifying methods used to extract iron in a blast furnace can affect the quality of steel that is produced.

===Ceramics and glasses===
{{Main|Ceramic}}
[[File:Si3N4bearings.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ceramic bearing parts]]
Another application of material science is the structures of [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]] typically associated with the most brittle materials. Bonding in ceramics and glasses uses covalent and ionic-covalent types with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (silica or sand) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay or as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. The structure of glass forms into an amorphous state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Scratch resistant Corning [[Gorilla Glass]] is a well-known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics.

Engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high temperatures, compression and electrical stress. Alumina, [[silicon carbide]], and [[tungsten carbide]] are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties.

===Composites===
{{Main|Composite material}}
[[File:Cfaser haarrp.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A 6 μm diameter carbon filament (running from bottom left to top right) siting atop the much larger human hair.]] [[Fiber|Filaments]] are commonly used for reinforcement in [[composite material]]s.
Another application of materials science in industry is making [[composite material]]s. These are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermal insulating tiles which play a key and integral role in NASA's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]] which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is [[reinforced Carbon-Carbon]] (RCC), the light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to {{convert|1510|C|F}} and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from [[graphite]] [[rayon]] cloth and impregnated with a [[phenolic resin]]. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured-pyrolized to convert the [[furfural]] alcohol to carbon. To provide oxidation resistance for reuse ability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to [[silicon carbide]].

Other examples can be seen in the "plastic" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a [[composite material]] made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) in which [[calcium carbonate]] chalk, [[talc]], [[glass fiber]]s or [[carbon fiber]]s have been added for added strength, bulk, or electrostatic dispersion. These additions may be termed reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.

===Polymers===
{{Main|Polymer}}
[[File:Polypropylene.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The repeating unit of the polymer polypropylene]]
[[File:Expanded polystyrene foam dunnage.jpg|thumb|Expanded polystyrene polymer packaging.]]
[[Polymer]]s are chemical compounds made up of a large number of identical components linked together like chains. They are an important part of materials science. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics and rubber. Plastics and rubber are really the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Plastics which have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[polystyrene]], [[nylon]]s, [[polyester]]s, [[acrylic resin|acrylics]], [[polyurethane]]s, and [[polycarbonate]]s and also rubbers which have been around are natural rubber, [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber, [[chloroprene]], and [[butadiene rubber]]. Plastics are generally classified as ''commodity'', ''specialty'' and [[engineering plastic|''engineering'' plastics]].

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to a vast array of applications, from [[artificial leather]] to [[electrical insulation]] and cabling, [[packaging]], and [[Food storage|containers]]. Its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established. The versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of [[plasticiser]]s and other additives that it accepts. The term "additives" in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties.

[[Polycarbonate]] would be normally considered an engineering plastic (other examples include PEEK, ABS). Such plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties. They are usually not used for disposable applications, unlike commodity plastics.

Specialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics, such as ultra-high strength, electrical conductivity, electro-fluorescence, high thermal stability, etc.

The dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications. For example, [[polyethylene]] (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable bags for shopping and trash, and is considered a commodity plastic, whereas [[medium-density polyethylene]] (MDPE) is used for underground gas and water pipes, and another variety called [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE) is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted [[hip joint]]s.

===Metal alloys===
{{Main|Alloy}}
[[File:Steel wire rope.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Wire rope made from [[steel]] alloy.]]
The study of metal alloys is a significant part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron ([[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[cast iron]], [[tool steel]], [[alloy steel]]s) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and [[high carbon steel]]s. An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the [[hardness]] and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties, however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron–carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.

Other significant metallic alloys are those of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[copper]] and [[magnesium]]. [[Copper alloys]] have been known for a long time (since the [[Bronze Age]]), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.

===Semiconductors===

The study of semiconductors is a significant part of materials science. A [[semiconductor]] is a material that has a resistivity between a metal and insulator. Its electronic properties can be greatly altered through intentionally introducing impurities or doping. From these semiconductor materials, things such as [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), and analog and digital [[electric circuit]]s can be built, making them materials of interest in industry. Semiconductor devices have replaced thermionic devices (vacuum tubes) in most applications. Semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs), which consist of a number—from a few to millions—of devices manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aip.org/jobs/profiles/semiconductor-industry-careers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604150127/https://www.aip.org/jobs/profiles/semiconductor-industry-careers |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= |date=2013-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the semiconductors in use today, [[silicon]] makes up the largest portion both by quantity and commercial value. Monocrystalline silicon is used to produce wafers used in the semiconductor and electronics industry. Second to silicon, [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is the second most popular semiconductor used. Due to its higher electron mobility and saturation velocity compared to silicon, it is a material of choice for high-speed electronics applications. These superior properties are compelling reasons to use GaAs circuitry in mobile phones, satellite communications, microwave point-to-point links and higher frequency radar systems. Other semiconductor materials include [[germanium]], [[silicon carbide]], and [[gallium nitride]] and have various applications.

==Relation to other fields==
Materials science evolved—starting from the 1960s—because it was recognized that to create, discover and design new materials, one had to approach it in a unified manner. Thus, materials science and engineering emerged at the intersection of various fields such as [[metallurgy]], [[solid state physics]], [[chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].

The field is inherently [[interdisciplinary]], and the materials scientists/engineers must be aware and make use of the methods of the physicist, chemist and engineer. The field thus maintains close relationships with these fields. Also, many physicists, chemists and engineers also find themselves working in materials science.

The overlap between physics and materials science has led to the offshoot field of ''materials physics'', which is concerned with the physical properties of materials. The approach is generally more macroscopic and applied than in [[condensed matter physics]]. See [[list of publications in physics#Materials physics|important publications in materials physics]] for more details on this field of study.

The field of materials science and engineering is important both from a scientific perspective, as well as from an engineering one. When discovering new materials, one encounters new phenomena that may not have been observed before. Hence, there is a lot of science to be discovered when working with materials. Materials science also provides a test for theories in condensed matter physics.

Materials are of the utmost importance for engineers, as the usage of the appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems. As a result, materials science is an increasingly important part of an engineer's education.

'''Metabolic engineering''' is the practice of optimizing [[genetics|genetic]] and regulatory processes within [[Cell (biology)|cells]] to increase the cells' production of a certain substance. These processes are chemical networks that use a series of biochemical reactions and [[enzymes]] that allow cells to convert raw materials into molecules necessary for the cell’s survival. Metabolic engineering specifically seeks to mathematically model these networks, calculate a yield of useful products, and pin point parts of the network that constrain the production of these products.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Y.T., Bennet, G. N., San, K.Y., (1998) ''Genetic and Metabolic Engineering'', Electronic Journal of Biotechnology, {{ISSN|0717-3458}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic engineering]] techniques can then be used to modify the network in order to relieve these constraints. Once again this modified network can be modeled to calculate the new product yield.

The ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to be able to use these organisms to produce valuable substances on an industrial scale in a cost effective manner.  Current examples include producing [[beer]], [[wine]], [[cheese]], [[pharmaceuticals]], and other [[biotechnology]] products. Some of the common strategies used for metabolic engineering are (1) overexpressing the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway, (2) blocking the competing metabolic pathways, (3) heterologous gene expression, and (4) enzyme engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Kulkarni R, 2016. [http://www.ias.ac.in/describe/article/reso/021/03/0233-0237 Metabolic Engineering: Biological Art of Producing Useful Chemicals]. Resonance, 21 (3), 233-237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since cells use these metabolic networks for their survival, changes can have drastic effects on the cells' viability. Therefore, trade-offs in metabolic engineering arise between the cells ability to produce the desired substance and its natural survival needs.  Therefore, instead of directly deleting and/or overexpressing the genes that encode for metabolic enzymes, the current focus is to target the regulatory networks in a cell to efficiently engineer the metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;Vemuri, G.M, Aristidou, A.A, (2005) ''Metabolic Engineering in the -omics Era: Elucidating and Modulating Regulatory Networks'', Microbial Mol Biology Review vol. 69: 197-216&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and applications ==
In the past, to increase the productivity of a desired [[metabolite]], a [[microorganism]] was genetically modified by chemically induced [[mutation]], and the mutant [[strain (biology)|strain]] that overexpressed the desired metabolite was then chosen.&lt;ref name="Voit"&gt;Voit,Eberhard.,Torres,Nestor V.(2002)." Pathways Analysis and Optimization in Metabolic Engineering." Cambridge:University Press,p.ix-x&lt;/ref&gt; However, one of the main problems with this technique was that the metabolic pathway for the production of that metabolite was not analyzed, and as a result, the constraints to production and relevant pathway enzymes to be modified were unknown.&lt;ref name = "Voit" /&gt;

In 1990s, a new technique called metabolic engineering emerged. This technique analyzes the metabolic pathway of a [[microorganism]], and determines the constraints and their effects on the production of desired compounds. It then uses genetic engineering to relieve these constraints. Some examples of successful metabolic engineering are the following: (i) Identification of constraints to lysine production in ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' ''glutamicum'' and insertion of new genes to relieve these constraints to improve production&lt;ref&gt;Stephanopoulos, G. N., Aristidou, A. A., Nielsen, J. (1998). " Metabolic Engineering: Principles and Methodologies ". San Diego: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) Engineering of a new [[fatty acid biosynthesis]] pathway, called reversed [[beta oxidation]] pathway, that is more efficient than the native pathway in producing fatty acids and alcohols which can potentially be catalytically converted to chemicals and fuels&lt;ref&gt;Dellomonaco, Clementina.(2011). '' Engineered Reversal of the beta oxidation cycle for the Synthesis of Fuels and Chemicals.'' Nature 476,355-359&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) Improved production of [[3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate|DAHP]] an aromatic metabolite produced by ''E. coli'' that is an intermediate in the production of aromatic amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;Patnaik, R. and Liao, J. (1994). "Engineering of Escherichia coli central metabolism for aromatic metabolite production with near theoretical yield". ''Appl. Environ. Microbiol.'' 60(11):3903-3908&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined through metabolic flux analysis that the theoretical maximal yield of DAHP per glucose molecule utilized, was 3/7. This is because some of the carbon from glucose is lost as carbon dioxide, instead of being utilized to produce DAHP. Also, one of the metabolites (PEP, or [[phosphoenolpyruvate]]) that are used to produce DAHP, was being converted to [[pyruvate]] (PYR) to transport glucose into the cell, and therefore, was no longer available to produce DAHP. In order to relieve the shortage of PEP and increase yield, Patnaik et al. used genetic engineering on ''E. coli'' to introduce a reaction that converts PYR back to PEP. Thus, the PEP used to transport glucose into the cell is regenerated, and can be used to make DAHP. This resulted in a new theoretical maximal yield of 6/7 – double that of the native ''E. coli'' system.

At the industrial scale, metabolic engineering is becoming more convenient and cost effective. According to the [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]], "more than 50 [[biorefinery]] facilities are being built across North America to apply metabolic engineering to produce biofuels and chemicals from renewable [[biomass]] which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions". Potential biofuels include short-chain [[alcohols]] and alkanes (to replace [[gasoline]]), [[fatty acid methyl esters]] and [[fatty alcohols]] (to replace [[diesel fuel|diesel]]), and [[fatty acid]]-and [[isoprenoid]]-based biofuels (to replace [[diesel fuel|diesel]]).&lt;ref&gt;Keasling D.,Jay(2010).'' Advanced Biofuel production in microbes.'' Biotechnol.J.,5,147-162&lt;/ref&gt;

Metabolic engineering continues to evolve in efficiency and processes aided by breakthroughs in the field of [[synthetic biology]] and progress in understanding [[Metabolite damage and its repair or pre-emption|metabolite damage and its repair or preemption]]. Early metabolic engineering experiments showed that accumulation of [[reactive intermediate]]s can limit flux in engineered pathways and be deleterious to host cells if matching damage control systems are missing or inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Vincent J.

==Metabolic flux analysis==
An analysis of metabolic flux can be found at ''[[Flux balance analysis]]''

===Setting up a metabolic pathway for analysis===
The first step in the process is to identify a desired goal to achieve through the improvement or modification of an organism's metabolism.  Reference books and online databases are used to research reactions and metabolic pathways that are able to produce this product or result. These databases contain copious genomic and chemical information including pathways for metabolism and other cellular processes.  Using this research, an organism is chosen that will be used to create the desired product or result. Considerations that are taken into account when making this decision are how close the organism's metabolic pathway is to the desired pathway, the maintenance costs associated with the organism, and how easy it is to modify the pathway of the organism.  ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') is widely used in metabolic engineering to synthesize a wide variety of products such as amino acids because it is relatively easy to maintain and modify.&lt;ref&gt;University of California - Los Angeles (2008, December 18). "Genetic Modification Turns E. Coli Bacteria Into High Density Biofuel". ''ScienceDaily.'' Retrieved December 7, 2011, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081218151652.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  If the organism does not contain the complete pathway for the desired product or result, then genes that produce the missing enzymes must be incorporated into the organism.

===Analyzing a metabolic pathway===
The completed metabolic pathway is modeled mathematically to find the theoretical yield of the product or the reaction fluxes in the cell.  A flux is the rate at which a given reaction in the network occurs.  Simple metabolic pathway analysis can be done by hand, but most require the use of software to perform the computations.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberger, J., Que, R., Fleming, R., et al. (2011). "Quantitative prediction of cellular metabolism with constraint-based models: the COBRA Toolbox v2.0". ''Nature Protocols.'' 6(9):1290-1307&lt;/ref&gt;  These programs use complex linear algebra algorithms to solve these models. To solve a network using the equation for determined systems shown below, one must input the necessary information about the relevant reactions and their fluxes. Information about the reaction (such as the reactants and stoichiometry) are contained in the matrices G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. Matrices V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; contain the fluxes of the relevant reactions.  When solved, the equation yields the values of all the unknown fluxes (contained in V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;).

:&lt;math&gt;V_x=-(G_x)^{-1}*(G_m * V_m)&lt;/math&gt;

===Determining the optimal genetic manipulations===
After solving for the fluxes of reactions in the network, it is necessary to determine which reactions may be altered in order to maximize the yield of the desired product. To determine what specific genetic manipulations to perform, it is necessary to use computational algorithms, such as OptGene or OptFlux.&lt;ref&gt;Rocha, I., Maia, P., Evangelista, P., et al. (2010). "OptFlux: an open-source software platform for in silico metabolic engineering". BMC Sys Biol. 45(4)&lt;/ref&gt; They provide recommendations for which genes should be overexpressed, knocked out, or introduced in a cell to allow increased production of the desired product. For example, if a given reaction has particularly low flux and is limiting the amount of product, the software may recommend that the enzyme catalyzing this reaction should be overexpressed in the cell to increase the reaction flux. The necessary genetic manipulations can be performed using standard molecular biology techniques. Genes may be overexpressed or knocked out from an organism, depending on their effect on the pathway and the ultimate goal.&lt;ref&gt;Work, T.S., Hinton, R., Work, E., Dobrota, M., Chard, T. (1980). "Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology". v.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental measurements===
In order to create a solvable model, it is often necessary to have certain fluxes already known or experimentally measured. In addition, in order to verify the effect of genetic manipulations on the metabolic network (to ensure they align with the model), it is necessary to experimentally measure the fluxes in the network. To measure reaction fluxes, carbon flux measurements are made using [[isotopic labeling|carbon-13 isotopic labeling]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiechert, W. and de Graaf, A.A. (2000). "Bidirectional Reaction Steps in Metabolic Networks: Modeling and Simulation of Carbon Isotope Labeling Experiments". ''Biotechnol. Bioeng.'' 55(1):101-117&lt;/ref&gt; The organism is fed a mixture that contains molecules where specific carbons are engineered to be carbon-13 atoms, instead of carbon-12. After these molecules are used in the network, downstream metabolites also become labeled with carbon-13, as they incorporate those atoms in their structures. The specific labeling pattern of the various metabolites is determined by the reaction fluxes in the network. Labeling patterns may be measured using techniques such as [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS) along with computational algorithms to determine reaction fluxes.

[[File:Bachlut1.gif|thumb|250px|Hand-written musical notation by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750). This is the beginning of the ''Prelude from the Suite for Lute in G minor'' BWV 995 (transcription of ''Cello Suite No. 5'', BWV 1011).]]
'''Music notation''' or '''musical notation''' is any system used to visually represent [[wikt:aurally|aurally]] perceived [[music]] played with [[instrument (music)|instruments]] or [[singing|sung]] by the [[human voice]] through the use of written, printed, or otherwise-produced symbols.

Types and methods of notation have varied between cultures and throughout history, and much information about ancient music notation is fragmentary. Even in the same time period, such as in the 2010s, different styles of music and different cultures use different music notation methods; for example, for professional [[classical music]] performers, [[sheet music]] using staves and noteheads is the most common way of notating music, but for professional [[country music]] [[session musician]]s, the [[Nashville Number System]] is the main method.

The symbols used include ancient symbols and [[modern musical symbols|modern symbols]] made upon any media such as symbols cut into stone, made in [[clay tablet]]s, made using a pen on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] or [[manuscript paper]]; printed using a [[printing press]] (ca. 1400s), a [[computer printer]] (ca. 1980s) or other [[Music engraving|printing]] or [[Photocopier|modern copying technology]].

Although many ancient cultures used symbols to represent [[melody|melodies]] and [[rhythm]]s, none of them were particularly comprehensive, and this has limited today's understanding of their music. The seeds of what would eventually become modern western notation were sown in [[Medieval music|medieval]] Europe, starting with the [[Catholic church|Catholic Church]]'s goal for ecclesiastical uniformity.  The church began notating [[plainchant]] melodies so that the same chants could be used throughout the church. Music notation developed further in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music]] eras. In the [[classical period (music)|classical period]] (1750–1820) and the [[Romantic music era]] (1820–1900), notation continued to develop as new [[music technology (mechanical)|musical instrument technologies]] were developed. In the [[contemporary classical music]] of the 20th and 21st century, music notation has continued to develop, with the introduction of [[graphical notation (music)|graphical notation]] by some modern composers and the use, since the 1980s, of computer-based [[scorewriter|score writer]] programs for notating music. Music notation has been adapted to many kinds of music, including classical music, [[popular music]], and [[traditional music]].

==History==

===Ancient Near East===
{{further|Music of Mesopotamia|Hurrian songs}}
[[File:Hurritische hymne.gif|right|frame|A drawing of one side of the tablet on which the Hymn to Nikkal is inscribed&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati, "[http://128.97.6.202/urkeshpublic/music.htm Hurrian Music]", associate editor and webmaster Federico A. Buccellati Urkesh website (n.p.: IIMAS, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The earliest form of musical notation can be found in a [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet that was created at [[Nippur]], in [[Sumer]] (today's [[Iraq]]), in about 1400 BC. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, that the music was composed in harmonies of thirds, and that it was written using a [[diatonic scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer &amp; Civil 1986,{{Page needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A tablet from about 1250 BC shows a more developed form of notation.&lt;ref&gt;Kilmer 1965,{{Page needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a [[lyre]], the tuning of which is described in other tablets.&lt;ref name="West 1994a"&gt;West 1994, 161–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated [[melody|melodies]] found anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="West 1994b"&gt;West 1994, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Delphichymn.jpg|thumb|250px|A photograph of the original stone at Delphi containing the second of the two [[Delphic Hymns]] to [[Apollo]]. The music notation is the line of occasional symbols ''above'' the main, uninterrupted line of Greek lettering.]]

===Ancient Greece===
{{further|Musical system of ancient Greece}}

[[Music of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BC until approximately the 4th century AD; several complete compositions and fragments of compositions using this notation survive. The notation consists of symbols placed above text syllables. An example of a complete composition is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], which has been variously dated between the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.

Three hymns by [[Mesomedes]] of [[Crete]] exist in manuscript. The [[Delphic Hymns]], dated to the 2nd century BC, also use this notation, but they are not completely preserved. Ancient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the [[Decline of the Western Roman Empire]].

===Byzantine Empire===
{{further|Byzantine music}}
[[File:Stavropoleos-anastasimatar-macarie-viena-1823-p11.png|thumb|right|250px|Byzantine music notation style in a Romanian ''anastasimatarion'', a "Book of Hymns at the Lord's Resurrection", 1823]]

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] music has mainly survived as music for court ceremonies, including vocal religious music. It is not known if it is based on the [[monody|monodic]] [[Musical mode#Greek scales|modal]] singing and instrumental music of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek theoretical categories played a key role to understand and transmit Byzantine music, especially the tradition of Damascus had a strong impact on the pre-Islamic [[Near East]] comparable to [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]].

Unlike Western notation Byzantine neumes always indicate modal steps in relation to a clef or modal key ([[Enechema|modal signatures]] which had been in use since papyrus fragments dating back to the 6th century). Originally this key or the incipit of a common melody was enough to indicate a certain melodic model given within the [[echos]]. Despite [[ekphonetic notation]] further early melodic notation developed not earlier than between the 9th and the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Today we can only the study the evolution of notation within Greek monastic chant books like those of the [[Sticheron|sticherarion]] and  the [[Irmologion|heirmologion]], while there is no authentic asmatikon and kontakarion of the Constantinopolitan cathedral rite. The earliest books which have survived, are in Slavonic translation which already show an own notation system (see [[#Russia|Russia]]) used in [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]] and [[Ohrid|Macedonia]] during the 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Greek alphabet notational signs are ordered left to right (though the direction could be adapted like in certain Syriac manuscripts). The question of rhythm was entirely based on cheironomia, well-known melodical phrases given by gestures of the [[Cantor (Christianity)|choirleaders]], which existed once as part of an oral tradition.

Today the main difference between Western and Eastern neumes is that Eastern notation symbols are ''differential'' rather than absolute, i.e. they indicate pitch steps (rising, falling or at the same step), and the musicians know to deduce correctly, from the score and the note they are singing presently, which correct interval is meant.  These step symbols themselves, or better "phonic neumes", resemble brush strokes and are colloquially called ''gántzoi'' ("hooks") in [[Modern Greek]].

Notes as pitch classes or modal keys (usually memorised by modal signatures) are represented in written form only between these neumes (in manuscripts usually written in red ink). In modern notation they simply serve as an optional reminder and modal and tempo directions have been added, if necessary. In Papadic notation medial signatures usually meant a temporary change into another echos.

The so-called "great signs" were once related to cheironomic signs; according to modern interpretations they are understood as embellishments and microtonal attractions (pitch changes smaller than a [[semitone]]), both essential in Byzantine chant.&lt;ref&gt;See Maria Alexandru ([[#Ale2000|2000]]) for a historical discussion of the great signs and their modern interpretations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Chrysanthos of Madytos]] there are seven standard note names used for "solfège" (''parallagē'') ''pá, vú, g&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;á, d&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;ē, ké, zō, nē'', while the older practice still used the four enechemata or intonation formulas of the four echoi given by the modal signatures, the authentic or "kyrioi" in ascending direction, and the plagal or "plagioi" in descending direction ([[Papadic Octoechos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Chrysanthos ([[#Chr1832|1832]]) made a difference between his monosyllabic and the traditional polysyllabic ''parallage.''&lt;/ref&gt; With exception of ''vú and zō'' they do roughly correspond to Western solmization syllables as ''re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do''.  Byzantine music uses the eight natural, non-tempered scales whose elements were identified by ''Ēkhoi'', "sounds", exclusively, and therefore the absolute pitch of each note may slightly vary each time, depending on the particular ''Ēkhos'' used.  Byzantine notation is still used in many Orthodox Churches.  Sometimes cantors also use transcriptions into Western or Kievan staff notation while adding non-notatable embellishment material from memory and "sliding" into the natural scales from experience, but even concerning modern neume editions since the reform of Chrysanthos a lot of details are only known from an oral tradition related to traditional masters and their experience.

===13th-century Near East===
In 1252, [[Safi al-Din al-Urmawi]] developed a form of musical notation, where [[rhythm]]s were represented by [[Geometry|geometric]] representation. Many subsequent scholars of rhythm have sought to develop graphical geometrical notations. For example, a similar geometric system was published in 1987 by Kjell Gustafson, whose method represents a rhythm as a two-dimensional graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toussaint|2004|loc=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Europe===
{{Main|Neume}}

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|Music notation from an early 14th-century English [[Missal]]]]
The scholar and music theorist [[Isidore of Seville]], while writing in the early 7th century, considered that "unless sounds are held by the memory of man, they perish, because they cannot be written down."&lt;ref&gt;Isidore of Seville 2006, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the 9th century, however, a form of neumatic notation began to develop in monasteries in Europe as a [[mnemonic]] device for [[Gregorian chant]], using symbols known as [[neume]]s; the earliest surviving musical notation of this type is in the ''Musica disciplina'' of [[Aurelian of Réôme]], from about 850. There are scattered survivals from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] before this time, of a type of notation known as [[Neume|Visigothic neumes]], but its few surviving fragments have not yet been deciphered.&lt;ref&gt;Zapke 2007, {{Page needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!--A complex issue, to be sure, but this book has 480 pages. Surely it does not take that long to demonstrate that nothing at all has been deciphered.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with this notation was that it only showed melodic contours and consequently the music could not be read by someone who did not know the music already.

[[File:EarlyMusicNotation.JPG|250px|thumb|Early music notation]]

Notation had developed far enough to notate melody, but there was still no system for notating rhythm. A mid-13th-century treatise, ''[[De Mensurabili Musica]]'', explains a set of six [[rhythmic modes]] that were in use at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Christensen 2002, 628.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not clear how they were formed. These rhythmic modes were all in triple time and rather limited rhythm in chant to six different repeating patterns. This was a flaw seen by German music theorist [[Franco of Cologne]] and summarised as part of his treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' (the art of measured chant, or [[mensural notation]]). He suggested that individual notes could have their own rhythms represented by the shape of the note. Not until the 14th century did something like the present system of fixed note lengths arise.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The use of regular measures (bars) became commonplace by the end of the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The founder of what is now considered the standard music stave was [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d'Arezzo]],&lt;ref name="Catholic encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07065a.htm Otten 1910].&lt;/ref&gt; an Italian Benedictine monk who lived from about 991 until after 1033. He taught the use of [[solmization]] syllables based on a hymn to [[Saint John the Baptist]], which begins [[Ut Queant Laxis]] and was written by the [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian [[Paul the Deacon]]. The first stanza is:

# '''Ut''' queant laxis
# '''re'''sonare fibris,
# '''Mi'''ra gestorum
# '''fa'''muli tuorum,
# '''Sol'''ve polluti
# '''la'''bii reatum,
# '''S'''ancte '''I'''ohannes.

Guido used the first syllable of each line, Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si, to read notated music in terms of [[Guidonian hand#Hexachord in Middle Ages|hexachords]]; they were not note names, and each could, depending on context, be applied to any note. In the 17th century, Ut was changed in most countries except France to the easily singable, "open" syllable Do, said to have been taken from the name of the Italian theorist [[Giovanni Battista Doni]],
but rather Do have been taken from the word "Dominus" in Latin with the meaning "the Lord". &lt;ref&gt;McNaught 1893, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, Neitz, and Battani 2003, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|1994|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern staff notation==
{{Main|List of musical symbols}}

[[File:Chopin Prelude 7.svg|thumb|500px|An example of modern musical notation: Prelude, Op. 28, No. 7, by [[Frédéric Chopin]] {{audio|Chopin Prelude 7.mid|Play}}]]

Modern music notation is used by musicians of many different genres throughout the world. The staff acts as a framework upon which pitches are indicated by placing round [[Musical note|note]]s on the staff lines or between the lines. The pitch of the round musical notes can be modified by [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]. The duration (note length) is shown with different [[note value]]s, which can be indicated by the note being just a circle (a [[whole note]]) or using stems to indicate [[quarter note]]s and other subdivisions, and additional symbols such as [[dotted note|dots]] and [[Tie (music)|ties]] which lengthen the duration of a note. Notation is read from left to right, which makes setting music for right-to-left scripts difficult.

A staff (or stave, in British English) of written music generally begins with a [[clef]], which indicates the position of one particular note on the staff. The [[treble clef]] or G clef was originally a letter G and it identifies the second line up on the five line staff as the note G above middle C. The [[bass clef]] or F clef shows the position of the note F below middle C. While the treble and bass clef are the most widely used clefs, other clefs are used, such as the [[alto clef]] (used for [[viola]] and [[alto trombone]] music) and the [[tenor clef]] (used for some [[cello]] and [[double bass]] music). Notes representing a pitch outside of the scope of the five line staff can be represented using [[ledger line]]s, which provide a single note with additional lines and spaces. Some instruments use mainly one clef, such as violin and flute, which use [[treble clef]] and [[double bass]] and [[tuba]], which use [[bass clef]]. Some instruments regularly use both clefs, such as [[piano]] and [[pipe organ]].

Following the clef, the [[key signature]] on a staff indicates the [[key (music)|key]] of the piece or song by specifying that certain notes are flat or sharp throughout the piece, unless otherwise indicated with [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] added before certain notes. When a sharp is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone higher. When a flat is placed before a note, this makes that note one semitone lower. [[Double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s are less common, but they are used. A double sharp is placed before a note to make it two semitones higher. A double flat is placed before a note to make it two semitones lower. A [[natural sign]] placed before a note renders that note in its "natural" form, which means that any sharps or flats applying to that note from the key signature or from accidentals are cancelled. Sometimes a [[courtesy accidental]] is used in music where it is not technically required, to remind the musician of what pitch the key signature requires.

Following the key signature is the [[time signature]]. The time signature typically consists of two numbers, with one of the most common being "4/4". The top "4" indicates that there are four beats per measure (also called [[Bar (music)|bar]]). The bottom "4" indicates that each of those beats are quarter notes. Measures divide the piece into groups of [[beat (music)|beats]], and the time signatures specify those groupings. "4/4" is used so often that it is also called "[[common time]]", and it may be indicated with a "C" rather than numbers. Other common time signatures are "3/4" (three beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); "2/4" (two beats per bar, with each beat being a quarter note); "6/8" (six beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note) and "12/8" (twelve beats per bar, with each beat being an eighth note; in practice, the eighth notes are typically put into four groups of three eighth notes. "12/8" is a [[compound time]] type of time signature). Many other time signatures exist, such as "3/8", "5/8", "5/4", "7/4", "9/8", and so on.

Many short [[classical music]] pieces from the [[classical period (music)|classical era]] and songs from [[traditional music]] and [[popular music]] are in one time signature for much or all of the piece. Music from the [[Romantic music]] era and later, particularly [[contemporary classical music]] and [[rock music]] genres such as [[progressive rock]] and the [[hardcore punk]] subgenre [[mathcore]], may use [[mixed meter]]; songs or pieces change from one meter to another, for example alternating between bars of "5/4" and "7/8".

Directions to the player regarding matters such as [[tempo]] (e.g., [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]], [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]], [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Largo]], [[Tempo#French tempo markings|Vif, Lent, Modérément]], [[Presto (music)|Presto]], etc.), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (pianississimo, pianissimo, piano, mezzopiano, mezzoforte, forte, fortissimo, fortississimo, etc.) appear above or below the staff. Terms indicating the [[musical expression]] or "feel" to a song or piece are indicated at the beginning of the piece and at any points where the mood changes (e.g., "Slow March", "Fast Swing", "Medium Blues", "Fougueux", "Feierlich", "Gelassen", "Piacevole", "Con slancio", "Majestic", "Hostile" etc.) For vocal music, lyrics are written near the pitches of the melody. For short pauses (breaths), [[retake]]s (retakes are indicated with a ' mark) are added.

In music for [[musical ensemble|ensembles]], a "[[sheet music|score]]" shows music for all players together, with the staves for the different instruments and/or voices stacked vertically. The [[conducting|conductor]] uses the score while she leads an [[orchestra]], [[concert band]], [[choir]] or other large ensemble. Individual performers in an ensemble play from  "parts" which contain only the music played by an individual musician. A score can be constructed from a complete set of parts and vice versa. The process was laborious and time consuming when parts were hand-copied from the score, but since the development of [[scorewriter]] computer software in the 1980s, a score stored electronically can have parts automatically prepared by the program and quickly and inexpensively printed out using a computer printer. 

A [[Flat (music)|♭]] in music lowers a pitch down one semitone. A [[Sharp (music)|♯]] in music raises a note one semitone. For example, a sharp on B would raise it do B♯ while a flat would lower it to B♭.

===Variations on staff notation===
[[File:Lead-sheet-wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|A lead sheet]]
[[File:Chord chart.svg|thumb|250px|A chord chart. {{audio|Chord chart.mid|Play}}]]
* [[Percussion notation]] conventions are varied because of the wide range of percussion instruments. Percussion instruments are generally grouped into two categories: pitched (e.g., [[glockenspiel]] or [[tubular bells]]) and non-pitched (e.g., [[bass drum]] and [[snare drum]]). The notation of non-pitched percussion instruments is less standardized. Pitched instruments use standard Western classical notation for the pitches and rhythms. In general, notation for unpitched percussion uses the five line staff, with different lines and spaces representing different [[drum kit]] instruments. Standard Western rhythmic notation is used to indicate the rhythm.
* [[Figured bass]] notation originated in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[Figured bass|basso continuo]] parts. It is also used extensively in [[accordion]] notation. The bass notes of the music are conventionally notated, along with numbers and other signs that determine which chords the harpsichordist, organist or lutenist should improvise. It does not, however, specify the exact pitches of the harmony, leaving that for the performer to improvise.
* A [[lead sheet]] specifies only the melody, lyrics and harmony, using one staff with [[chord notation|chord symbols]] placed above and lyrics below. It is used to capture the essential elements of a [[popular music|popular song]] without specifying how the song should be arranged or performed.
* A [[chord chart]] or "chart" contains little or no melodic information at all but provides detailed harmonic information about the [[chord progression]]. Some chord charts also contain rhythmic information, indicated using slash notation for full beats and rhythmic notation for rhythms. This is the most common kind of written music used by professional [[session musician]]s playing [[jazz]] or other forms of [[List of popular music genres|popular music]] and is intended primarily for the [[rhythm section]] (usually containing [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[Bass guitar|bass]] and [[drum]]s).
* Simpler chord charts for songs may contain only the chord changes, placed above the lyrics where they occur. Such charts depend on prior knowledge of the melody, and are used as reminders in performance or informal [[group singing]]. Some chord charts intended for [[rhythm section]] accompanists contain only the chord progression.
* The [[shape note]] system is found in some church hymnals, [[sheet music]], and song books, especially in the [[Southern United States]]. Instead of the customary elliptical note head, note heads of various shapes are used to show the position of the note on the major scale. [[Sacred Harp]] is one of the most popular tune books using shape notes.

==In various countries==

===Korea===
[[File:시용향악보 (時用鄕樂譜).jpg|200px|thumb|''Jeongganbo musical notation system'']]
''Jeongganbo'' is a unique traditional musical notation system created during the time of [[Sejong the Great]] that was the first East Asian system to represent rhythm, pitch, and time.&lt;ref&gt;Gnanadesikan 2011, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gukak|url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/251893/1|website=The DONG-A ILBO|publisher=dongA.com|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among various kinds of Korean traditional music, Jeong-gan-bo targets a particular genre, Jeong-ak (정악, 正樂).

Jeong-gan-bo tells the pitch by writing the pitch's name down in a box called 'jeong-gan' (this is where the name comes from). One jeong-gan is one beat each, and it can be split into two, three or more to hold half beats and quarter beats, and more. This makes it easy for the reader to figure out the beat.

Also, there are lots of markings indicating things such as ornaments. Most of these were later created by Ki-su Kim.

===India===
{{Main|Swaralipi}}
[[File:Bhat notation1.jpg|thumb|350px|Indian music, early 20th century.]]
The Indian scholar and musical theorist [[Pingala]] (c. 200 BC), in his ''Chanda Sutra'', used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry.

In the notation of Indian [[rāga]], a solfege-like system called [[swara|sargam]] is used. As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (Shadaj, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni). The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa. Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] fifth rather than an [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] fifth). These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes').

Each of the other five notes, Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' (shuddha) pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, shuddha Re, the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. Re, Ga, Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower (Komal-"flat") (thus, komal Re is a half-step higher than Sa).

Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher (teevra-"sharp") (thus, tivra Ma is an augmented fourth above Sa). Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar ('movable notes'). In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar, the pitches are represented by Western letters. Capital letters are used for the achala swar, and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar. Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar.

Other systems exist for non-twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] and non-Western music, such as the Indian ''[[Swaralipi]]''.

{{further|Znamenny chant}}
[[Image:Example of hooks and banners notation.PNG|thumb|200px|right|An example of Znamenny notation with so-called "red marks", Russia, 1884. "Thy [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Cross]] we honour, oh Lord, and Thy holy Resurrection we praise."]]
[[Image:Kryuki.jpg|thumb|160px|A hand-drawn [[lubok]] featuring 'hook and banner notation'.]] 
Znamenny Chant is a singing tradition used in the [[Russia]]n [[Orthodox Church]] which uses a "hook and banner" notation. Znamenny Chant is [[unison]], [[melisma]]tic [[liturgy|liturgical]] singing that has its own specific notation, called the ''stolp'' notation.  The symbols used in the stolp notation are called ''{{transl|ru|kryuki|links=no}}'' ({{lang-ru|крюки|links=no}}, 'hooks') or ''{{transl|ru|znamena}}'' ({{lang-ru|знамёна|links=no}}, 'signs').  Often the names of the signs are used to refer to the stolp notation.  Znamenny melodies are part of a system, consisting of Eight Modes (intonation structures; called glasy); the melodies are characterized by fluency and well-balancedness.{{harv|Kholopov|2003|loc=192}} There exist several types of Znamenny Chant: the so-called ''Stolpovoy'', ''Malyj'' (Little) and ''Bolshoy'' (Great) Znamenny Chant.  Ruthenian Chant ([[Prostopinije]]) is sometimes considered a sub-division of the Znamenny Chant tradition, with the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovite]] Chant (Znamenny Chant proper) being the second branch of the same musical continuum.

Znamenny Chants are not written with notes (the so-called linear notation), but with special signs, called ''Znamëna'' (Russian for "marks", "banners") or ''Kryuki'' ("hooks"), as some shapes of these signs resemble hooks. Each sign may include the following components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure. The stolp notation was developed in [[Kievan Rus']] as an [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] refinement of the [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] [[neumatic]] musical notation.

The most notable feature of this notation system is that it records transitions of the melody, rather than [[Musical note|note]]s. The signs also represent a mood and a gradation of how this part of melody is to be sung (tempo, strength, devotion, meekness, etc.) Every sign has its own name and also features as a spiritual symbol. For example, there is a specific sign, called "little dove" (Russian: голубчик ''(golubchik)''), which represents two rising sounds, but which is also a symbol of the [[Holy Ghost]]. Gradually the system became more and more complicated. This system was also ambiguous, so that almost no one, except the most trained and educated singers, could sing an unknown melody at sight. The signs only helped to reproduce the melody, not coding it in an unambiguous way.

===China===
{{Main|Chinese musical notation}}

[[File:Qinnotation.png|thumb|250px|Chinese [[Guqin notation]], 1425]]
The earliest known examples of text referring to music in China are inscriptions on musical instruments found in the Tomb of [[Marquess|Marquis]] Yi of Zeng (d. 433 B.C.). Sets of 41 chimestones and 65 bells bore lengthy inscriptions concerning pitches, scales, and transposition. The bells still sound the pitches that their inscriptions refer to. Although no notated musical compositions were found, the inscriptions indicate that the system was sufficiently advanced to allow for musical notation. Two systems of pitch nomenclature existed, one for relative pitch and one for absolute pitch. For relative pitch, a [[solmization]] system was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm Bagley 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609090628/http://www.britac.ac.uk/events/2004/abstracts/2004-bagley.htm |date=9 June 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese music is highly diversified, and therefore requires various systems of notation. In Japanese [[shakuhachi]] music, for example, glissandos and timbres are often more significant than distinct pitches, whereas [[taiko]] notation focuses on discrete strokes.

[[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyuan]] [[sanshin]] music uses [[kunkunshi]], a notation system of [[kanji]] with each character corresponding to a finger position on a particular string.

===Indonesia===&lt;!--[[Kepatihan notation]]'s see also links here--&gt;
{{Main|Gamelan notation}}

Notation plays a relatively minor role in the oral traditions of [[Indonesia]]. However, in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], several systems were devised beginning at the end of the 19th century, initially for archival purposes. Today the most widespread are cipher notations ("not angka" in the broadest sense) in which the pitches are represented with some subset of the numbers 1 to 7, with 1 corresponding to either highest note of a particular octave, as in [[Sundanese script|Sundanese]] [[gamelan]], or lowest, as in the [[kepatihan notation]] of [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]].

Notes in the ranges outside the central octave are represented with one or more dots above or below the each number. For the most part, these cipher notations are mainly used to notate the skeletal melody (the [[balungan]]) and vocal parts ([[gerong]]an), although transcriptions of the elaborating instrument variations are sometimes used for analysis and teaching. Drum parts are notated with a system of symbols largely based on letters representing the vocables used to learn and remember drumming patterns; these symbols are typically laid out in a grid underneath the skeletal melody for a specific or generic piece.

The symbols used for drum notation (as well as the vocables represented) are highly variable from place to place and performer to performer. In addition to these current systems, two older notations used a kind of staff: the [[Surakarta|Solo]]nese script could capture the flexible rhythms of the [[Sindhen|pesinden]] with a squiggle on a horizontal staff, while in [[Yogyakarta]] a ladder-like vertical staff allowed notation of the balungan by dots and also included important drum strokes. In Bali, there are a few books published of [[Gamelan gender wayang]] pieces, employing alphabetical notation in the old Balinese script.

Composers and scholars both Indonesian and foreign have also mapped the [[slendro]] and [[pelog]] [[Musical tuning|tuning]] systems of gamelan onto the western staff, with and without various symbols for [[microtonal music|microtones]]. The Dutch composer [[Ton de Leeuw]] also invented a three line staff for his composition ''Gending''. However, these systems do not enjoy widespread use.

In the second half of the twentieth century, Indonesian musicians and scholars extended cipher notation to other oral traditions, and a [[diatonic and chromatic|diatonic scale]] cipher notation has become common for notating western-related genres (church hymns, popular songs, and so forth). Unlike the cipher notation for gamelan music, which uses a "fixed Do" (that is, 1 always corresponds to the same pitch, within the natural variability of gamelan tuning), Indonesian diatonic cipher notation is "moveable-Do" notation, so scores must indicate which pitch corresponds to the number 1 (for example, "1=C").

==Other systems and practices==

===Pitch bracket notation===
In pitch bracket notation music is written with melody lines and pitch brackets. Melody lines are like staff lines except they can change pitch by writing pitch brackets on them. Pitch brackets add or subtract scale steps to the melody line. The shape of the bracket (i.e. angle bracket), determines the number of scale steps to add. The direction of the bracket, opening or closing, determines whether to add or subtract scale steps. As a result of the mathematical nature of pitch bracket notation, arithmetic and algebra can be directly applied to the notation. Musical variations can be mathematically generated from their themes.

===Cipher notation===
{{Main|Numbered musical notation}}
Cipher notation systems assigning Arabic numerals to the [[major scale]] degrees have been used at least since the Iberian organ tablatures of the 16th-century and include such exotic adaptations as ''[[Siffernotskrift]]''. The one most widely in use today is the Chinese ''Jianpu'', discussed in the [[Numbered musical notation|main article]]. Numerals can of course also be assigned to different scale systems, as in the Javanese ''[[kepatihan]]'' notation [[Musical notation#Indonesia|described above]].

===Solfège===
{{Main|Solfège}}
Solfège is a way of assigning syllables to names of the musical scale. In order, they are today: ''Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do{{'}}'' (for the octave). The classic variation is: ''Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si Do{{'}}''. The first Western system of functional names for the musical notes was introduced by [[Guido of Arezzo]] (c. 991 &amp;ndash; after 1033), using the beginning syllables of the first six musical lines of the Latin hymn [[Ut queant laxis]]. The original sequence was ''Ut Re Mi Fa Sol La'', where each verse started a scale note higher. "Ut" later became "Do". The equivalent syllables used in Indian music are: ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni''. See also: [[solfège]], [[swara|sargam]], [[Kodály method#Hand signs|Kodály hand signs]].

[[Tonic sol-fa]] is a type of notation using the initial letters of solfège.

===Letter notation===
{{Main|Letter notation}}
The notes of the 12-tone scale can be written by their letter names A–G, possibly with a trailing sharp or flat symbol, such as A{{music|sharp}} or B{{Music|flat}}.

===Tablature===
{{Main|Tablature}}
Tablature was first used in the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]] for organ music and later in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] for [[lute]] music.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1961, xxiii and 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In most lute tablatures, a staff is used, but instead of pitch values, the lines of the staff represent the strings of the instrument. The [[fret]]s to finger are written on each line, indicated by letters or numbers. Rhythm is written separately with one or another variation of standard note values indicating the duration of the fastest moving part. Few seem to have remarked on the fact that tablature combines in one notation system both the physical and technical requirements of play (the lines and symbols on them and in relation to each other representing the actual performance actions) with the unfolding of the music itself (the lines of tablature taken horizontally represent the actual temporal unfolding of the music). In later periods, lute and guitar music was written with standard notation. Tablature caught interest again in the late 20th century for popular [[guitar]] music and other fretted instruments, being easy to transcribe and share over the internet in [[ASCII tab|ASCII format]]. Websites like [[Tablature#OLGA.net|OLGA]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olga.net/ olga.net]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070949/http://www.olga.net/ |date=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have archives of text-based popular music tablature.

===Klavar notation===
{{Main|Klavarskribo}}
Klavarskribo (sometimes shortened to '''klavar''') is a music notation system that was introduced in 1931 by the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Cornelis Pot. The name means "keyboard writing" in [[Esperanto]]. It differs from conventional music notation in a number of ways and is intended to be easily readable. Many klavar readers are from the Netherlands.

===Piano-roll-based notations===
Some chromatic systems have been created taking advantage of the layout of black and white keys of the standard piano keyboard. The "staff" is most widely referred to as "piano roll", created by extending the black and white piano keys.

===Chromatic staff notations===
Over the past three centuries, hundreds of music notation systems have been proposed as alternatives to traditional western music notation. Many of these systems seek to improve upon traditional notation by using a "chromatic staff" in which each of the 12 pitch classes has its own unique place on the staff. Examples are the ''Ailler-Brennink'' notation, Jacques-Daniel Rochat's ''Dodeka'' music notation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodeka.info/ dodeka.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicnotation.org/systems/more-notation-systems/|title=More Notation Systems {{!}} Notation Systems {{!}} The Music Notation Project|website=musicnotation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Tom Reed's ''Twinline'' notation, Russell Ambrose's ''Ambrose Piano Tabs'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ambrosepianotabs.com/ ambrosepianotabs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Morris' ''Clairnote'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://clairnote.org/ clairnote.org]&lt;/ref&gt; John Keller's ''Express Stave'', and José A. Sotorrio's ''Bilinear Music Notation''. These notation systems do not require the use of standard key signatures, accidentals, or clef signs. They also represent interval relationships more consistently and accurately than traditional notation. The Music Notation Project (formerly known as the Music Notation Modernization Association) has a website with information on many of these notation systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicnotation.org musicnotation.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic notation===
{{Main|Graphic notation (music)}}
The term 'graphic notation' refers to the contemporary use of non-traditional symbols and text to convey information about the performance of a piece of music. Practitioners include [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], [[Earle Brown]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], and [[Roger Reynolds]]. See ''Notations'', edited by John Cage and Alison Knowles, {{ISBN|0-685-14864-5}}.

===Simplified music notation===
{{Main|Simplified music notation}}
[[Simplified Music Notation]] is an alternative form of musical notation designed to make [[sight reading|sight-reading]] easier. It is based on [[modern musical symbols|classical staff notation]], but incorporates [[sharp (music)|sharps]] and [[flat (music)|flats]] into the shape of the [[note heads]]. [[Musical note|Note]]s such as [[sharp (music)|double sharps]] and [[flat (music)|double flats]] are written at the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] they are actually played at, but preceded by [[symbol]]s called ''history signs'' that show they have been [[transposition (music)|transposed]].

===Modified Stave Notation===
{{Main|Modified Stave Notation}}
[[Modified Stave Notation]] (MSN) is an alternative way of notating music for people who cannot easily read ordinary musical notation even if it is enlarged.

===Parsons code===
{{Main|Parsons code}}
Parsons code is used to encode music so that it can be easily searched.

===Braille music===
{{Main|Braille music}}
Braille music is a complete, well developed, and internationally accepted musical notation system that has symbols and notational conventions quite independent of print music notation. It is linear in nature, similar to a printed language and different from the two-dimensional nature of standard printed music notation. To a degree Braille music resembles musical markup languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicmarkup.info/scope/markuplanguages.html musicmarkup.info]&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[MusicXML]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://emusician.com/ar/emusic_xml_music/ emusician.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701200951/http://emusician.com/ar/emusic_xml_music/ |date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Notation Interchange File Format|NIFF]].

===Integer notation===
In [[integer notation]], or the [[integer]] model of pitch, all [[pitch class]]es and [[interval (music)|interval]]s between pitch classes are designated using the numbers 0 through 11.

===Rap notation===
The standard form of rap notation is the "flow diagram", where rappers line up their lyrics underneath "beat numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2009, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Hip-hop scholars also make use of the same flow diagrams that rappers use: the books ''How to Rap'' and ''How to Rap 2'' extensively use the diagrams to explain rap's triplets, flams, rests, rhyme schemes, runs of rhyme, and breaking rhyme patterns, among other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 2013, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems are used by musicologists Adam Krims in his book ''Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity''&lt;ref&gt;Krims 2001, 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kyle Adams in his work on rap's flow.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As rap revolves around a strong 4/4 beat,&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009, 69"&gt;Edwards 2009, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; with certain syllables aligned to the beat, all the notational systems have a similar structure: they all have four beat numbers at the top of the diagram, so that syllables can be written in-line with the beat.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009, 69"/&gt;

==Music notation on computer==
{{Main|Scorewriter}}

Many computer programs have been developed for creating music notation (called ''scorewriters'' or ''music notation software''). Music may also be stored in various digital file formats for purposes other than graphic notation output.

==Perspectives of musical notation in composition and musical performance==
According to Philip Tagg and [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musicology and to a degree European-influenced musical practice suffer from a 'notational centricity', a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation.&lt;ref&gt;Tagg 1979, 28–32; Middleton 1990, 104–6.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of 20th- and 21st-century composers have dealt with this problem, either by adapting standard Western musical notation or by using graphic notation.{{Clarify|date=October 2018}}&lt;!--How does changing the style of notation encourage musicologists to ignore notation in favor of other approaches, such as recordings or spectrograms?--&gt; These include [[George Crumb]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Krzystof Penderecki]], [[Earle Brown|Earl Brown]], [[John Cage]], [[Witold Lutoslawski]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce 1973, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cogan 1976, {{Page needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mycoforestry''' is an ecological [[forest management]] system implemented to enhance [[Forest ecology|forest ecosystems]] and plant communities through the introduction of [[mycorrhiza]]l and [[saprotroph]]ic [[fungi]]. Mycoforestry is considered a type of [[permaculture]]&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Zev. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/It%27s+good+to+grow+mushrooms:+Zev+Friedman+dishes+the+dirt+on+...-a0199193902 Digging In.] ''New Life Journal.'' 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be implemented as a beneficial component of an [[agroforestry]] system. Mycoforestry can enhance the yields of tree crops and produce [[edible mushroom]]s, an economically valuable product. By integrating plant-fungal associations into a forestry management system, native forests can be preserved, wood waste can be recycled back into the ecosystem, planted restoration sites are enhanced, and the sustainability of forest ecosystems are improved.&lt;ref name="stamets"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mycelium running: how mushrooms can help save the world |last=Stamets |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Stamets |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |location= |isbn=1-58008-579-2 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPI8_-omzvsC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=mycoforestry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=38pC71hh3O&amp;sig=vBOBS8Y0GcqUh40HyBiUGjwv8lk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I0mSS9zwB4OKNNHCwI8N&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=mycoforestry&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mycoforestry is an alternative to the practice of [[clearcutting]], which removes dead wood from forests, thereby diminishing nutrient availability and reducing soil depth.&lt;ref name="dahlgren"&gt;Dahlgren, R. A.; Driscoll, C. T. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/h523755w4m857t85/ The effects of whole-tree clear-cutting on soil processes at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA.] ''Plant and Soil.'' Volume 158, Number 2 / January 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection of fungal species==

According to [[Paul Stamets]], the first principle for the creation of a mycoforestry system is to utilize native fungal species.  Implementing a mycoforestry system provides the potential of improving restoration efforts and the possibility of economic gain through mushroom cropping and harvesting.  However to utilize native fungal flora, first the relationships between present fungal species and growth substrate, and habitat need to be studied.

A simple way to introduce a mycoforestry system and enhance out-plantings for crops and forest restoration sites is to "use mycorrhizal spore inoculum when replanting forest lands"&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; For this process it is best to match native trees with native mycorrhizal fungi.  This method keeps and will promote the functioning of the native ecosystem, and native biodiversity.  

It is assumed in a functioning forest ecosystem an underground mycelial network persists even if no fruiting bodies are visible.&lt;ref name="frankland"&gt;Frankland, Juliet C. [http://fungus.org.uk/nwfg/mycapr97.htm All you ever wanted to know about Mycelium.] ''NWFG Newsletter.'' April 1997. (ISSN 1465-8054) Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A period of disappearance of mushrooms from an area should not cause alarm.  In order to trigger the formation of fruiting bodies, many fungal species require specific environmental conditions.  Most species of fungi do not fruit year round.

Mycoforestry is an emergent scientific field and practice.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; Until broadly standardized protocols are created and perfected, the collection of both current and historical ecological site conditions will improve the success of the project.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; Therefore, a survey of fungal relations at the site under both prime and poor conditions is beneficial to implementation of a mycoforestry system.

==Saprotrophic fungi==
[[File:Und wieder Pilze.JPG|thumb|right|Edible oyster mushrooms (''[[Pleurotus]]'' sp.) fruiting from a stump]]

The second principle is to promote saprotrophic fungi in the environment.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; Saprophytic fungi are crucial to mycoforestry systems because these are the primary composers breaking down wood and returning nutrients to the soil for use by the rest of the forest ecosystem.  This can be accomplished through inoculation of wood debris at site. Spored oils can be used in chainsaws when problematic or invasive hardwood requires felling. This method is a simple means to inoculate a tree.   Additionally plug spawn can be implemented and injected into wood mass again prompting colonization by the selected fungus.  Eventually repeated colonization efforts should not be necessary as many fungal life forms are strong and will spread and sustain in the soil on their own.&lt;ref name="frankland"/&gt;

In management of the mycoforestry system it is important that [[coarse woody debris|dead wood]] be in contact with the ground.  This allows fungus to reach up from the soil and decompose fallen wood releasing nutrients at a much quicker rate then if the wood is left standing.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt;  Additionally it is important to leave dead wood on site for decomposition back into the soil.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt;  This philosophy is similarly based to the fact that clear cutting of a forest reduces soil nutrients and thickness.&lt;ref name="dahlgren"/&gt;

==Beneficial fungal interactions==
[[File:Armillaria mellea 620.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Armillaria]]'', a [[parasitic]] fungus]]

The third principal is to implement species known to benefit plant species.&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt;  These are commonly mycorrhizal fungus that form long term associations with plants, often extending inside of plants roots acting as an additional root system providing for better absorption of nutrients and water. 

Utilizing mushroom species that attract insects could be a useful source of fish food.  This practice makes the mycoforestry a larger system. Unlike most agriculture systems it helps the environment in a number of ways. It ties all biological aspects of the environment together, creating sustainable living and food production as well as sustainable fisheries similar to the ancient Hawaiian Ahupua'a, which utilized sustainable all portions of the land for environmental and food security.

Additionally fungal species can be implemented that compete with disease causing agents like [[Armillaria root rot]]s&lt;ref name="stamets"/&gt; to provide long term protection of the forestry system. 

Additionally, the implementation of an agroforestry system performs [[mycoremediation]] and [[mycofiltration]] activities cleaning up toxins and restoring the environment.

'''''Myrionecta rubra''''' (or '''''Mesodinium rubrum''''') is a species of ciliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gustafson|first1=Daniel E.|last2=Stoecker|first2=Diane K.|last3=Johnson|first3=Matthew D.|last4=Van Heukelem|first4=William F.|last5=Sneider|first5=Kerri|title=Cryptophyte algae are robbed of their organelles by the marine ciliate ''Mesodinium rubrum''|journal=Nature|year=2000|volume=405|issue=6790|pages=1049–1052|doi=10.1038/35016570|pmid=10890444}}&lt;/ref&gt; It constitutes a [[plankton]] community and is found throughout the year, most abundantly in spring and fall, in coastal areas. Although discovered in 1908, its scientific importance came into light in the late 1960s when it attracted scientists by the recurrent red colouration it caused by forming massive blooms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryther|first1=John H.|title=Occurrence of red water off Peru|journal=Nature|year=1967|volume=214|issue=5095|pages=1318–1319|doi=10.1038/2141318a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; that cause red tides in the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=William S.|last2=Fylling|first2=Dennis M.

Unlike typical protozoans, ''M. rubra'' can make its own nutrition by [[photosynthesis]]. The unusual [[autotrophic]] property was discovered in 2006 when genetic sequencing revealed that the photosynthesising organelles, [[plastids]], were derived from the principal food of the ciliate, the photosynthetic algae called [[cryptomonads]] (or cryptophytes).&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Matthew D.|last2=Tengs|first2=Torstein|last3=Oldach|first3=David|last4=Stoecker|first4=Diane K.|title=Sequestration, performance, and functional control of cryptophyte plastids in the ciliate ''Myrionecta rubra ''(Ciliophora)|journal=Journal of Phycology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1235–1246|doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00275.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, thus, both autotrophic and [[heterotrophic]]. This nature also indicates that it is an example of [[endosymbiosis]], supporting the [[endosymbiotic theory]], as well as the concept of stealing of [[cell organelles]] called [[kleptoplastidy]].&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowack|first1=E.

In 2009, a new species of [[Gram-negative bacteria]] called ''Maritalea myrionectae'' was discovered from a [[cell culture]] of ''M. rubra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=C. Y.|last2=Cho|first2=K. D.|last3=Yih|first3=W.|last4=Cho|first4=B.

== Description ==

''M. rubra'' is a free-living marine ciliate. It is reddish in colour and form dark-red mass during blooming. Its body is almost spherical, looking like a miniature [[sunflower]] with its radiating hair-like [[Undulipodium|cilia]] on its body surface. It measures up to 100 μm in length and 75 μm in width. The body is superficially divided into two lobes due to formation of a constriction at the centre. The constriction gives rise to a larger anterior lobe and a smaller posterior lobe. The cilia arise from the constriction. Using the cilia it can jump about 10-20 times its body length in one movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=F. J. R.|last2=Blackbourn|first2=D. J.|last3=Blackbourn|first3=Janice|title=The red-water ciliate'' Mesodinium rubrum'' and its 'incomplete symbionts': A review including new ultrastructural observations|journal=Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada|year=1971|volume=28|issue=3|pages=391–407|doi=10.1139/f71-052}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its nucleus is prominently situated at the centre, and is surrounded by organelles mostly derived from algae. For example, its cytoplasm contains numerous plastids, [[mitochondria]] and other [[Cell nuclei|nuclei]]. These organelles are properly separated such that the mitochondria are fully enclosed in a [[endosome|vacuole membrane]] and two [[endoplasmic reticulum]] membranes of the ciliate.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2009"/&gt; This indicates that the ciliate is primarily an heterotroph, but after acquiring algal plastid, it transforms into an autotroph.

=== The endosymbiont ===

Genetic analysis showed that in the American coastal areas, the primary food of ''M. rubra'' is the algae most closely related to the free-living ''[[Geminigera cryophila]]''.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; But in Japanese coasts, the major algal species is ''[[Teleaulax amphioxeia]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; When these plastid-containing algae are ingested by the ciliate, they are not digested. The plastids remain functional and provide nutrition to the ciliate by photosynthesis. In order for the plastids to be normally active, they still require enzymes, which are synthesised by the sequestered algal nuclei. The single nucleus can survive and remain genetically active up to 30 days in the cytoplasm of the ciliate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Matthew D.|last2=Oldach|first2=David|last3=Delwiche|first3=Charles F.|last4=Stoecker|first4=Diane K.|title=Retention of transcriptionally active cryptophyte nuclei by the ciliate ''Myrionecta rubra''|journal=Nature|year=2007|volume=445|issue=7126|pages=426–428|doi=10.1038/nature05496|pmid=17251979}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the retention time of the prey nuclei is short, an average ''M. rubra'' cell may contain eight algal plastids per single prey nucleus and the nuclei need to be replaced by continuous feeding on fresh algae. Thus, the algal organelles are not permanently integrated.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3212">'''Māori science''' also called '''Te Pūtaiao Māori''' (literally ''Māori knowledge of the natural world''), is an [[academic discipline]] at the intersection of [[Western science]] and [[mātauranga Māori]] (literally ''Māori knowledge'' or [[traditional knowledge]] of the [[Māori people]]). It can be viewed as a [[decolonization]] of [[science]]. Maori science is practiced by the Māori people; the natives of New Zealand. As a result of separation from the other nations, the Maori developed their own culture and practices.
Largely a product of [[Māori Renaissance]] of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, most Māori science is project-based with science-based organisation partner with [[iwi]] organisations and typically government funding. Outputs typically include traditional scientific outputs (i.e. articles in peer reviewed journals) as well as concrete benefits for [[iwi]]. Examples include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11172">The '''National Emissions Standards Act''', officially known as the '''Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act''' ({{USPL|89|272}}), is a 1965 amendment to the U.S. [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1963. The amendment set the first federal [[Automobile emissions control|vehicle emissions]] standards, beginning with the 1968 models. These standards were reductions from the 1963 emissions: 72% reduction for [[hydrocarbon]]s, 56% reduction for [[carbon monoxide]], and 100% reduction for crankcase hydrocarbons.  The impact the regulatory standards will have on air quality in the future, as well as the potential characteristics of the vehicle fleet can be analyzed with the use of [[roadway air dispersion model]]s.

The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is a department specific to the Clean Air Act. Its purpose is to make sure the amount of air pollution emitted stays inside the standards set by the U.S. Each state is required to have a state implementation plan (SIPs) that clearly indicates how it will enforce the regulations of the Clean Air Act. The states have to create regulations of their own that also adhere to the guidelines of the U.S. regulations; in order to do so, they must hold hearings so the public can contribute ideas and provide feedback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/pdfs/peg.pdf The Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act], U.S. EPA website, see pages 1-2 for explanation of the roles of the states and local governments as well as the role of the U.S. EPA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleaning up commonly found air pollutants==
The six common air pollutants of primary concern to the United States are particle pollution, [[ground-level ozone]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide|sulfur oxides]], [[nitrogen oxides]], and [[lead]].&lt;ref name="Cleaning"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/cleanup.html Cleaning Up Commonly Found Air Pollutants], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; These pollutants are detrimental to health, the environment, and a person's home and other belongings. The worst two of the six pollutants are particle pollution and ground-level ozone, which have to be regulated by the EPA. Particle pollution, or particle matter, consists of soot, smoke, and chemically formed "droplets".&lt;ref name="Cleaning"/&gt; These particles are very small and can bury themselves deep inside the lungs. Ground-level ozone is found in [[smog]] and can also negatively affect the lungs. Smog contains [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) and [[nitrogen oxides]] (NOx). VOCs come from cars burning gasoline, petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, etc., while NOx results from burning gasoline, coal, or oil.&lt;ref name="Cleaning"/&gt;

==Cars, trucks, buses, and non-road equipment==
Motor vehicles contribute a great deal to air pollution, so to reduce the amount of emissions released, the EPA placed restrictions on fuel and engine production. As a result, manufacturers are required to build cleaner engines and refiners are required to produce cleaner fuels. Gasoline used to include lead, which can cause damage to bodily functions and organs and sulfur was lowered over 90 percent in fuels because it doesn't allow a vehicle's [[catalytic converter]] to effectively clean up the exhaust.&lt;ref name="Vehicles"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/carstrucks.html Cars, Trucks, Buses, and "Nonroad" Equipment], U.S. EPA website. &lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most small cars, the majority of trucks, buses, and [[non-road equipment]] use diesel engines because they are more fuel efficient. However, they are also more harmful to the environment. In order to cut the emissions, the EPA issued rules to combine strict emissions standards for diesel engines and to lower sulfur diesel fuel.&lt;ref name="Vehicles"/&gt;

[[Alternative fuels]] such as natural gas, [[propane]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], electricity, and [[biodiesel]], are a major area of interest for the Clean Air Act. It is also important to find renewable fuels that can come from resources such as wood, waste paper, grasses, vegetable oils, and corn.&lt;ref name="Vehicles"/&gt;

==Interstate and international air pollution==
Air pollution is not contained and is carried by the wind all over the world. Industries contribute air pollution in the form of smog and [[haze]] in "downwind states".&lt;ref name="Interstate"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/interstate.html Interstate and International Air Pollution], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes pollution from "upwind states" blows into the downwind states, which can affect their air quality standards. These states can ask the EPA to enforce "a federal plan" to make sure that the standards are met. The Clean Air Act also requires that national parks maintain clear air; therefore, the EPA must collaborate with states to diminish the "regional haze" in national parks and wilderness areas.&lt;ref name="Interstate"/&gt;

==Reducing acid rain==
Acid precipitation comes in more forms than just rain. Snow, fog, mist, gas, and dust are also formed in the atmosphere and have the ability to become acid precipitation.&lt;ref name="Acid"&gt;[http://epa.gov/air/caa/peg/acidrain.html Reducing Acid Rain], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; These types of precipitation are formed when certain types of air pollutants mix with the moisture in the air to form an acid. Each type is  potentially dangerous to humans' health, can cause haze and problems in the environment, and can cause damage to people's properties. The two main pollutants that cause acid precipitation are [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Power plants that burn coal and "heavy oil" are accountable for over two-thirds of SO2 emissions annually in the U.S., while automobiles emit about fifty percent NOx and power plants emit about forty percent. The remaining percentages are from industrial and commercial boilers.&lt;ref name="Acid"/&gt; 

Any toxin is harmful to life on Earth. Acid rain and snow can increase the acidity in lakes and streams long enough to harm fish and other forms of life. Sulfur dioxide can be dangerous to children and the elderly by causing serious damage to lung tissue. In 1990, the Clean Air Act was changed to include a "nationwide approach" to lowering SO2 and NOx emissions. A cap was placed on the total SO2 emissions from electric power plants across the U.S.&lt;ref name="Acid"/&gt;

==Reducing toxic air pollutants==
Toxic air pollutants are the suspected cause of major illnesses and issues with reproductive problems. These pollutants stay in the environment for long periods, which can affect all living things and start a chain of negative events. In particular, smokestacks and automobiles are the two main sources of toxic air pollutants. When refueling, the gases turn into vapor that leak into the air. "Before the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, EPA regulated air toxics one chemical at a time." &lt;ref name="Toxic"&gt;[http://epa.gov/air/caa/peg/toxics.html Reducing Toxic Air Pollutants], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA now regulates pollutants by categories of industries because they release more than one chemical at a time. Some of the categories are, chemical plants, [[incinerators]], dry cleaners, and manufacturers of wood furniture. Since the 1990 Clean Air Act, air toxics from large industries have already been reduced by 70 percent.&lt;ref name="Toxic"/&gt;

==Protecting the stratosphere ozone layer==
Ozone can be harmful if it is ground-level, but if it is in the [[stratosphere]], it protects the Earth from [[ultraviolet]] rays from the sun. The stratosphere blocks some of the light called ultraviolet B, which can cause skin cancer and eye damage. It can also damage plant life on land and in the ocean.&lt;ref name="Ozone"&gt;[http://epa.gov/air/caa/peg/stratozone.html Protecting the Stratospheric Ozone Layer], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the main pollutants that are harmful to the stratosphere are called [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs). They come from aerosols such as hairspray, air conditioners, and some other types. They were banned in the 1970s. In the 1980s, scientists found that there were holes in the ozone around the South Pole. As a result, over 190 countries, including the United States, signed the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]]. This agreement is designated to eliminating chemicals that harm the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="Ozone"/&gt; The 1990 Clean Air Act "phased out" the most harmful chemicals and in 1996, production of CFCs, [[halons (disambiguation)|halons]], and [[methyl chloroform]] ended in the United States. There are still holes in the ozone that will take approximately 60 years to close up because of the chemicals that are already in the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="Ozone"/&gt;

==Permits and enforcement==
Congress added an operating permit program to the 1990 Clean Air Act for larger industries and commercial sources that release toxins into the air.&lt;ref name="Permits"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/permits.html Permits and Enforcement], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; These permits have information about which pollutants are emitted, how much may be emitted, and what actions the person in charge is taking to minimize the pollution. Permits must also state plans to measure and report the air pollution produced. The EPA is also responsible for making sure each state and tribe abides by the permits.&lt;ref name="Permits"/&gt; For businesses that qualify for more than one thing under the Clean Air Act, operating permits are helpful because the information is all there. These permits tell them exactly what they need to do to prevent pollution. Now the EPA is more powerful in being able to enforce the rules instead of having to handle everything in court. The EPA can either "issue an order requiring the violator to comply, issue and administrative penalty order, or bring a civil judicial action".&lt;ref name="Permits"/&gt;

==Public participation==
Since the 1990 Clean Air Act, the public has the opportunity to give input on "how a law is carried out".&lt;ref name="Public"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/public.html Public Participation], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; Hearings are held in different cities in the United States by the EPA. Anyone who attends is allowed to participate or written comments can be sent to the EPA. These hearings are open to the public when a "major rule" is about to be discussed.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt; The more public input is recorded, the better the outcome will be for communities around the country. Reports from the Clean Air Act are made available to the public and they include information about the amount of pollution that is emitted by industries and other sources.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt;

In [[computer aided engineering]] (CAE) a '''preprocessor''' is a [[computer program|program]] which provides a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) to define physical properties. 
This data is used by the subsequent [[computer simulation]].

Steps that are followed in Pre-Processing

1&gt; The geometry (physical bounds) of the problem is defined

2&gt; The volume occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (meshing)

3&gt; The physical modeling is defined - Eg. equations of motion + enthalpy + radiation + species conservation

4&gt; Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behavior and properties at the boundaries of the problem. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined.

5&gt; The simulation is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady state or transient

6&gt; Finally a post-processor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resting solution

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2737">The '''Press–Schechter formalism''' is a [[mathematical model]] for predicting the number of objects (such as [[galaxies]] or [[galaxy clusters]]) of a certain mass within a given volume of the Universe. It was described in a famous [[Academic paper|paper]] by [[William H. Press]] and [[Paul L. Schechter|Paul Schechter]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974ApJ...187..425P Formation of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies by Self-Similar Gravitational Condensation], W.H. Press, P. Schechter, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the context of [[Dark matter|cold dark matter]] cosmological models,
perturbations on all scales are imprinted on the universe at very early times,
for example by quantum fluctuations during an [[Inflationary cosmology|inflationary era]].
Later, as radiation redshifts away, these become mass perturbations, and they
start to grow linearly.  Only long after that, starting with small mass scales
and advancing over time to larger mass scales, do the perturbations actually
collapse to form (for example) galaxies or clusters of galaxies, in so-called
hierarchical structure formation (see [[Physical cosmology]]).

Press and Schechter observed that the fraction of mass in collapsed objects
more massive than some mass M is related to the fraction of volume samples
in which the smoothed initial density fluctuations are above some
density threshold.  This yields a formula for the mass function (distribution
of masses) of objects at any given time.

==Result==

The Press–Schechter formalism predicts that the number of objects with mass between &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M+dM&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;N(M)dM = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(1+\frac{n}{3}\right)\frac{\bar{\rho}}{M^2}\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/6}\exp\left(-\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/3}\right)dM&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean (baryonic and dark) matter density of the universe, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the power spectrum of the fluctuations in the early universe &lt;math&gt;P(k)\propto k^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M^*&lt;/math&gt; is a critical mass above which structures will form.

Qualitatively, the prediction is that the mass distribution is a power law for
small masses, with an exponential cutoff above some characteristic mass that
increases with time.  Such functions had previously been noted by Schechter
as observed [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity functions]],
and are now known as Schechter luminosity functions.  The Press-Schechter
formalism provided the first quantitative model for how such functions might
arise.

'''Process duct work''' conveys large volumes of hot, dusty air from [[Process engineering|processing equipment]] to mills, baghouses to other process equipment. Process [[Duct (industrial exhaust)|duct work]] may be round or rectangular. Although round duct work costs more to fabricate than rectangular duct work, it requires fewer stiffeners and is favored in many applications over rectangular ductwork.

The air in process duct work may be at ambient conditions or may operate at up to {{convert|900|°F}}. Process ductwork varies in size from 2&amp;nbsp;ft diameter to 20&amp;nbsp;ft diameter or to perhaps 20&amp;nbsp;ft by 40&amp;nbsp;ft rectangular.

Large process ductwork may fill with dust, depending on slope, to up to 30% of cross section, which can weigh 2 to 4 tons per linear foot.

Round ductwork is subject to duct suction collapse, and requires stiffeners to minimize this, but is more efficient in material than rectangular duct work.

There are no comprehensive, design references for process duct work design. The ASCE reference for the design of power plant duct design gives some general guidance on duct design, but does not specifically give designers sufficient information to design process duct work.

==Structural process ductwork==
Structural process ductwork carries large volumes of high temperature, dusty air, between pieces of process equipment. The design of this ductwork requires an understanding of the interaction of heat softening of [[metal]]s, potential effects of dust buildup in large ductwork, and [[structural design]] principles. There are two basic shapes for structural process ductwork: rectangular and round. Rectangular ductwork is covered by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] "The Structural Design of Air &amp; Gas Ducts for Process Power Stations and Industrial Applications".

In the practical design of primarily round structural process ductwork in the [[cement]], [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[lead]] industries, the duct size involved ranges from 18&amp;nbsp;inches (45&amp;nbsp;cm) to 30&amp;nbsp;feet (10&amp;nbsp;m). The air temperature may vary from ambient to 1000&amp;nbsp;°F (515&amp;nbsp;°C). Process ductwork is subject to large loads due to dust buildup, fan suction pressure, wind, and [[earthquake]] forces. {{As of|2009}} 30&amp;nbsp;ft diameter process ductwork may cost $7,000 per ton. Failure to properly integrate design forces may lead to catastrophic duct collapse. Overdesign of ductwork is expensive.

===Round and rectangular duct structural design===
The structural design of ductwork plate is based on buckling of the plate element. Round ductwork plate design is based on diameter to duct plate thickness ratios, and the allowable stresses are contained in multiple references such as ''US Steel Plate'', ASME/ANSI STS-1,SMNACA, ''Tubular Steel Structures'', and other references. In actuality round ductwork bent in bending is approximately 30% stronger than a similar shape in compression, however one uses the same allowable stresses in bending as we do for compression.

Round ducts require typical stiffeners at roughly 3 diameter spacing, or roughly 20&amp;nbsp;ft. O.C. for wind ovaling and fabrication and truck shipping requirements. Round ducts, larger than {{convert|6|ft|6|in}} in diameter (1/4" plate) require support ring stiffeners. Smaller-diameter ducts may not require support ring stiffeners, but may be designed with saddle supports. When stiffener rings are required they are traditionally designed based on "Roark", although this reference is quite conservative.

Round duct elbow allowable stresses are lower than the allowable stresses for straight duct  by a K factor = 1.65/(h 2/3power) where [h = t (duct) * R (elbow) /(r(duct)*r (duct). This equation, or similar equations is found in ''Tubular Steel Structures'' section 9.9.

Rectangular ductwork design properties is based on width-to-thickness ratios. This is simplified, normally to width=t/16, from corner elements or corner angle stiffeners, although in reality, the entire duct top &amp; side plate does participate, somewhat in duct section properties.

===Duct logic===

Duct logic is the process of planning for duct thermal movement, combined with planning to minimize duct dust dropout.

Ducts move with changes in internal temperature. Ducts are assumed to have the same temperature as their internal gasses, which may be up to 900&amp;nbsp;°F. If the internal duct temperature exceeds 1000&amp;nbsp;°F, refractory lining is used to minimize the duct surface temperature. At 1000&amp;nbsp;°F, ducts may grow approximately 5/8 inch per 10 feet of length. This movement must be carefully planned for, with cloth (or metal) expansion joints at each equipment flange, and one joint per each straight section of ductwork.

Sloping ductwork at or above the duct dust angle of repose will minimize dust buildup. Therefore many ducts carrying high dust loads slope at 30 degrees, or steeper.

===Duct elbow geometry===

To minimize pressure loss in duct elbows, the typical elbow radius is 1&amp;nbsp;1/2 times the duct diameter. In cases where this elbow radius is not feasible, turning vanes are added to the duct.

[[File:Stack Inlet Transition.jpg|thumbnail|Stack transition at concrete stack]]
===Duct transition and elbow layout===

Process ductwork is often large (6-foot diameter to 18-foot diameter), carrying large volumes of hot dirty gasses, at velocities of 3000 to 4500 feet per minute. The fans used to move these gasses are also large, 250 to 4000 horsepower. Therefor minimizing duct pressure drop by minimizing turbulence at elbows and transitions is of importance. Duct elbow radius is usually 1&amp;nbsp;1/2 to 2 times the duct size. The side slopes of transitions are typically 10 to 30 degrees.

Note: the duct gas velocity is chosen to minimize duct dust dropout. Cement and lime plant duct velocity at normal operations is 3000 to 3200 foot per minute, lead plant velocities are 4000 to 4500 foot per minute, as the dust is heavier. Other industries, such as grain have lower gas velocities. Higher duct gas velocity may require more powerful fans than lower duct velocities.

===Duct support types===
* Fixed supports typically are designed to resist lateral movement of the duct. Depending on the support geometry, fixed supports may also resist rotation of the duct art the support.
* Sliding supports are typically supported on Teflon, (or other material) pads, isolated from the duct so that temperature and dust does not damage the sliding surface.
* Link supports  are often "bents", or braced frames down from the duct support ring (frame) to a foundation or support plane. if the bent is long enough, hinges are not required to allow for duct thermal growth.
* Rod or hanger supports are similar to link supports, but due to the flexibility of the rod supports, that are easier to design and detail.
* Guide supports: Often rings inside a structural frame, with angle guides, that allow the duct to grow vertically while restraining the duct laterally for wind loads.
* Unusual "support" conditions (details):
** Hinges at expansion joints
** Tension ties across dual fixed supports
** Designs that allowing duct elbows to flex under unusual support conditions
** Other unusual design models.

===Duct design loads===

For cement plant and Lime plant process ductwork, duct loads are a combination of:
# Duct dead loads: are often simplified (in Cement plant usage) by using duct plate weight, multiplied by 1.15 as a stiffener allowance, as duct stiffeners usually weigh less than 15% times the duct plate weight. Duct stiffener allowance for rectangular power plants ductwork may be 50% to 100% of the duct plate weight.
# Duct internal dust loads (bottom of duct): which vary considerably with duct slope. These loads need to be approved by the client, but are often used as follows:
For duct sloping 0 degrees to 30 degrees, duct internal dust is 25% of duct cross section. For duct sloping 30 degrees to  45 degrees duct dust loads are reduced to 15% of cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping 45 degrees to 85 degrees,duct internal dust is 5% of duct cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping over 85 degrees.
Because of the potential for high dust loading, most process ductwork is run at a 30 to 45 degree slope.

2a) Duct dust loading in non-process ducts (2-foot diameter and smaller), such as conveyor venting ducts are sometimes run horizontally and can be filled to 100% of cross section.

2b) Power plant internal duct dust loads are coordinated with the client, and are sometimes used at 1 to 2 foot of internal ash loadings.

3) Duct internal, coating dust loads, which sometimes are used as a 2" (50&amp;nbsp;mm) coating of dust on the internal perimeter.

4) Duct suction pressure loads. Most process duct loads have design pressures of 25 inches (600&amp;nbsp;mm) to 40 inches (1000&amp;nbsp;mm) of water pressure. This suction pressure operates to cause suction pressure collapse on the duct side walls. Also this pressure operates perpendicular to the duct "expansion joints" to create an additional load on the duct supports that adds to dead, and live loads. Please note: duct pressure loads vary with temperature, as the gas density varies with temperature. A duct pressure of 25 inches of H2O, at room temperature may become 12 inches to 6 inches at duct operating pressures.

5) Duct wind loads

6) Duct Seismic loads

7) Duct Snow loads, normally inconsequential, as snow will melt quickly unless the plant is in shutdown mode.

8) Top of duct dust loads, often used as zero, since plant dust generation is much less now, than in the past.

9) Duct suction pressure loads, act perpendicular to end of duct cross section, and can be significant. For a duct designed for 25" of water at a startup temperature of 70 degree F, on an 8 foot in diameter duct, this is equal to 8000 pounds at each end of the duct.

==Round ductwork==

The majority of cement plant process ductwork is round. This is because the round duct shape does not bend between circumferential stiffeners. Therefor bending stiffeners are not required, and round ductwork requires fewer and lighter intermediate stiffeners than rectangular ductwork. Round cement plant duct stiffeners are sometimes about 5% duct plate weight. Rectangular cement plant duct stiffeners are 15 to 20% times duct plate weight. Power plant ductwork is often larger. power plant ductwork is usually rectangular, with stiffener weights of 50% (or more) times duct plate weight. (this is based on personal experience, and my vary with loads, duct size, and industry standards)

Large, round process ductwork is usually [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricated]] from 1/4-inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) mild steel plate, with ovaling stiffening rings at 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;ft (5 to 6 M) on center, regardless of diameter. These lengths allow for resistance to wind ovaling and resistance to out of round when shipping by truck. This also works well with fabricator equipment.

The typical intermediate rings are designed for wind bending [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], reduced as required by the [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]] reduction at working temperatures. The typical rings are fabricated from rolled steel plate, angles or tees's welded together to create the ring cross section required. Rings are fabricated from any combination of plate, tee or W shape that the shop can roll. Rings are usually mild carbon steel, ASTM A36 plate, or equivalent. The location of ring butt welds should preferably be offset 15 degrees(+/-)from point of maximum stress to minimize the effect of weld porosity on weld allowable stress.

See [[U.S. Steel|US Steel]] Plate, volume II for empirical ring spacing, and wind bending stress:
Spacing = Ls = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)]
Section = p * L (spacing, ft) * Do (ft) * Do (ft)/Fb (20,000 at ambient T)
This reference is older, but a good starting point for duct design.

SMACNA, (2ND Edition) chapter 4 has many useful formulas for round ducts, allowable stresses, ring spacing, effect of dust, ice,and live loads. The basic factor of safety for SMACNA, 3, is larger than typically used on typical structural engineering projects, of 1.6.
Under SMACNA the critical ring spacing for rings is L = 1.25 * D (ft) sqrt (D(ft)/t(inches)), which is similar to tubular steel structures, L = 3.13 * R sqrt (R/t). In effect, using Spacing = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)] is conservative.

Allowable bending and compression stress in ducts can come from several sources.

See API 560 for design of wind ovaling stiffeners

See Tubular Steel structures, chapter 2, 9 &amp; 12 for the allowable stresses for thin, round ducts, their allowable stresses, elbows, elbow softening coefficients, and some procedures for the design of duct support rings. These allowable stresses can be verified with select review of chapters of US Steel Plate, Blodgett Design of plate structures, Roark &amp; Young, or API 650.

Round duct support rings are spaced, often at three diameters, or as require at up to about 50&amp;nbsp;ft centers (14 m). At this spacing the main support rings are designed for the sum of [[suction pressure]] stresses &amp; support bending moments.

Round ductwork allowable compressive stress is = 662 /(d/t) +339 * Fy (tubular steel structures, chapter 2). Other reference use similar equations.

Ductwork typical cement plant pressure drops are: 60% to 80% of high temperature process duct work [[pressure drop]] occurs in the process equipment, baghouses, mills and cyclones. Since motor 1 (one) horsepower cost roughly $1000/year (US$) (2005), duct efficiency is important. Minimizing duct pressure drop can reduce plan operating costs. most ductwork, non-equipment pressure drop occurs at transitions and changes of directions (elbows). The bests way to minimize duct pressure drop or to minimize plant operating costs, is to use elbows with an elbow radius to duct radius exceeding 1.5. (For a 15-foot duct, the elbow radius would therefore equal, or exceed, 22.5&amp;nbsp;ft.)

Process duct pressure drops (US practice) are usually measured in inches of water. A typical duct operates at about - 25 inches (160 psf.) total suction pressure, with roughly 75% of the pressure loss in the bag house, and 10% of pressure lost in duct friction, and 15% (nominal)lost in elbow turbulence. A major consideration of duct design is to minimize duct pressure losses, turbulence, as poor duct geometry, increases turbulence, and increases plant electrical usage.

Round duct work suction pressure collapse, in ducts over 6 feet in diameter, is prevented with rings at supports, and roughly 3 diameter centers.

Round duct support rings are traditionally designed from the formula's found in Roark &amp; Young. However this reference is based on point loads on rings, while actual duct ring loads are based on almost uniform bottom dust. Therefore these formulars can be shown with Ram, or other analysis methods to have conservatism factor of roughly 2 above the stresses given In Roark. The duct ring force dead, live and dust forces need to be combined with suction pressure stresses. Suction pressure forces concentrate on the rings, as they are the stiffest element present.

Round ductwork elbow allowable stresses are reduced due to the elbow curvature. Various references give similar results for this reduction. Tubular steel structures, Section 9.9 gives the (Beskin) reduction factor of K= 1.65/(h (2/3 power)) where h= t (plate) *R(elbow)/ r (duct) (where suction pressures are smaller). This K reduces the I factor of the duct  I effective = I/K.

Round duct rings are fabricated from rolled tees, angles, or plates, welded into the shape required. Typically these are designed with ASTM A-36 properties.

===Factors of safety===

Typical duct round plate factor of safety (traditional factor of safety) should be 1.6, because duct plate bending, and buckling is mostly controlled by typical intermediate ring design.

Typical intermediate ring factor of safety should be 1.6, because there is ample evidence in various codes, (API 360, etc.) that intermediate rings designed for wind ovaling and suction pressure combinations are safe.

Typical main support ring factor of safety, if designed by "Roark" formulas should be 1.6, (If constructed to the Roark normal 1% out of round standard tolerance) because it can be shown by various methods that these formulas are at least a factor of two, above three D duct ring analysis results etc..

Typical duct elbow factor of safety should be above 1.6, because it can be difficult to show that shipping out of round for elbows corresponds to the normal 1% out of round standard tolerance. (various code and reference notes).

==Round structural conveyor tubes==

Round structural tubes are sometimes used to support and contain conveyors transporting coal, lead concentrate, or other dusty material over county roads, plant access roads, or river barge loading facilities. When tubes are used for these purposes they may be 10'-6" to 12 foot diameter, and up to 250 foot long, using up to 1/2" plate and ovaling ring stiffeners at 8 foot (to 20 foot centers). On one such project My firm added L8x8x3/4  at the top 45 degree  location to stiffen the plate near the point of maximum stress for tubes (as per Timoshenko, and others).

Some vendor provide conveyor galleries for the same purpose.

==Rectangular ductwork==

Rectangular cement plant ductwork is often 1/4" (6&amp;nbsp;mm) duct plate, with stiffeners spaced at about 2'-6", depending on suction pressure and temperature. Thinner plate requires a closer stiffener spacing. The stiffeners are usually considered pinned end. Power plant ductwork can be 5/16" thick duct plate, with "fixed end" W stiffeners at roughly 2'-5" spacing. Because rectangular duct plate bends, stiffeners are required at reasonably close spacing. Duct plate 3/16", or thinner, may dishpan, or make noise, and should be avoided.

Rectangular duct section properties are calculated from the distance between the upper to lower duct corners of the ductwork The flanges areas are based on the size of corner angles plus duct plate width based on the plate thickness ratio of 16*t. (see AISC structural duct design below) For section properties the "web" plate is ignored.

The typical stiffener spacing for cement plant duct work is usually based on duct plate bending M = W * L * L / 8. This is because using a fixed-fixed condition requires difficult to design plate attachments. Power plant, and other larger ductwork,  usually goes thru the expense of creating "fixed End" corner moment. all stiffeners for rectangular ductwork requires consideration of lateral torsional bracing stiffeners.

==Effect of temperature on duct yield stress==
Ducts are usually designed as if the duct plate and stiffener temperatures match the internal duct gas temperatures. For mild carbon steels (ASTM A36) temperatures, the design yield stress ratio at 300°F is 84% of room temperature stress. At 500°F, the design yield stress ratio is 77% of room temperature stress. At 700°F, the design yield stress ratio is about 71% of room temperature stress. Temperatures above 800°F may cause mild carbon steel to warp. This is because, in this temperature range, the crystal lattice structure of mild carbon steel changes with temperatures above about 800 degrees F (reference, US Steel Plate, elevated temperature steel).

For ductwork operating above 800 degrees F, duct plate material should resist warping. Either Core-ten or ASTM A304 stainless steel may be used for duct plate between 800°F and 1200°F, Core-ten plate is less expensive than stainless steel.

Corten steels have essentially the same yield stress ratios as Corten through 700°F. At 900°F, the yield stress ratio is 63%. At 1100°F, the yield stress ratio is 58% (AISC tables). Corten steels should not be used above 1100°F.

Unless the duct and its stiffeners are insulated, the stiffeners can be designed in ASTM A36 steels, even at a duct temperature of 1000°F. This is because the stiffener temperature is cooler than the duct gas temperature by several hundred degrees (F). Duct stiffener temperatures are assumed to drop about 100°F per inch of depth (when uninsulated) (no reference available).

==Corrosion and wear resistance==

===Corrosion===
As reducing the loss of heat at plants has changed over the years, ductwork now connects more pieces of equipment than ever before. Care needs to be taken to avoid condensation of moisture in plant ductwork. Once condensation occurs, the condensation may absorb CO2, other components in the gas stream, and become corrosive on low carbon steel. Methods to avoid this problem may include
# Duct insulation
# specialty steels, such as COR-10 steels or A304 SS or A316L SS,
# Duct internal coatings. Duct internal coatings are expensive, and may cost more than the stack plate they protect. Uncoated stacks cement plant stacks, with condensation, have been noted to last less than two years.

Sulfuric acid attack may require stainless steel ducts, fiberglass ducts, etc.

===Wear resistance===
Many plant exhaust gasses contain dusts with high wear potential. Typically wear resistant steels are not useful in resisting duct wear, particularly at higher temperatures. Wear resistant steel ducts are hard to fabricate, and refractory coatings are usually less expensive than wear resistant steel ductwork. Each industry may have different approaches to resist duct wear.

Cement plant clinker dust is more abrasive than sand. In high temperature ducts, or ducts with wear potential, 2 1/2-inch refractory, is often anchored to the duct plate with V anchors at 6" O.C. (+/-) to resist a) temperature, or b) wear at elbows or a combination of these effects. Occasionally ceramic tiles or ceramic mortars are anchored to ductwork to resist temperature and wear.

Grain plant hulls are also very abrasive. Sometimes plastic liners are used to resist wear in grain facilities, where temperatures are lower than in mineral processing facilities.

==Expansion joint types==

Duct segments are typically separated with metal or fabric expansion joints. These joints are designed and detailed for the duct suction pressure, temperatures, and movements between duct segments. Fabric joints are often chosen to separate the duct segments because they usually cost 40% less than metal joints. Also metal joints place an additional loads onto duct segments. Metal joints prefer axial movements, and provide significant lateral loads onto duct segments.  fabric joints cost $100 to $200 per square foot of joint (2010). Metal joints can cost twice this amount.

fabric expansion duct forces are assumed to be 0 #/inch. Metal expansion joint forces for metal joints a 24-inch diameter duct are on the order of 850#/ inch of movement for axial spring rate, and 32,500 #/inch for lateral movement. These coefficients will vary with duct size, joint thickness, and becomes larger for rectangular ducts (based on one recent job).

Fabric expansion joint life is about 5 years under field conditions. Many plants prefer access platforms near the joints for replacing the joint fabric.

==Finite element software==

Currently software is available to model ductwork in 3D. This software needs to be used with care, as the design rules for width to thickness and elbow softening coefficients, etc., may not be input into the design program.

[[File:Duct Y Split &amp; reinforcing.jpg|thumbnail|Duct transition and reinforcing]]

==Drawing presentation and dimensioning==
{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}

It is easy to draw ducts in 3D without correct dimensioning. Drawings should be laid out with:

* Work points, with elevations, and plan dimensioning.
* Elbow radius, duct diameters, or width and thickness dimensions, elbow tangent dimensions (true view and plan and elevation views)
* Column grids, dimensions between supports, showing work points
* Lack of dimensions in 3D generated drawings makes drawings hard to follow.
* supports need to be coordinated with elevations.

==Special duct loading conditions==

Special duct loading conditions may occur outside of dead, live, dust and temperature conditions. Ductwork associated with coal mills, coke grinding facilities, and to some extent grain processing facilities, may be subject to explosive dusts. Ductwork designed for explosive dust is typically designed for 50 psi internal pressure, and will typically have one explosion relief one vent per duct section. the likelihood of a dust explosion on an indirect coal mill system is 100%, over time. This can generate a plum of fire 5&amp;nbsp;ft. to 15&amp;nbsp;ft. in diameter, and 20&amp;nbsp;ft. to 30&amp;nbsp;ft. long. Therefore access to areas surrounding explosion vents shall limit personal access with locked access.

==Duct details==

Ducts are shipped from fabricating facility to job sites on trucks, by rail, or on barges in lengths accommodating the mode of transport, often in 20 foot sections. These sections are connected with flanges, or weld straps. Flanges are provided at expansion joints, or to join low stress duct sections. Flanges may be difficult to design for the duct plate forces. Flange gaskets add flexibility to the flanges that make their ability to carry forces problematic. Therefore, weld straps (short steel straps) are commonly used for higher stress duct plate connections.

==Various duct photos==
A close look at the fixed duct support photo shows several properties or round ring supports. There are stiffeners at roughly 60 degrees on center. This duct ring is fabricated from two rolled WTs, welded at the center. This is a smaller duct, with light loads, so that the bottom flange was slightly modified by support clearance requirements. A small gap is shown for placing the duct PTFE slide bearing, although a fixed support could also be inserted in this gap. In the background of this photo is a duct flange. The duct flange normally has 3/4" bolts at 6" nominal; spacing. Duct flange angle thickness needs to be designed for duct plate tensile stresses, as flanges will bend. 5/16" or 3/8" angle thicknesses are common.    
  
See above photo of round duct elbows, transitions, and stiffeners. The duct elbow radius is from 1 1/2 to 2 times the duct diameter. The round duct has ovaling, and shipping rings at 20 foot nominal spacing, and larger support rings at supports. The Y split has suction stiffeners at the duct intersection. Note the 3000 HP fan inlet transition and stack inlet transition also shown in this photo. 

The adjacent photo also shows several principles of process ductwork. It shows a large baghouse inlet ductwork. The inlet duct is tapered to minimize dust dropout. A shallow taper such at this also reduces pressure losses when changing duct diameters. Note the rectangular duct ring spacing is roughly 2'-6" on center. The round duct is stiffened near each branch duct.

== Resources ==
There are several references for process duct work. These references are worked together to review duct design processes. Other references are often used for duct design, but they give similar results. Finite element design of process duct work is possible, but a requirement of design theory and allowable stresses is required to properly interpret the finite element model.

Cement, lime and lead industry accepted dust loads (for structural loading) are:
Process ductwork is intended to convey large volumes of dust. some of this dust will settle to the bottom of the duct during power outages and normal operation.

The percentage of duct cross section filled with dust is often assumed to be as follows:

* Duct slopes level to 30 degrees, 25% of cross section.
* Duct slopes, 30 degrees to 45 degrees, 15% of cross section
* Duct Slopes, 45 degrees to 85 Degrees, 5%
* Above 85 degrees, a 2&amp;nbsp;in (50&amp;nbsp;mm) interior coating of dust.
* These loads are always confirmed with the client, before use, but the above in US common practice

To minimize the buildup of dust, each material has a minimum carrying velocity, lime = about 2800 fpm., cement about 3200 fpm, and lead dust about 4200 fpm.

Dust density depends on industry, Normally these are: cement dust density = 94 pcf, lime industry = 50 pcf, lead oxide dust = 200 pcf.

Duct Wear: High temperature ductwork often carries large volumes of hot abrasive dust. Often the design temperature of the duct, or the abrasiveness of the dust, prevents the use of abrasive resisting steels. In these cases refractory can be anchored inside the duct, or abrasive resisting tiles, with weld nuts, are welded to the inside of the ductwork.
 
Duct Thermal Movement

Duct steels expand with temperature. Each type of steel may have a different coefficient of thermal expansion, typical mild carbon steels expand with the coefficient of 0.0000065 (See AISC).

:''For the concept of protasis in linguistics, see [[Conditional sentence]].''
In [[drama]], a '''protasis''' is the introductory part of a play, usually its first act. The term was coined by the fourth-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] grammarian [[Aelius Donatus]]. He defined a play as being made up of three separate parts, the other two being [[epitasis]] and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. In modern [[dramatic theory]] the term [[Dramatic_structure|dramatic arc]] has substantially the same meaning&lt;ref&gt;https://makingmusic.ableton.com/dramatic-arc&lt;/ref&gt;, though with slightly different divisions.

__NOTOC__
[[File:Pantheon dome.jpg|thumb|The Roman [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] was the [[List of largest domes|largest dome in the world]] for more than a millennium and is the largest unreinforced solid concrete dome to this day&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanconcrete.com/ The Roman Pantheon: The Triumph of Concrete]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Roman architectural revolution''', also known as the '''Concrete revolution''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeLaine|1990|p=407}}; {{harvnb|Rook|1992|pp=18f.}}; {{harvnb|Gardner|2005|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the widespread use in [[Roman architecture]] of the previously little-used architectural forms of the [[arch]], [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], and [[dome]]. For the first time in history, their potential was fully exploited in the construction of a wide range of civil engineering structures, public buildings, and military facilities. These included [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|baths]], [[List of Roman bridges|bridges]], [[Circus (building)#List of Roman circuses|circuses]], [[List of Roman dams and reservoirs|dams]], [[List of Roman domes|domes]], [[Roman harbour|harbour]]s, and [[Roman temple|temples]].

A crucial factor in this development that saw [[List of ancient architectural records|a trend to monumental architecture]] was the invention of [[Roman concrete]] (also called [[opus caementicium]]), which led to the liberation of the shape from the dictate of the traditional materials of stone and brick.&lt;ref name="Ward-Perkins 1956, 219"/&gt;   

{{ quote
| For the first time in recorded history we find evidence of an interest in the shapes of the space contained strong enough to outweigh the functional logic of the masonry masses that contained it. There was nothing new in the employment of curvilinear or polygonal forms, as such...But in so far as such buildings incorporated curvilinear or polygonal rooms and corridors, the shapes of these were determined by the form of the building as a whole, not by any aesthetic principle.
| &lt;ref name="Ward-Perkins 1956, 219"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward-Perkins|1956|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}

The development of Roman architecture, however, did not remain limited to these new forms and  materials. An unrelated process of architectural innovation continued unabated, which, although less conspicuous, proved their usefulness for solving structural problems and found their way permanently into Western architecture, such as the [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel arch]], the independent [[corbel]], and the metal-tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeLaine|1990|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Romanticism''' (also known as the '''Romantic era''') was an artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical. &lt;!-- Please do not adjust these dates without raising the matter on the talk page first --&gt;  It was partly a reaction to the [[Industrial Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9083836 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013060413/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9083836 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 October 2005 |title=''Romanticism''.

The movement emphasized intense emotion as an authentic source of [[aesthetic]] experience, placing new emphasis on such emotions as [[apprehension (fear)|apprehension]], [[horror and terror]], and [[Awe (emotion)|awe]]—especially that experienced in confronting the new aesthetic categories of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] and beauty of nature. It elevated [[folk art]] and ancient custom to something noble, but also spontaneity as a desirable characteristic (as in the musical [[impromptu]]). In contrast to the [[Rationalism]] and [[Classicism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romanticism revived [[medievalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Núria Perpinyà|Perpinya]], Núria. [http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/buch/isbn/3794 Ruins, Nostalgia and Ugliness. Five Romantic perceptions of Middle Ages and a spoon of Game of Thrones and Avant-garde oddity]. Berlin: Logos Verlag. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and elements of art and narrative perceived as authentically medieval in an attempt to escape population growth, early [[urban sprawl]], and [[Industrial Revolution|industrialism]].

Although the movement was rooted in the German ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement, which preferred intuition and emotion to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, the events and ideologies of the [[French Revolution]] were also proximate factors. Romanticism assigned a high value to the achievements of "heroic" individualists and artists, whose examples, it maintained, would raise the quality of society. It also promoted the individual imagination as a critical authority allowed of freedom from classical notions of form in art. There was a strong recourse to historical and natural inevitability, a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', in the representation of its ideas. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]] was offered as a polar opposite to Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;"'A remarkable thing,' continued Bazarov, 'these funny old romantics! They work up their nervous system into a state of agitation, then, of course, their equilibrium is upset.'" ([[Ivan Turgenev]], ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'', chap. 4 [1862])&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of Romanticism during this time was associated with multiple processes, including social and political changes and the spread of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/901360| jstor = 901360| title = The Decline of Romanticism: End of the Century, Turn of the Century-- Introductory Sketch of an Essay| journal = Studia Musicologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae| volume = 12| issue = 1/4| page = 263| year = 1970| last1 = Szabolcsi | first1 = B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining Romanticism==

===Basic characteristics===
The nature of Romanticism may be approached from the primary importance of the free expression of the feelings of the artist. The importance the Romantics placed on emotion is summed up in the remark of the German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]], "the artist's feeling is his law".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 96&lt;/ref&gt; To [[William Wordsworth]], poetry should begin as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings", which the poet then "recollect[s] in tranquility", evoking a new but corresponding emotion the poet can then mold into art.&lt;ref&gt;From the Preface to the 2nd edition of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', quoted Day, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

To express these feelings, it was considered the content of art had to come from the imagination of the artist, with as little interference as possible from "artificial" rules dictating what a work should consist of. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and others believed there were natural laws the imagination—at least of a good creative artist—would unconsciously follow through [[artistic inspiration]] if left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 3&lt;/ref&gt; As well as rules, the influence of models from other works was considered to impede the creator's own imagination, so that [[originality]] was essential. The concept of the [[genius]], or artist who was able to produce his own original work through this process of ''creation from nothingness'', is key to Romanticism, and to be derivative was the worst sin.&lt;ref name="Ruthven01p40"&gt;Ruthven (2001) p. 40 quote: "Romantic ideology of literary authorship, which conceives of the text as an autonomous object produced by an individual genius."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spearing87"&gt;Spearing (1987) quote: "Surprising as it may seem to us, living after the Romantic movement has transformed older ideas about literature, in the Middle Ages authority was prized more highly than originality."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco94"&gt;Eco (1994) p. 95 quote:
Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness", with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is often called "romantic originality."&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1926), throughout; Smith (1924); Millen, Jessica ''Romantic Creativity and the Ideal of Originality: A Contextual Analysis'', in [http://eview.anu.edu.au/cross-sections/vol6/pdf/ch07.pdf ''Cross-sections'', The Bruce Hall Academic Journal – Volume VI, 2010 PDF]; Forest Pyle, The Ideology of Imagination: Subject and Society in the Discourse of Romanticism (Stanford University Press, 1995) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Translator and prominent Romantic [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] argued in his ''Lectures on Dramatic Arts and Letters'' that the most phenomenal power of human nature is its capacity to divide and diverge into opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Romanticism: A Brief History with Documents|last=1963–|first=Breckman, Warren|date=2008|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|others=Rogers D. Spotswood Collection.|isbn=978-0312450236|edition= 1st |location=Boston|oclc=148859077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not essential to Romanticism, but so widespread as to be normative, was a strong belief and interest in the importance of nature. This particularly in the effect of nature upon the artist when he is surrounded by it, preferably alone. In contrast to the usually very social art of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Romantics were distrustful of the human world, and tended to believe a close connection with nature was mentally and morally healthy. Romantic art addressed its audiences with what was intended to be felt as the personal voice of the artist. So, in literature, "much of romantic poetry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Day 3–4; quotation from M.H. Abrams, quoted in Day, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Isaiah Berlin]], Romanticism embodied "a new and restless spirit, seeking violently to burst through old and cramping forms, a nervous preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of consciousness, a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual movement and change, an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life, a passionate effort at self-assertion both individual and collective, a search after means of expressing an unappeasable yearning for unattainable goals."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The group of words with the root "Roman" in the various European languages, such as "romance" and "Romanesque", has a complicated history, but by the middle of the 18th century "romantic" in English and ''romantique'' in French were both in common use as adjectives of praise for natural phenomena such as views and sunsets, in a sense close to modern English usage but without the amorous connotation. The application of the term to literature first became common in Germany, where the circle around the Schlegel brothers, critics [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]], began to speak of ''romantische Poesie'' ("romantic poetry") in the 1790s, contrasting it with "classic" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating.  Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his ''Dialogue on Poetry'' (1800), "I seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived."&lt;ref&gt;Ferber, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In both French and German the closeness of the adjective to ''roman'', meaning the fairly new literary form of the [[novel]], had some effect on the sense of the word in those languages.  The use of the word, invented by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], did not become general very quickly, and was probably spread more widely in France by its persistent use by [[Germaine de Staël]] in her ''[[De l'Allemagne]]'' (1813), recounting her travels in Germany.&lt;ref name="Ferber, 7"&gt;Ferber, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the "romantic harp" and "classic lyre",&lt;ref name="Ferber, 7"/&gt; but in 1820 [[Lord Byron|Byron]] could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously, "I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the [[Académie française]] took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period===
The period typically called Romantic varies greatly between different countries and different artistic media or areas of thought. [[Margaret Drabble]] described it in literature as taking place "roughly between 1770 and 1848",&lt;ref&gt;in her ''Oxford Companion'' article, quoted by Day, 1&lt;/ref&gt; and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, [[M. H. Abrams]] placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 1–5&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have proposed 1780–1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = British Literature 1780–1830|last = Mellor|first = Anne|publisher = Harcourt Brace &amp; Co./Wadsworth|year = 1996|isbn = 978-1413022537|location = NY|pages = |last2 = Matlak|first2 = Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; [[Romantic music|musical Romanticism]], for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'' of [[Richard Strauss]] are described stylistically as "Late Romantic" and were composed in 1946–48.&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Kravitt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WpR6Ja9eQzYC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22Four+Last+Songs%22+%22Late+Romantic%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FC92T8K_JIWA8gPP3JCeDQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Four%20Last%20Songs%22%20%22Late%20Romantic%22&amp;f=false The Lied: Mirror of Late Romanticism]'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1996): 47. {{ISBN|0300063652}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in most fields the Romantic Period is said to be over by about 1850, or earlier.

The early period of the Romantic Era was a time of war, with the French Revolution (1789–1799) followed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] until 1815.  These wars, along with the political and social turmoil that went along with them, served as the background for Romanticism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Greenblatt et al., ''Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, "The Romantic Period – Volume D" (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company Inc., 2006): {{Page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The key generation of French Romantics born between 1795–1805 had, in the words of one of their number, [[Alfred de Vigny]], been "conceived between battles, attended school to the rolling of drums".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 147, inc. quotation&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jacques Barzun]], there were three generations of Romantic artists. The first emerged in the 1790s and 1800s, the second in the 1820s, and the third later in the century.&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, 469&lt;/ref&gt;

===Context and place in history===
The more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of [[intellectual history]] and [[literary history]] throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging.  That it was part of the [[Counter-Enlightenment]], a reaction against the [[Age of Enlightenment]], is generally accepted in current scholarship.  Its relationship to the [[French Revolution]], which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions.  Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views,&lt;ref&gt;Day, 1–3; the arch-conservative and Romantic is [[Joseph de Maistre]], but many Romantics swung from youthful radicalism to conservative views in middle age, for example Wordsworth. [[Samuel Palmer]]'s only published text was a short piece opposing the [[Repeal of the corn laws]].&lt;/ref&gt; and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.

In philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading "to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth",&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, 57&lt;/ref&gt; and hence not only to nationalism, but also [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]], with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Several of Berlin's pieces dealing with this theme are collected in the work referenced. See in particular: Berlin, 34–47, 57–59, 183–206, 207–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the Romantics, Berlin says, &lt;blockquote&gt;in the realm of ethics, politics, aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered; this applied equally to individuals and groups—states, nations, movements. This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism, where the notion of eternal models, a Platonic vision of ideal beauty, which the artist seeks to convey, however imperfectly, on canvas or in sound, is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom, individual creativity. The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some "external" voice—church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste—is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- yes, 2 semi-colons &amp; about 15 commas in the quote --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[John William Waterhouse]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'', 1888, after a poem by [[Tennyson]]; like many [[Victorian painting]]s, romantic but not Romantic.]]

[[Arthur Lovejoy]] attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article "On The Discrimination of Romanticisms" in his ''Essays in the [[History of ideas|History of Ideas]]'' (1948); some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present, some like [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] see in it the inaugural moment of [[modernity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp Linda Simon ''The Sleep of Reason'' by Robert Hughes]&lt;/ref&gt; and some like [[Chateaubriand]], [[Novalis]] and Samuel Taylor Coleridge see it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism—a "Counter-Enlightenment"—&lt;ref&gt;''[[Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder]]'', Pimlico, 2000 {{ISBN|0712664920}} was one of [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and organic,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Darrin McMahon|Darrin M. McMahon]], "The Counter-Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revolutionary France" ''Past and Present'' No. 159 (May 1998:77–112) p. 79 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; to be associated most closely with [[German Romanticism]]. An earlier definition comes from [[Charles Baudelaire]]: "Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth, but in the way of feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Salon_de_1846_%28Curiosit%C3%A9s_esth%C3%A9tiques%29#II._.E2.80.94_Qu.E2.80.99est-ce_que_le_romantisme.3F |title=Baudelaire's speech at the "Salon des curiosités Estethiques |language=fr |publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], which affected literature, especially the novel and drama, painting, and even music, through [[Verismo]] opera. This movement was led by France, with [[Balzac]] and [[Flaubert]] in literature and [[Courbet]] in painting; [[Stendhal]] and [[Goya]] were important precursors of Realism in their respective media. However, Romantic styles, now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled, continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond. In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as "Late Romantic"  and by others as "Neoromantic" or "Postromantic", but other fields do not usually use these terms; in English literature and painting the convenient term "Victorian" avoids having to characterise the period further.

In northern Europe, the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished, and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was. Elsewhere, including in very different ways the United States and Russia, feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible. Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent, as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics, but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced, often replaced with meticulous technique, as in the poems of [[Tennyson]] or many paintings.  If not realist, late 19th-century art was often extremely detailed, and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with. Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art, above all the pre-eminent importance of originality, remained important for later generations, and often underlie modern views, despite opposition from theorists.

In literature, Romanticism found recurrent themes in the evocation or criticism of the past, the cult of "[[sensibility]]" with its emphasis on women and children, the isolation of the artist or narrator, and respect for nature. Furthermore, several romantic authors, such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], based their writings on the [[supernatural]]/[[occult]] and human [[psychology]]. Romanticism tended to regard [[satire]] as something unworthy of serious attention, a prejudice still influential today.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, James (1958) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''English Satire''] p. 1. There were a few exceptions, notably Byron, who integrated satire into some of his greatest works, yet shared much in common with his Romantic contemporaries. Bloom, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The romantic movement in literature was preceded by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and succeeded by [[Literary realism|Realism]].

Some authors cite 16th century poet [[Isabella di Morra]] as an early precursor of Romantic literature. Her lyrics covering themes of isolation and loneliness, which reflected the tragic events of her life, are considered "an impressive prefigurement of Romanticism",&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Grendler, [[Renaissance Society of America]], ''Encyclopedia of the Renaissance'', [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]], 1999, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; differing from the [[Petrarch]]ist fashion of the time based on the [[philosophy of love]].

The precursors of Romanticism in English poetry go back to the middle of the 18th century, including figures such as [[Joseph Warton]] (headmaster at [[Winchester College]]) and his brother [[Thomas Warton]], [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="John Keats page 106"&gt;John Keats. By Sidney Colvin, p. 106. Elibron Classics&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph maintained that invention and imagination were the chief qualities of a poet. [[Thomas Chatterton]] is generally considered the first Romantic poet in English.&lt;ref name="Thomas Chatterton 1971, page 11"&gt;Thomas Chatterton, Grevel Lindop, 1972, Fyffield Books, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish poet [[James Macpherson]] influenced the early development of Romanticism with the international success of his [[Ossian]] cycle of poems published in 1762, inspiring both [[Goethe]] and the young [[Walter Scott]]. Both Chatterton and Macpherson's work involved elements of fraud, as what they claimed was earlier literature that they had discovered or compiled was, in fact, entirely their own work. The [[Gothic novel]], beginning with [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' (1764), was an important precursor of one strain of Romanticism, with a delight in horror and threat, and exotic picturesque settings, matched in Walpole's case by his role in the early [[Gothic Revival|revival of Gothic architecture]]. ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', a novel by [[Laurence Sterne]] (1759–67) introduced a whimsical version of the anti-rational [[sentimental novel]] to the English literary public.

An early German influence came from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], whose 1774 novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' had young men throughout Europe emulating its protagonist, a young artist with a very sensitive and passionate temperament. At that time Germany was a multitude of small separate states, and Goethe's works would have a seminal influence in developing a unifying sense of [[nationalism]].  Another philosophic influence came from the German idealism of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], making [[Jena]] (where Fichte lived, as well as Schelling, [[Hegel]], [[Schiller]] and the brothers [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]]) a center for early [[German Romanticism]] (see [[Jena Romanticism]]). Important writers were [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Novalis]] (''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]'', 1799), [[Heinrich von Kleist]] and [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]. [[Heidelberg]] later became a center of German Romanticism, where writers and poets such as [[Clemens Brentano]], [[Achim von Arnim]], and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]] (''[[Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts]]'') met regularly in literary circles.

Important motifs in German Romanticism are travelling, nature, for example the [[German Forest]], and [[Germanic mythology|Germanic myths]]. The later German Romanticism of, for example [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s ''[[Der Sandmann]]'' (''The Sandman''), 1817, and [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff]]'s ''Das Marmorbild'' (''The Marble Statue''), 1819, was darker in its motifs and has [[gothic novel|gothic]] elements.  The significance to Romanticism of childhood innocence, the importance of imagination, and racial theories all combined to give an unprecedented importance to [[folk literature]], non-classical [[mythology]] and [[children's literature]], above all in Germany.  Brentano and von Arnim were significant literary figures who together published ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' ("The Boy's Magic Horn" or [[cornucopia]]), a collection of versified folk tales, in 1806–08.  The first collection of ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' by the [[Brothers Grimm]] was published in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack |year=1988 |title=The Brothers Grimm: From Enchanted Forests to the Modern World |edition = 1st |publisher= Routledge |isbn=978-0415900812 |pages= 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the much later work of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], who was publishing his invented tales in Danish from 1835, these German works were at least mainly based on collected [[Folklore|folk tales]], and the Grimms remained true to the style of the telling in their early editions, though later rewriting some parts.  One of the brothers, [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]], published in 1835 ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'', a long academic work on Germanic mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zipes |first=Jack| year=2000 |title=The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales |publisher= Oxford University Press |pages=13–14,  218–19 |isbn=978-0198601159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strain is exemplified by Schiller's highly emotional language and the depiction of physical violence in his play ''[[The Robbers]]'' of 1781.

In [[English literature]], the key figures of the Romantic movement are considered to be the group of poets including [[William Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[John Keats]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and the much older [[William Blake]], followed later by the isolated figure of [[John Clare]]; also such novelists as [[Walter Scott]] from Scotland and [[Mary Shelley]], and the essayists [[William Hazlitt]] and [[Charles Lamb]]. The publication in 1798 of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'', with many of the finest poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge, is often held to mark the start of the movement.  The majority of the poems were by Wordsworth, and many dealt with the lives of the poor in his native [[Lake District]], or his feelings about nature—which he more fully developed in his long poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', never published in his lifetime.  The longest poem in the volume was Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', which showed the Gothic side of English Romanticism, and the exotic settings that many works featured. In the period when they were writing, the [[Lake Poets]] were widely regarded as a marginal group of radicals, though they were supported by the critic and writer [[William Hazlitt]] and others.
[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]], ''[[Chateaubriand]]'' in Rome, 1808]]

In contrast [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]] achieved enormous fame and influence throughout Europe with works exploiting the violence and drama of their exotic and historical settings; Goethe called Byron "undoubtedly the greatest genius of our century".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' in 1805, followed by the full [[epic poem]] ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past, already evoked in ''Ossian''; [[Romanticism in Scotland|Romanticism and Scotland]] were to have a long and fruitful partnership.  Byron had equal success with the first part of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' in 1812, followed by four "Turkish tales", all in the form of long poems, starting with ''[[The Giaour]]'' in 1813, drawing from his [[Grand Tour]], which had reached Ottoman Europe, and [[Orientalism|orientalizing]] the themes of the Gothic novel in verse.  These featured different variations of the "[[Byronic hero]]", and his own life contributed a further version. Scott meanwhile was effectively inventing the [[historical novel]], beginning in 1814 with ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', set in the [[1745 Jacobite rising]], which was an enormous and highly profitable success, followed by over 20 further [[Waverley Novels]] over the next 17 years, with settings going back to the [[Crusades]] that he had researched to a degree that was new in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 192–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Germany, Romanticism in English literature had little connection with nationalism, and the Romantics were often regarded with suspicion for the sympathy many felt for the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], whose collapse and replacement with the dictatorship of Napoleon was, as elsewhere in Europe, a shock to the movement. Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on [[Lake Geneva]] with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by Shelley's wife-to-be [[Mary Shelley]] and the [[novella]] ''[[The Vampyre]]'' by Byron's doctor [[John William Polidori]].  The lyrics of [[Robert Burns]] in Scotland and [[Thomas Moore]], from Ireland reflected in different ways their countries and the Romantic interest in folk literature, but neither had a fully Romantic approach to life or their work.

Though they have modern critical champions such as [[György Lukács]], Scott's novels are today more likely to be experienced in the form of the many operas that composers continued to base on them over the following decades, such as [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[I puritani]]'' (both 1835).  Byron is now most highly regarded for his short lyrics and his generally unromantic prose writings, especially his letters, and his unfinished [[satire]] ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 197–200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike many Romantics, Byron's widely publicised personal life appeared to match his work, and his death at 36 in 1824 from disease when helping the [[Greek War of Independence]] appeared from a distance to be a suitably Romantic end, entrenching his legend.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 213–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Keats in 1821 and Shelley in 1822 both died in Italy, Blake (at almost 70) in 1827, and Coleridge largely ceased to write in the 1820s.  Wordsworth was by 1820 respectable and highly regarded, holding a government [[sinecure]], but wrote relatively little.  In the discussion of English literature, the Romantic period is often regarded as finishing around the 1820s, or sometimes even earlier, although many authors of the succeeding decades were no less committed to Romantic values.

The most significant novelist in English during the peak Romantic period, other than Walter Scott, was [[Jane Austen]], whose essentially conservative world-view had little in common with her Romantic contemporaries, retaining a strong belief in decorum and social rules, though critics {{who|date=December 2015}} have detected tremors under the surface of some works, especially ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' (1817).&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt; But around the mid-century the undoubtedly Romantic novels of the [[Yorkshire]]-based [[Brontë family]] appeared.  Most notably [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte's]] ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Brontë|Emily's]] ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', both published in 1847, which also introduced more gothic themes. While these two novels were written and published after the Romantic period is said to have ended, their novels were heavily influenced by Romantic literature they'd read as children.

Byron, Keats and Shelley all wrote for the stage, but with little success in England, with Shelley's ''[[The Cenci]]'' perhaps the best work produced, though that was not played in a public theatre in England until a century after his death. Byron's plays, along with dramatizations of his poems and Scott's novels, were much more popular on the Continent, and especially in France, and through these versions several were turned into operas, many still performed today.  If contemporary poets had little success on the stage, the period was a legendary one for performances of [[Shakespeare]], and went some way to restoring his original texts and removing the Augustan "improvements" to them. The greatest actor of the period, [[Edmund Kean]], restored the tragic ending to ''[[King Lear]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Or at least he tried to; Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, and with regret, he reverted to [[Nahum Tate]]'s version with a comic ending, which had been standard since 1689. See [[Stanley Wells]], "Introduction" from ''King Lear'' Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleridge said that, "Seeing him act was like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge, Samuel Taylor]], ''Table Talk'', 27 April 1823 in {{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|last2=Morley|first2=Henry|title=Table Talk of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christobel, &amp;amp;c |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1884|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJIRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====

[[File:PG 1063Burns Naysmith.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Burns]] in [[Alexander Nasmyth]]'s portrait of 1787]]
Although after [[Acts of Union 1707|union with England]] in 1707 Scotland increasingly adopted English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0060558881}}, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Macpherson]] (1736–96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard [[Ossian]], he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Fingal'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0060558881}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also popularised in France by figures that included [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Gaskill, ''The Reception of Ossian in Europe'' (Continuum, 2004), {{ISBN|0826461352}}, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.&lt;ref&gt;D. Thomson, ''The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's "Ossian"'' (Aberdeen: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Burns]] (1759–96) and [[Walter Scott]] (1771–1832) were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) "[[Auld Lang Syne]]" is often sung at [[Hogmanay]] (the last day of the year), and "[[Scots Wha Hae]]" served for a long time as an unofficial [[national anthem]] of the country.&lt;ref&gt;L. McIlvanney, "Hugh Blair, Robert Burns, and the Invention of Scottish Literature", ''Eighteenth-Century Life'', vol. 29 (2), Spring 2005, pp. 25–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work, ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Whetter, ''Understanding Genre and Medieval Romance'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), {{ISBN|0754661423}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It launched a highly successful career, with other historical novels such as ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]'' (1817), ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]'' (1818) and ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' (1820). Scott probably did more than any other figure to define and popularise Scottish cultural identity in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;N. Davidson, ''The Origins of Scottish Nationhood'' (Pluto Press, 2008), {{ISBN|0745316085}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major literary figures connected with Romanticism include the poets and novelists [[James Hogg]] (1770–1835), [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] (1784–1842) and [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] (1779–1839).&lt;ref&gt;A. Maunder, ''FOF Companion to the British Short Story'' (Infobase Publishing, 2007), {{ISBN|0816074968}}, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant figures of the Romantic movement, [[Lord Byron]], was brought up in Scotland until he inherited his family's [[Baron Byron|English peerage]].&lt;ref&gt;P. MacKay, E. Longley and F. Brearton, ''Modern Irish and Scottish Poetry'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0521196027}}, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sir Henry Raeburn - Portrait of Sir Walter Scott.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Raeburn|Raeburn's]] portrait of [[Walter Scott]] in 1822]]  Scotland was also the location of two of the most important literary magazines of the era, ''[[The Edinburgh Review]]'' (founded in 1802) and ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' (founded in 1817), which had a major impact on the development of British literature and drama in the era of Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;A. Jarrels, "'Associations respect[ing] the past': Enlightenment and Romantic historicism", in [[Jon Paul Klancher|J. P. Klancher]], ''A Concise Companion to the Romantic Age'' (Oxford: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009), {{ISBN|0631233555}}, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Benchimol, ed., ''Intellectual Politics and Cultural Conflict in the Romantic Period: Scottish Whigs, English Radicals and the Making of the British Public Sphere'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0754664465}}, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Duncan and Alex Benchimol suggest that publications like the novels of Scott and these magazines were part of a highly dynamic Scottish Romanticism that by the early nineteenth century, caused Edinburgh to emerge as the cultural capital of Britain and become central to a wider formation of a "British Isles nationalism."&lt;ref&gt;A. Benchimol, ed., ''Intellectual Politics and Cultural Conflict in the Romantic Period: Scottish Whigs, English Radicals and the Making of the British Public Sphere'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), {{ISBN|0754664465}}, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish "national drama" emerged in the early 1800s, as plays with specifically Scottish themes began to dominate the Scottish stage. Theatres had been discouraged by the [[Church of Scotland]] and fears of Jacobite assemblies. In the later eighteenth century, many plays were written for and performed by small amateur companies and were not published and so most have been lost. Towards the end of the century there were "[[closet dramas]]", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and [[Joanna Baillie]] (1762–1851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and [[Gothic literature|Gothic]] Romanticism.&lt;ref name=Brown2007pp229-30&gt;I. Brown, ''The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and Empire (1707–1918)'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748624813}}, pp. 229–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Romanticism was relatively late in developing [[19th-century French literature#Romanticism|in French literature]], more so than in the visual arts. The 18th-century precursor to Romanticism, the cult of sensibility, had become associated with the [[Ancien regime]], and the French Revolution had been more of an inspiration to foreign writers than those experiencing it at first-hand. The first major figure was [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], a minor aristocrat who had remained a royalist throughout the Revolution, and returned to France from exile in England and America under Napoleon, with whose regime he had an uneasy relationship. His writings, all in prose, included some fiction, such as his influential [[novella]] of exile ''[[René (novella)|René]]'' (1802), which anticipated Byron in its alienated hero, but mostly contemporary history and politics, his travels, a defence of religion and the medieval spirit (''[[Génie du christianisme]]'' 1802), and finally in the 1830s and 1840s his enormous [[autobiography]] ''[[Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe]]'' ("Memoirs from beyond the grave").&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 202–03, 241–42.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jean-Jacques Grandville - Frenzied Romans at the First Performance of Hernani - WGA10359.jpg|thumb|The "battle of ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''" was fought nightly at the theatre in 1830]]
After the [[Bourbon Restoration]], French Romanticism developed in the lively world of [[Theatre of France#19th century|Parisian theatre]], with productions of [[Shakespeare]], Schiller (in France a key Romantic author), and adaptations of Scott and Byron alongside French authors, several of whom began to write in the late 1820s. Cliques of pro- and anti-Romantics developed, and productions were often accompanied by raucous vocalizing by the two sides, including the shouted assertion by one theatregoer in 1822 that "Shakespeare, c'est l'aide-de-camp de Wellington" ("Shakespeare is [[Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] [[aide-de-camp]]").&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 239–46, 240 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre Dumas]] began as a dramatist, with a series of successes beginning with ''Henri III et sa cour'' (1829) before turning to novels that were mostly historical adventures somewhat in the manner of Scott, most famously ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', both of 1844. [[Victor Hugo]] published as a poet in the 1820s before achieving success on the stage with ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]''—a historical drama in a quasi-Shakespearian style that had famously riotous performances on its first run in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 244–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Dumas, Hugo is best known for his novels, and was already writing ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831), one of the best known works, which became a paradigm of the French Romantic movement. The preface to his unperformed play "Cromwell" gives an important manifesto of French Romanticism, stating that "there are no rules, or models". The career of [[Prosper Mérimée]] followed a similar pattern; he is now best known as the originator of the story of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', with his novella published 1845. [[Alfred de Vigny]] remains best known as a dramatist, with his play on the life of the English poet ''Chatterton'' (1835) perhaps his best work. [[George Sand]] was a central figure of the Parisian literary scene, famous both for her novels and criticism and her affairs with [[Chopin]] and several others;&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen&lt;/ref&gt; she too was inspired by the theatre, and wrote works to be staged at her [[House of George Sand|private estate]].

French Romantic poets of the 1830s to 1850s include [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and the flamboyant [[Théophile Gautier]], whose prolific output in various forms continued until his death in 1872.

[[Stendhal]] is today probably the most highly regarded French novelist of the period, but he stands in a complex relation with Romanticism, and is notable for his penetrating psychological insight into his characters and his realism, qualities rarely prominent in Romantic fiction. As a survivor of the French [[retreat from Moscow]] in 1812, fantasies of heroism and adventure had little appeal for him, and like Goya he is often seen as a forerunner of Realism. His most important works are ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', 1830) and ''La Chartreuse de Parme'' (''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', 1839).

{{Main|Romanticism in Poland}}
[[Romanticism in Poland]] is often taken to begin with the publication of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s first poems in 1822, and end with the crushing of the [[January Uprising]] of 1863 against the Russians. It was strongly marked by interest in Polish history.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Dyczewski, ''Values in the Polish cultural tradition'' (2002) p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Polish Romanticism revived the old "Sarmatism" traditions of the ''[[szlachta]]'' or Polish nobility. Old traditions and customs were revived and portrayed in a positive light in the Polish messianic movement and in works of great Polish poets such as Adam Mickiewicz (''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''), [[Juliusz Słowacki]] and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]], as well as prose writers such as [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of the literature of [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] period, differentiating it from that of other countries. They had not suffered the loss of national statehood as was the case with Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760–1850'' (2004) vol. 2. p. 742&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the general spirit and main ideas of European Romanticism, the literature of Polish Romanticism is unique, as many scholars have pointed out, in having developed largely outside of Poland and in its emphatic focus upon the issue of Polish [[nationalism]]. The Polish intelligentsia, along with leading members of its government, left Poland in the early 1830s, during what is referred to as the "[[Great Emigration]]", resettling in France, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, and the United States.
[[File:Juliusz Słowacki 1.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Juliusz Słowacki]], a Polish poet considered one of the [[Three Bards|"Three National Bards" of Polish literature]]—a major figure in the Polish Romantic period, and the father of modern Polish drama.]]
Their art featured [[wikt:emotionalism|emotionalism]] and [[Irrationalism and Aestheticism|irrationality]], fantasy and imagination, personality cults, [[folklore]] and country life, and the propagation of ideals of freedom. In the second period, many of the [[Polish Romantics]] worked abroad, often banished from Poland by the occupying powers due to their politically subversive ideas. Their work became increasingly dominated by the ideals of political struggle for freedom and their country's [[sovereignty]]. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. There developed the idea of the ''[[Three Bards|poeta wieszcz]]'' (the prophet). The ''[[wieszcz]]'' (bard) functioned as spiritual leader to the nation fighting for its independence. The most notable poet so recognized was [[Adam Mickiewicz]].

[[Zygmunt Krasiński|Zygmunt Krasinski]] also wrote to inspire political and religious hope in his countrymen. Unlike his predecessors, who called for victory at whatever price in Poland's struggle against Russia, Krasinski emphasized Poland's [[Spirituality|spiritual]] role in its fight for independence, advocating an intellectual rather than a military superiority. His works best exemplify the [[Messianism|Messianic movement in Poland]]: in two early dramas, ''Nie-boska komedyia''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nie-Boska komedia|url = https://pl.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nie-Boska_komedia&amp;oldid=41481531|language = pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1835; ''The Undivine Comedy)'' and ''[[Irydion]]'' (1836; ''Iridion)'', as well as in the later ''Psalmy przyszłości'' (1845), he asserted that Poland was the [[Christ of Europe]]: specifically chosen by God to carry the world's burdens, to suffer, and eventually be resurrected.

=== Russia ===
Early Russian Romanticism is associated with the writers [[Konstantin Batyushkov]] (''A Vision on the Shores of the Lethe'', 1809), [[Vasily Zhukovsky]] (''The Bard'', 1811; ''Svetlana'', 1813) and [[Nikolay Karamzin]] (''Poor Liza'', 1792; ''Julia'', 1796; ''Martha the Mayoress'', 1802; ''The Sensitive and the Cold'', 1803). However the principal exponent of Romanticism in Russia is [[Alexander Pushkin]] (''[[The Prisoner of the Caucasus (poem)|The Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', 1820–1821; ''The Robber Brothers'', 1822; ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', 1820; ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', 1825–1832). Pushkin's work influenced many writers in the 19th century and led to his eventual recognition as Russia's greatest poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/dostoevsky/texts/devil_pushkinbio.html|title=Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799–1837) |publisher=University of Virginia Slavic Department|accessdate=1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Russian Romantic poets include [[Mikhail Lermontov]] (''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'', 1839), [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] (''Silentium!'', 1830), [[Yevgeny Baratynsky]] (''Eda'', 1826), [[Anton Delvig]], and [[Wilhelm Küchelbecker]].

Influenced heavily by Lord Byron, Lermontov sought to explore the Romantic emphasis on metaphysical discontent with society and self, while Tyutchev's poems often described scenes of nature or passions of love. Tyutchev commonly operated with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, and the still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Baratynsky's style was fairly classical in nature, dwelling on the models of the previous century.

[[Romanticism in Spanish literature]] developed a well-known literature with a huge variety of poets and playwrights. The most important Spanish poet during this movement was [[José de Espronceda]]. After him there were other poets like [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]], [[Mariano José de Larra]] and the dramatists [[Ángel de Saavedra]] and [[José Zorrilla]], author of ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''. Before them may be mentioned the pre-romantics [[José Cadalso]] and [[Manuel José Quintana]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip W. Silver, ''Ruin and restitution: reinterpreting romanticism in Spain'' (1997) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  The plays of [[Antonio García Gutiérrez]] were adapted to produce Giuseppe Verdi's operas ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. Spanish Romanticism also influenced regional literatures. For example, in [[Catalonia]] and in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] there was a national boom of writers in the local languages, like the Catalan [[Jacint Verdaguer]] and the Galician [[Rosalía de Castro]], the main figures of the [[Romantic nationalism|national revivalist]] movements [[Renaixença]] and [[Rexurdimento]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Brenan, ''The literature of the Spanish people: from Roman times to the present'' (1965) p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

There are scholars who consider Spanish Romanticism to be Proto-Existentialism because it is more anguished than the movement in other European countries. Foster et al., for example, say that the work of Spain's writers such as Espronceda, Larra, and other writers in the 19th century demonstrated a "metaphysical crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spanish Literature : Current debates on Hispanism|last=Foster|first=David|last2=Altamiranda|first2=Daniel|last3=de Urioste|first3=Carmen|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|year=2001|isbn=978-0815335634|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observers put more weight on the link between the 19th-century Spanish writers with the existentialist movement that emerged immediately after. According to Richard Caldwell, the writers that we now identify with Spain's romanticism were actually precursors to those who galvanized the literary movement that emerged in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Richard|date=1970|title=The Persistence of Romantic Thought in Spain|url=|journal=Modern Language Review|volume=65|pages=803–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion is the subject of debate for there are authors who stress that Spain's romanticism is one of the earliest in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El primer romantico 'europeo' de España|last=Sebold|first=Russell|publisher=Editorial Gredos|year=1974|isbn=978-8424905910|location=Madrid|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some assert that Spain really had no period of literary romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Donald|date=1963|title=Towards an Understanding of Spanish Romanticism|url=|journal=Modern Language Review|volume=58|pages=190–95|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy underscores a certain uniqueness to Spanish romanticism in comparison to its European counterparts.

===Portugal===
[[File:Almeida Garrett - litografia sobre papel.png|thumb|upright|Portuguese poet, novelist, politician and playwright [[Almeida Garrett]] (1799–1854)]]
Romanticism began in [[Portugal]] with the publication of the poem ''Camões'' (1825), by [[Almeida Garrett]], who was raised by his uncle D. Alexandre, bishop of [[Angra do Heroísmo|Angra]], in the precepts of [[Neoclassicism]], which can be observed in his early work. The author himself confesses (in ''Camões''' preface) that he voluntarily refused to follow the principles of epic poetry enunciated by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], as he did the same to [[Horace]]'s [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|''Ars Poetica'']]. Almeida Garrett had participated in the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|1820 Liberal Revolution]], which caused him to exile himself in England in 1823 and then in France, after the [[Vilafrancada|Vila-Francada]]. While living in Great Britain, he had contacts with the Romantic movement and read authors such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Scott, Ossian, Byron, Hugo, Lamartine and de Staël, at the same time visiting feudal castles and ruins of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches and abbeys, which would be reflected in his writings. In 1838, he presented ''Um Auto de Gil Vicente'' ("A Play by [[Gil Vicente]]"), in an attempt to create a new national theatre, free of Greco-Roman and foreign influence. But his masterpiece would be ''Frei Luís de Sousa'' (1843), named by himself as a "Romantic drama" and it was acclaimed as an exceptional work, dealing with themes as national independence, faith, justice and love. He was also deeply interested in Portuguese folkloric verse, which resulted in the publication of ''Romanceiro'' ("Traditional Portuguese Ballads") (1843), that recollect a great number of ancient popular ballads, known as "romances" or "rimances", in ''redondilha maior'' verse form, that contained stories of [[chivalry]], life of [[saint]]s, [[crusades]], [[courtly love]], etc. He wrote the novels ''Viagens na Minha Terra'', ''O Arco de Sant'Ana'' and ''Helena.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Obras Completas de Almeida Garrett – 2 Volumes|last=Almeida Garrett|first=João Baptista|publisher=Lello Editores|year=1990|isbn=978-9724801926|location=Porto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$almeida-garrett|title=Artigo de apoio Infopédia – Almeida Garrett|last=Infopédia|website=Infopédia – Dicionários Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="José"&gt;{{Cite book|title=História da literatura portuguesa|last=José.|first=Saraiva, António|date=1996|publisher=Porto Editora|others=Lopes, Oscar|isbn=978-9720301703|edition= 17a|location=[Porto, Portugal]|oclc=35124986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandre Herculano]] is, alongside Almeida Garrett, one of the founders of Portuguese Romanticism. He too was forced to exile to Great Britain and France because of his [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideals. All of his poetry and prose are (unlike Almeida Garrett's) entirely Romantic, rejecting [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman myth]] and history.&lt;ref&gt;file:///C:/Users/Utilizador/Downloads/portoeditora_herculano_aharpacrente.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He sought inspiration in medieval Portuguese poems and [[chronicle]]s as in the [[Bible]]. His output is vast and covers many different genres, such as historical essays, poetry, novels, opuscules and theatre, where he brings back a whole world of Portuguese legends, tradition and history, especially in ''Eurico, o Presbítero'' ("Eurico, the Priest") and ''Lendas e Narrativas'' ("Legends and Narratives"). His work was influenced by Chateaubriand, Schiller, [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]], Walter Scott and the Old Testament [[Psalms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infopedia.pt/$alexandre-herculano|title=Artigo de apoio Infopédia – Alexandre Herculano|last=Infopédia|website=Infopédia – Dicionários Porto Editora|language=pt-PT|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[António Feliciano de Castilho]] made the case for [[Ultra-Romanticism]], publishing the poems ''A Noite no Castelo'' ("Night in the Castle") and ''Os Ciúmes do Bardo'' ("The Jealousy of the Bard"), both in 1836, and the drama ''Camões''. He became an unquestionable master for successive Ultra-Romantic generations, whose influence would not be challenged until the famous Coimbra Question. He also created polemics by translating [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' without knowing German, but using French versions of the play. Other notable figures of Portuguese Romanticism are the famous novelists [[Camilo Castelo Branco]] and [[Júlio Dinis]], and [[António Augusto Soares de Passos|Soares de Passos]], Bulhão Pato and Pinheiro Chagas.&lt;ref name="José"/&gt;

Romantic style would be revived in the beginning of the 20th century, notably through the works of poets linked to the Portuguese Renaissance (Renascença Portuguesa), such as [[Teixeira de Pascoaes|Teixeira de Pascoais]], [[Jaime Cortesão]], Mário Beirão, among others, who can be considered Neo-Romantics. An early Portuguese expression of Romanticism is found already in poets such as [[Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage]] (especially in his sonnets dated at the end of the 18th century) and [[Leonor de Almeida Portugal, 4th Marquise of Alorna|Leonor de Almeida Portugal, Marquise of Alorna]].&lt;ref name="José"/&gt;

Romanticism in Italian literature was a minor movement, yet still important; it began officially in 1816 when [[Germaine de Staël]] wrote an article in the journal ''Biblioteca italiana'' called "Sulla maniera e l'utilità delle traduzioni", inviting Italian people to reject [[Neoclassicism]] and to study new authors from other countries. Before that date, [[Ugo Foscolo]] had already published poems anticipating Romantic themes. The most important Romantic writers were [[Ludovico di Breme]], Pietro Borsieri and [[Giovanni Berchet]]. Better known authors such as [[Alessandro Manzoni]] and [[Giacomo Leopardi]] were influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as well as by Romanticism and Classicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La nuova enciclopedia della letteratura|publisher=Garzanti|location=Milan|year=1985|page=829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish-speaking South American Romanticism was influenced heavily by [[Esteban Echeverría]], who wrote in the 1830 and 1840s. His writings were influenced by his hatred for the Argentine dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], and filled with themes of blood and terror, using the metaphor of a slaughterhouse to portray the violence of Rosas' dictatorship.

Brazilian Romanticism is characterized and divided in three different periods. The first one is basically focused on the creation of a sense of national identity, using the ideal of the heroic Indian. Some examples include [[José de Alencar]], who wrote ''[[Iracema]]'' and ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'', and [[Gonçalves Dias]], renowned by the poem "[[Canção do exílio]]" (Song of the Exile). The second period, sometimes called [[Ultra-Romanticism]], is marked by a profound influence of European themes and traditions, involving the melancholy, sadness and despair related to unobtainable love. Goethe and Lord Byron are commonly quoted in these works. Some of the most notable authors of this phase are [[Álvares de Azevedo]], [[Casimiro de Abreu]], [[Fagundes Varela]] and [[Junqueira Freire]]. The third cycle is marked by social poetry, especially the abolitionist movement, and it includes [[Castro Alves]], [[Tobias Barreto]] and [[Pedro Luís Pereira de Sousa]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberto González Echevarría and Enrique Pupo-Walker, ''The Cambridge History of Latin American Literature: Brazilian Literature'' (1996) vol. 2 p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

[[File:Cole Thomas The Course of Empire The Savage State 1836.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Cole]], ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]: The Savage State'' (1 of 5), 1836]]
In the United States, at least by 1818 with William Cullen Bryant's "[[To a Waterfowl]]", Romantic poetry was being published. American Romantic [[Gothic literature]] made an early appearance with [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820) and ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1819), followed from 1823 onwards by the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'' of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], with their emphasis on heroic simplicity and their fervent landscape descriptions of an already-exotic mythicized frontier peopled by "[[noble savage]]s", similar to the philosophical theory of [[Rousseau]], exemplified by [[Uncas]], from ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. There are picturesque "local color" elements in Washington Irving's essays and especially his travel books. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s tales of the macabre and his balladic poetry were more influential in France than at home, but the romantic American novel developed fully with the atmosphere and [[melodrama]] of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850). Later [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] writers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] still show elements of its influence and imagination, as does the [[romantic realism]] of [[Walt Whitman]]. The poetry of [[Emily Dickinson]]—nearly unread in her own time—and [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' can be taken as epitomes of American Romantic literature. By the 1880s, however, psychological and [[social realism]] were competing with Romanticism in the novel.

====Influence of European Romanticism on American writers====
The European Romantic movement reached America in the early 19th century. American Romanticism was just as multifaceted and individualistic as it was in Europe. Like the Europeans, the American Romantics demonstrated a high level of moral enthusiasm, commitment to individualism and the unfolding of the self, an emphasis on intuitive perception, and the assumption that the natural world was inherently good, while human society was filled with corruption.&lt;ref name="George L 1997 p 613"&gt;George L. McMichael and Frederick C. Crews, eds. ''Anthology of American Literature: Colonial through romantic'' (6th ed. 1997) p. 613&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanticism became popular in American politics, philosophy and art. The movement appealed to the revolutionary spirit of America as well as to those longing to break free of the strict religious traditions of early settlement. The Romantics rejected rationalism and religious intellect. It appealed to those in opposition of Calvinism, which includes the belief that the destiny of each individual is preordained. The Romantic movement gave rise to [[New England]] [[Transcendentalism]], which portrayed a less restrictive relationship between God and Universe. The new philosophy presented the individual with a more personal relationship with God. Transcendentalism and Romanticism appealed to Americans in a similar fashion, for both privileged feeling over reason, individual freedom of expression over the restraints of tradition and custom. It often involved a rapturous response to nature. It encouraged the rejection of harsh, rigid Calvinism, and promised a new blossoming of American culture.&lt;ref name="George L 1997 p 613"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Romanticism, American", in ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'' ed by Ann Lee Morgan (Oxford University Press, 2007) [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t238.e1140 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

American Romanticism embraced the individual and rebelled against the confinement of neoclassicism and religious tradition. The Romantic movement in America created a new literary genre that continues to influence American writers. Novels, short stories, and poems replaced the sermons and manifestos of yore. Romantic literature was personal, intense, and portrayed more emotion than ever seen in neoclassical literature. America's preoccupation with freedom became a great source of motivation for Romantic writers as many were delighted in free expression and emotion without so much fear of ridicule and controversy. They also put more effort into the psychological development of their characters, and the main characters typically displayed extremes of sensitivity and excitement.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship of the American poet Wallace Stevens to Romanticism is raised in the poem "[[Another Weeping Woman]]" and its commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Visual arts==
{{See also|Gothic Revival architecture}}
[[File:The Bard (1774).jpeg|thumb|largethumb|[[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]], ''The Bard'', 1774, a prophetic combination of Romanticism and nationalism by the Welsh artist]]

In the visual arts, Romanticism first showed itself in [[landscape painting]], where from as early as the 1760s British artists began to turn to wilder landscapes and storms, and [[Gothic architecture]], even if they had to make do with [[Welsh art|Wales as a setting]]. [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] were born less than a year apart in 1774 and 1775 respectively and were to take German and English landscape painting to their extremes of Romanticism, but both their artistic sensibilities were formed when forms of Romanticism was already strongly present in art. [[John Constable]], born in 1776, stayed closer to the English landscape tradition, but in his largest "six-footers" insisted on the heroic status of a patch of the working countryside where he had grown up—challenging the traditional [[hierarchy of genres]], which relegated landscape painting to a low status. Turner also painted very large landscapes, and above all, seascapes. Some of these large paintings had contemporary settings and [[staffage]], but others had small figures that turned the work into [[history painting]] in the manner of [[Claude Lorrain]], like [[Salvator Rosa]] a [[late Baroque]] artist whose landscapes had elements that Romantic painters repeatedly turned to.  Friedrich often used single figures, or features like crosses, set alone amidst a huge landscape, "making them images of the transitoriness of human life and the premonition of death."&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 96–101, 99 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups of artists expressed feelings that verged on the mystical, many largely abandoning classical drawing and proportions.  These included [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]] and the other members of [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] in England, and in Germany [[Philipp Otto Runge]]. Like Friedrich, none of these artists had significant influence after their deaths for the rest of the 19th century, and were 20th century rediscoveries from obscurity, though Blake was always known as a poet, and Norway's leading painter [[Johan Christian Dahl]] was heavily influenced by Friedrich. The Rome-based [[Nazarene movement]] of German artists, active from 1810, took a very different path, concentrating on medievalizing history paintings with religious and nationalist themes.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 112–21&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', 1800–02]]

The arrival of Romanticism in French art was delayed by the strong hold of [[Neoclassicism]] on the academies, but from the [[Napoleonic]] period it became increasingly popular, initially in the form of history paintings propagandising for the new regime, of which [[Girodet]]'s ''[[Ossian]] receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', for Napoleon's [[Château de Malmaison]], was one of the earliest.  Girodet's old teacher [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] was puzzled and disappointed by his pupil's direction, saying: "Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 184–190, 187 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  A new generation of the French school,&lt;ref&gt;Walter Friedlaender, ''From David to Delacroix'', 1974, remains the best available account of the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; developed personal Romantic styles, though still concentrating on history painting with a political message. [[Théodore Géricault]] (1791–1824) had his first success with ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'', a heroic military figure derived from [[Rubens]], at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1812 in the years of the Empire, but his next major completed work, ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' of 1821, remains the greatest achievement of the Romantic history painting, which in its day had a powerful anti-government message.

[[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863) made his first Salon hits with ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' (1822), ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' (1827). The second was a scene from the Greek War of Independence, completed the year Byron died there, and the last was a scene from one of Byron's plays. With Shakespeare, Byron was to provide the subject matter for many other works of Delacroix, who also spent long periods in North Africa, painting colourful scenes of mounted Arab warriors. His ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830) remains, with the ''Medusa'', one of the best-known works of French Romantic painting. Both reflected current events, and increasingly "[[history painting]]", literally "story painting", a phrase dating back to the Italian Renaissance meaning the painting of subjects with groups of figures, long considered the highest and most difficult form of art, did indeed become the painting of historical scenes, rather than those from religion or mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/roma/hd_roma.htm|title=Romanticism|website=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Goya]] was called "the last great painter in whose art thought and observation were balanced and combined to form a faultless unity".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 142&lt;/ref&gt;  But the extent to which he was a Romantic is a complex question. In Spain, there was still a struggle to introduce the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in which Goya saw himself as a participant.  The demonic and anti-rational monsters thrown up by his imagination are only superficially similar to those of the Gothic fantasies of northern Europe, and in many ways he remained wedded to the classicism and realism of his training, as well as looking forward to the Realism of the later 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 133–42&lt;/ref&gt; But he, more than any other artist of the period, exemplified the Romantic values of the expression of the artist's feelings and his personal imaginative world.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 279–80&lt;/ref&gt;  He also shared with many of the Romantic painters a more free handling of paint, emphasized in the new prominence of the brushstroke and [[impasto]], which tended to be repressed in neoclassicism under a self-effacing finish.
[[File:Cavalier gaulois pont d'iena RG am face.jpg|thumb|''Cavalier gaulois'' by [[Antoine-Augustin Préault]], [[Pont d'Iéna]], Paris]]

[[Sculpture]] remained largely impervious to Romanticism, probably partly for technical reasons, as the most prestigious material of the day, marble, does not lend itself to expansive gestures. The leading sculptors in Europe, [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], were both based in Rome and firm Neoclassicists, not at all tempted to allow influence from medieval sculpture, which would have been one possible approach to Romantic sculpture. When it did develop, true Romantic sculpture—with the exception of a few artists such as [[Rudolf Maison]]—&lt;ref&gt;McKay, James, ''The Dictionary of Sculptors in Bronze'', Antique Collectors Club, London, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; rather oddly was missing in Germany, and mainly found in France, with [[François Rude]], best known from his group of the 1830s from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in Paris, [[David d'Angers]], and [[Auguste Préault]]. Préault's plaster relief entitled ''Slaughter'', which represented the horrors of wars with exacerbated passion, caused so much scandal at the 1834 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] that Préault was banned from this official annual exhibition for nearly twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 397, 379–84&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the most important Romantic sculptor was [[Lorenzo Bartolini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dizionario di arte e letteratura|publisher=Zanichelli|location=Bologna|year=2002|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, historical painting on idealized medieval and Renaissance themes is known as the [[Troubadour style|''style Troubadour'']], a term with no equivalent for other countries, though the same trends occurred there. Delacroix, [[Ingres]] and [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] all worked in this style, as did lesser specialists such as [[Pierre-Henri Révoil]] (1776–1842) and [[Fleury-François Richard]] (1777–1852). Their pictures are often small, and feature intimate private and anecdotal moments, as well as those of high drama. The lives of great artists such as [[Raphael]] were commemorated on equal terms with those of rulers, and fictional characters were also depicted. Fleury-Richard's ''Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband'', shown in the [[Paris Salon]] of 1802, marked the arrival of the style, which lasted until the mid-century, before being subsumed into the increasingly academic history painting of artists like [[Paul Delaroche]].&lt;ref&gt;Noon, throughout, especially pp. 124–155&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hayez, Fracesco - Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem - 1836-50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Francesco Hayez]], ''Crusaders Thirsting near Jerusalem'']]

Another trend was for very large apocalyptic history paintings, often combining extreme natural events, or divine wrath, with human disaster, attempting to outdo ''The Raft of the Medusa'', and now often drawing comparisons with effects from Hollywood. The leading English artist in the style was [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and worked his way through the biblical disasters, and those to come in the [[Christian eschatology|final days]]. Other works such as Delacroix's ''[[Death of Sardanapalus]]'' included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially [[Poussin]] and [[Rubens]], with extra emotionalism and special effects.

Elsewhere in Europe, leading artists adopted Romantic styles: in Russia there were the portraitists [[Orest Kiprensky]] and [[Vasily Tropinin]], with [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] specializing in [[marine painting]], and in Norway [[Hans Gude]] painted scenes of [[fjord]]s. In Italy [[Francesco Hayez]] (1791–1882) was the leading artist of Romanticism in mid-19th-century [[Milan]].  His long, prolific and extremely successful career saw him begin as a Neoclassical painter, pass right through the Romantic period, and emerge at the other end as a sentimental painter of young women. His Romantic period included many historical pieces of "Troubadour" tendencies, but on a very large scale, that are heavily influenced by [[Gian Battista Tiepolo]] and other [[late Baroque]] Italian masters.

Literary Romanticism had its counterpart in the American visual arts, most especially in the exaltation of an untamed American [[Landscape art|landscape]] found in the paintings of the [[Hudson River School]]. Painters like [[Thomas Cole]], [[Albert Bierstadt]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church]] and others often expressed Romantic themes in their paintings. They sometimes depicted ancient ruins of the old world, such as in Fredric Edwin Church's piece ''Sunrise in Syria''. These works reflected the Gothic feelings of death and decay. They also show the Romantic ideal that Nature is powerful and will eventually overcome the transient creations of men. More often, they worked to distinguish themselves from their European counterparts by depicting uniquely American scenes and landscapes. This idea of an American identity in the art world is reflected in [[W. C. Bryant]]'s poem, ''To Cole, the Painter, Departing for Europe'', where Bryant encourages Cole to remember the powerful scenes that can only be found in America.

Some American paintings (such as Albert Bierstadt's ''[[The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak]]'') promote the literary idea of the "[[noble savage]]" by portraying idealized Native Americans living in harmony with the natural world. Thomas Cole's paintings tend towards [[allegory]], explicit in ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' series painted in the early 1840s, showing the stages of life set amidst an awesome and immense nature.

Musical Romanticism is predominantly a German phenomenon—so much so that one respected French reference work defines it entirely in terms of "The role of music in the aesthetics of German romanticism".&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 1961, 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Another French encyclopedia holds that the German temperament generally "can be described as the deep and diverse action of romanticism on German musicians", and that there is only one true representative of Romanticism in French music, [[Hector Berlioz]], while in Italy, the sole great name of musical Romanticism is [[Giuseppe Verdi]], "a sort of [Victor] Hugo of opera, gifted with a real genius for dramatic effect". Nevertheless, the huge popularity of German Romantic music led, "whether by imitation or by reaction", to an often nationalistically inspired vogue amongst Polish, Hungarian, Russian, Czech, and Scandinavian musicians, successful "perhaps more because of its extra-musical traits than for the actual value of musical works by its masters".&lt;ref&gt;Ferchault 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term "Romanticism" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of "romantic" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation. Indeed, one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789, in the ''Mémoires'' of [[André Grétry]].&lt;ref&gt;Grétre 1789.&lt;/ref&gt; This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans, but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (himself a composer, amongst other things) and, by so doing, establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally.&lt;ref name="Samson 2001"&gt;Samson 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810 [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] named [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as "the three masters of instrumental compositions" who "breathe one and the same romantic spirit". He justified his view on the basis of these composers' depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality. In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, "a child-like, serene disposition prevails", while Mozart (in the late [[Symphony No. 39 (Mozart)|E-flat major Symphony]], for example) "leads us into the depths of the spiritual world", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, "a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of "the monstrous and immeasurable", with the pain of an endless longing that "will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann 1810, col. 632.&lt;/ref&gt; This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder|Wackenroder]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and later by writers such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 1961, 585–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

This chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century, when [[Richard Wagner]] denigrated the music of [[Meyerbeer]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] as "[[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]]": "The Opera, to which we shall now return, has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz, too, as a plump, fine-flavoured oyster, whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well-to-do appearance."&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1995, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of ''Musikwissenschaft'' ([[musicology]])—itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age—attempted a more scientific [[periodization]] of music history, and a distinction between [[Classical period (music)|Viennese Classical]] and Romantic periods was proposed. The key figure in this trend was [[Guido Adler]], who viewed Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]] as transitional but essentially Classical composers, with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post-Beethoven generation of [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Robert Schumann]], Berlioz, and [[Franz Liszt]]. From Adler's viewpoint, found in books like ''Der Stil in der Musik'' (1911), composers of the [[New German School]] and various late-19th-century [[Musical nationalism|nationalist]] composers were not Romantics but "moderns" or "realists" (by analogy with the fields of painting and literature), and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Samson 2001"/&gt;

By the second quarter of the 20th century, an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint, and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past. This in turn led historians such as [[Alfred Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;Einstein 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; to extend the musical "[[Romantic music|Romantic Era]]" throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th. It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]''&lt;ref&gt;Warrack 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Jay Grout|Grout's]] ''History of Western Music''&lt;ref&gt;Grout 1960, 492.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not unchallenged. For example, the prominent German musicologist [[Friedrich Blume]], the chief editor of the first edition of ''[[Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'' (1949–86), accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century, but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century, including such pre–World War II developments as [[Expressionist music|expressionism]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blume 1970; Samson 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''&lt;ref name="Samson 2001"/&gt; and the new edition of ''[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wehnert 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the contemporary music culture, the romantic musician followed a public career depending on sensitive middle-class audiences rather than on a courtly patron, as had been the case with earlier musicians and composers. Public persona characterized a new generation of virtuosi who made their way as soloists, epitomized in the concert tours of [[Paganini]] and [[Liszt]], and the conductor began to emerge as an important figure, on whose skill the interpretation of the increasingly complex music depended.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, 176–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sciences===
{{Main|Romanticism in science}}
The Romantic movement affected most aspects of intellectual life, and [[Romanticism in science|Romanticism and science]] had a powerful connection, especially in the period 1800–40. Many scientists were influenced by versions of the ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and others, and without abandoning [[empiricism]], sought in their work to uncover what they tended to believe was a unified and organic Nature. The English scientist Sir [[Humphry Davy]], a prominent Romantic thinker, said that understanding nature required "an attitude of admiration, love and worship, [...] a personal response."&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that knowledge was only attainable by those who truly appreciated and respected nature.  Self-understanding was an important aspect of Romanticism.  It had less to do with proving that man was capable of understanding nature (through his budding intellect) and therefore controlling it, and more to do with the emotional appeal of connecting himself with nature and understanding it through a harmonious co-existence.&lt;ref&gt;Bossi, M., and Poggi, S., ed. ''Romanticism in Science: Science in Europe, 1790–1840'', p.xiv; Cunningham, A., and Jardine, N., ed. ''Romanticism and the Sciences'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historiography===
[[Historiography|History writing]] was very strongly, and many would say harmfully, influenced by Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Sreedharan|title=A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJVoi3PIejwC&amp;pg=PR9|year=2004|publisher=Orient Blackswan|pages=128–68|isbn=978-8125026570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In England [[Thomas Carlyle]] was a highly influential essayist who turned historian; he both invented and exemplified the phrase "hero-worship",&lt;ref&gt;in his published lectures ''[[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History]]'' of 1841&lt;/ref&gt; lavishing largely uncritical praise on strong leaders such as [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Frederick the Great]] and Napoleon.  Romantic nationalism had a largely negative effect on the writing of history in the 19th century, as each nation tended to [[Historiography and nationalism|produce its own version of history]], and the critical attitude, even cynicism, of earlier historians was often replaced by a tendency to create romantic stories with clearly distinguished heroes and villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ceri Crossley|title=French Historians and Romanticism: Thierry, Guizot, the Saint-Simonians, Quinet, Michelet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovaIAgAAQBAJ|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134976683}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Nationalist ideology of the period placed great emphasis on racial coherence, and the antiquity of peoples, and tended to vastly over-emphasize the continuity between past periods and the present, leading to [[national mysticism]].  Much historical effort in the 20th century was devoted to combating the romantic historical myths created in the 19th century.

===Theology===
To insulate theology from [[reductionism]] in science, 19th-century post-Enlightenment German theologians moved in a new direction, led by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Albrecht Ritschl]]. They took the Romantic approach of rooting religion in the inner world of the human spirit, so that it is a person's feeling or sensibility about spiritual matters that comprises religion.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Clayton and Zachary Simpson, eds. ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science'' (2006) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chess===

{{main| Romantic chess}}

[[Romantic chess]] was the style of [[chess]] which emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.&lt;ref name="Shenk, 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Shenk |title=The Immortal Game: A History of Chess |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWf71WaEnLgC&amp;pg=PT99 |year=2007 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=99|isbn=978-0307387660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic era in chess is generally considered to have begun with Joseph MacDonnell and Pierre LaBourdonnais, the two dominant chess players in the 1830s. The 1840s was dominated by Howard Staunton, and other leading players of the era included Adolf Anderssen, Daniel Harrwitz, Henry Bird, Louis Paulsen, and Paul Morphy. The "[[Immortal Game]]", played by [[Adolf Anderssen]] and [[Lionel Kieseritzky]] on [[21 June]] 1851 in London—where Anderssen made bold [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]] to secure victory, giving up both [[rook (chess)|rooks]] and a bishop, then his [[queen (chess)|queen]], and then [[checkmate|checkmating]] his opponent with his three remaining [[minor piece]]s—is considered a supreme example of Romantic chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Teach Yourself Chess |author=[[William Hartston|Hartston, Bill]] |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |isbn=978-0340670392 |year=1996 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the Romantic era in chess is considered to be the [[Vienna 1873 chess tournament|1873 Vienna Tournament]] where [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] popularized positional play and the closed game.

==Romantic nationalism==

[[File:Fra Hardanger Gude.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Hans Gude]], ''Fra Hardanger'', 1847. Example of [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]].]]
One of Romanticism's key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of [[national language]]s and [[folklore]], and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning. One of the most important functions of medieval references in the 19th century was nationalist. Popular and epic poetry were its workhorses. This is visible in Germany and Ireland, where underlying Germanic or Celtic [[Stratum (linguistics)|linguistic substrates]] dating from before the Romanization-Latinization were sought out.

Early Romantic nationalism was strongly inspired by [[Rousseau]], and by the ideas of [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], who in 1784 argued that the geography formed the natural economy of a people, and shaped their customs and society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The nature of nationalism changed dramatically, however, after the [[French Revolution]] with the rise of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]], and the reactions in other nations. Napoleonic nationalism and republicanism were, at first, inspirational to movements in other nations: self-determination and a consciousness of national unity were held to be two of the reasons why France was able to defeat other countries in battle. But as the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] became [[First French Empire|Napoleon's Empire]], Napoleon became not the inspiration for nationalism, but the object of its struggle. In [[Prussia]], the development of spiritual renewal as a means to engage in [[Napoleonic Wars|the struggle against Napoleon]] was argued by, among others, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], a disciple of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The word ''[[Volkstum]]'', or nationality, was coined in German as part of this resistance to the now conquering emperor. Fichte expressed the unity of language and nation in his address "To the German Nation" in 1806:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole. ...Only when each people, left to itself, develops and forms itself in accordance with its own peculiar quality, and only when in every people each individual develops himself in accordance with that common quality, as well as in accordance with his own peculiar quality—then, and then only, does the manifestation of divinity appear in its true mirror as it ought to be.&lt;ref name="Fichte"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1806fichte.asp | title=Address to the German Nation | publisher=Fordham University | date=1806 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | author=Fichte, Johann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view of nationalism inspired the collection of [[folklore]] by such people as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the revival of old epics as national, and the construction of new epics as if they were old, as in the ''[[Kalevala]]'', compiled from Finnish tales and folklore, or ''[[Ossian]]'', where the claimed ancient roots were invented. The view that fairy tales, unless contaminated from outside literary sources, were preserved in the same form over thousands of years, was not exclusive to Romantic Nationalists, but fit in well with their views that such tales expressed the primordial nature of a people. For instance, the Brothers Grimm rejected many tales they collected because of their similarity to tales by [[Charles Perrault]], which they thought proved they were not truly German tales;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p. 31 {{ISBN|0691067228}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' survived in their collection because the tale of [[Brynhildr]] convinced them that the figure of the sleeping princess was authentically German. [[Vuk Karadžić]]  contributed to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation. He regarded the oral literature of the peasants as an integral part of Serbian culture, compiling it to use in his collections of folk songs, tales, and proverbs, as well as the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prilozi za književnost, jezik, istoriju i folklor|year=1965|publisher=Државна штампарија Краљевине Срба, Хрвата и Словенаца|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnpHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22&amp;dq=%22%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B8+%D1%83+%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%22|accessdate=19 January 2012|page=264|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar projects were undertaken by the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846, {{ISBN|039397636X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polish nationalism and messianism ===
Romanticism played an essential role in the national awakening of many Central European peoples lacking their own national states, not least in Poland, which had recently failed to restore its independence when [[Imperial Russian Army|Russia's army]] crushed the [[November Uprising|Polish Uprising]] under [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. Revival and reinterpretation of ancient myths, customs and traditions by Romantic poets and painters helped to distinguish their indigenous cultures from those of the dominant nations and crystallise the mythography of [[Romantic nationalism]]. Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. Arguably, the most distinguished Romantic poet of this part of Europe was [[Adam Mickiewicz]], who developed an idea that [[Christ of Europe|Poland was the Messiah of Nations]], predestined to suffer just as [[Jesus]] had suffered to save all the people. The Polish self-image as a "[[Christ of Europe|Christ among nations]]" or the martyr of Europe can be traced back to its history of [[Christendom]] and suffering under invasions. During the periods of foreign occupation, the Catholic Church served as bastion of Poland's national identity and language, and the major promoter of [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]]. The [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] came to be seen in Poland as a Polish sacrifice for the security for [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. Adam Mickiewicz wrote the patriotic drama [[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]] (directed against the Russians) where he depicts Poland as the Christ of Nations. He also wrote "Verily I say unto you, it is not for you to learn civilization from foreigners, but it is you who are to teach them civilization ... You are among the foreigners like the Apostles among the idolaters". In "[[Books of the Polish nation and Polish pilgrimage]]" Mickiewicz detailed his vision of Poland as a Messias and a Christ of Nations, that would save mankind. Dziady is known for various interpretation. The most known ones are the moral aspect of part II, [[individualist]] and romantic message of part IV, as well as deeply patriotic, messianistic and Christian vision in part III of poem. Zdzisław Kępiński, however, focuses his interpretation on [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan]] and [[occult]] elements found in the drama. In his book ''Mickiewicz hermetyczny'' he writes about [[Hermeticism|hermetic]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophic]] and [[Alchemy|alchemical]] philosophy on the book as well as [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] symbols.

[[File:Stock Market Learning rgb 300dpi.jpg|thumb|Stock Market Learning - Logo]]
'''Stock Market Learning''' is an international competition run by the [[Savings bank|Savings Banks]] in Europe with the support of the [[European Savings Banks Group]] (ESBG) based in Brussels. It aims to provide pupils a better understanding of the [[stock market]] and of the economic and financial world by simulating transactions in [[stock exchange]]s.  The competition was held for the first time in Germany in 1983, while the Savings Banks in Europe became actively involved in 1999. By 2010, over 1 million teams had taken part in the initiative.

==Procedure==
Each team is assigned an account with virtual capital that is to be used to buy and sell [[Security (finance)|securities]]. The purpose is to increase initial [[asset]]s by conducting individual investing strategies. While capital is virtual, trading is based on real [[Share price|stock prices]] at certain stock exchanges.

The list of tradable securities consists primarily of [[Share (finance)|shares]] but also includes [[Fixed interest|fixed-interests]] securities and [[Collective investment scheme|investment funds]]. Since 2009, there is both a conventional and [[sustainability]] competition. The former takes into consideration the total performance of the account, whereas the latter is based on the sustainability account value, i.e. on the earnings gained from shares listed in a [[sustainability index]].

==Awards==
In 2010, Stock Market Learning received the official [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development|UN Decade Project of Education for Sustainable Development]] award from the German Commission for UNESCO.

The '''University of Louvain'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/016709801#Graphic_representation|title=University of Louvain - EUTM file information|last=|first=|date=|year=|website=European Union Intellectual Property Office|orig-year=2017|access-date=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|Université catholique de Louvain}}, '''UCLouvain''') is [[Belgium]]'s largest [[French language|French]]-speaking [[university]]. It is located in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], which was expressly built to house the university, and [[Brussels]], [[Charleroi]], [[Mons]] and [[Tournai]]. From September 2018 onwards, the university is called '''UCLouvain''' in the context of a merger with [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels]].

The University of Louvain (''Universitas Lovaniensis'') was founded at the centre of the historic town of [[Leuven]] (or ''Louvain'') in 1425, making it the first university in Belgium and the [[Low Countries]]. After being closed in 1797 during the Napoleonic period, the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|''Catholic'' University of Leuven]] was "re-founded" in 1834, and is frequently, but controversially, identified as a continuation of the older institution.{{ref|caveat|A}}{{ref|caveat2|B}} In 1968 the Catholic University of Leuven split into the Dutch-language ''[[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]'', which stayed in Leuven, and the French-language ''Université catholique de Louvain'', which moved to [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] in [[Wallonia]], 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Brussels]]. Since the 15th century, ''Leuven/Louvain'', as it is still often called, has been a major contributor to the development of Catholic theology.

==History==
{{For|the history of the university prior to 1968|Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)#History}}

The [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], based in [[Leuven]] ("''Louvain''" in French), 30&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Brussels]], provided lectures in French from its refounding in 1835, and in Dutch from 1930. In 1968, the [[Dutch-language]] section became the independent [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], which remained in Leuven, while the French-speaking university was moved to a greenfield campus and town, [[Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve|Louvain-la-Neuve]], 30&amp;nbsp;km south-east of Brussels, in a part of the country where French is the official language. This separation also entailed dividing existing library holdings between the two new universities.

With the democratization of university education already stretching existing structures, plans to expand the French-speaking part of the university at a campus in [[Brussels]] or [[Wallonia]] were quietly discussed from the early 1960s, but it was not anticipated that the French-speaking section would become an entirely independent university and lose all of its buildings and infrastructure in [[Leuven]]. The first stone of the new campus at Louvain-la-Neuve was laid in 1971, and the transfer of faculties to the new site was completed in 1979.

== Chronology ==
In 1425, Dukes of Brabant created the University of Louvain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UNIVERSITÉ DE LOUVAIN|url = http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/universite-de-louvain/|website = Encyclopædia Universalis|access-date = 2016-02-23|first = Encyclopædia|last = Universalis}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Université de Louvain) and has been deleted under Joseph II and under the French Republic.

In 1817, the University of the State of Louvain (''Université de l'Etat de Louvain'') was founded and closed 15 August 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = La matricule de l'Universite de Louvain (1817-1835)|last = Graffart|first = Arlette|publisher = Album de Carlos Wyffels|year = 1987|isbn = |location = Bruxelles|pages = 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, bishops of Belgium created the Belgium Catholic University (Université Catholique de Belgique) also known under the name Catholic University of Malines (Université Catholique de Malines).

In 1835, near after the suppression of the University of the State of Louvain (Université de l'Etat de Louvain), the Belgium Catholic University (Université Catholique de Belgique) set up to Louvain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionnaire de l'histoire universelle de l'Eglise|last = Encyclopedie theologique|first = |publisher = J.P. Migne|year = 1863|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of the city of Louvain was its reputation of old university residence.

The law voted 27 September 1835 stated that there would be only one university funded by the State of Belgium in Louvain. By consequence, the Catholic University of Malines (Université catholique de Malines) moved to Louvain, took the advantage of the reputation of the city and adopted a new name: Catholic University of Louvain (Université Catholique de Louvain).

In a catholic winning back spirit established by the pope Grégoire XVI,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les annees Lovanium|last = Ndaywel è Nziem|first = Isidore|publisher = L'Harmattan|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the promoter and first rector Monseigneur de Ram wanted to create a shield which will repulse religion's enemies and block every doctrines weakening the catholic society bases.

In 1845: foundation of the Pharmacy school

1865: Creation of the engineering schools

In 1884: The University of Louvain celebrated its fiftieth anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Universite Catholique de Louvain: Liber Memorialis: 1834-1884|last = Descamps|first = E.|publisher = Peeters|year = 1887|isbn = |location = Louvain|pages = V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, as a result of the linguistic issues, the University is divided in two different universities: one French speaking which will be built in the province of Brabant Wallon and one Dutch which stayed in the same infrastructure.

In 1970, these two universities are established by law: ''Katholieke Universiteit Leuven'' and ''Université Catholique de Louvain''.

In 1971, laying of the first foundation stone in Louvain-la-Neuve. New city reserved for the French speaking infrastructure.

==Campuses==
While the main [[campus]] of the University of Louvain is based in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], it also comprises a campus in Brussels, in [[Woluwe-Saint-Lambert]], which until recently was called "Louvain-en-Woluwe" (today "UCLouvain Brussels Woluwe" nowadays) for the university's [[Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc|faculty of medicine]], a campus in [[Mons]] called, [[UCL Mons|UCLouvain FUCaM Mons]], a minor installation in [[Charleroi]] with 133 students (as of 2011) at UCLouvain Charleroi, an architectural school in [[Tournai]], UCLouvain Tournai, with 540 students (as of 2011), and an architectural school in [[Brussels]], UCLouvain Bruxelles Saint-Gilles, with 570 students (as of 2011).

==Prospects==
According to a 2007 agreement, the University of Louvain was to absorb three smaller French-speaking catholic colleges: the [[Facultés Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix|Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix]] ([[FUNDP]]) located in [[Namur (city)|Namur]], the [[Facultés Universitaires Saint-Louis|Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis]] ([[FUSL]]) located in Brussels (now called Saint-Louis University, Brussels (USL-B)) and the [[Catholic university of Mons]] ([[FUCaM]]) located in [[Mons]] and [[Charleroi]]. The negotiations for a full merger aborted by an insufficient vote by the general assembly of [[Facultés Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix|Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix]] ([[FUNDP]]) in December 2010. The result was a merger between the University of Louvain and [[Facultés universitaires catholiques de Mons]] (FUCaM) in [[Mons]], effective from September 15, 2011. The Mons campus is denoted UCLouvain FUCaM Mons. The three universities still collaborate in consortium, the "Academie Louvain". Within this group, member universities have coordinated their masters programmes in the fields of economics, management, political sciences and sciences as well as the doctoral programmes in all disciplines.,

From September 2018, the University of Louvain and [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels]] will ''[[de facto]]'' merge and share the name UCLouvain.

==Student activities==

===Cercles===
''Cercles'' are [[Student society|Student Societies]] or [[Fraternities and sororities|Fraternities]] based around each faculty.  The Cercles, along with the Régionales (which are based around their respective regions of origin) coordinate and manage most of the students' animation and nightlife.  Most Cercles run small bars to fund their activities, and also jointly operate a larger nightclub, "La Casa".

Cercles and Régionales are run exclusively by member students known as the Committee.  These members are elected every year, usually by voting from all members (active or otherwise) wishing to participate, although some Cercles restrict the number of possible voters in some cases.

Aside from promoting student folklore and coordinating student animation, Cercles also offer academic aid to students in their respective faculties and organize more cultural activities, such as visits to museums and/or other cities, conferences, and low-cost trips for students (for example skiing in the Alps during the Winter Break).

Every Cercle and Régionale has its own customs and traditions, but some are practiced by all :

The Baptême ({{lang-fr|baptism}}) is a [[hazing]] ceremony used by most to induct new members, who then participate in a number of trials and activities involving eggs and other foodstuff, paint, demeaning chants etc.  Baptized members (les Baptisés) are among the most common type of members, and some Cercles and Régionales try to only accept new members this way, although "it is in no way an obligation to be baptized in order to be a part of the Cercle or to frequent them".

The [[Calotte (Belgium)|calotte]] is a Belgian [[student cap]] worn by students attending Catholic universities.  They are emblems of student folklore dating back to the late 19th century.  Nowadays, most calottes are passed by way of a ceremony known as the coronae.  How they are passed and what must be known or done to deserve it depends on the Cercle or Régionale.  One thing that is universally known, is that there is a lot of singing involved.

Cercles are notorious for their generally high output of alcohol (especially beer) and low level of cleanliness.  Students tend to wear old clothes that they don't mind damaging or dirtying as a consequence, and the overall ambiance is more akin to a rave or a frat-party than a nightclub or sports bar.

===Kots===
Student accommodation in Belgium comes in the form of a "[[Kot (lodging)|kot]]", a term having [[Flemish|Belgian Dutch]] origin. A "kot" can be translated as den or hut. The French way to form the plural of "kot" is "kots" (in Dutch, the plural of "kot" is "koten"). In the bilingual region of Brussels, where there are both Dutch- and French-speaking universities and their students, it is common that "for rent" signs are in French only, with the French plural of "kot".

===Kot-à-projet===
{{main|Theme-based shared flat (kot-à-projet)}}

Unique to UCLouvain a [[Theme-based shared flat (kot-à-projet)|Kot-à-projet]] (kap) is a kot whose inhabitants have similar interests and who organise activities for the general student population, they are similar to [[Fraternity and sorority houses]], but smaller in size with only the committee living in the kot. Being small several Kots can be situated in the same, university owned, apartment building. One of them is "le kap contes", a kot promoting the art of storytelling. Another is called "Kap Délices" which suggests lots of activities as theme buffets, cooking lessons, material renting and a lot of other things related to cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kapdelices.net |title=Kap Délices &amp;#124; Accueil |publisher=Kapdelices.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Union===
The AGL (General Assembly of Louvain students) is the UCLouvain's [[Students' union]]. The body comprises an [[Executive (government)|executive]] Committee, and a [[Legislature|legislative]] Council. The Committee consists of ex-officio members: President, Vice-Presidents for Education &amp; Welfare, VP for the Medicine faculty (Situated in [[Woluwe-Saint-Lambert]]), General Secretary, Activities Officer, Communications Officer, Operations Officer, Foreign student's Officer, Cultural Officer, [[Editing#Executive editor|Editor-in-Chief]] &amp; Deputy Editor-in-Chief as well as the president of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aglouvain.be/wiki/index.php/Comit%E9 |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 October 2017 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171011031126/http://www.aglouvain.be/wiki/index.php/Comit%E9 |archive-date=11 October 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
''Quinzaine'' a University produced newsletter, ''La Savate'' produced by the AGL and the monthly ''l'étincelle'' by the [[Theme-based shared flat (kot-à-projet)|Kot-à-projet]] KAP Etincelle. Cercles also produce publications.

===24h Vélo===
[[File:24h velo (LLN) (1808220531).jpg|thumb|A fanciful bike [[float (parade)|float]] at the [[24h vélo de Louvain-la-Neuve]]]]
{{main|24h velo (LLN)}}

The 24 Hour Cycle (24h Vélo) is, nominally, a [[bicycle]] endurance [[Road bicycle racing|road race]] held in October, organised by  ''CSE Animations'' (Centre Sportif Etudiant). While there is an elite race with teams of two, Student groups enter novelty themed multi-bike vehicles, in the shape of a Van or Whale for example, for prizes. The quality of these designs range in terms of artistic merit, and ability to stay intact over the duration of the race. A 240-minute race also takes place for teenagers. The event is probably best known for what happens off the track. Concurrent with the race is [[Belgium]]'s largest student event, with concerts and stands lasting the full 24hrs.

==Non EU students==

For the year 2018-2019, a lot of non-EU students, who were admitted to study in the master programs at UCL, did not receive their Belgian visas. As the result, they were not able to study in the UCL for the programs to which they were admitted.

==Notes==
:A.{{note|caveat}} The Old University of Leuven (1425) is the oldest university in the low countries, and the Catholic University of Leuven (1834) is sometimes, controversially, identified as a continuation of it. It should be noted that Belgium's highest court, the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]] has ruled that the (1834) Catholic University of Leuven cannot be regarded as continuing the old (1425) University of Leuven.&lt;ref&gt;Ruling of the Cour de Cassation of Belgium of 26 November 1846: "''The Catholic University of Leuven can not be regarded as continuing the old University of Leuven''", in, ''Table générale alphabétique et chronologique de la Pasicrisie Belge contenant la jurisprudence du Royaume de 1814 à 1850'', Brussels, 1855, p. 585, column 1, alinea 2. See also: ''Bulletin Usuel des Lois et Arrêtés'', 1861, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Old University of Leuven#History]].
:B.{{note|caveat2}} This is a relatively recent phenomenon. In 1884, the university celebrated its 50th anniversary, acknowledging its actual date of foundation.&lt;ref&gt;In the year 1887, the Catholic University of Louvain, has celebrated his 50th anniversary.... E. Descamps, in : ''Université Catholique de Louvain : Liber Memorialis : 1834-1884'', Louvain : Peeters, 1887, p. V : "''les fêtes du cinquantième anniversaire de l'Université catholique de Louvain ont eu un brillant éclat et un immense retentissement''".&lt;/ref&gt; Only in 1968 did the new Catholic university dare to add the date 1425 to its neo-gothic seal (created, without the date, in 1909).

Vastu shastra (''{{IAST|vāstu śāstra}}'') is a traditional Hindu system of architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quack|first1=Johannes|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=119|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which literally translates to "science of architecture."&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"/&gt; These are texts found on the Indian subcontinent that describe principles of design, layout, measurements, ground preparation, space arrangement, and spatial geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vastukarta.com/principles_of_vastu.php|title=GOLDEN PRINCIPLES OF VASTU SHASTRA Vastukarta|website=www.vastukarta.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pka/&gt; Vastu Shastras incorporate traditional Hindu and in some cases Buddhist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vastushastra|first=Vijaya |last=Kumar|publisher=New Dawn/Sterling|year=2002|isbn=978-81-207-2199-9|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns ([[yantra]]), symmetry, and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|directional]] alignments.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;

Vastu Shastra are the textual part of ''Vastu Vidya'', the latter being the broader knowledge about architecture and design theories from ancient India.&lt;ref name=vsgt1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu Vidya knowledge is a collection of ideas and concepts, with or without the support of layout diagrams, that are not rigid. Rather, these ideas and concepts are models for the organization of space and form within a building or collection of buildings, based on their functions in relation to each other, their usage and to the overall fabric of the Vastu.&lt;ref name=vsgt1/&gt; Ancient Vastu Shastra principles include those for the design of ''Mandir'' ([[Hindu temple]]s),&lt;ref&gt;George Michell (1988), The Hindu Temple: An Introduction to Its Meaning and Forms, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226532301}}, pp 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; and the principles for the design and layout of houses, towns, cities, gardens, roads, water works, shops and other public areas.&lt;ref name=pka/&gt;&lt;ref name="GD Vasudev 2001 pp 74-92"&gt;GD Vasudev (2001), Vastu, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|81-208-1605-6}}, pp 74-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"&gt;Sherri Silverman (2007), Vastu: Transcendental Home Design in Harmony with Nature, Gibbs Smith, Utah, {{ISBN|978-1423601326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The Sanskrit word ''vastu'' means a dwelling or house with a corresponding plot of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Latest Vastu Shastra (Some Secrets)|first=Jagdish|last= Gautum|page=17|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-81-7017-449-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[vrddhi]], ''vāstu'', takes the meaning of "the site or foundation of a house, site, ground, building or dwelling-place, habitation, homestead, house". The underlying root is ''vas'' "to dwell, live, stay, reside".&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams (1899).&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[shastra]] may loosely be translated as  "doctrine, teaching".

''Vastu-Sastras'' (literally, science of dwelling) are ancient Sanskrit manuals of architecture. These contain Vastu-Vidya (literally, knowledge of dwelling).&lt;ref name=bbdutt&gt;BB Dutt (1925), {{Google books|J3jEJFNxdy4C|Town planning in Ancient India}}, {{ISBN|978-81-8205-487-5}}; See critical review by LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Proposals tracing potential links of the principles of composition in ''Vastu Shastra'' and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] have been made, but [[Kapila Vatsyayan]] is reluctant to speculate on such links given the Indus Valley script remains undeciphered.&lt;ref name="Singer1991p117"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milton Singer|title=Semiotics of Cities, Selves, and Cultures: Explorations in Semiotic Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9G6h1EfTTwC&amp;pg=PA117 |year=1991|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-085775-7|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chakrabarti, Vastu Vidya is as old the Vedic period and linked to the ritual architecture.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2013p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vibhuti Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory and Practice: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgmakH37M0UC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77882-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael W. Meister]], the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' contains verses with mystic cosmogony which provide a paradigm for cosmic planning, but they did not represent architecture nor a developed practice.&lt;ref name="Buhnemann2003p251"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gudrun Bühnemann|title=Mandalas and Yantras in the Hindu Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQf2m8VaC_oC&amp;pg=PA251 |year=2003|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-12902-2|pages=251–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varahamihira]]'s ''Brihat Samhita'' dated to the sixth century CE, states Meister, is the first known Indian text that describes "something like a ''vastupurusamandala'' to plan cities and buildings".&lt;ref name="Buhnemann2003p251"/&gt; The emergence of Vastu vidya as a specialized field of science is speculated to have occurred significantly before the 1st-century CE.&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti2013p1"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Plan of Kandariya Mahadeva temple.jpg|thumb|360px|Ancient India produced many Sanskrit manuals of architecture, called Vastu Sastra. Many of these are about Hindu temple layout (above), design and construction, along with chapters on design principles for houses, villages, towns. The architect and artists (Silpins) were given wide latitude to experiment and express their creativity.&lt;ref name=mmgeometry/&gt;]]
There exist many Vastu-Sastras on the art of building houses, temples, towns and cities. One such Vastu Sastra is by [[Thakkura Pheru]], describing where and how temples should be built.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1976), The Hindu Temple Volume 1 &amp; 2, {{ISBN|81-208-0223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hebner (2010), Architecture of the Vastu Sastra - According to Sacred Science, in Science of the Sacred (Editor: David Osborn), {{ISBN|978-0557277247}}, pp 85-92; N Lahiri (1996), Archaeological landscapes and textual images: a study of the sacred geography of late medieval Ballabgarh, World Archaeology, 28(2), pp 244-264&lt;/ref&gt; By 6th century AD, Sanskrit manuals for constructing palatial temples were in circulation in India.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Lewandowski (1984), Buildings and Society: Essays on the Social Development of the Built Environment, edited by Anthony D. King, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0710202345}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu-Sastra manuals included chapters on home construction, town planning,&lt;ref name=bbdutt/&gt; and how efficient villages, towns and kingdoms integrated temples, water bodies and gardens within them to achieve harmony with nature.&lt;ref name="GD Vasudev 2001 pp 74-92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"/&gt; While it is unclear, states Barnett,&lt;ref&gt;LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391&lt;/ref&gt; as to whether these temple and town planning texts were theoretical studies and if or when they were properly implemented in practice, the manuals suggest that town planning and Hindu temples were conceived as ideals of art and integral part of Hindu social and spiritual life.&lt;ref name=bbdutt/&gt;

The ''Silpa Prakasa'' of Odisha, authored by Ramachandra Bhattaraka Kaulachara sometime in ninth or tenth century CE, is another Vastu Sastra.&lt;ref name=aliceboner66&gt;Alice Boner and Sadāśiva Rath Śarmā (1966), {{Google books|itQUAAAAIAAJ|Silpa Prakasa Medieval Orissan Sanskrit Text on Temple Architecture}}, E.J. Brill (Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt; Silpa Prakasa describes the geometric principles in every aspect of the temple and symbolism such as 16 emotions of human beings carved as 16 types of female figures. These styles were perfected in Hindu temples prevalent in eastern states of India. Other ancient texts found expand these architectural principles, suggesting that different parts of India developed, invented and added their own interpretations. For example, in ''Saurastra'' tradition of temple building found in western states of India, the feminine form, expressions and emotions are depicted in 32 types of ''Nataka-stri'' compared to 16 types described in ''Silpa Prakasa''.&lt;ref name=aliceboner66/&gt; Silpa Prakasa provides brief introduction to 12 types of Hindu temples. Other texts, such as ''Pancaratra Prasada Prasadhana'' compiled by Daniel Smith&lt;ref&gt;H. Daniel Smith (1963), Ed. Pāncarātra prasāda prasādhapam, A Pancaratra Text on Temple-Building, Syracuse: University of Rochester, {{OCLC|68138877}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silpa Ratnakara compiled by Narmada Sankara&lt;ref&gt;Mahanti and Mahanty (1995 Reprint), Śilpa Ratnākara, Orissa Akademi, {{OCLC|42718271}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide a more extensive list of Hindu temple types.

Ancient Sanskrit manuals for temple construction discovered in Rajasthan, in northwestern region of India, include Sutradhara Mandana’s ''Prasadamandana'' (literally, manual for planning and building a temple) with chapters on town building.&lt;ref&gt;Amita Sinha (1998), Design of Settlements in the Vaastu Shastras, Journal of Cultural Geography, 17(2), pp 27-41, {{doi|10.1080/08873639809478319}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manasara shilpa'' and ''Mayamata'', texts of South Indian origin, estimated to be in circulation by 5th to 7th century AD, is a guidebook on South Indian Vastu design and construction.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillotson, G. H. R. (1997). Svastika Mansion: A Silpa-Sastra in the 1930s. South Asian Studies, 13(1), pp 87-97&lt;/ref&gt; ''Isanasivagurudeva paddhati'' is another Sanskrit text from the 9th century describing the art of building in India in south and central India.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ganapati Sastri (1920), Īśānaśivagurudeva paddhati, Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, {{OCLC|71801033}}&lt;/ref&gt; In north India, ''Brihat-samhita'' by [[Varāhamihira]] is the widely cited ancient Sanskrit manual from 6th century describing the design and construction of ''Nagara'' style of Hindu temples.&lt;ref name=mmgeometry&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meister |first=Michael W. |author-link=Michael W. Meister |date=1983 |title=Geometry and Measure in Indian Temple Plans: Rectangular Temples |journal=Artibus Asiae |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=266–296 |doi=10.2307/3249613 |jstor=3249613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hgood&gt;Heather Elgood (2000), Hinduism and the religious arts, {{ISBN|978-0304707393}}, Bloomsbury Academic, pp 121-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H Kern (1865), [http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/BrhatSamhitaSanskrit.pdf The Brhat Sanhita of Varaha-mihara], The Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

These ancient ''Vastu Sastras'', often discuss and describe the principles of Hindu temple design, but do not limit themselves to the design of a Hindu temple.&lt;ref&gt;S Bafna, On the Idea of the Mandala as a Governing Device in Indian Architectural Tradition, Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 59, No. 1 (Mar., 2000), pp. 26-49&lt;/ref&gt; They describe the temple as a holistic part of its community, and lay out various principles and a diversity of alternate designs for home, village and city layout along with the temple, gardens, water bodies and nature.&lt;ref name="Sherri Silverman 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=stellakvolm1&gt;[[Stella Kramrisch]], The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0222-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandala types and properties==
[[File:64 grid Manduka design Hindu Temple Floor Plan Vastu Purusa Mandala Ancient Architecture.svg|thumb|220px|The 8x8 (64) grid Manduka Vastu Purusha Mandala layout for [[Hindu Temple]]s. It is one of 32 Vastu Purusha Mandala grid patterns described in Vastu sastras. In this grid structure of symmetry, each concentric layer has significance.&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;]]
The central area in all [[mandala]] is the [[Brahmasthana]]. Mandala "circle-circumference" or "completion", is a concentric diagram having spiritual and ritual significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The space occupied by it varies in different [[mandala]] – in ''Pitha'' (9) and ''Upapitha'' (25) it occupies one square module, in ''Mahaapitha'' (16), ''Ugrapitha'' (36) and ''Manduka'' (64), four square modules and in ''Sthandila'' (49) and ''Paramasaayika'' (81), nine square modules.&lt;ref name=vcm/&gt; The Pitha is an amplified Prithvimandala in which, according to some texts, the central space is occupied by earth. The Sthandila mandala is used in a concentric manner.&lt;ref name=vcm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|pages=86–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important [[mandala]] is the Manduka/ Chandita Mandala of 64 squares and the Paramasaayika Mandala of 81 squares. The normal position of the Vastu Purusha (head in the northeast, legs in the southwest) is as depicted in the Paramasaayika Mandala. However, in the Manduka Mandala the Vastu Purusha is depicted with the head facing east and the feet facing west. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Vastu direction chakar.jpg|thumb|vastu directional chakara]]
It is believed that every piece of a land or a building has a soul of its own and that soul is known as Vastu Purusha.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockingbaba.com/blog/index.php/2015/07/06/vastu-for-beginners-blog-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

A site of any shape can be divided using the Pada Vinyasa. Sites are known by the number of squares. They range from 1x1 to 32x32 (1024) square sites. Examples of mandalas with the corresponding names of sites include:&lt;ref name=stellakramrisch76/&gt;
* ''Sakala'' (1 square) corresponds to ''Eka-pada'' (single divided site)
* ''Pechaka'' (4 squares) corresponds to ''Dwi-pada'' (two divided site)
* ''Pitha'' (9 squares) corresponds to ''Tri-pada'' (three divided site)
* ''Mahaapitha'' (16 squares) corresponds to ''Chatush-pada'' (four divided site)
* ''Upapitha'' (25 squares) corresponds to ''Pancha-pada'' (five divided site)
* ''Ugrapitha'' (36 squares) corresponds to ''Shashtha-pada'' (six divided site)
* ''Sthandila'' (49 squares) corresponds to ''Sapta-pada'' (seven divided site)
* ''Manduka/ Chandita'' (64 square) corresponds to ''Ashta-pada'' (eight divided site))
* ''Paramasaayika'' (81 squares) corresponds to ''Nava-pada'' (nine divided site)
* ''Aasana'' (100 squares) corresponds to ''Dasa-pada'' (ten divided site)
* ''Bhadrmahasan'' (196 squares) corresponds to ''Chodah-pada'' (14 divided sites)

==Modern adaptations and usage==
[[File:Plan, Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur, Rajasthan.JPG|thumb|Vastu Shastra-inspired plan adapted and evolved by modern architect [[Charles Correa]] in the design of Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur, Rajasthan.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpg1/&gt;]]

Vastu sastra represents a body of ancient concepts and knowledge to many modern architects, a guideline but not a rigid code.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt; The square-grid mandala is viewed as a model of organization, not as a ground plan. The ancient Vastu sastra texts describe functional relations and adaptable alternate layouts for various rooms or buildings and utilities, but do not mandate a set compulsory architecture. Sachdev and Tillotson state that the mandala is a guideline, and employing the mandala concept of Vastu sastra does not mean every room or building has to be square.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt; The basic theme is around core elements of central space, peripheral zones, direction with respect to sunlight, and relative functions of the spaces.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;

The pink city [[Jaipur]] in Rajasthan was master planned by Rajput king [[Jai Singh II|Jai Singh]] and built by 1727 CE, in part around Vastu Shilpa Sastra principles.&lt;ref name=vsgt2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|pages=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nus1&gt;[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-07-jantar_mantar.pdf Jantar Mantar &amp; Jaipur - Section II] National University of Singapore, pp. 17-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nus1/&gt; Similarly, modern era projects such as the architect [[Charles Correa]]'s designed [[Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya]] in [[Ahmedabad]], Vidhan Bhavan in [[Bhopal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irena Murray|title=Charles Correa: India's Greatest Architect|date=2011|publisher=RIBA Publishing|isbn=978-1859465172}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jawahar Kala Kendra]] in Jaipur, adapt and apply concepts from the Vastu Shastra Vidya.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc1&gt;{{cite book|last1=V Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|date=2013|pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of [[Chandigarh]] city, [[Le Corbusier]] incorporated modern architecture theories with those of Vastu Shastra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=SAJAH|date=2011|volume=26|issue=3|pages=45–56|author=Gerald Steyn|title=Le Corbusier’s research-based design approaches|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/20055/Steyn_LeCorbusier(2011).pdf?sequence=1|publisher=Tshwane University of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H Saini|title=Vaastu ordains a full flowering for Chandigarh|date=1996|publisher=The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reena Patra|title=Vaastu Shastra: Towards Sustainable Development|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2009|volume=17|pages=244–256|publisher=Wiley InterScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial rule period of India, town planning officials of the [[British Raj]] did not consider Vastu Vidya, but largely grafted Islamic Mughal era motifs and designs such as domes and arches onto Victorian-era style buildings without overall relationship layout.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anthony D'Costa|title=A New India?: Critical Reflections in the Long Twentieth Century|pages=165–168|isbn=978-0857285041}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement, later known as the Indo-Saracenic style, is found in chaotically laid out, but externally grand structures in the form of currently used major railway stations, harbors, tax collection buildings, and other colonial offices in South Asia.&lt;ref name=vsgt3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vibhuti Sachdev, Giles Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|date=2004|isbn=978-1861891372|pages=149–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vastu sastra vidya was ignored, during colonial era construction, for several reasons. These texts were viewed by 19th and early 20th century architects as archaic, the literature was inaccessible being in an ancient language not spoken or read by the architects, and the ancient texts assumed space to be readily available.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; In contrast, public projects in the colonial era were forced into crowded spaces and local layout constraints, and the ancient Vastu sastra were viewed with prejudice as superstitious and rigid about a square grid or traditional materials of construction.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; Sachdev and Tillotson state that these prejudices were flawed, as a scholarly and complete reading of the Vastu sastra literature amply suggests the architect is free to adapt the ideas to new materials of construction, local layout constraints and into a non-square space.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc2&gt;{{cite book|last1=V Chakrabarti|title=Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0700711130|date=2013|pages=86–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and completion of a new city of [[Jaipur]] in early 1700s based on Vastu sastra texts, well before any colonial era public projects, was one of many proofs.&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt;&lt;ref name=vc2/&gt; Other examples include modern public projects designed by [[Charles Correa]] such as Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur, and Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad.&lt;ref name=vsgt2/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpg1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klaus-Peter Gast|title=Modern Traditions: Contemporary Architecture in India|page=11|isbn=978-3764377540|date=2011|publisher=Birkhäuser Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vastu Shastra remedies have also been applied by Khushdeep Bansal in 1997 to the Parliament complex of India, when he contented that the library being built next to the building is responsible for political instability in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/harmonising-homes-hearts/story-UR90utlqvNojXaolxBmtNN.html | title=‘Harmonising’ homes, hearts | publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] | date= 9 June 2012 | accessdate= 4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German architect Klaus-Peter Gast states that the principles of Vastu Shastras is witnessing a major revival and wide usage in the planning and design of individual homes, residential complexes, commercial and industrial campuses, and major public projects in India, along with the use of ancient iconography and mythological art work incorporated into the Vastu vidya architectures.&lt;ref name=kpg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephen Marshall|title=Urban Coding and Planning|pages=83–103|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415441261|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vastu and superstition ===
{{see also|Superstition in India#Vastu Shastra}}
The use of ''Vastu shastra'' and ''Vastu consultants'' in modern home and public projects is controversial.&lt;ref name=vc2/&gt; Some architects, particularly during India's colonial era, considered it arcane and superstitious.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vsgt3/&gt; Other architects state that critics have not read the texts and that most of the text is about flexible design guidelines for space, sunlight, flow and function.&lt;ref name=vc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm1/&gt;

Vastu Shastra is considered as pseudoscience by rationalists like [[Narendra Nayak]] of [[Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations]].&lt;ref name=OUP-Johannes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quack|first1=Johannes|title=Disenchanting India: Organized Rationalism and Criticism of Religion in India|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=170|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNbxUwhS5RUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist and astronomer [[Jayant Narlikar]] considers Vastu Shastra as pseudoscience and writes that Vastu does not have any "logical connection" to the environment.&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narlikar|first1=Jayant V.|editor1-last=Percy|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Pasachoff|editor2-first=Jay|title=Teaching and Learning Astronomy: Effective Strategies for Educators Worldwide|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=165|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mdzQ4uCnYfkC&amp;pg=PA165|chapter=Astronomy, pseudoscience and rational thinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the examples cited by Narlikar arguing the absence of logical connection is the Vastu rule, "sites shaped like a triangle ... will lead to government harassment, ... parallelogram can lead to quarrels in the family." Narlikar notes that sometimes the building plans are changed and what has already been built is demolished to accommodate for Vastu rules.&lt;ref name="narlikar_CUP"/&gt; Regarding superstitious beliefs in Vastu, Science writer [[Meera Nanda]] cites the case of [[N.T.Rama Rao]], the ex-chief minister of [[Andhra Pradesh]], who sought the help of Vastu consultants for his political problems. Rama Rao was advised that his problems would be solved if he entered his office from an east facing gate. Accordingly, a slum on the east facing side of his office was ordered to be demolished, to make way for his car's entrance.&lt;ref name=Sokal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sokal|first1=Alan|title=Beyond the Hoax: Science, Philosophy and Culture|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=306–307|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SjBdUTpf184C&amp;pg=PT407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge of Vastu consultants is questioned by Pramod Kumar (citation required), "Ask the Vaastu folks if they know civil engineering or architecture or the local government rules on construction or minimum standards of construction to advise people on buildings. They will get into a barrage of "ancient" texts and "science" that smack of the pseudo-science of astrology. Ask them where they were before the construction boom and if they will go to slum tenements to advise people or advise on low-cost community-housing—you draw a blank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kumar|first1=Pramod|title=Akshaya Tritiya and the great Indian superstition industry|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/akshaya-tritiya-and-the-great-indian-superstition-industry-781471.html|accessdate=15 August 2015|publisher=Firstpost|date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanskrit treatises on architecture==
Of the numerous Sanskrit treatises mentioned in ancient Indian literature, some have been translated in English. Many Agamas, Puranas and Hindu scriptures include chapters on architecture of temples, homes, villages, towns, fortifications, streets, shop layout, public wells, public bathing, public halls, gardens, river fronts among other things.&lt;ref name=pka/&gt; In some cases, the manuscripts are partially lost, some are available only in Tibetan, Nepalese or South Indian languages, while in others original Sanskrit manuscripts are available in different parts of India. Some treatises, or books with chapters on Vaastu Shastra include:&lt;ref name=pka&gt;Acharya P.K.

[[Constructed wetland]]s are used to treat municipal and industrial [[wastewater]] as well as [[stormwater]] runoff. They may also play a role in [[water-sensitive urban design]].

==Definitions==
A patch of land that develops pools of water after a [[rain storm]] would not necessarily be considered a "wetland", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other [[water bodies]] or [[landform]]s based on their [[water level]] and on the types of [[plant]]s that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a [[water table]] that stands at or near the [[land surface]] for a long enough period each year to support [[aquatic plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvwd.net/water_glossary.htm |title= Glossary of Terms |publisher=Carpinteria Valley Water District |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163056/http://www.cvwd.net/water_glossary.htm |archivedate=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mapping2.orr.noaa.gov/portal/calcasieu/calc_html/resources/glossary.html |title=Glossary |publisher=Mapping2.orr.noaa.gov |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163041/http://mapping2.orr.noaa.gov/portal/calcasieu/calc_html/resources/glossary.html |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more concise definition is a community composed of [[hydric soil]] and [[hydrophytes]].&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt;

Wetlands have also been described as [[ecotone]]s, providing a transition between dry land and water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamapower.com/hydro/glossary.asp |title=Glossary |publisher=Alabama Power |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321233304/http://www.alabamapower.com/hydro/glossary.asp |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsch and Gosselink write that wetlands exist "...at the interface between truly [[terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] ecosystems and [[aquatic habitat|aquatic]] systems, making them inherently different from each other, yet highly dependent on both."&lt;ref name="mitsch2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitsch
|first=William J.|first2=James G.|last2=Gosselink|title=Wetlands|edition=4th|date=2007-08-24|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-471-69967-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cSKeTCi894C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In environmental decision-making, there are subsets of definitions that are agreed upon to make regulatory and policy decisions.

===Technical definitions===
[[File:Sunrise at viru bog.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Sunrise at Viru Bog, Estonia]]
A wetland is "an ecosystem that arises when inundation by water produces soils dominated by anaerobic and aerobic processes, which, in turn, forces the biota, particularly rooted plants, to adapt to flooding."{{sfnp|Keddy|2010|p=2}} There are four main kinds of wetlands&amp;nbsp;– [[marsh]], [[swamp]], [[bog]] and [[fen]] (bogs and fens being types of [[mire]]s). Some experts also recognize wet meadows and aquatic ecosystems as additional wetland types.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; The largest wetlands in the world include the swamp forests of the Amazon and the peatlands of Siberia.&lt;ref name="FraserKeddy"/&gt;

====Ramsar Convention definition====
Under the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar international wetland conservation treaty]], wetlands are defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ramsar 40th Anniversary Message for November| publisher = Ramsar| accessdate = 2011-10-10 | url = http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-home/main/ramsar/1_4000_0__}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Article 1.1: "...wetlands are areas of marsh, [[fen]], [[peatland]] or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, [[fresh water|fresh]], [[brackish water|brackish]] or [[saline water|salt]], including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres."
*Article 2.1: "[Wetlands] may incorporate [[riparian]] and coastal zones adjacent to the wetlands, and [[island]]s or bodies of marine water deeper than six metres at [[low tide]] lying within the wetlands."

====Regional definitions====
Although the general definition given above applies around the world, each county and region tends to have its own definition for legal purposes. In the United States, wetlands are defined as "those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/definitions.cfm|title=EPA Regulations listed at 40 CFR 230.3(t)|accessdate=2014-02-18|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been used in the enforcement of the [[Clean Water Act]]. Some US states, such as [[Massachusetts]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have separate definitions that may differ from the federal government's.

In the [[United States Code]], the term wetland is defined "as land that (A) has a predominance of hydric soils, (B) is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions and (C) under normal circumstances supports a prevalence of such vegetation." Related to this legal definitions, the term "normal circumstances" are conditions expected to occur during the wet portion of the growing season under normal climatic conditions (not unusually dry or unusually wet), and in the absence of significant disturbance. It is not uncommon for a wetland to be dry for long portions of the growing season. Wetlands can be dry during the dry season and abnormally dry periods during the wet season, but under normal environmental conditions the soils in a wetland will be saturated to the surface or inundated such that the soils become anaerobic, and those conditions will persist through the wet portion of the growing season.&lt;ref&gt;US Government Publishing Office. (2011) [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/3801 16 U.S. Code Chapter 58 Subchapter I, § 3801 – Definitions]. Legal Information Institute,  Cornell Law School, Ithaca.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The most important factor producing wetlands is [[flooding]]. The duration of flooding or prolonged soil saturation by [[groundwater]] determines whether the resulting wetland has aquatic, [[marsh]] or [[swamp]] [[vegetation]]. Other important factors include fertility, natural disturbance, competition, [[herbivory]], burial and salinity.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; When [[peat]] accumulates, [[bog]]s and [[fen]]s arise.

==Characteristics==
Wetlands vary widely due to local and regional differences in [[topography]], [[hydrology]], [[vegetation]], and other factors, including human involvement.

==Hydrology==
Wetland hydrology is associated with the spatial and temporal dispersion, flow, and physio-chemical attributes of surface and ground water in its reservoirs. Based on hydrology, wetlands can be categorized as [[riverine]] (associated with streams), [[wikt:lacustrine|lacustrine]] (associated with lakes and reservoirs), and [[palustrine]] (isolated). Sources of hydrological flows into wetlands are predominantly [[precipitation]], surface water, and [[groundwater]]. Water flows out of wetlands by [[evapotranspiration]], [[surface runoff]], and subsurface water outflow. [[Hydrodynamics]] (the movement of water through and from a wetland) affects hydro-periods (temporal fluctuations in water levels) by controlling the water balance and water storage within a wetland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=J. L.|last2=Arndt|first2=J. L.|last3=Montgomery|first3=J. A.|date=2001|contribution=Hydrology of wetland and related soils|editor1-first=J. L.|editor1-last=Richardson|editor2-first=M. J.|editor2-last=Vepraskas|title=Wetland Soils|publisher=Lewis Publishers|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape characteristics control wetland hydrology and [[hydrochemistry]]. The [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[concentration (chemistry)|concentrations]] of water depend on [[temperature]] and [[atmospheric pressure]]. Hydrochemistry within wetlands is determined by the [[pH]], [[salinity]], nutrients, [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], soil composition, [[Water hardness|hardness]], and the sources of water. Water chemistry of wetlands varies across landscapes and climatic regions. Wetlands are generally [[minerotrophic]] with the exception of bogs.

Bogs receive most of their water from the [[atmosphere]]; therefore, their water usually has low mineral ionic composition. In contrast, groundwater has a higher concentration of dissolved nutrients and minerals.

The water chemistry of fens ranges from low pH and low minerals to alkaline with high accumulation of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] because they acquire their water from precipitation as well as ground water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitt|first1=D. H.|last2=Chee|first2=W|date=1990|title=The relationships of vegetation to surface water chemistry and peat chemistry in fens of Alberta, Canada|journal=Plant Ecology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=87–106|doi=10.1007/bf00032163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of salinity===

Salinity has a strong influence on wetland water chemistry, particularly in wetlands along the coast.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=B. R.|editor1-last=Silliman|editor2-first=E. D.|editor2-last=Grosholz|editor3-first=M. D.|editor3-last=Bertness|date=2009|title=Human Impacts on Salt Marshes: A Global Perspective|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in regions with large precipitation deficits. In non-riverine wetlands, natural salinity is regulated by interactions between ground and surface water, which may be influenced by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=M. J.|last2=Schreiber|first2=E. S.

===Soil===
[[Carbon]] is the major nutrient cycled within wetlands. Most nutrients, such as [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[carbon]], and [[nitrogen]] are found within the soil of wetlands. [[Anaerobic respiration|Anaerobic]] and [[aerobic respiration]] in the soil influences the nutrient cycling of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponnamperuma|first=F. N.|date=1972|title=The chemistry of submerged soils|journal=Advances in Agronomy|volume=24|pages=29–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the solubility of phosphorus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=P.

Wetlands with low pH and saline conductivity may reflect the presence of acid [[sulfate]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minh|first1=L. Q.|last2=Tuong|first2=T. P.|last3=van Mensvoort|first3=M. E.

[[Biogeochemistry|Biogeochemical processes]] in wetlands are determined by soils with low [[redox]] potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=W. A.|date=1997|title=Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change|edition=2nd|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetland soils are identified by [[redoxymorphic]] mottles or low [[Munsell color system#Chroma|chroma]], as determined by the [[Munsell Color System]].

===Biota===
The [[biota (ecology)|biota]] of a wetland system includes its flora and fauna as described below. The most important factor affecting the biota is the duration of flooding.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; Other important factors include fertility and salinity. In [[fen]]s, species are highly dependent on water chemistry. The chemistry of water flowing into wetlands depends on the source of water and the geological material in which it flows through&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bedford|first=B. L.|date=1996|title=The need to define hydrologic equivalence at the landscape scale for freshwater wetland mitigation|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=1|pages=57–68|doi=10.2307/2269552|jstor=2269552}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the nutrients discharged from organic matter in the soils and plants at higher elevations in slope wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=M.

====Flora====
[[File:Nelumbo nucifera LOTUS bud.jpg|thumb|Bud of ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', an aquatic plant.]]

There are four main groups of [[hydrophyte]]s that are found in wetland systems throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blacktown Council wetlands |accessdate=2011-09-25 |url=http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410125002/http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |archivedate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Submergent plant|Submerged]] wetland vegetation can grow in saline and fresh-water conditions. Some species have underwater flowers, while others have long stems to allow the flowers to reach the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchinson|first1=G. E.|date=1975|title=A Treatise on Limnology. Vol. 3: Limnological Botany|location=New York, NY|publisher=John Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submerged species provide a food source for native fauna, habitat for invertebrates, and also possess filtration capabilities. Examples include [[seagrasses]] and [[Vallisneria|eelgrass]].

Floating water plants or floating vegetation is usually small, like arrow arum (''[[Peltandra virginica]]'').

Trees and shrubs, where they comprise much of the cover in saturated soils, qualify those areas in most cases as [[swamp]]s.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; The upland boundary of swamps is determined partly by water levels. This can be affected by dams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hughes|editor-first=F. M. R.|date=2003|title=The Flooded Forest: Guidance for policy makers and river managers in Europe on the restoration of floodplain forests|series=FLOBAR2, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some swamps can be dominated by a single species, such as [[silver maple]] swamps around the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilcox|first1=D.

====Fauna====
[[File:Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens).jpg|thumb|Many species of [[frog]]s live in wetlands, while others visit them each year to lay eggs.]]
[[File:Snapping turtle 3 md.jpg|thumb|[[Snapping turtle]]s are one of the many kinds of turtles found in wetlands.]]
[[Fish]] are more dependent on wetland ecosystems than any other type of habitat. Seventy-five percent of the United States' commercial fish and shellfish stocks depend solely on estuaries to survive.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"&gt;{{cite web | title=Ramsar Convention Ecosystem Services Benefit Factsheets| accessdate = 2011-09-25 | url = http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-info-ecosystem-services/main/ramsar/1-30-103%5E24258_4000_0__}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical fish species need mangroves for critical hatchery and nursery grounds and the coral reef system for food.

[[Amphibian]]s such as [[frog]]s need both terrestrial and aquatic habitats in which to reproduce and feed. While tadpoles control algal populations, adult frogs forage on insects. Frogs are used as an indicator of [[ecosystem health]] due to their thin skin which absorbs both nutrient and toxins from the surrounding environment resulting in an above average extinction rate in unfavorable and polluted environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savethefrogs.com/why-frogs/ |title=Frogs {{!}} Bioindicators |website=Savethefrogs.com |date=2011 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Reptile]]s such as [[alligator]]s and [[crocodile]]s are common in wetlands of some regions. Alligators occur in fresh water along with the fresh water species of the crocodile.The Florida [[Everglades]] is the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators coexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mazzotti, F.J. |author2=Best, G.R. |author3=Brandt, L.A. |author4=Cherkiss, M.S. |author5=Jeffery, B.M. |author6=Rice, K.G. |year=2009 |title=Alligators and crocodiles as indicators for restoration of Everglades ecosystems |journal=Ecological Indicators 9(6) |page=S137−S149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[saltwater crocodile]] inhabits estuaries and mangroves and can be seen in the coastline bordering the [[Great Barrier Reef]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Messel, H. 1981. Surveys of tidal river systems in the Northern Territory of Australia and their crocodile populations (Vol. 1). Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Snake]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[turtle]]s also can be seen throughout wetlands. [[Snapping turtle]]s are one of the many kinds of turtles found in wetlands.
 
[[Bird]]s, particularly [[waterfowl]] and [[Wader|wading birds]], use wetlands extensively&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Wetland birds: habitat resources and conservation implications |last=Milton |first=W. |date=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0511011368 |location=Cambridge|oclc=50984660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mammal]]s include numerous small and medium-sized species such as [[vole]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[bat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and [[platypus]] in addition to large herbivorous and apex species such as the [[beaver]], [[coypu]], [[swamp rabbit]], [[Florida panther]], and [[moose]]. Wetlands attract many mammals due to abundant seeds, berries, and other vegetation components, as well as abundant populations of prey such as invertebrates, small reptiles and amphibians.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[Insect]]s and [[invertebrate]]s total more than half of the 100,000 known animal species in wetlands. Insects and invertebrates can be submerged in the water or soil, on the surface, and in the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invertebrates in freshwater wetlands of North America : ecology and management|date=1999|publisher=Wiley|others=Batzer, Darold P., Rader, Russell Ben., Wissinger, Scott A.|isbn=978-0471292586|location=New York|oclc=39747651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Algae====

[[Algae]] are diverse water plants that can vary in size, color, and shape. Algae occur naturally in habitats such as inland lakes, inter-tidal zones, and damp soil and provide a dedicated food source for many animals, including some invertebrates, fish, turtles, and frogs. There are three main groups of algae:

*[[Plankton]] are algae which are [[microscopic]], free-floating algae. This algae is so tiny that on average, if 50 of these microscopic algae were lined up end-to-end, it would only measure one millimetre. Plankton are the basis of the food web and are responsible for [[primary production]] in the ocean using photosynthesis to make food.
*[[Filamentous algae]] are long strands of algae cells that form floating mats.
*[[Chara (alga)|''Chara'']] and ''[[Nitella]]'' algae are upright algae that look like a submerged plant with roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |title=Taken from Blacktown Council Wetland Inventory |publisher=Blacktown Council |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122111725/http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |archivedate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climates==
===Temperature===
[[File:MiddleSpring.JPG|thumb|Wetlands contrast the hot, arid landscape around Middle Spring, [[Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Utah]]]]
Wetlands are located in every climatic zone.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Temperatures vary greatly depending on the location of the wetland. Many of the world's wetlands are in [[temperate zone]]s, midway between the North or South Pole and the equator. In these zones, summers are warm and winters are cold, but temperatures are not extreme. In a temperate zone wetland, such as one along the [[Gulf of Mexico]], a typical temperature might be {{convert|11|C|F}}. Wetlands in the [[tropics]] are much warmer for a larger portion of the year. Wetlands on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] can reach temperatures exceeding {{convert|50|C|F}} and would therefore be subject to rapid evaporation. In northeastern [[Siberia]], which has a polar climate, wetland temperatures can be as low as {{convert|−50|C|F}}. [[Peatland]]s insulate the [[permafrost]] in subarctic regions, thus delaying or preventing thawing of [[permafrost]] during summer, as well as inducing the formation of [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ramsar.org/document/peatlands-climate-change-mitigation-and-biodiversity-conservation|title=PEATLANDS, CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|deadurl=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precipitation===
The amount of precipitation a wetland receives varies widely according to its area. Wetlands in [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and western [[Ireland]] typically receive about {{convert|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. In some places in [[Southeast Asia]], where heavy rains occur, they can receive up to {{convert|10000|mm|in|abbr=on}}. In some drier regions, wetlands exist where as little as {{convert|180|mm|in|abbr=on}} precipitation occurs each year. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Uses of wetlands==

Depending partly on a wetland's geographic and topographic location,&lt;ref&gt;Adamus, P.R. and L.T. Stockwell. 1983. ''A Method for Wetland Functional Assessment.'' Vol. I. Critical Review and Evaluation Concepts. FHWA-IP-82-23. Federal Highway Admin., Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; the functions it performs can support multiple [[ecosystem services]], values, or benefits. [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] and [[Ramsar Convention]] described wetlands as a whole to be of [[biosphere]] significance and societal importance in the following areas, for example:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

*[[Flood control|Water storage (flood control)]]
*Groundwater replenishment
*Shoreline stabilisation and storm protection
*[[Water purification]]
*Reservoirs of [[biodiversity]]
*Pollination
*Wetland products
*Cultural values
*Recreation and [[Eco tourism|tourism]]
*[[Climate change mitigation]] and adaptation

According to the Ramsar Convention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The economic worth of the ecosystem services provided to society by intact, naturally functioning wetlands is frequently much greater than the perceived benefits of converting them to 'more valuable' intensive land use – particularly as the profits from unsustainable use often go to relatively few individuals or corporations, rather than being shared by society as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Unless otherwise cited, ecosystem services information is based on the following series of references.''&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

To replace these wetland [[ecosystem services]], enormous amounts of money would need to be spent on [[water purification]] plants, dams, levees, and other hard infrastructure, and many of the services are impossible to replace.

=== Water storage (flood control) ===
''Major wetland type: floodplain and closed-depression wetlands''

'''Storage reservoirs and flood protection:''' The wetland system of [[floodplains]] is formed from major rivers downstream from their [[headwaters]]. "The floodplains of major rivers act as natural storage reservoirs, enabling excess water to spread out over a wide area, which reduces its depth and speed. Wetlands close to the headwaters of streams and rivers can slow down rainwater runoff and spring snowmelt so that it doesn't run straight off the land into water courses. This can help prevent sudden, damaging floods downstream."&lt;ref name="ramsar_a" /&gt; Notable river systems that produce large spans of floodplain include the [[Nile River]], the Niger river inland delta, [the Zambezi River flood plain], [the Okavango River inland delta], [the Kafue River flood plain][the Lake Bangweulu flood plain] (Africa), [[Mississippi River]] (USA), [[Amazon River]] (South America), [[Yangtze River]] (China), [[Danube River]] (Central Europe) and [[Murray-Darling]] River (Australia).

'''Human impact:''' Converting wetlands to upland through drainage and development forces adjoining or downstream water channels into narrower corridors. This accelerates watershed hydrologic response to storm events and this increases the need in some cases for alternative means of flood control. That is because the newly formed channels must manage the same amount of precipitation, causing flood peaks to be [higher or deeper] and floodwaters to travel faster.

Water management engineering developments in the past century have degraded these wetlands through the construction of artificial embankments. These constructions may be classified as [[Levee|dykes]], bunds, [[levees]], [[weirs]], barrages and [[dams]] but serve the single purpose of concentrating water into a select source or area. Wetland water sources that were once spread slowly over a large, shallow area are pooled into deep, concentrated locations. Loss of wetland floodplains results in more severe and damaging flooding. Catastrophic human impact in the Mississippi River floodplains was seen in death of several hundred individuals during a [[levee breach]] in New Orleans caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Ecological catastrophic events from human-made embankments have been noticed along the Yangtze River floodplains since the middle of the river has become prone to more frequent and damaging flooding. Some of these events include the loss of [[riparian vegetation]], a 30% loss of the vegetation cover throughout the river's basin, a doubling of the percentage of the land affected by soil erosion, and a reduction in reservoir capacity through [[siltation]] build-up in floodplain lakes.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

===Groundwater replenishment===
''Major wetland type: [[marsh]], [[swamp]], and subterranean [[karst]] and cave hydrological systems''

The [[surface water]] which is the water visibly seen in wetland systems only represents a portion of the overall water cycle which also includes [[atmospheric water]] and [[groundwater]]. Wetland systems are directly linked to groundwater and a crucial regulator of both the quantity and [[water quality|quality of water]] found below the ground. Wetland systems that are made of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] [[sediment]]s like [[limestone]] or occur in areas with highly variable and fluctuating water tables especially have a role in [[groundwater replenishment]] or [[water recharge]]. Sediments that are [[porous]] allow water to filter down through the soil and overlying rock into [[aquifers]] which are the source of 95% of the world's drinking water. Wetlands can also act as recharge areas when the surrounding water table is low and as a discharge zone when it is too high. [[Karst cave|Karst]] (cave) systems are a unique example of this system and are a connection of underground rivers influenced by rain and other forms of [[precipitation]]. These wetland systems are capable of regulating changes in the water table on upwards of {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

'''Human impact''': Groundwater is an important source of water for [[drinking water|drinking]] and [[irrigation]] of crops. Over 1&amp;nbsp;billion people in Asia and 65% of the public water sources in Europe source 100% of their water from groundwater. Irrigation is a massive use of groundwater with 80% of the world's groundwater used for agricultural production.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

Unsustainable abstraction of groundwater has become a major concern. In the Commonwealth of [[Australia]], water licensing is being implemented to control use of water in major agricultural regions. On a global scale, groundwater deficits and water scarcity is one of the most pressing concerns facing the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

===Shoreline stabilization and storm protection===
''Wetland type: [[Mangrove]]s, [[coral reef]]s, [[salt marsh]]''

{{Main|Integrated coastal zone management}}

Tidal and inter-tidal wetland systems protect and stabilize coastal zones. [[Coral reefs]] provide a protective barrier to coastal shoreline. [[Mangroves]] stabilize the coastal zone from the interior and will migrate with the shoreline to remain adjacent to the boundary of the water. The main conservation benefit these systems have against storms and [[storm surge]]s is the ability to reduce the speed and height of waves and floodwaters.

'''Human impact''': The sheer number of people who live and work near the coast is expected to grow immensely over the next fifty years. From an estimated 200&amp;nbsp;million people that currently live in low-lying coastal regions, the development of urban coastal centers is projected to increase the population by fivefold within 50 years.&lt;ref name="urlUNEP-Home"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The United Kingdom has begun the concept of managed coastal realignment. This management technique provides shoreline protection through restoration of natural wetlands rather than through applied engineering. In East Asia, reclamation of coastal wetlands has resulted in widespread transformation of the coastal zone, and up to 65% of coastal wetlands have been destroyed by coastal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | first1 = J. | last1 = MacKinnon | first2 = Y.

===Water purification===
''Wetland types: floodplain, closed-depression wetlands, [[mudflat]], [[salt marsh]], mangroves''

'''Nutrient retention:''' Wetlands cycle both sediments and nutrients balancing [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystems]]. A natural function of wetland vegetation is the up-take, storage, and (for nitrate) the removal of nutrients found in [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from the surrounding soil and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|title=Letting Nature Do the Job|date=2008-08-01|website=Wild.org|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113192135/http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|archive-date=2013-01-13|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many wetlands, nutrients are retained until plants die or are harvested by animals or humans and taken to another location, or until microbial processes convert soluble nutrients to a gas as is the case with nitrate.

'''Sediment and heavy metal traps:''' Precipitation and surface runoff induces [[soil erosion]], transporting sediment in suspension into and through waterways. These sediments move towards larger and more sizable waterways through a natural process that moves water towards oceans. All types of sediments which may be composed of clay, sand, silt, and rock can be carried into wetland systems through this process. Wetland vegetation acts as a physical barrier to slow water flow and trap sediment for short or long periods of time. Suspended sediment often contains heavy metals that are retained when wetlands trap the sediment. In some cases, certain metals are taken up through wetland plant stems, roots, and leaves. Many floating plant species, for example, can absorb and filter heavy metals. [[Water hyacinth]] (''Eichhornia crassipes''), [[duckweed]] (''Lemna'') and [[water fern]] (''Azolla'') store [[iron]] and [[copper]] commonly found in [[wastewater]]. Many fast-growing plants rooted in the soils of wetlands such as [[cattail]] (''Typha'') and [[Phragmites|reed]] (''Phragmites'') also aid in the role of heavy metal up-take. Animals such as the [[oyster]] can filter more than {{convert|200|L|gal}} of water per day while grazing for food, removing nutrients, suspended sediments, and chemical contaminants in the process. On the other hand, some types of wetlands facilitate the mobilization and bioavailability of mercury (another heavy metal), which in its [[Methylmercury|methyl mercury]] form increases the risk of bioaccumulation in fish important to animal food webs and harvested for human consumption.

'''Capacity:''' The ability of wetland systems to store or remove nutrients and trap sediment and associated metals is highly efficient and effective but each system has a threshold. An overabundance of nutrient input from fertilizer run-off, sewage effluent, or non-point pollution will cause [[eutrophication]]. Upstream erosion from deforestation can overwhelm wetlands making them shrink in size and cause dramatic [[biodiversity loss]] through excessive sedimentation load. Retaining high levels of metals in sediments is problematic if the sediments become resuspended or oxygen and pH levels change at a future time. The capacity of wetland vegetation to store heavy metals depends on the particular metal, oxygen and pH status of wetland sediments and overlying water, water flow rate (detention time), wetland size, season, climate, type of plant, and other factors.

'''Human impact''': The capacity of a wetland to store sediment, nutrients, and metals can be diminished if sediments are compacted such as by vehicles or heavy equipment, or are regularly tilled. Unnatural changes in water levels and water sources also can affect the water purification function. If water purification functions are impaired, excessive loads of nutrients enter waterways and cause [[eutrophication]]. This is of particular concern in temperate coastal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valiela|first1=I.|last2=Collins|first2=G.|last3=Kremer|first3=J.|last4=Lajtha|first4=K.|last5=Geist|first5=M.|last6=Seely|first6=B.|last7=Brawley|first7=J.|last8=Sham|first8=C.

'''Examples:''' An example of how a natural wetland is used to provide some degree of [[sewage treatment]] is the [[East Kolkata Wetlands]] in [[Kolkata, India]]. The wetlands cover {{convert|125|km2|sqmi}}, and are used to treat Kolkata's sewage. The nutrients contained in the wastewater sustain fish farms and agriculture.

===Constructed wetlands===
[[File:Flintenbreite constructed wetland.jpg|thumb|Constructed wetland in an ecological settlement in Flintenbreite near Luebeck, Germany]]
{{main|Constructed wetland}}
The function of most natural wetland systems is not to manage  [[wastewater]]. However, their high potential for the filtering and the treatment of pollutants has been recognized by environmental engineers that specialize in the area of [[Wastewater treatment systems|wastewater treatment]]. These constructed wetland systems are highly controlled environments that intend to mimic the occurrences of soil, flora, and microorganisms in natural wetlands to aid in treating wastewater effluent. Constructed wetlands can be used to treat raw sewage, storm water, agricultural and [[industrial effluent]]. They are constructed with flow regimes, micro-biotic composition, and suitable plants in order to produce the most efficient treatment process. Other advantages of constructed wetlands are the control of [[retention time]]s and [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic]] channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brix|first=H|date=1993|contribution=Wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands: system design, removal processes, and treatment performance|editor-first=A. G.|editor-last=Moshiri|title=Constructed Wetlands for Water Quality Improvement|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important factors of constructed wetlands are the water flow processes combined with plant growth.

Constructed wetland systems can be surface flow systems with only free-floating [[macrophytes]], floating-leaved macrophytes, or submerged macrophytes; however, typical free water surface systems are usually constructed with emergent macrophytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vymazal|first1=J.|last2=Kröpfleova|first2=L.|date=2008|title=Wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=14}}{{page needed|date=January 2017|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsurface flow-constructed wetlands with a vertical or a horizontal flow regime are also common and can be integrated into urban areas as they require relatively little space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoffmann|first1=H.|last2=Platzer|first2=C.|last3=von Münch|first3=E.|last4=Winker|first4=M.|date=2011|url=http://www.susana.org/_resources/documents/default/2-930-giz2011-en-technology-review-constructed-wetlands.pdf |title=Technology review of constructed wetlands – Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment|publisher=[[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]]|location=Eschborn, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reservoirs of biodiversity===

Wetland systems' rich [[biodiversity]] is becoming a focal point at International Treaty Conventions and within the [[World Wildlife Fund]] organization due to the high number of species present in wetlands, the small global geographic area of wetlands, the number of species which are [[endemic]] to wetlands, and the high productivity of wetland systems. Hundred of thousands of animal species, 20,000 of them vertebrates, are living in wetland systems. The discovery rate of fresh water fish is at 200 new species per year. The impact of maintaining biodiversity is seen at the local level through job creation, sustainability, and community productivity. A good example is the Lower Mekong basin which runs through Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Supporting over 55&amp;nbsp;million people, the sustainability of the region is enhanced through wildlife tours. The U.S. state of Florida has estimated that US$1.6&amp;nbsp;billion was generated in state revenue from recreational activities associated with wildlife.

'''Biodiverse river basins:''' The Amazon holds 3,000 species of freshwater fish species within the boundaries of its basin, whose function it is to disperse the seeds of trees. One of its key species, the Piramutaba catfish, ''Brachyplatystoma vaillantii'', migrates more than {{convert|3300|km|mi|abbr=on}} from its nursery grounds near the mouth of the Amazon River to its spawning grounds in Andean tributaries, {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, distributing plants seed along the route.

'''Productive intertidal zones:''' Intertidal mudflats have a level of productivity similar to that of some wetlands even while possessing a low number of species. The abundance of [[invertebrates]] found within the mud are a food source for [[migratory waterfowl]].

'''Critical life-stage habitat:''' Mudflats, saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds have high levels of both species richness and productivity, and are home to important nursery areas for many commercial fish stocks.

'''Genetic diversity:''' Populations of many species are confined geographically to only one or a few wetland systems, often due to the long period of time that the wetlands have been physically isolated from other aquatic sources. For example, the number of [[endemic species]] in [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia classifies it as a hotspot for biodiversity and one of the most biodiverse wetlands in the entire world. Evidence from a research study by Mazepova ''et al.'' suggest that the number of [[crustacean]] species endemic to Baikal Lake (over 690 species and subspecies) exceeds the number of the same groups of animals inhabiting all the fresh water bodies of Eurasia together. Its 150 species of free-living [[Platyhelminthes]] alone is analogous to the entire number in all of Eastern Siberia. The 34 species and subspecies number of [[Baikal sculpins]] is more than twice the number of the analogous fauna that inhabits Eurasia. One of the most exciting discoveries was made by A.&amp;nbsp;V. Shoshin who registered about 300 species of free-living [[nematodes]] using only six near-shore sampling localities in the Southern Baikal. "If we will take into consideration, that about 60% of the animals can be found nowhere else except Baikal, it may be assumed that the lake may be the biodiversity center of the Eurasian continent."&lt;ref name="Baikal"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Timoshkin|editor-first=O. A.|title=Index of animal species inhabiting Lake Baikal and its catchment area. Guides and Keys to Identification of Fauna and Flora of Lake Baikal|edition=1st|volume=1|date=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Novosibirsk, Nauka|isbn=978-5-02-031736-9|work=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MUCsAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human impact:''' Biodiversity loss occurs in wetland systems through land use changes, habitat destruction, pollution, exploitation of resources, and invasive species. Vulnerable, threatened, and [[endangered species]] number at 17% of waterfowl, 38% of fresh-water dependent mammals, 33% of freshwater fish, 26% of freshwater amphibians, 72% of freshwater turtles, 86% of marine turtles, 43% of crocodilians and 27% of coral reef-building species. Introduced hydrophytes in different wetland systems can have devastating results. The introduction of [[water hyacinth]], a native plant of South America into Lake Victoria in East Africa as well as [[duckweed]] into non-native areas of Queensland, Australia, have overtaken entire wetland systems suffocating the wetlands and reducing the diversity of other plants and animals. This is largely due to their phenomenal growth rate and ability to float and grow on the surface of the water.

===Wetland products and productivity===

Wetland productivity is linked to the climate, wetland type, and nutrient availability. Low water and occasional drying of the wetland bottom during [[drought]]s (dry marsh phase) stimulate plant recruitment from a diverse [[seed bank]] and increase productivity by mobilizing nutrients. In contrast, high water during [[deluge (prehistoric)|deluge]]s (lake marsh phase) causes turnover in plant populations and creates greater interspersion of element cover and open water, but lowers overall productivity. During a cover cycle that ranges from open water to complete vegetation cover, annual net primary productivity may vary 20-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=W. C.|last2=Millett|first2=B. V.|last3=Gilmanov|first3=T.|last4=Voldseth|first4=R. A.|last5=Guntenspergen|first5=G. R.|last6=Naugle|first6=D. E.|date=2005|title=Vulnerability of Northern Prairie Wetlands to Climate Change|journal=Bio Science|volume=10|pages=863–872}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grasses of fertile floodplains such as the Nile produce the highest yield including
plants such as ''[[Arundo donax]]'' (giant reed), ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' (papyrus), ''[[Phragmites]]'' (reed) and ''[[Typha]]'' (cattail, bulrush).

Wetlands naturally produce an array of vegetation and other ecological products that can be harvested for personal and commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waterlogged wealth: why waste the world's wet places?|last=Maltby|first=Edward|date=1986|publisher=International Institute for Environment and Development|others=Earthscan.|isbn=978-0905347639|location=London|oclc=18834448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most significant of these is fish which have all or part of their life-cycle occur within a wetland system. Fresh and saltwater fish are the main source of protein for one billion people and comprise 15% of an additional two billion people's diets. In addition, fish generate a fishing industry that provides 80% of the income and employment to residents in developing countries. Another food staple found in wetland systems is rice, a popular grain that is consumed at the rate of one fifth of the total global calorie count. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam, where rice paddies are predominant on the landscape, rice consumption reach 70%.&lt;ref name="ramsar b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-info/main/ramsar/1-31-59_4000_0__|title=The Ramsar Information Sheet on Wetlands of International Importance|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some native wetland plants in the Caribbean and Australia are harvested sustainably for medicinal compounds; these include the red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'') which possesses antibacterial, wound-healing, anti-ulcer effects, and antioxidant properties.&lt;ref name="ramsar b" /&gt;

Food converted to sweeteners and carbohydrates include the [[Cycas revoluta|sago palm]] of Asia and Africa (cooking oil), the [[nipa palm]] of Asia (sugar, vinegar, alcohol, and fodder) and honey collection from mangroves. More than supplemental dietary intake, this produce sustains entire villages. Coastal Thailand villages earn the key portion of their income from sugar production while the country of Cuba relocates more than 30,000 hives each year to track the seasonal flowering of the mangrove ''[[Avicennia]]''.

Other mangrove-derived products:

* Fuelwood
* Salt (produced by evaporating seawater)
* Animal fodder
* Traditional medicines (e.g. from mangrove bark)
* Fibers for textiles
* Dyes and tannins

'''Human impact:''' Over-fishing is the major problem for sustainable use of wetlands. Concerns are developing over certain aspects of farm fishing, which uses natural waterways to harvest fish for human consumption and pharmaceuticals. This practice has become especially popular in Asia and the South Pacific. Its impact upon much larger waterways downstream has negatively affected many small island developing states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/static?%20dom=root&amp;xml=index.xml] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aquaculture]] is continuing to develop rapidly throughout the Asia-Pacific region specifically in China with world holdings in Asia equal to 90% of the total number of aquaculture farms and 80% of its global value.&lt;ref name="ramsar b" /&gt; Some aquaculture has eliminated massive areas of wetland through practices seen such as in the [[shrimp farming]] industry's destruction of mangroves. Even though the damaging impact of large scale shrimp farming on the coastal ecosystem in many Asian countries has been widely recognized for quite some time now, it has proved difficult to check in absence of other employment avenues for people engaged in such occupation. Also burgeoning demand for shrimps globally has provided a large and ready market for the produce

Threats to rice fields mainly stem from inappropriate water management, introduction of invasive alien species, agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, and land use changes. Industrial-scale production of palm oil threatens the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems in parts of southeast Asia, Africa, and other developing countries.

Over-exploitation of wetland products can occur at the community level as is sometimes seen throughout coastal villages of Southern Thailand where each resident may obtain for themselves every consumable of the mangrove forest (fuelwood, timber, honey, resins, crab, and shellfish) which then becomes threatened through increasing population and continual harvest.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Additional functions and uses of wetlands ===
Some types of wetlands can serve as fire breaks that help slow the spread of minor wildfires. Larger wetland systems can influence local precipitation patterns. Some boreal wetland systems in catchment headwaters may help extend the period of flow and maintain water temperature in connected downstream waters. Pollination services are supported by many wetlands which may provide the only suitable habitat for pollinating insects, birds, and mammals in highly developed areas. It is likely that wetlands have other functions whose benefits to society and other ecosystems have yet to be discovered.

==Wetlands and climate change==
Wetlands perform two important functions in relation to climate change. They have mitigation effects through their ability to [[Carbon sink|sink carbon]], converting a greenhouse gas ([[carbon dioxide]]) to solid plant material through the process of [[photosynthesis]], and also through their ability to store and regulate water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2009|title=Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas|location=Washington, DC |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|series=Climate Ready Estuaries Program, EPA 430-F-08-024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetlands store approximately 44.6 million tonnes of carbon per year globally.&lt;ref name="Chmura, G. L. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chmura|first1=G. L.|date=2003|title=Global carbon sequestration in tidal, saline wetland soils|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|volume=17|issue=4|pages=1111|bibcode=2003GBioC..17.1111C|doi=10.1029/2002GB001917}}{{page needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[salt marsh]]es and mangrove swamps in particular, the average carbon sequestration rate is {{nowrap|210 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} while [[peatlands]] sequester approximately {{nowrap|20–30 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Chmura, G.

The ability of many tidal wetlands to store carbon and minimize methane flux from tidal sediments has led to sponsorship of [[blue carbon]] initiatives that are intended to enhance those processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/climate/blue-carbon/2021/|title=More on blue carbon and carbon sequestration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on nitrous oxide fluxes from wetlands in the southern hemisphere are lacking, as are ecosystem-based studies including the role of dominant organisms that alter sediment biogeochemistry. Aquatic invertebrates produce ecologically-relevant nitrous oxide emissions due to ingestion of [[denitrifying bacteria]] that live within the subtidal sediment and water column&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stief|first1=P.|last2=Poulsen|first2=M.|last3=Nielsen|displayauthors=etal|date=2009|title=Nitrous oxide emission by aquatic macrofauna|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=11|pages=4296–4300|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.4296S|doi=10.1073/pnas.0808228106|pmid=19255427|pmc=2651200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may also be influencing nitrous oxide production within some wetlands.

===Peatswamps in Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, [[peatswamp forests]] and soils are being drained, burnt, mined, and overgrazed, contributing severely to climate change.&lt;ref name="wetlands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetlands.org/|title=Wetlands International works to sustain and restore wetlands for people and biodiversity|publisher=Wetlands International|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of peat drainage, the organic carbon that was built up over thousands of years and is normally under water is suddenly exposed to the air. It decomposes and turns into [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is released into the atmosphere. Peat fires cause the same process to occur and in addition create enormous clouds of smoke that cross international borders, such as happens every year in Southeast Asia. While peatlands constitute only 3% of the world's land area, their degradation produces 7% of all [[fossil fuel]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.

Through the building of dams, [[Wetlands International]] is halting the drainage of peatlands in Southeast Asia, hoping to mitigate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Concurrent wetland restoration techniques include reforestation with native tree species as well as the formation of community fire brigades. This sustainable approach can be seen in central [[Kalimantan]] and [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]].

== Wetland Disturbance ==

Wetlands, the functions and services they provide as well as their flora and fauna, can be affected by several types of disturbances. The disturbances (sometimes termed stressors or alterations) can be human-associated or natural, direct or indirect, reversible or not, and isolated or cumulative. When exceeding levels or patterns normally found within wetlands of a particular class in a particular region, the predominant ones include the following&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryID=39147|title=Impacts on quality of inland wetlands of the United States: A survey of indicators, techniques, and applications of community-level biomonitoring data |author=Office of Research &amp; Development|website=cfpub.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323993409|title=Indicators for Monitoring Biological Integrity of Inland Freshwater Wetlands: A Survey of North American Technical Literature (1990-2000)|last=Adamus|first=Paul|last2=J.

Disturbances can be further categorized as follows:

;Minor disturbance

;Moderate disturbance
:Ecosystem integrity is damaged but can recover in time without assistance.&lt;ref name="clewell2013" /&gt;
;Impairment or severe disturbance
:Human intervention may be needed in order for ecosystem to recover.&lt;ref name="clewell2013" /&gt;

Just a few of the many sources of these disturbances are&lt;ref name="wetlands" /&gt;

** Drainage
** Development
** Over-grazing
**[[Mining]]
** Unsustainable water use
*They can be manifested partly as:
**[[Water Scarcity]]
**[[Endangered|Impacts to Endangered]] species
** Disruption of wildlife breeding grounds
** Imbalance in sediment load and nutrient filtration

==Conservation==

[[File:Hommik Mukri rabas.jpg|thumb|Fog rising over the Mukri bog near [[Mukri, Estonia]]. The bog has an area of {{convert|2147|ha}} and has been protected since 1992.]]
Wetlands have historically been the victim of large draining efforts for [[real estate development]], or [[flooding]] for use as recreational [[lake]]s or [[hydropower]] generation. Some of the world's most important agricultural areas are wetlands that have been converted to farmland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=G.

In order to maintain wetlands and sustain their functions, alterations and disturbances that are outside the normal range of variation should be minimized.

===Balancing wetland conservation with the needs of people===
Wetlands are vital ecosystems that provide livelihoods for the millions of people who live in and around them. The [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) called for different sectors to join forces to secure wetland environments in the context of sustainable development and improving human wellbeing. A three-year project carried out by Wetlands International in partnership with the [[International Water Management Institute]] found that it is possible to conserve wetlands while improving the livelihoods of people living among them. Case studies conducted in Malawi and Zambia looked at how [[dambo]]s – wet, grassy valleys or depressions where water seeps to the surface – can be farmed sustainably to improve livelihoods. Mismanaged or overused dambos often become degraded, however, using a knowledge exchange between local farmers and environmental managers, a protocol was developed using soil and water management practices. Project outcomes included a high yield of crops, development of sustainable farming techniques, and adequate water management generating enough water for use as irrigation. Before the project, there were cases where people had died from starvation due to food shortages. By the end of it, many more people had access to enough water to grow vegetables. A key achievement was that villagers had secure food supplies during long, dry months. They also benefited in other ways: nutrition was improved by growing a wider range of crops, and villagers could also invest in health and education by selling produce and saving money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good practices and lessons learned in integrating ecosystem conservation and poverty reduction objectives in wetlands|url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/wn/w.n.iwmi_poverty_report.pdf|publisher=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands|accessdate= 2011-11-19|date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramsar Convention===
{{Main|Ramsar Convention|List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance}}
''The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat'', or Ramsar Convention, is an international [[treaty]] designed to address global concerns regarding wetland loss and degradation. The primary purposes of the treaty are to list wetlands of international importance and to promote their wise use, with the ultimate goal of preserving the world's wetlands. Methods include restricting access to the majority portion of wetland areas, as well as educating the public to combat the misconception that wetlands are wastelands. The Convention works closely with five International Organisation Partners. These are: [[Birdlife International]], the [[IUCN]], the [[International Water Management Institute]], [[Wetlands International]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]. The partners provide technical expertise, help conduct or facilitate field studies and provide financial support. The IOPs also participate regularly as observers in all meetings of the Conference of the Parties and the Standing Committee and as full members of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel.

==Valuation==

The value of a wetland to local communities, as well as the value of wetland systems generally to the earth and to humankind, is one of the most important valuations that can be conducted for [[sustainable development]]. This typically involves first mapping a region's wetlands, then assessing the functions and ecosystem services the wetlands provide individually and cumulatively, and evaluating that information to prioritize or rank individual wetlands or wetland types for conservation, management, restoration, or development. Over a longer period, it requires keeping inventories of known wetlands and monitoring a representative sample of the wetlands to determine changes due to both natural and human factors. Such a valuation process is used to educate decision-makers such as governments of the importance of particular wetlands within their jurisdiction.

===Assessment===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Rapid assessment methods are used to score, rank, rate, or categorize various functions, [[ecosystem services]], species, communities, levels of disturbance, and/or [[ecological health]] of a wetland or group of wetlands. This is often done to prioritize particular wetlands for conservation (avoidance) or to determine the degree to which loss or alteration of wetland functions should be compensated, such as by restoring degraded wetlands elsewhere or providing additional protections to existing wetlands. Rapid assessment methods are also applied before and after a wetland has been restored or altered, to help monitor or predict the effects of those actions on various wetland functions and the services they provide. Assessments are typically considered to be "rapid" when they require only a single visit to the wetland lasting less than one day, which in some cases may include interpretation of aerial imagery and [[GIS]] analyses of existing spatial data, but not detailed post-visit laboratory analyses of water or biological samples. Due to time and cost constraints, the levels of various wetland functions or other attributes are usually not measured directly but rather are estimated relative to other assessed wetlands in a region, using observation-based variables, sometimes called "indicators", that are hypothesized or known to predict performance of the specified functions or attributes.

To achieve consistency among persons doing the assessment, rapid methods present indicator variables as questions or checklists on standardized data forms, and most methods standardize the scoring or rating procedure that is used to combine question responses into estimates of the levels of specified functions relative to the levels estimated in other wetlands ("calibration sites") assessed previously in a region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://people.oregonstate.edu/~adamusp/WESP/Manual_WESP1.3_13Oct2016_Adamus.pdf |title=Manual for the Wetland Ecosystem Services Protocol (WESP)|last=Adamus|first=P. |date= 2016|website=Oregon State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid assessment methods, partly because they often use dozens of indicators pertaining to conditions surrounding a wetland as well as within the wetland itself, aim to provide estimates of wetland functions and services that are more accurate and repeatable than simply describing a wetland's class type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= |chapter= |editor=Dorney, J. |editor2=Savage, R. |editor3=Tiner, R.W. |editor4=Adamus, P. |title=Wetland and Stream Rapid Assessments: Development, Validation, and Application |date=2018 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-12-805091-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A need for wetland assessments to be rapid arises mostly when government agencies set deadlines for decisions affecting a wetland, or when the number of wetlands needing information on their functions or condition is large.

In North America and a few other countries, standardized rapid assessment methods for wetlands have a long history, having been developed, calibrated, tested, and applied to varying degrees in several different regions and wetland types since the 1970s. However, few rapid assessment methods have been fully validated. Done correctly, validation is a very expensive endeavor that involves comparing rankings of a series of wetlands based on results from rapid assessment methods with rankings based on less rapid and considerably more costly, multi-visit, detailed measurements of levels of the same functions or other attributes in the same series of wetlands.

===Inventory===

Although developing a global inventory of wetlands has proven to be a large and difficult undertaking, many efforts at more local scales have been successful. Current efforts are based on available data, but both classification and spatial resolution have sometimes proven to be inadequate for regional or site-specific environmental management decision-making. It is difficult to identify small, long, and narrow wetlands within the landscape. Many of today's remote sensing satellites do not have sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to monitor wetland conditions, although multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data may offer improved spatial resolutions once it is 4&amp;nbsp;m or higher. Majority of the pixels are just mixtures of several plant species or vegetation types and are difficult to isolate which translates into an inability to classify the vegetation that defines the wetland. Improved remote sensing information, coupled with good knowledge domain on wetlands will facilitate expanded efforts in wetland monitoring and mapping. This will also be extremely important because we expect to see major shifts in species composition due to both anthropogenic land use and natural changes in the environment caused by climate change.

===Monitoring===

A wetland needs to be monitored over time to assess whether it is functioning at an ecologically sustainable level or whether it is becoming degraded. Degraded wetlands will suffer a loss in water quality, loss of sensitive species, and aberrant functioning of soil geochemical processes.

'''Mapping'''

Practically, many natural wetlands are difficult to monitor from the ground as they are quite often are difficult to access and may require exposure to dangerous plants and animals as well as diseases borne by insects or other invertebrates..Therefore, mapping using aerial imagery is one effective tool to monitor a wetland, especially a large wetland, and can also be used to monitor the status of numerous wetlands throughout a watershed or region. Many remote sensing methods can be used to map wetlands. Remote-sensing technology permits the acquisition of timely digital data on a repetitive basis. This repeat coverage allows wetlands, as well as the adjacent land-cover and land-use types, to be monitored seasonally and/or annually. Using digital data provides a standardized data-collection procedure and an opportunity for data integration within a [[geographic information system]]. Traditionally, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and the SPOT 4 and 5 satellite systems have been used for this purpose. More recently, however, multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data, with spatial resolutions of {{convert|4|by|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.44|by|2.44|m|ft|abbr=on}}, respectively, have been shown to be excellent sources of data when mapping and monitoring smaller wetland habitats and vegetation communities.

For example, Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District assessed area wetlands in Michigan, USA, using remote sensing. Through using this technology, satellite images were taken over a large geographic area and extended period. In addition, using this technique was less costly and time-consuming compared to the older method using visual interpretation of [[aerial photographs]]. In comparison, most aerial photographs also require experienced interpreters to extract information based on structure and texture while the interpretation of remote sensing data only requires analysis of one characteristic (spectral).

However, there are a number of limitations associated with this type of image acquisition. Analysis of wetlands has proved difficult because to obtain the data it is often linked to other purposes such as the analysis of land cover or land use.

'''Further improvements'''

Methods to develop a classification system for specific biota of interest could assist with technological advances that will allow for identification at a very high accuracy rate. The issue of the cost and expertise involved in remote sensing technology is still a factor hindering further advancements in image acquisition and data processing. Future improvements in current wetland vegetation mapping could include the use of more recent and better geospatial data when it is available.

==Restoration==
Restoration and [[Restoration ecology|restoration ecologists]] intend to return wetlands to their natural trajectory by aiding directly with the natural processes of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=clewell2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clewell|first1=AF|last2=Aronson|first2=J|title=Ecological restoration|date=2013|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; These direct methods vary with respect to the degree of physical manipulation of the natural environment and each are associated with different levels of restoration.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Restoration is needed after disturbance or [[Disturbance (ecology)|perturbation]] of a wetland.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Disturbances include [[Exogeny|exogenous]] factors such as flooding or drought.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Other external damage may be [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbance caused by clear-cut harvesting of trees, oil and gas extraction, poorly defined infrastructure installation, over grazing of livestock, ill-considered recreational activities, alteration of wetlands including dredging, draining, and filling, and other negative human impacts.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="mitsch2007" /&gt; Disturbance puts different levels of stress on an environment depending on the type and duration of disturbance.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; There is no one way to restore a wetland and the level of restoration required will be based on the level of disturbance although, each method of restoration does require preparation and administration.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;

*

===Levels of restoration===
;Factors influencing selected approach may include&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;
*Budget
*Time scale limitations
*Project goals
*Level of disturbance
*Landscape and ecological constraints
*Political and administrative agendas
*Socioeconomic priorities

# '''Prescribed Natural Regeneration'''
#: There are no biophysical manipulation and the ecosystem is left to recover based on the process of [[Ecological succession|succession]] alone.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; The focus of this method is to eliminate and prevent further disturbance from occurring.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; In order for this type of restoration to be effective and successful there must be prior research done to understand the probability that the wetland will recover with this method.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Otherwise, some biophysical manipulation may be required to enhance the rate of succession to an acceptable level determined by the project managers and ecologists.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; This is likely to be the first method of approach for the lowest level of disturbance being that it is the least intrusive and least costly.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; 
# '''Assisted Natural Regeneration'''
#: There are some biophysical manipulations however they are non-intrusive.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Example methods that are not limited to wetlands include prescribed burns to small areas, promotion of site specific soil [[microbiota]] and plant growth using nucleation planting whereby plants radiate from an initial planting site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corbin|first1=JD|last2=Holl|first2=KD|title=Applied nucleation as a forest restoration strategy|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|date=2012|volume=256|pages=37–46|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2011.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion of niche diversity or increasing the range of niches to promote use by a variety of different species.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; These methods can make it easier for the natural species to flourish by removing competition from their environment and can speed up the process of succession.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;
# '''Partial Reconstruction'''
#: Here there is a mix between natural regeneration and manipulated environmental control.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; These manipulations may require some engineering and more invasive biophysical manipulation including ripping of [[subsoil]], [[Agrochemical|agrichemical]] applications such as herbicides and insecticides, laying of mulch, mechanical seed dispersal, and tree planting on a large scale.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; In these circumstances the wetland is impaired and without human assistance it would not recover within an acceptable period of time determined by ecologists.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Again these methods of restoration will have to be considered on a site by site basis as each site will require a different approach based on levels of disturbance and ecosystem dynamics.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;
# '''Complete Reconstruction'''
#: The most expensive and intrusive method of reconstruction requiring engineering and ground up reconstruction.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Because there is a redesign of the entire ecosystem it is important that the natural trajectory of the ecosystem be considered and that the plant species will eventually return the ecosystem towards its natural trajectory.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;

=== Important considerations ===

* Constructed wetlands can take 10–100 years to fully resemble the vegetative composition of a natural wetland.
* Artificial wetlands do not have hydric soil. The soil has very low levels of organic carbon and total nitrogen compared to natural wetland systems, and this reduces the performance of several functions.
* Organic matter added to degraded natural wetlands can in some cases help restore their productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=T. M.|last2=Davis|first2=S.

In 1998, a statute enacted by the legislature of the State of Alabama amended the obscenity provisions of the Alabama Code to make the distribution of certain defined sexual devices a criminal offense. Vendors and users of such devices filed a constitutional challenge to the statute in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama]] against [[William H. Pryor, Jr.]], in his official capacity as the Attorney General of the State of Alabama.&lt;ref name="NDAla"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Williams v. Pryor |vol=41 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=1257 |pinpoint= |court=N.D. Ala. |date=1999 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/41/1257/2411577/ |accessdate=2017-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district court declined to hold the statute violated any constitutional right but determined the statute was unconstitutional because it lacked a rational basis.&lt;ref name="NDAla"/&gt; The State appealed to the [[Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], which reversed the lower court ruling on October 12, 2000.&lt;ref name="11thCir1"/&gt;

==Background==

After the 1998 amendment, the Alabama Code obscenity provisions provide the following:
''It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly distribute, possess with intent to distribute, or offer or agree to distribute any obscene material or any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs for any thing of pecuniary value.''

A first violation is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $10,000 and up to one year of jail or hard labor; a subsequent violation is a class C felony.  The State conceded the statute's proscription of the distribution of sexual devices in Alabama does not apply to devices acquired as gifts or by purchases in another state. The statute also does not restrict possession or use of a sexual device by an individual, but only the commercial distribution of the devices. 
After considering Supreme Court precedent, the District Court determined the statute does not implicate previously recognized fundamental constitutional rights. The court also declined to extend those rights to provide a fundamental right to the use of sexual devices  The district court next reviewed the statute under rational basis scrutiny and concluded the statute lacked a rational basis. The court accordingly held the statute unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction against its enforcement.&lt;ref name="NDAla"/&gt;

==Eleventh Circuit ruling==
The Circuit Court explained that whether a statute is constitutional is determined in large part by the level of scrutiny applied by the courts. Statutes that infringe fundamental rights, or that make distinctions based upon suspect classifications such as race or national origin, are subject to [[strict scrutiny]], which requires that the statute be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.  Most statutes reviewed under the very stringent strict scrutiny standard are found to be unconstitutional.  Quoting ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', the Circuit Court stated that "if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold the [law] so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end."&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v. Pryor'', 240 F.3d at 948, quoting {{ussc|name=Romer v. Evans|link=|volume=517|page=620|pin=632|year=1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Court, almost every statute subject to the very deferential [[Rational basis review|rational basis]] scrutiny standard is found to be constitutional.

The Circuit Court concluded that the district court erred in determining the Alabama statute lacks a rational basis. It found that the State's interest in public morality is a legitimate interest rationally served by the statute, and that the crafting and safeguarding of public morality has long been an established part of the States' plenary police power to legislate and indisputably is a legitimate government interest under rational basis scrutiny.

The Court rejected plaintiffs argument that the statute is constitutionally irrational because it is contrary to a wide spectrum of public and professional opinions which recognize numerous legitimate and beneficial uses of sexual devices, especially the necessity of sexual devices for some persons to achieve medical or emotional health. The Court said that however misguided the legislature of Alabama may have been in enacting the statute challenged in this case, the statute is not constitutionally irrational under rational basis scrutiny because it is rationally related to the State's legitimate power to protect its view of public morality. "The Constitution presumes that ... improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted."&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v. Pryor'', 240 F.3d at 952, quoting {{ussc|name=Vance v. Bradley|link=|volume=440|page=93|pin=97|year=1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court remanded the [[as-applied challenge]]s for consideration by the district court because the record and stipulations were too narrow to permit the Court to decide whether or to what extent the Alabama statute infringes a fundamental right to sexual privacy of the specific plaintiffs in this case.

==Subsequent challenges==
In December 2003 the Supreme court ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' which overturned the previous decision of ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' In light of this the [[ACLU]] again challenged the decision before the 11th Circuit in February 2007. The 11th circuit ruled that even though ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' had been overruled that in doing so the Supreme Court had

&lt;blockquote&gt;"declined the invitation" to recognize a fundamental right to sexual privacy, which would have compelled us to employ strict scrutiny in assessing the constitutionality of the challenged statute ... Thus, because there is no fundamental right at issue, we apply rational basis scrutiny to the challenged statute.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ... Accordingly, we find that public morality survives as a rational basis for legislation even after ''Lawrence'', and we find that in this case the State's interest in the preservation of public morality remains a rational basis for the challenged statute. By upholding the statute, we do not endorse the judgment of the Alabama legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Williams v. Morgan |vol=478 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1316 |pinpoint=1320-23 |court=11th Cir. |date=2007 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/478/1316/473287/ |accessdate=2017-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Reliable Consultants Inc. v. Earle]],'' on February 12, 2008, the 5th Circuit overturned the Texas ban on the sale of sex toys using the similar facts that failed in the above appeal. It held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as in ''Lawrence'', the State here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the State is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification for the statute after ''Lawrence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Reliable Consultants Inc. v. Earle |vol=517 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=738 |pinpoint=746 |court=5th Cir. |date=2008 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/20081255517f3d73811253 |accessdate=2017-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[This That and the Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga.]],'' the 11th Circuit struck down on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds a Georgia law that banned advertising obscene material, including sex toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=This That and the Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v.
