'''Alexander Lang Elder''' (18 April 1815 – 5 September 1885) was a businessman and politician in colonial South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Fayette Gosse, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/elder-alexander-lang-3888/text5319 'Elder, Alexander Lang (1815–1885)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1972, accessed online 28 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amado Boudou''' ({{IPA-es|aˈmaðo βuˈðu}}; born 19 November 1962) is an Argentine businessman and politician who served as the [[Vice President of Argentina]] from 2011 to 2015. He was previously [[Minister of Economy of Argentina|Minister of the Economy]] from 2009 to 2011.

In August 2018, following a [[Boudougate|lengthy investigation]], he was convicted of corruption. He was then sentenced to five years and ten months in prison, and banned for life from holding public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Argentina's former Vice-President Amado Boudou jailed for corruption |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45104286 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Amado Boudou was born in [[Buenos Aires]], in 1962. His father, also named Amado, was born to a [[French Argentine|French immigrant]] from [[Aveyron]] named ''Aimé'', and this became a nickname for both.&lt;ref name=nacion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1149568-quien-es-amado-boudou|title=¿Quién es Amado Boudou?|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in the ocean-front city of [[Mar del Plata]] and enrolled in the [[National University of Mar del Plata]], where he received a degree in economics, in 1986; described by acquaintances as a sociable type and fond of the bass guitar, he helped produce a number of rock concerts in Mar del Plata in his days as a student, including a festival attended by 15,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt;&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://www.consejo.org.ar/Cv05/boudou_amado.htm Amado Boudou: curriculum vitae] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudou attended graduate courses in economics and was awarded a master's degree in economics by a private institution, the [[Universidad del CEMA|Argentine Macroeconomic Studies Center]] (CEMA), which is well-known locally for its support of [[neo-liberal]] and [[free market]] policies.&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt; Boudou was then brought in as a salesman by Venturino Ehisur S.A. (a local sanitation services company). Following his role in securing a number of lucrative hospital contracts for the company, he was named general manager in 1992 of their government contracts office. The company closed, however, when one of its top municipal clients terminated the contract in 1995.&lt;ref name=perfil&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2008/10/25/noticia_0015.html ''Perfil'' (25 October 2008)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then co-founded Ecoplata S.A., another sanitation services firm, and acted as its project manager; Ecoplata was awarded sanitation contracts by the resort cities of [[Villa Gesell]] and [[Pinamar]].&lt;ref name=cv /&gt; He married Daniela Andriuolo in 1993, but they were divorced five years later; they had no children.&lt;ref name=historia /&gt;

Boudou entered public service in 1998, when he was named to the Comptroller's Office of the National Social Security Administration ([[ANSES]]) by Economy Minister [[Roque Fernández]] (a fellow CEMA alumnus),&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt; and in February 2001, he was named that office's general manager. The election of [[Justicialist Party]] candidate Juan Pablo de Jesús as Mayor of the sea-side [[La Costa Partido|La Costa District]] resulted in Boudou's appointment as Finance Secretary for the popular resort district, which the policy maker accepted.&lt;ref name=cv /&gt;

The Finance Secretary subscribed to the 2005 Federal Housing Plan promulgated by President [[Néstor Kirchner]], a decision which made La Costa eligible for 486 low-income housing units. The contract, awarded to local builder Cantera FC in May 2005 for nearly US$10&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt; was followed by Boudou's return to the ANSES, in January 2006.&lt;ref name=nacion /&gt; The Cantera FC contract resulted in an administrative debacle, however, when the builder abandoned the works in June 2007, having by then received over US$7&amp;nbsp;million in payments (for which the Mayor never initiated litigation).&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt;

== National policy maker ==
Returned to the ANSES by its Director, [[Sergio Massa]], Boudou was named its Financial Director (a post second only to the director's in importance), and oversaw the voluntary conversion of several million private pension accounts to the ANSES' aegis when this choice was made available in December 2006. He was appointed its Director in October 2008, after Massa's promotion to the powerful post of Presidential Cabinet Chief.&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt;

Boudou's appointment coincided with President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]'s controversial decision to transfer loss-plagued private [[pension funds]]' assets of nearly US$30&amp;nbsp;billion to the ANSES, citing the cost of subsidizing 77% of the funds' beneficiaries and the effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2008|international crisis]] on the government's ability to obtain financing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/10/20/elpais/p-01785008.htm "Analizan cambios profundos en el sistema de jubilación privada"] ''Clarín'' (20 October 2008) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ruling [[Front for Victory]]'s defeat in the June 2009 [[Argentine legislative election, 2009|mid-term elections]], Economy Minister [[Carlos Rafael Fernández]] tendered his resignation to the President, effective 7 July, and was replaced by the ANSES Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/07/07/um/m-01954438.htm "Tras la dura derrota electoral, Cristina cambia medio Gabinete"], ''Clarín'' (7 July 2009) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallout from the international, [[2008 financial crisis]] later forced the left-wing Argentine government of President [[Cristina Kirchner]] to seek domestic financing for growing public spending, as well as for [[foreign debt]] service obligations. These policies and ongoing [[capital flight]] put further pressure on the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]]'s ability to finance debt service obligations, and the president ordered a US$6.7&amp;nbsp;billion account opened at the Central Bank for the latter purpose in December 2009, implying the use of the Central Bank's [[foreign exchange reserve]]s, and drawing direct opposition from the institution's President, [[Martín Redrado]]; Redrado was ultimately forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2010/01/22/um/m-02125286.htm "Aníbal Fernández: 'Redrado no entra más al Banco Central'"], ''Clarín'' (22 January 2010) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudou presented a [[Debt restructuring|debt swap]] package on 3 May 2010, for the holders of over US$18&amp;nbsp;billion in bonds who did not participate in the 2005 [[Argentine debt restructuring]] prepared by former Economy Minister [[Roberto Lavagna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2010/5/3/un-487506.asp ''Los Andes'' (3 May 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/63mtJIrUB?url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2010/5/3/un-487506.asp |date=8 December 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Holdout problem|holdouts]] include numerous [[vulture fund]]s which had eschewed the 2005 offer, and had instead resorted to the courts in a bid for higher returns on their defaulted bonds. These disputes had led to a number of liens against central bank accounts in New York and, indirectly, to reduced Argentine access to international credit markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2010/01/12/um/m-02118566.htm "Embargaron fondos del Central en EE.UU. y el Gobierno volvió a denunciar maniobras desestabilizadoras"], ''Clarín'' (12 January 2010) {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 Boudou compared Candelaria de la Sota and Martín Kanenguiser, journalists from ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' and ''[[La Nación]]'', with the people cleaning the gas chambers during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1313281 Agresión de Boudou a periodistas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanenguiser requested clarification, but Boudou instead defended his statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1314013 La agresión de Boudou a periodistas fue un agravio para toda la sociedad] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attack was condemned by the FOPEA (an organization of journalists), members of the legislature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1314035 Críticas a Boudou por la agresión a dos periodistas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[DAIA]].&lt;ref name="daia"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1313539 Unánime rechazo al ministro] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DAIA accused him of trivializing the holocaust, and Congressman [[Eduardo Amadeo]] demanded his resignation;&lt;ref name="daia" /&gt; Boudou later stated that this was a badly chosen metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1314115 "Se trató de una metáfora inadecuada", dijo Boudou tras la agresión a periodistas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economy Minister announced his bid for the office of [[Mayor of Buenos Aires]] in December 2010 as a candidate in the [[Front for Victory]] primaries ahead of the 2011 race; hoping to solidify his base among the country's influential trade unions, he made the announcement at the headquarters of SMATA (the machinists' and auto workers' union).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elargentino.com/nota-119189-Boudou-lanza-su-candidatura-a-Jefe-de-Gobierno.html ''El Argentino'': Boudou lanza su precandidatura a Jefe de Gobierno] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723093419/http://www.elargentino.com/nota-119189-Boudou-lanza-su-candidatura-a-Jefe-de-Gobierno.html |date=23 July 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, Senator [[Daniel Filmus]] was nominated in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1375035-elecciones-en-la-capital-reunion-en-olivos-para-definir-candidatos|title=Filmus-Tomada, la fórmula kirchnerista para la Capital|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial and conviction ===
{{Main|Boudougate}}
The vice president faced accusations of [[influence peddling]] in 2012 regarding contracts awarded by the Economy Ministry to Ciccone Printing for the supply of 100 peso bills, license plates, and other government issues. The controversy arose following statements made by the ex-wife of Ciccone executive Alejandro Vanderbroele to the effect that Boudou was his [[Sleeping partner|silent partner]] in the firm. It was alleged that [[César Guido Forcieri]], who had previously worked under Boudou, had made the connection between the two men. Pursuant to prosecutor Carlos Rívolo's request and following news that the [[Puerto Madero]] condominium rented by Boudou was owned by a friend of Vanderbroele who had, moreover, borrowed funds from Boudou, Judge Daniel Rafecas ordered the residence searched for proof of business associations between Vanderbroele and the vice president;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Allanaron-Amado-Boudou-Puerto-Madero_0_676132617.html|title=Operativo judicial en un departamento de Boudou|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt; a receipt for one month of [[homeowner association]] dues owed by the condominium's owner, Fabián Carosso, and paid instead by Vanderbroele was located in the search on 4 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2012/04/04/politica-16779-otra-operacion-de-clarin-vandenbroele-no-pago-expensas-de-boudou.php|title=Otra operación de Clarín: Vandenbroele no pagó expensas de Boudou|work=Info News|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an August 2013 judicial ruling ordering prosecutors to provide evidence of wrongdoing, and their subsequent failure to do so, on 11 September a Federal Court granted a motion by Boudou's attorneys that would allow them to file for a [[Nolle prosequi|dismissal of charges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/Guio-judicial-a-Boudou-podria-pedir-su-sobreseimiento-en-el-caso-Ciccone-20130911-0025.html|title=Guiño judicial a Boudou: podría pedir su sobreseimiento en el caso Ciccone|work=Perfil|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, indicted on [[Bribery#Forms of bribery|passive bribery]] and influence peddling charges by Judge Ariel Lijo on 27 June 2014; Boudou appealed the indictment on 10 July, alleging [[malicious prosecution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buenosairesherald.com/article/164256/vp-amado-boudou-files-appeal-against-corruption-indictment|title=VP Amado Boudou files appeal against corruption indictment|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boudou is also being investigated for several other offenses and/or crimes, and is a defendant in a total of ten cases in the Federal Courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/politica/Boudou-suma-diez-causas-en-la-Justicia-federal-20140629-0053.html Boudou suma diez causas en la Justicia federal], Perfil, 29 June 2014 (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2017, Boudou was arrested on charges of [[money laundering]] and [[racketeering]], during the ongoing trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Argentina VP Boudou arrested in corruption case|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-corruption/ex-argentina-vp-boudou-arrested-in-corruption-case-idUSKBN1D317J|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ended in August 2018, and he was sentenced to five years and ten months.

Boudou claims that he is a victim of political persecution.&lt;ref name="jailed" /&gt; He said that the "alleged bribe has no basis or link to the evidence because it didn’t exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/08/08/world/politics-diplomacy-world/argentine-ex-vice-president-amado-boudou-convicted-corruption-former-president-cristina-kirchner/#.W2s7S9ThBkg|title=Argentine ex-Vice President Amado Boudou convicted for corruption under former President Cristina Kirchner|author=|date=8 August 2018|publisher=The Japan Times|accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications and awards ==

=== The Business Intelligence System ===

The Business Intelligence System published in 1988, co-authored with Tamar Gilad, was the first publication to introduce a model for a formal competitive intelligence function to the corporate world.  This model has been adopted by an overwhelming number of large companies in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="ben2"/&gt;

=== Business Blind Spots ===

Business Blind Spots, first published in 1994 with a second edition appearing in 1998, is about the important role of intelligence in a business, and what happens when managers choose to ignore intelligence and allow blind spots to persist.  The book also stresses the importance of the human aspect of intelligent corporations.  In the book, Dr. Gilad maintains that hardware and software are not the solutions to the weakness in corporations; instead the solutions are the application of human-led systems and structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infonortics.com/publications/giladbb.html Publisher Web Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224051140/http://www.infonortics.com/publications/giladbb.html |date=February 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the first book to introduce the blind spots war game methodology.&lt;ref name="ben2" /&gt; The book was called "inspirational" &lt;ref&gt;http://thoughtblender.blogspot.com/2007_09_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt; and has been sold out in weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Albagli, A., W.A Baldwin and K. K. Coker. Book Review. The Journal of Technology Transfer, Vol. 22, No.1, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Warning ===

Early warning, published in 2003, is about limiting surprise in the business world.  The book covers the strategic early warning process model first written about by Dr. Gilad in 2001.&lt;ref name="ben2" /&gt;  It also covers developing a Competitive Early Warning system to avoid such surprises, manage risk effectively, and avoid “industrial dissonance,” which is when market realities outpace corporate strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amanet.org/books/book.cfm?isbn=9780814407868 American Management Association Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Gilad's Early Warning System has been quoted by Philip Kotler as one of the effective tools management can use in managing chaotic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P. and J. Castlione. Chaotics: The Business of Managing and Marketing in the Age of Turbulence. Amacom, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business War Games ===

Business War Games (2009) is both about the theory of, and a practical manual for, running simple, reality-based war games throughout a company, enabling managers at all levels to formulate better strategies.  War games are simulations of competitive dynamics in a business’ given market with the goal of “pressure testing” product, market, or the whole business unit’s strategic plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bengilad.com/business_war_games.php Business War Games Overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403025605/http://www.bengilad.com/business_war_games.php |date=April 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book shows steps, and practical details, on how to decide whether war gaming is necessary, and which decisions to use it for.  It also covers: how to prepare, run, and organize an inexpensive game, how to predict competitor moves with accuracy and little information, and why one does not need computers, consultants, or specialized software to conduct such games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1601630301 Editorial Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Articles ===

Dr. Gilad has written multiple articles related to the field of Competitive Intelligence.  These articles appear in multiple CI related publications and on multiple web sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyci.com/ResourceCenter/#bgart Academy of CI Article List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302093248/http://www.academyci.com/ResourceCenter/#bgart |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===

In 1996 Dr. Gilad was awarded the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] Meritorious Award.  This award is given to a single individual each year that has made significant and meritorious contributions to the competitive intelligence profession.  He was the second of the three Academy of Competitive Intelligence founders to be given the award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scip.org/content.cfm?itemnumber=592&amp;navItemNumber=2236 SCIP Meritorious Award Winners List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110202204/http://www.scip.org/content.cfm?itemnumber=592&amp;navItemNumber=2236 |date=November 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cagiva''' was an Italian [[motorcycle]] manufacturer. It was founded in 1950 by Giovanni Castiglioni in [[Varese]], originally producing small metal components. Giovanni's sons, Claudio and Gianfranco Castiglioni went into the motorcycle industry in 1978. The name is a [[portmanteau]] derived from the founder's name 'Giovanni Castiglioni' and the founding location, i.e. '''''CA'''stiglioni '''GI'''ovanni '''VA'''rese''.

In its history, Cagiva won races in [[Dakar Rally|Dakar]] and [[Motocross]] competitions, as well as in [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]].

==History==
[[Image:Cagiva elefant 650 1986.jpg|left|thumb|Cagiva Elefant 650, a dual-sport motorcycle using a Ducati engine]]
In 1978 Cagiva entered the motorcycle business with two racing motorcycles ridden by [[Gianfranco Bonera]] and [[Marco Lucchinelli]]. In the same year it bought a factory in [[Varese]]'s [[frazione]] of Schiranna from [[Harley-Davidson|Aermacchi/AMF-Harley-Davidson]] and went into motorcycle production. By 1979 the company reached an annual production of 40,000 motorbikes, with eight models powered by [[two-stroke]] engines ranging from 125&amp;nbsp;cc to 350&amp;nbsp;cc.

Many of the Harley-Davidson models were continued in production as Cagivas, and the off-road motorcycle division was improved and expanded, eventually producing its own race-winning WMX series of moto-cross motorcycles.
[[Image:2june2006 399.jpg|thumb|A [[Cagiva T4|T4]] 350 cm³, currently in use in the [[Italian army|Italian]] and other armies because of its maneuverability and power&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/cronaca/11562114/Esercito--al--Motodays-.html|title=Esercito: al 'Motodays' con moto storiche e l'ultima nata, la Cagiva 350 (2)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:French Army biker dsc06873.jpg|thumb|Another Cagiva T4 used by the [[French Armed Forces]]]]
In 1983 Cagiva also sourced Ducati [[four stroke]] v-twin engines from 350&amp;nbsp;cc to 1000&amp;nbsp;cc and entered the big displacement market. Cagiva bought [[Ducati Motor Holding|Ducati]] in 1985, but kept the Ducati brand that was better recognized outside Italy. Ducati motorcycle production continued in [[Bologna]], while the [[Varese]]-built Cagiva Ala Azzurra (sold under the name "Alazzurra", "Bluewing") and Elefant were introduced, both featuring Ducati engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/2008-01-01/Cagiva-Alazzurra.aspx 1985-1987 Cagiva Alazzurra] ''Motorcycle Classics'' article, Jan/Feb 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Cagiva continued with strategic buyouts of [[Moto Morini]] in 1985 and [[Husqvarna Motorcycles|Husqvarna]] in 1987. In 1991 Cagiva also bought the trademarks for the [[MV Agusta]] brand.

In 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer by the [[Texas Pacific Group]] and sold the Ducati and Moto Morini brands. In 1999, for strategic purposes, the company was restructured. MV Agusta Motor become the main brand comprising Cagiva and Husqvarna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cagiva.it/_vti_g6_att.aspx?rpstry=174_ | title= Cagiva Recent Facts | publisher= Cagiva | accessdate= 2008-02-03 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080215054421/http://www.cagiva.it/_vti_g6_att.aspx?rpstry=174_ | archivedate= 2008-02-15 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, production of the [[Cagiva roadster]] ended. In 2008, Harley-Davidson bought MV Agusta Motor, the parent company of Cagiva, thereby regaining some control of its old [[Aermacchi]] factory.

In October 2009, Harley-Davidson informed that it would put Cagiva up for sale. In the August of the following year, Cagiva was bought back by the son of the founder and former owner Claudio Castiglioni.

In 2012, production of new high engine capacity Mitos ended. Increasingly stringent environmental emission requirements and the concentration of resources on MV Agusta's F3 were cited as reasons. The last few Mito SP525s produced were white in colour, and personally signed by MV Agusta CEO Giovanni Castiglioni, thus ended the legacy of the Mito, alongside the end of the Raptors.

Last Cagiva-branded bikes were Raptor and Mito 125cc. The Cagiva brand is no longer active, the production being focused on MV Agusta.

==Racing==

In the early 1980s Cagiva began to manufacture dirt bikes and started a massive public relations program with the opening of its North American branch. It hired Ron Turner and Duane Summers to test and develop its bikes. Cagiva motocross bikes were characterized by their fast powerful engines and innovative features, such as the MX line that had only one spring in the front forks with one fork controlling dampening and the other spring.

===500cc World Championship===

At the end of the 1970s the company began campaigning the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] circuit. [[Randy Mamola]] was its lead rider from 1988 to 1990, and he achieved Cagiva’s first podium result. It would also have some technical assistance from [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]]. In [[1991 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1991]] it signed former world champion [[Eddie Lawson]] to its team. Lawson would claim the company's first victory when he won the [[1992 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1992]] Hungarian Grand Prix. [[John Kocinski]] would also win a Grand Prix on a [[Cagiva GP500]] (C594), finishing third in the [[1994 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1994]] world championship.

==Mini Moke==

Cagiva bought [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]]s design for the [[Mini Moke]], manufacturing them in [[Portugal]] using British built engines from 1990 until 1993. Intending to transfer production to the [[Bologna]] factory early in 1995, the tooling for the Moke was transferred to Italy late in 1993, but production never restarted.

A '''chief information officer in higher education''' is the senior executive who is responsible for information and communications technology in the university, college or other higher education institution. The position may not necessarily be called a CIO in some institutions. The CIO title is often coupled with Vice President/Vice Chancellor of information technology, is primarily used at doctoral/research institutions, while the titles of Director or Dean are more common at the other five types of [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]]; MA I, MA II, BA Liberal Arts, BA General, and AA.&lt;ref name="Arroway"&gt;{{cite web|author=Arroway, E. D.|author2=Davenport, E.|author3=Guangning, X.|author4=Updegrove, D.|year=2010|publisher= Educause core data service|title=Fiscal year 2009 summary report :''Educause''|pages= 1–168|accessdate=February 5, 2011|url=http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/PUB8007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the CIO title used at different institutions may represent unique positions with differing roles and responsibilities. Ultimately, there is no one definition for a CIO; it has a variety of meanings, functions, areas of purview, reporting structures, and required qualifications.&lt;ref name="brown2010b"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brown, W. |year=2010b|title=  2010 study of higher education chief information officer roles and effectiveness|publisher=Center for Higher Education, Chief Information Officer Studies, Inc.|accessdate=February 20, 2011|url=http://www.checs.org/publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some traditional executive and administrative positions in higher education, such as a [[chief financial officer]] position or chief academic officer/[[provost (education)|provost]] have been in existence for a long time and typically have a definite career path. In contrast, the position of CIO in higher education, which has only been around for about 35 years, has no single career path nor single model to explain what can be expected of CIOs in higher education, which makes it a challenge and an opportunity for those interested in preparing for such a role (Brown, 2009; Cash &amp; Pearlson, 2004; Nelson, 2003). Brian L. Hawkins (2004), former president of [[Educause]] concluded:
::There is no defined career path for CIOs, nor is there any certification, degree, or even a common body of knowledge that such a ::person should have mastered in order to fulfill this kind of position effectively…finding the right CIO is more about aligning ::personal traits, skills, professional orientation, proven success, and vision with a given campus culture and climate. (p. 100)

That being said, research in this field including recent surveys of technology leaders, CIOs and academic leaders in higher education institutions provides data on the current and expected levels of academic degrees of CIOs and their perceived required skill set. This, in turn, may mean that prospective CIOs who prepare in a manner to meet these perceived expectations in terms of academic degrees and skills may be more likely to be successful in being hired into the position of CIO and succeeding at it. The next two sections explore these two areas, that is, the academic degree preparation and skill set needed for CIOs in higher education.

==Qualifications==

A review of CIO vacancy positions and requirements between April 2009 and May 2010 from the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]], [[Educause]] and HigherEdJobs.com found that only 44.30% of the positions required a graduate degree as a requirement (Brown, 2010a). Brown speculates that position postings that do state a graduate degree requirement are simply attempting to create a larger pool of candidates. Brown (2010b) &lt;ref name="brown2010b"/&gt; reported that 79% of CIOs (who responded to his survey) have graduate degrees, and this percentage has been steadily increasing since 2007. According to Brown’s 2010 survey, 58% of CIOs have master's degrees while 21% have a doctorate.  Of those possessing a doctorate, these CIOs were working in all types of institutions ranging from doctoral-granting institutions to those with a special focus. About one third of these CIOs were working at a Master’s institutions while another third were working at a doctoral-granting institution. In contrast, his survey showed that the majority of CIOs with a master's degree as their highest level of academic preparation were working at institutions granting only associate degrees.

In terms of degree majors for CIO positions, Brown &lt;ref name="brown2010b"/&gt; found that 40% of the job postings did not identify the major preferred and another 44% requested a computer related major, or in IT or business. 46% of CIOs and 48% of members of the institution management team believed that the degree major was not important (Brown, 2010a). On a related note, the top four degree majors for technology leaders which comprised 70% of the responses were technology, business, education and administration (Brown, 2010a).

==Skill-sets==

What skill set is needed to successfully serve in the role of Chief Information Officer in higher education? A review of the literature provides some useful perspectives. Linda Fleit (1999), the former president and founder of the IT Consulting Firm Edutech International from 1985 to 2008 and through this experience, well acquainted with the role CIOs in higher education institutions, indicated seven areas which she felt were requirements for CIOs. These included (as cited in Hawkins, 2004): 1) a clear vision about the role on information technology in higher education; 2) excellent oral and written communication and listening skills; 3) ability to form alliances and relationships with key campus constituents; 4) the ability to work collaboratively and effectively; 5) the ability to make and back hard decisions; 6) the ability to manage resources judiciously, and 7) deep expertise and knowledge in at least one aspect of technology. Cash and Pearlson (2004), representing the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and the Concours Group, respectively, identify leadership, business and technical competencies as essential for CIOs in higher education. Carol A. Cartwright (2002), who served as president of Kent State University from 1991 to 2006 and who is currently serving as president of Bowling Green State University, sought several essential qualifications in a CIO who would be expected to serve as a full-fledged member of her “executive orchestra”: proven leadership skills, strong management skills, and an understanding of the difference between these two. Wayne Brown (2010b), the CIO at Excelsior College who has conducted annual surveys with CIOs and executive management on the role and effectiveness of CIOs since 2003, surveyed 440 CIOs in higher education in 2010 to determine what they considered the top skills needed to be effective in their positions. Brown (2010b) reported that a CIOs’ top five skills in order were: communication skills, leadership, technical knowledge, interpersonal skills and higher education knowledge. The same question posed to members of the management team at higher education institutions revealed that they ranked the same top five skills as important but in a different order: technical knowledge, communication skills, leadership, higher education knowledge, and interpersonal skills. Lastly, Hawkins (2004) identified five skills that he believed were critical to success as a CIO in higher education: strong communication skills, boundary-spanning ability (i.e. the ability to work across the silos that often exist at institutions), leadership ability, management experience, and a strong understanding of the academic environment.

Although there is some variance in the literature as to the best skills and competencies to possess to succeed as a CIO in higher education, the common elements across most of these appear to include leadership skills, management skills, communication skills, business knowledge, higher education experience/knowledge, interpersonal skills, and technical skills/deep knowledge in one aspect of technology. What is unclear in the literature is the quantity and quality of these skills, but most likely these will vary depending on the individual institutional context.

==Career prospects==
According to Brown (2010b),&lt;ref name="brown2010b"/&gt; in 2010 59% of CIOs responding to his survey were over 51 years of age compared to 55% in this age bracket in 2009. In addition, he reported that 47% of CIOs in 2010 planned to retire within the next 10 years. Furthermore, his report showed that the average CIO tenure in higher education in 2010 was an average of 6 years, 8 months, which is a drop from 2007 where the average tenure was 7 years, 5 months. The combination of these factors---the aging CIO, retirement plans, the faster change-over in CIO positions—presents a promising picture of job prospects for those seeking CIO positions in higher education in coming years.

The '''Clio Awards''' is an annual award program that recognizes innovation and creative excellence in [[advertising]], [[design]] and [[communication]], as judged by an international panel of [[advertising professional]]s.&lt;ref name=TRIBUTE&gt;Clio Awards: A Tribute to 30 Years of Advertising Excellence 1960-1989/Part 1, {{ISBN|0-86636-124-3}}, PBC International, September 1990&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described the event (in 1991) as the world's most recognizable international advertising awards.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;

==History==
The awards, founded by [[Wallace A. Ross]] in 1959, are named for the Greek goddess [[Clio]], the mythological [[Muse]] known as "the proclaimer, glorifier and celebrator of history, great deeds and accomplishments".&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt;

==1960s==
The Clios were first given in 1959, for excellence in television advertising, by the ''American TV and Radio Commercials Festival''. Each winner received a gold [[Georg Olden (graphic designer)|Georg Olden]]–designed statuette. The competition was expanded to include work on international television and movies in 1966, and then radio ads, in the United States, in 1967.&lt;ref name=GUIDE&gt;Carder, Sheri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=1993+Clio+award&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oofl86zCJ_&amp;sig=Rd-DUO1ZsVcuIJ7qeDxrUp6oUe8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fbrFTNaNLYW8lQeAwYzkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=1993%20Clio%20award&amp;f=false "Clio Awards"] ''The Guide to United States popular culture'', pages 180-181, {{ISBN|978-0-87972-821-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s==
[[File:1977 Clio ArthurSchroeck.jpg|thumb|Engraved plaque on the 1977 Clio award given to [[Artie Schroeck]] for arranging the music in a [[McDonald's]] jingle.]]
The Clio Awards were acquired by Bill Evans in 1972 for $150,000&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Horovitz, Bruce: [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-04/business/fi-6474_1_clio-awards "Hello Clio, What's New?"] Los Angeles Times, September 4, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and the Clios became a profitable "for profit" company.&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt; At one point, the company's income was $2.5 million per year, being derived primarily from Clio nomination fees, of $70 to $100 per entry.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;

Evans expanded competition by including: U.S. Print advertising in 1971; International Print advertising in 1972; International Radio advertising in 1974; U.S. Packaging design in 1976; International Packaging design; and U.S. Specialty advertising in 1977.&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt;

==1980s==
In 1983, Evans continued to expand by acquiring U.S. Cable advertising in 1983.&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt;

The rules for the 1984 award required that a given entry appear publicly during the calendar year in 1983. In order to be eligible, [[Chiat/Day]] needed to run [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s [[1984 (advertisement)|1984]] commercial for the [[Macintosh]] computer prior to [[Super Bowl XVIII]]. In December 1983, Apple purchased time on [[KMVT]] in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]], after the normal sign-off, and recorded the broadcast in order to qualify.&lt;ref name="linzmayer"&gt;Linzmayer, Owen (1994). ''The Mac Bathroom Reader''. Sybex, {{ISBN|978-0-7821-1531-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the following year, a nearly identical situation occurred when [[Ziebart|Ziebart's]] ad agency, [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]], purchased time on a [[Detroit]] channel carrying the inaugural [[Cherry Bowl]] college football game in December, 1984 in order for that commercial to be eligible for the 1985 awards.  The move paid off as Ziebart's "Friend of the Family (Rust in Peace)" commercial garnered the Clio Award in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99092280/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Evans acquired Hispanic advertising.&lt;ref name=GUIDE /&gt;

==1990s==
===1991 Clio Awards===
{{tone|date=December 2014}}
Attendees of the 1991 Clio Awards who had paid the US$125 admission price did not have tickets waiting at the door, as promised. Also missing were any Clio officials and Clio President Bill Evans. The event did not start on time; in fact, people stood around drinking, schmoozing, and trading rumors about Evans and the Clio organization for more than two hours. Finally, the lights dimmed and the band started playing. A man walked up to the microphone and began to speak. He identified himself as the caterer and announced that the master of ceremonies was a no-show, but that he would give it a shot. It started out well but, after being informed that there was no script and no winners list, he gave up and walked off. A second man walked onstage and began talking, but he was not a polished speaker and it was obvious that we he was inebriated. Print ads were the first awards; transparencies of the winning entries were displayed. As each image appeared on screen, the owner of the work was asked to come to the stage, pick up their Clio, and identify themselves and their agency. When the last award in the category was dispensed, the band began playing an interlude and the emcee began singing. The audience began booing and throwing dinner rolls, and the man staggered offstage. Several minutes passed, but no one took his place. As the people began to leave, one man mounted the stage, strode to the table of remaining statuettes, snatched one up, and waved it as he left the stage. Two other individuals claimed their own awards; then suddenly, the stage was stampeded by advertising executives, intent on the Clios that remained.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT /&gt;

The event for television commercials, scheduled a few days later, was called off.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT /&gt;

===1992 Bankruptcy===
On March 17, 1992, Clio Enterprises Inc., filed for bankruptcy, claiming $1.8 million in debts and indeterminate assets of at least US$1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Stuart: [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/18/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-bankruptcy-filing-by-clio-enterprises.html "Bankruptcy Filing By Clio Enterprises"] New York Times, March 18, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicago]] publisher Ruth Ratny purchased the Clio name for an undisclosed figure. Evans had wanted $2 million, and trade publications reported a sale price of $10,000, which Ratny called low. Ratny reorganized the event as the '''New Clio Awards''', and combined what had previously been two events into a single presentation, which was delayed from June until September 1992. [[Advertising Age]] magazine reported 6,000 entries, less than one quarter of the 1990 total. As a concession to the 1991 winners who had not yet received the trophies, their entry fee was waived. The 1990 award show at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] drew 1,800, while only 500 paid for the 1992 show at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]],&lt;ref name=LAT /&gt; which was hosted by [[Tony Randall]]. A total of 86 awards in 73 categories were handed out.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Stuart: [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/14/business/the-media-business-advertising-new-clios-face-a-test-of-credibility.html "'New' Clios Face a Test Of Credibility"]. ''The New York Times'', September 14, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Another major change with the "New" Clios was direct competition between U.S. and foreign firms, which resulted in Swiss agency Comsult/Advico Young &amp; Rubicam being named the winner of the best Television campaign.&lt;ref name=SWISS&gt;Horovitz, Bruce: [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-16/business/fi-1011_1_clio-awards "Swiss Firm Wins Top Clio Award"]. ''Los Angeles Times'', September 16, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

A bankruptcy court ruled that the creditors of the 1991 Clio Awards should be paid. At the time, Ratny lacked the financial resources to settle the [[US$]]600,000 debt. Another Chicagoan, James M. Smyth a former film editor, put up the money and became sole owner of the Clio Awards.  On New Year's Eve of 1992, he began working on the 1993 Clio awards show.&lt;ref name=TEMPO&gt;Millman, Nancy: [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-02-22/features/9303183743_1_new-clio-awards-revive-condo "Tempo reported on the New Clio Awards"] Chicago Tribune, February 22, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feigenbaum, Nancy: [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/clio-awards "The Clio Awards is about to get yet"] Orlando Sentinel, February 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The award ceremony was again delayed until September, and  [[Jay Chiat]] of [[TBWA\Chiat\Day]], Rick Fizdale from [[Leo Burnett Worldwide]] and Keith Reinhard at [[DDB Worldwide]] joined the  Clio Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Stuart: [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-another-setback-for-clio-awards.html "ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Another Setback For Clio Awards"]. ''The New York Times'', May 28, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Clios were sold to Dutch-owned company VNU Media.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;

==2000s==
In 2007, VNU changed its name to the [[Nielsen Company]].&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973271,00.html "Advertising The Collapse Of Clio"] Time magazine, July 1, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[e5 Global Media]] assumed control of Clio, when it acquired magazines [[Adweek]] and [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] (among others) from Nielsen Business Media.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Keith: [http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/clio_awards_return_to_downtown_just_QAsQQ6thXSqBNnviIEKMhM "CLIO awards return to downtown just as advertised"] New York Post, May 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Nicole Purcell was appointed Executive Director of Clio and Brooke Levy was hired to run marketing for the organization. Together they have been credited with reestablishing Clio as a best-in-class creative program. In 2015, Nicole Purcell was promoted to President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/ny-clio-idUSnBw206195a+100+BSW20150120 |title=CLIO Names Nicole Purcell President|work=Reuters|accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive]] acquired the Clio Awards Collection from the [[London International Awards]], the organization that purchased the collection from the Clio organization in 1992.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.iu.edu/stories/2017/12/iub/releases/14-clio-collection.html|title=We interrupt your viewing pleasure with this message from our sponsors|work=News at IU|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of thousands of reels of 16mm and 35mm film, the collection contains Clio entries and winners from the 1960s through the early 1990s across a wide variety of categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.libraries.indiana.edu/IULMIA/exhibits/show/clio|title=Clio Awards Collection · Indiana University Libraries Moving Image Archive|website=collections.libraries.indiana.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; International submissions are also included in the collection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Clio is currently part of MediaBistro Holdings, a group that also includes Adweek and The Film Expo Group, and is owned by Guggeinheim Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/adweek-parent-prometheus-buys-mediabistro-editorial-assets-158001 |title=Adweek Parent Company Buys Mediabistro Editorial Assets|work=AdWeek|accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drpepper.com/en Clio Awards ]. Retrieved 19 Oct. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judging==
In 2014, Clio assembled a 50/50 male-female jury made up of more than 70% international (non-US) judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clioawards.com/awards/press/?year=2014&amp;pressid=262 |title=CLIO Awards 2015|publisher=Clioawards.com|date= |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2014 was also the year Clio began holding judging sessions internationally. The 2014 judging session took place in Malta, and the 2015 session will take place in Tenerife, Spain.

According to the Clio Awards website, more than 80% of submissions are eliminated within the first two rounds. Juries then determine whether a work deserves to be included on the Shortlist, or receive a Bronze, Silver, or Gold medal. One work in each media type may be awarded the Grand Clio, the highest honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clioawards.com/about/ "About Clio"] Clio 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Clio stated, in 2007, that the competition received more than 19,000 entries from all over the world and enlisted a jury of more than 110 judges from 62 countries. Nearly two-thirds of the submissions came from outside the United States.&lt;ref name=ABOUT&gt;[http://www.clioawards.com/about/ "About Clio"] Clio 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cost–volume–profit''' ('''CVP'''), in [[managerial economics]], is a form of [[cost accounting]]. It is a simplified model, useful for elementary instruction and for short-run decisions.

==Overview==
A critical part of CVP analysis is the point where total revenues equal total costs (both fixed and variable costs). At this [[break-even point]], a company will experience no income or loss. This break-even point can be an initial examination that precedes more detailed CVP analysis.

CVP analysis employs the same basic assumptions as in breakeven analysis. The assumptions underlying CVP analysis are:
* The behavior of both costs and revenues are linear throughout the relevant range of activity. (This assumption precludes the concept of volume discounts on either purchased materials or sales.) 
* Costs can be classified accurately as either fixed or variable. 
* Changes in activity are the only factors that affect costs. 
* All units produced are sold (there is no ending finished goods inventory). 
* When a company sells more than one type of product, the product mix (the ratio of each product to total sales) will remain constant.

The components of CVP analysis are:
* Level or volume of activity. 
* Unit selling prices
* Variable cost per unit
* Total fixed costs
* Manpower Cost Direct and indirect 

==Assumptions==
CVP assumes the following:
* Constant sales price;
* Constant [[variable cost]] per unit;
* Constant total [[fixed cost]];
* Units sold equal units produced.
These are simplifying, largely [[linear]]izing assumptions, which are often implicitly assumed in elementary discussions of costs and profits. In more advanced treatments and practice, costs and revenue are [[nonlinear]] and the analysis is more complicated, but the intuition afforded by linear CVP remains basic and useful.

One of the main methods of calculating CVP is profit–volume ratio
which is (contribution /sales)*100 = this gives us profit–volume ratio.

* contribution stands for sales minus variable costs.
Therefore, it gives us the profit added per unit of variable costs.

==Model==

===Basic graph===
The assumptions of the CVP model yield the following linear equations for [[total cost]]s and total revenue (sales):

:{{math|1=Total costs = [[fixed costs]] + (unit variable cost &amp;times; number of units)}}
:{{math|1=[[Total revenue]] = sales price &amp;times; number of unit}}
These are linear because of the assumptions of constant costs and prices, and there is no distinction between units produced and units sold, as these are assumed to be equal. Note that when such a chart is drawn, the linear CVP model is assumed, often implicitly.

In symbols:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{TC} = \text{TFC} + V \times X&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{TR} = P \times X&lt;/math&gt;
where
* '''TC''' = '''Total costs'''
* '''TFC''' = '''Total fixed costs'''
* ''V'' = '''Unit variable cost''' ('''variable cost per unit''')
* ''X'' = '''Number of units'''
* '''TR''' = ''S'' = '''Total revenue''' = '''Sales'''
* '''P''' = '''(Unit) sales price''' 
Profit is computed as TR-TC; it is a profit if positive, a loss if negative.

===Break down===
Costs and sales can be broken down, which provide further insight into operations.

One can decompose total costs as fixed costs plus variable costs:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{TC} = \text{TFC} + V \times X&lt;/math&gt;

Following a [[matching principle]] of matching a portion of sales against variable costs, one can decompose sales as [[Contribution margin|contribution]] plus variable costs, where '''contribution''' is "what's left after deducting variable costs". One can think of contribution as "the marginal contribution of a unit to the profit", or "contribution towards offsetting fixed costs".

In symbols:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{TR} &amp;= P \times X\\
          &amp;= \bigl(\left(P - V \right)+V\bigr)\times X\\
          &amp;= \left(C+V\right)\times X\\
          &amp;= C\times X + V\times X
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''C'' = '''Unit Contribution (Margin)'''

Subtracting variable costs from both costs and sales yields the simplified diagram and equation for profit and loss.

In symbols:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{PL} &amp;= \text{TR} - \text{TC}\\
          &amp;= \left(C+V\right)\times X
           - \left(\text{TFC} + V \times X\right)\\
          &amp;= C \times X - \text{TFC}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:CVP-TC-FC-VC-Sales-Contrib-VC-PL-compat.svg|thumb|right|240px|Diagram relating all quantities in CVP.]]

These diagrams can be related by a rather busy diagram, which demonstrates how if one subtracts variable costs, the sales and total costs lines shift down to become the contribution and fixed costs lines. Note that the profit and loss for any given number of unit sales is the same, and in particular the break-even point is the same, whether one computes by sales = total costs or as contribution = fixed costs. Mathematically, the contribution graph is obtained from the sales graph  by a [[shear mapping|shear]], to be precise &lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ -V &amp; 1\end{smallmatrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where V are unit variable costs.

==Applications==
CVP simplifies the computation of [[breakeven]] in [[break-even analysis]], and more generally allows simple computation of [[target income sales]]. It simplifies analysis of short run trade-offs in operational decisions.

==Limitations==
CVP is a '''short run''', '''marginal''' analysis: it assumes that unit variable costs and unit revenues are constant, which is appropriate for small deviations from current production and sales, and assumes a neat division between fixed costs and variable costs, though in the long run all costs are variable. For longer-term analysis that considers the entire life-cycle of a product, one therefore often prefers [[activity-based costing]] or [[throughput accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://maaw.info/Chapter11.htm#The%20Controversy%20over%20the%20contribution%20margin%20approach The Controversy over the contribution margin approach], in MAAW, Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

When we analyze CVP  is  where we demonstrate the point  at which in a firm  there will be no profit nor loss  means that  firm  works in  breakeven situation

1. Segregation of total costs into its fixed and variable components is always a daunting task to do. 
2. Fixed costs are unlikely to stay constant as output increases beyond a certain range of activity. 
3. The analysis is restricted to the relevant range specified and beyond that the results can become unreliable. 
4. Aside from volume, other elements like inflation, efficiency, capacity and technology impact on costs 
5. Impractical to assume sales mix remain constant since this depends on the changing demand levels. 
6. The assumption of linear property of total cost and total revenue relies on the assumption that unit variable cost and selling price are always constant. In real life it is valid within relevant range or period and likely to change.

Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-705829-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Material used from this publication in this article has been licensed under Creative Commons Share Alike and Gnu Free Documentation License. See talk.&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 71 percent responded that they found a customer satisfaction metric very useful in managing and monitoring their businesses.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics/&gt;

It is seen as a [[key performance indicator]] within business and is often part of a [[Balanced Scorecard]]. In a competitive marketplace where businesses compete for customers, customer satisfaction is seen as a key differentiator and increasingly has become a key element of business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Future of Business: The Essentials |last=Gitman |first=Lawrence J. |author2=Carl D.

==Purpose==
[[File:Business Feedback Loop PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=|A business ideally is continually seeking feedback to improve customer satisfaction.]]
"Customer satisfaction provides a leading indicator of consumer [[buyer decision process|purchase intentions]] and [[customer loyalty|loyalty]]." &lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics/&gt;
"Customer satisfaction data are among the most frequently collected indicators of market perceptions. Their principal use is twofold:" &lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics/&gt;
# "Within organizations, the collection, analysis and dissemination of these data send a message about the importance of tending to customers and ensuring that they have a positive experience with the company's goods and services."&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics/&gt;
# "Although sales or market share can indicate how well a firm is performing ''currently'', satisfaction is perhaps the best indicator of how likely it is that the firm’s customers will make further purchases ''in the future''. Much research has focused on the relationship between customer satisfaction and retention. Studies indicate that the ramifications of satisfaction are most strongly realized at the extremes."

On a five-point scale, "individuals who rate their satisfaction level as '5' are likely to become return customers and might even evangelize for the firm. (A second important metric related to satisfaction is willingness to recommend. This metric is defined as "The percentage of surveyed customers who indicate that they would recommend a brand to friends." When a customer is satisfied with a product, he or she might recommend it to friends, relatives and colleagues. This can be a powerful marketing advantage.) "Individuals who rate their satisfaction level as '1,' by contrast, are unlikely to return. Further, they can hurt the firm by making negative comments about it to prospective customers. [[Willingness to recommend]] is a key metric relating to customer satisfaction."&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics/&gt;

==Theoretical Ground==
In literature antecedents of satisfaction are studied from different aspects. The considerations extend from psychological to physical and from normative to positive aspects. However, in most of the cases the consideration is focused on two basic constructs as customers expectations prior to purchase or use of a product and his relative perception of the performance of that product after using it.

Expectations of a customer on a product tell us his anticipated performance for that product. As it is suggested in the literature, consumers may have various "types" of expectations when forming opinions about a product's anticipated performance. For example, four types of expectations are identified by Miller (1977): ideal, expected, minimum tolerable, and desirable. While, Day (1977) indicated among expectations, the ones that are about the costs, the product nature, the efforts in obtaining benefits and lastly expectations of social values.
Perceived product performance is considered as an important construct due to its ability to allow making comparisons with the expectations.

It is considered that customers judge products on a limited set of norms and attributes. Olshavsky and Miller (1972) and Olson and Dover (1976) designed their researches as to manipulate actual product performance, and their aim was to find out how perceived performance ratings were influenced by expectations. These studies took out the discussions about explaining the differences between expectations and perceived performance." &lt;ref name="Phenomenon"&gt;Kucukosmanoglu, Ahmet Nuri; Sensoy Ertan (2010). "Customer Satisfaction: A Central Phenomenon in Marketing". [https://www.academia.edu/1977823/CUSTOMER_SATISFACTION_A_CENTRAL_PHENOMENON_IN_MARKETING]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some research studies, scholars have been able to establish that customer satisfaction has a strong emotional, i.e., affective, component.&lt;ref&gt;Westbrook, Robert A., and Richard L. Oliver. "The dimensionality of consumption emotion patterns and consumer satisfaction." Journal of consumer research (1991): 84-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others show that the cognitive and affective components of customer satisfaction reciprocally influence each other over time to determine overall satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Homburg, Christian, Nicole Koschate, and Wayne D. Hoyer. "The role of cognition and affect in the formation of customer satisfaction: a dynamic perspective." Journal of Marketing 70.3 (2006): 21-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially for durable goods that are consumed over time, there is value to taking a dynamic perspective on customer satisfaction. Within a dynamic perspective, customer satisfaction can evolve over time as customers repeatedly use a product or interact with a service. The satisfaction experienced with each interaction (transactional satisfaction) can influence the overall, cumulative satisfaction. Scholars showed that it is not just overall customer satisfaction, but also customer loyalty that evolves over time.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Michael D., Andreas Herrmann, and Frank Huber. "The evolution of loyalty intentions." Journal of marketing 70.2 (2006): 122-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===&lt;small&gt;The Disconfirmation Model&lt;/small&gt;===
"The Disconfirmation Model is based on the comparison of customers’ [expectations] and their [perceived performance] ratings. Specifically, an individual’s expectations are confirmed when a product performs as expected. It is negatively confirmed when a product performs more poorly than expected. The disconfirmation is positive when a product performs over the expectations(Churchill &amp; Suprenant 1982).
There are four constructs to describe the traditional disconfirmation paradigm mentioned as expectations, performance, disconfirmation and satisfaction." &lt;ref name="Phenomenon" /&gt;
"Satisfaction is considered as an outcome of purchase and use, resulting from the buyers’ comparison of expected rewards and incurred costs of the purchase in relation to the anticipated consequences. In operation, satisfaction is somehow similar to attitude as it can be evaluated as the sum of satisfactions with some features of a product." &lt;ref name="Phenomenon" /&gt;
"In the literature, cognitive and affective models of satisfaction are also developed and considered as alternatives(Pfaff, 1977).
Churchill and Suprenant in 1982, evaluated various studies in the literature and formed an overview of Disconfirmation process in the following figure:" &lt;ref name="Phenomenon" /&gt;

==Construction==
Organizations need to retain existing customers while targeting non-customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Customer-Focused Management: Competing Through Service |last=John |first=Joby |year=2003 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-1-56720-564-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring customer satisfaction provides an indication of how successful the organization is at providing products and/or services to the marketplace.

"Customer satisfaction is measured at the individual level, but it is almost always reported at an aggregate level. It can be, and often is, measured along various dimensions. A hotel, for example, might ask customers to rate their experience with its front desk and check-in service, with the room, with the amenities in the room, with the restaurants, and so on. Additionally, in a holistic sense, the hotel might ask about overall satisfaction 'with your stay.'"&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics/&gt;

As research on consumption experiences grows, evidence suggests that consumers purchase goods and services for a combination of two types of benefits: hedonic and utilitarian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Wang|first2=Huchen|title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management|volume=20|issue=4|pages=487-506|doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hedonic benefits are associated with the sensory and experiential attributes of the product. Utilitarian benefits of a product are associated with the more instrumental and functional attributes of the product (Batra and Athola 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Batra, Rajeev and Olli T. Athola (1990), “Measuring the Hedonic and Utilitarian Sources of Consumer Attitudes,” Marketing Letters, 2 (2), 159-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Customer satisfaction is an ambiguous and abstract concept and the actual manifestation of the state of satisfaction will vary from person to person and product/service to product/service. The state of satisfaction depends on a number of both psychological and physical variables which correlate with satisfaction behaviors such as return and recommend rate. The level of satisfaction can also vary depending on other options the customer may have and other products against which the customer can compare the organization's products.

Work done by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry (Leonard L)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing Services: Competing Through Quality |last=Berry |first=Leonard L. |author2=A. Parasuraman |year=1991 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-903079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1985 and 1988 provides the basis for the measurement of customer satisfaction with a service by using the gap between the customer's expectation of performance and their perceived experience of performance. This provides the measurer with a satisfaction "gap" which is objective and quantitative in nature. Work done by Cronin and Taylor propose the "confirmation/disconfirmation" theory of combining the "gap" described by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry as two different measures (perception and expectation of performance) into a single measurement of performance according to expectation.

The usual measures of customer satisfaction involve a [[Sample survey|survey]]&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Sheila (2003). Customer satisfaction toolkit for ISO 9001:2000. Milwaukee, Wis.: ASQ Quality Press. {{ISBN|0-87389-559-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[Likert scale]]. The customer is asked to evaluate each statement in terms of their perceptions and expectations of performance of the organization being measured.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wirtz, Jochen and John E. G. Bateson (1995), “An Experimental Investigation of Halo Effects in Satisfaction Measures of Service Attributes,” International Journal of Service Industry Management, 6 (3), 84-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Good [[quality measure]]s need to have high satisfaction loadings, good reliability, and low error [[variance]]s. In an empirical study comparing commonly used satisfaction measures it was found that two multi-item [[semantic differential]] scales performed best across both [[hedonic]] and [[utilitarian]] service consumption contexts. A study by Wirtz &amp; Lee (2003),&lt;ref name="Wirtz"&gt;Wirtz, Jochen; Chung Lee, Meng (2003), “An Empirical Study on The Quality and Context-specific Applicability of Commonly Used Customer Satisfaction Measures,” Journal of Service Research, Vol. 5, No. 4, 345-355.&lt;/ref&gt; found that a six-item 7-point [[semantic differential]] scale (for example, Oliver and Swan 1983), which is a six-item 7-point bipolar scale, consistently performed best across both hedonic and utilitarian services. It loaded most highly on satisfaction, had the highest item reliability, and had by far the lowest error variance across both studies. In the study,&lt;ref name="Wirtz" /&gt; the six items asked respondents’ evaluation of their most recent experience with ATM services and ice cream restaurant, along seven points within these six items: “''pleased me'' to ''displeased me''”, “''contented with'' to ''disgusted with''”, “''very satisfied with'' to ''very dissatisfied with''”, “''did a good job for me'' to ''did a poor job for me''”, “''wise choice'' to ''poor choice''” and “''happy with'' to ''unhappy with''”. A [[semantic differential]] (4 items) scale (e.g., Eroglu and Machleit 1990),&lt;ref&gt;Eroglu, Sergin A. and Karen A. Machleit (1990), “An Empirical Study of Retail Crowding: Antecedents and Consequences,” Journal of Retailing, 66 (Summer), 201-21.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a four-item 7-point bipolar scale, was the second best performing measure, which was again consistent across both contexts. In the study, respondents were asked to evaluate their experience with both products, along seven points within these four items: “''satisfied'' to ''dissatisfied''”, “''favorable'' to ''unfavorable''”, “''pleasant'' to ''unpleasant''” and “''I like it very much'' to ''I didn’t like it at all''”.&lt;ref name="Wirtz" /&gt; The third best scale was single-item percentage measure, a one-item 7-point bipolar scale (e.g., Westbrook 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Westbrook, Robert A. (1980), “A Rating Scale for Measuring Product/Service Satisfaction,” Journal of Marketing, 44 (Fall), 68-72.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the respondents were asked to evaluate their experience on both ATM services and ice cream restaurants, along seven points within “''[[customer delight|delighted]]'' to ''terrible''”.&lt;ref name="Wirtz" /&gt;

Finally, all measures captured both affective and cognitive aspects of satisfaction, independent of their scale anchors.&lt;ref name=Wirtz /&gt; Affective measures capture a consumer’s attitude (liking/disliking) towards a product, which can result from any product information or experience. On the other hand, cognitive element is defined as an appraisal or conclusion on how the product’s performance compared against expectations (or exceeded or fell short of expectations), was useful (or not useful), fit the situation (or did not fit), exceeded the requirements of the situation (or did not exceed).

Recent research shows that in most commercial applications, such as firms conducting customer surveys, a single-item overall satisfaction scale performs just as well as a multi-item scale.&lt;ref&gt;Drolet, Aimee L., and Donald G. Morrison. "Do we really need multiple-item measures in service research?." Journal of service research 3, no. 3 (2001): 196-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in larger scale studies where a researcher needs to gather data from a large number of customers, a single-item scale may be preferred because it can reduce total survey error.&lt;ref&gt;Salant, Priscilla, and Don A. Dillman. "How to Conduct your own Survey: Leading professional give you proven techniques for getting reliable results." (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodologies==
[[American Customer Satisfaction Index]] (ACSI) is a scientific standard of customer satisfaction. Academic research has shown that the national ACSI score is a strong predictor of [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) growth, and an even stronger predictor of [[Personal Consumption Expenditure]] (PCE) growth.&lt;ref&gt;Fornell, C., R.T. Rust and M.G. Dekimpe (2010). "The Effect of Customer Satisfaction on Consumer Spending Growth," Journal of Marketing Research, 47(1), 28-35.&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[microeconomic]] level, academic studies have shown that ACSI data is related to a firm's financial performance in terms of [[return on investment]] (ROI), sales, long-term firm value ([[Tobin's q|Tobin's ''q'']]), [[cash flow]], cash flow volatility, [[human capital]] performance, [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] returns, [[debt]] financing, risk, and consumer spending.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, E.W., C. Fornell &amp; S.K. Mazvancheryl (2004). "Customer Satisfaction and Shareholder Value." Journal of Marketing, Vol. 68, October, 172-185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fornell, C., S. Mithas, F.V. Morgeson III, and M.S. Krishnan (2006). "Customer Satisfaction and Stock Prices: High Returns, Low Risk," Journal of Marketing, 70(1), 3−14.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing ACSI scores have been shown to predict loyalty, word-of-mouth recommendations, and purchase behavior. The ACSI measures customer satisfaction annually for more than 200 companies in 43 industries and 10 economic sectors. In addition to quarterly reports, the ACSI methodology can be applied to private sector companies and government agencies in order to improve loyalty and purchase intent.&lt;ref&gt;Morgeson, F. V., &amp; Petrescu, C. (2011). "Do They All Perform Alike? An Examination of Perceived Performance, Citizen Satisfaction and Trust with US Federal Agencies." International Review of Administrative Sciences, 77(3), 451-479.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kano model]] is a theory of product development and customer satisfaction developed in the 1980s by Professor [[Noriaki Kano]] that classifies customer preferences into five categories: Attractive, One-Dimensional, Must-Be, Indifferent, Reverse. The Kano model offers some insight into the product attributes which are perceived to be important to customers.

[[SERVQUAL]] or RATER is a service-quality framework that has been incorporated into customer-satisfaction surveys (e.g., the revised Norwegian Customer Satisfaction Barometer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0167-4870(01)00030-7 |title=The evolution and future of national customer satisfaction index models |last=Johnson |first=Michael D. |author2=Anders Gustafssonb |author3=Tor Wallin Andreassenc |author4=Line Lervikc |author5=Jaesung Cha |journal=Journal of Economic Psychology |volume=22 |issue=2|year=2001 |pages=217–245 |issn=0167-4870}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to indicate the gap between customer expectations and experience.

[[J.D. Power and Associates]] provides another measure of customer satisfaction, known for its top-box approach and automotive industry rankings. J.D. Power and Associates' marketing research consists primarily of consumer surveys and is publicly known for the value of its product awards.

Other research and consulting firms have customer satisfaction solutions as well. These include [[A.T. Kearney]]'s Customer Satisfaction Audit process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Customer Satisfaction Audit |last=Bluestein |first=Abram |author2=Michael Moriarty |author3=Ronald J Sanderson  |publisher=Cambridge Strategy Publications |location=Axminster |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-902433-98-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporates the Stages of Excellence framework and which helps define a company’s status against eight critically identified dimensions.

For [[Business-to-business|B2B]] customer satisfaction surveys, where there is a small customer base, a high response rate to the survey is desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Customer Relationship Management, Emerging Concepts, Tools and Application, Edited by Jagsish N Sheth, Atul Parvatiyar and G Shainesh, published by Tata McGraw-Hill Education - see Chapter 21, pages 193 to 199&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Customer Satisfaction Index]] (2012) found that response rates for paper-based surveys were around 10% and the response rates for e-surveys (web, wap and e-mail) were averaging between 5% and 15% - which can only provide a straw poll of the customers' opinions.

In the European Union member states, many methods for measuring impact and satisfaction of [[e-Government|e-government]] services are in use, which the [[eGovMoNet]] project sought to compare and harmonize.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission: [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/apps/projects/factsheet/index.cfm?project_ref=224998 eGovMoNet: eGovernment Monitor Network].&lt;/ref&gt;

These customer satisfaction methodologies have not been independently audited by the [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] according to [[Marketing Metric Audit Protocol (MMAP)|MMAP (Marketing Metric Audit Protocol)]].

Recently there has been a growing interest in predicting customer satisfaction using big data and machine learning methods (with behavioral and demographic features as predictors) to take targeted preventive actions aimed at avoiding churn, complaints and dissatisfaction&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431917301433 Pokryshevskaya, E.

== Early life ==
Bernard was born on 22 March 1888. Bernards's parents were Edmund Bowen Bernard and Arabella Margaret Piercy.
Bernard studied at [[Stubbington House School]] in [[Fareham]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]]. 

== Education ==
After Bernard held the rank of midshipman in the [[Royal Navy]], he attended [[Thames Nautical Training College]] in [[Foots Cray Place]], [[Kent]].&lt;ref name="Peerage"&gt;{{cite web|work=The Peerage|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p13970.htm#c139696.1|title=Sir Dallas Gerald Mercer Bernard, 1st Bt.|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Bernard arrived in the Far East and joined [[Jardine Matheson|Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] by at least 1912, at which point he was working there as an assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Directory &amp; Chronicle for China, Japan, Corea, Indo-China, Straits Settlements, Malay States, Siam, Netherlands India, Borneo, the Philippines, &amp;c. |date=1912 |publisher=Hong Kong Daily Press Office |pages=1111–1112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4tEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1111 |accessdate=16 August 2018 |chapter=Foreign Residents}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was chairman of the trustees of the Sailors' Home and on the Local General Committee of the Missions to Seamen in Hong Kong in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Strong to Save"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Stephen |title=Strong to Save |date=19 July 2017 |publisher=City U Press |location=Hong Kong |isbn=962937305X |page =142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mB4wDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142 |accessdate=16 August 2018 |chapter=Headwinds and Adverse Currents |quote= [Bishop Duppuy] had already discussed the matter with a fellow Mission Local General Committee member and the chairman of the Sailors' Home trustees, D.G.M.

Bernard became the director of the Bank of England from 1936 to 1949 and the [[High Sheriff of the County of London]] from 1942 to 1943 and later on the Lieutenant of the City of London. After the war, he continued to serve the bank and rose to the deputy-governor of the Bank of England in 1949 until in 1954 when he left the bank.&lt;ref name="Peerage"/&gt;

After leaving the Bank of England, Bernard joined the [[Courtaulds]] and became the director between 1954 and 1956 and between 1964 and 1965 and also the deputy-chairman from 1956 to 1962. He was also active in banking in the Middle East. In 1954, he was appointed chairman of the Jordan Currency Board, which became the sole authority entitled to issue [[Jordanian dinar]]. He held the post until 1957 and continued as the chairman of the [[British Bank of the Middle East]] from 1954 until 1965.&lt;ref name="Peerage"/&gt;

He was created [[Bernard baronets|1st Baronet Bernard]], of Snakemoor, in the [[County of Southampton]] on 27 January 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=40097 |date=9 February 1954 |page=865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EconomicIntegrationEU.svg|thumb|International free trade and customs unions around the world.]]
'''Economic integration''' is the unification of economic policies between different states through the partial or full abolition of tariff and non-tariff restrictions on trade taking place among them prior to their integration.  This is meant in turn to lead to lower prices for distributors and consumers with the goal of increasing the level of welfare, while leading to an increase of economic productivity of the states.

The trade stimulation effects intended by means of economic integration are part of the contemporary economic [[Theory of the Second Best]]: where, in theory, the best option is [[free trade]], with [[free competition]] and no [[trade barriers]] whatsoever. Free trade is treated as an idealistic option, and although realized within certain developed states, economic integration has been thought of as the "second best" option for global trade where barriers to full free trade exist.

==Etymology==
In economics the word ''integration'' was first employed in industrial organisation to refer to combinations of business firms through economic agreements, cartels, concerns, trusts, and mergers—[[horizontal integration]] referring to combinations of competitors, [[vertical integration]] to combinations of suppliers with customers. In the current sense of combining separate economies into larger economic regions, the use of the word ''integration'' can be traced to the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fritz Machlup]] credits Eli Heckscher, Herbert Gaedicke and Gert von Eyern as the first users of the term ''economic integration'' in its current sense. According to Machlup, such usage first appears in the 1935 English translation of Hecksher's 1931 book ''Merkantilismen'' (''Mercantilism'' in English), and independently in Gaedicke's and von Eyern's 1933 two-volume study ''Die produktionswirtschaftliche Integration Europas: Eine Untersuchung über die Aussenhandelsverflechtung der europäischen Länder''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Machlup|1977|pp=4–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective ==
There are economic as well as political reasons why nations pursue economic integration.  The economic rationale for the increase of trade between member states of economic unions rests on the supposed [[productivity]] gains from integration. This is one of the reasons for the development of economic integration on a global scale, a phenomenon now realized in continental [[trade bloc|economic blocs]] such as [[ASEAN]], [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], [[South American Community of Nations|SACN]], the [[European Union]], and the [[Eurasian Economic Community]]; and proposed for intercontinental economic blocks, such as the [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]] and the [[Transatlantic Free Trade Area]].

[[Comparative advantage]] refers to the ability of a person or a country to produce a particular good or service at a lower [[Marginal cost|marginal]] and [[opportunity cost]] over another. Comparative advantage was first described by [[David Ricardo]] who explained it in his 1817 book ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in an example involving England and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;The exact phrase is not found in [http://www.econlib.org/library/Ricardo/ricP.html an online version of that book].&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal it is possible to produce both [[wine]] and [[cloth]] with less labour than it would take to produce the same quantities in England.  However the relative costs of producing those two goods are different in the two countries.  In England it is very hard to produce wine, and only moderately difficult to produce cloth.  In Portugal both are easy to produce.  Therefore, while it is cheaper to produce cloth in Portugal than England, it is cheaper still for Portugal to produce excess wine, and trade that for English cloth. Conversely England benefits from this trade because its cost for producing cloth has not changed but it can now get wine at a lower price, closer to the cost of cloth. The conclusion drawn is that each country can gain by specializing in the good where it has comparative advantage, and trading that good for the other.

[[Economies of scale]] refers to the cost advantages that an enterprise obtains due to expansion. There are factors that cause a producer’s average cost per unit to fall as the scale of output is increased. Economies of scale is a long run concept and refers to reductions in unit cost as the size of a facility and the usage levels of other inputs increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A lone car maker may be profitable, however, if they export cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market.

Besides these economic reasons, the primary reasons why economic integration has been pursued in practise are largely political.  The ''[[Zollverein]]'' or German Customs Union of 1867 paved the way for [[German Question|partial German unification]] under Prussian leadership in 1871.  [[Imperial preference|"Imperial free trade"]] was (unsuccessfully) proposed in the late 19th century to strengthen the loosening ties within British Empire.  The [[European Economic Community]] was created to integrate France and Germany's economies to the point that they would find it impossible to go to war with each other.

The degree of economic integration can be categorized into seven stages:&lt;ref&gt;Page 2, Balassa, Bela. The Theory of Economic Integration (Routledge Revivals). Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Preferential trading area]]&lt;!-- this stage didn't show in Bela' book --&gt;
# [[Free trade area]]
# [[Customs union]]
# [[Common market]]
# [[Economic union]]
# [[Economic and monetary union]]
# [[Complete economic integration]]

These differ in the degree of unification of economic policies, with the highest one being the completed economic integration of the states, which would most likely involve political integration as well.

A "free trade area" (FTA) is formed when at least two states partially or fully abolish custom tariffs on their inner border. To exclude regional exploitation of zero tariffs within the FTA there is a rule of [[certificate of origin]] for the goods originating from the territory of a member state of an FTA.

A "customs union" introduces unified tariffs on the exterior borders of the union (CET, common external tariffs). A "monetary union" introduces a shared currency. A "common market" add to a FTA the free movement of services, capital and labor.

An "economic union" combines customs union with a common market. A "[[fiscal union]]" introduces a shared fiscal and budgetary policy. In order to be successful the more advanced integration steps are typically accompanied by unification of economic policies (tax, social welfare benefits, etc.), reductions in the rest of the [[trade barrier]]s, introduction of supranational bodies, and gradual moves towards the final stage, a "political union".

== Economic theory ==
The framework of the theory of economic integration was laid out by [[Jacob Viner]] (1950) who defined the [[trade creation]] and [[trade diversion]] effects, the terms introduced for the change of interregional flow of goods caused by changes in customs tariffs due to the creation of an economic union. He considered trade flows between two states prior and after their unification, and compared them with the rest of the world. His findings became and still are the foundation of the theory of economic integration. The next attempts to enlarge the static analysis towards three states+world (Lipsey, et al.) were not as successful.

The basics of the theory were summarized by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[economist]] [[Béla Balassa]] in the 1960s. As economic integration increases, the barriers of trade between markets diminish. Balassa believed that supranational common markets, with their free movement of economic factors across national borders, naturally generate demand for further integration, not only economically (via monetary unions) but also politically—and, thus, that economic communities naturally evolve into political unions over time.

The dynamic part of international economic integration theory, such as the dynamics of [[trade creation]] and [[trade diversion]] effects, the [[Pareto efficiency]] of factors (labor, capital) and value added, mathematically was introduced by Ravshanbek Dalimov. This provided an interdisciplinary approach to the previously static theory of international economic integration, showing what effects take place due to economic integration, as well as enabling the results of the non-linear sciences to be applied to the dynamics of international economic integration.

Equations describing:
# enforced oscillations of a pendulum with friction;
# predator-prey oscillations;
# heat and/or gas spatial dynamics (the [[heat equation]] and [[Navier-Stokes equations]])
were successfully applied towards:
# the dynamics of GDP;
# price-output dynamics and the dynamic matrix of the outputs of an economy;
# regional and inter-regional migration of labor income and value added, and to trade creation and trade diversion effects (inter-regional output flows).
The straightforward conclusion from the findings is that one may use the accumulated knowledge of the exact and natural sciences (physics, biodynamics, and chemical kinetics) and apply them towards the analysis and forecasting of economic dynamics.

Dynamic analysis has started with a new definition of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), as a difference between aggregate revenues of sectors and investment (a modification of the value added definition of the GDP). It was possible to analytically prove that all the states gain from economic unification, with larger states receiving less growth of GDP and productivity, and vice versa concerning the benefit to lesser states. Although this fact has been empirically known for decades, now it was also shown as being mathematically correct.

A qualitative finding of the dynamic method is the similarity of a coherence policy of economic integration and a mixture of previously separate liquids in a retort: they finally get one colour and become one liquid. Economic space (tax, insurance and financial policies, customs tariffs, etc.) all finally become the same along with the stages of economic integration.

Another important finding is a direct link between the dynamics of macro- and micro-economic parameters such as the evolution of industrial clusters and the GDP's temporal and spatial dynamics. Specifically, the dynamic approach analytically described the main features of the theory of competition summarized by [[Michael Porter]], stating that industrial clusters evolve from initial entities gradually expanding within their geographic proximity. It was analytically found that the geographic expansion of industrial clusters goes along with raising their productivity and technological innovation.

Domestic savings rates of the member states were observed to strive to one magnitude, and the dynamic method of forecasting this phenomenon has also been developed. Overall dynamic picture of economic integration has been found to look quite similar to unification of previously separate basins after opening intraboundary sluices, where instead of water the value added (revenues) of entities of member states interact.

== Success factors ==
Among the requirements for successful development of economic integration are "permanency" in its evolution (a gradual expansion and over time a higher degree of economic/political unification); "a formula for sharing joint revenues" (customs duties, licensing etc.) between member states (e.g., per capita); "a process for adopting decisions" both economically and politically; and "a will to make concessions" between developed and developing states of the union.

A "coherence" policy is a must for the permanent development of economic unions, being also a property of the economic integration process. Historically the success of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] opened a way for the formation of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) which involved much more than just the two sectors in the ECSC. So a coherence policy was implemented to use a different speed of economic unification (coherence) applied both to economic sectors and economic policies. Implementation of the coherence principle in adjusting  economic policies in the member states of economic block causes [[economic integration effects]].

== Global economic integration ==

With economics crisis started in 2008 the global economy has started to realize quite a few initiatives on regional level.
It is unification between the EU and US, expansion of Eurasian Economic Community (now Eurasia Economic Union) by Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. It is also the creation of BRICS with the bank of its members, and notably high motivation of creating competitive economic structures within Shanghai Organization, also creating the bank with many multi-currency instruments applied. Engine for such fast and dramatic changes was insufficiency of global capital, while one has to mention obvious large political discrepancies witnessed in 2014-2015. Global economy has to overcome this by easing the moves of capital and labor, while this is impossible unless the states will find common point of views in resolving cultural and politic differences which pushed it so far as of now.

[[Globalization]] refers to the increasing global relationships of [[culture]], people, and economic activity.

Fashion Revolution campaigns for systemic reform of the [[fashion]] industry with a focus on the need for greater [[Transparency (trade)|transparency]] in the fashion [[supply chain]].  Fashion Revolution has designated the anniversary of the [[Rana Plaza]] disaster in [[Bangladesh]] as Fashion Revolution Day. In 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 millions of people around the world called on brands to answer the question Who Made My Clothes?

==History==
Fashion Revolution was created in 2013 in response to the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh by [[Carry Somers]] and Orsola de Castro.  Somers and De Castro had worked as [[fashion designers]] in the UK for over two decades and saw that the factory collapse could act as a catalyst for change in the industry.

==Fashion Revolution Day / Fashion Revolution Week==
Fashion Revolution Day takes place annually on 24 April, the anniversary of the [[2013 Savar building collapse|2013 Rana Plaza building collapse]] when 1133 died and over 2500 were injured.  In 2016, it expanded into Fashion Revolution Week.

The first Fashion Revolution Day took place on 24 April 2014.  Fashion Revolution's hashtag #insideout was the no. 1 global trend on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfam.org.uk/education/education-blog/2015/03/fashion-revolution-day&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hepburn |first=Stephanie |date=14 April 2015 |title=Can a hashtag change the fashion industry? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/apr/14/can-a-hashtag-change-the-fashion-industry |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Fashion Revolution Day took place on 24 April 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14494">'''Federico Elaskar''' is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] businessman who has been implicated in a web of financial-corruption scandals, known as [[The Route of the K-Money|Lázarogate]], surrounding the administrations of that nation’s last president, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], and of her late husband and predecessor, [[Nestor Kirchner]], and centering on the Kirchernite businessman [[Lázaro Báez]].&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;{{cite web| title =Los contactos en Miami de Elaskar, ex financista arrepentido| work =Clarin| date =Apr 21, 2013| url = http://www.Clarín.com/politica/contactos-Miami-Elaskar-financista-arrepentido_0_905309544.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, when he was in his mid-20s, Elaskar had already been a principal in several international firms and had accumulated considerable personal wealth. In an April 2013 television interview, he described at length his role in an international scheme to launder money for Báez and other leading figures in the Kirchner circle. After the interview, however, he claimed that he had been lying. One report stated that Elaskar was “perhaps the key piece” in the entire history of corruption involving persons connected to the Kirchner regime.&lt;ref name=rol&gt;{{cite web| title =El rol de la financiera SGI en el caso Leonardo Fariña – Lázaro Báez| work =Apertura| date =Apr 15, 2013| url = http://www.apertura.com/negocios/El-rol-de-la-financiera-SGI-en-el-caso-Leonardo-Faria--Lazaro-Baez-20130415-0002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Elaskar was an employee of Droguería Vademécum S.A., whose president was Marcelo Emilio Elaskar and whose director was Paris Elaskar. He then became deputy director of ATC Argentine Trust Company SA and worked for the advertising company Latin Minds SRL.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;&lt;ref name=crimen&gt;{{cite web| last =Ramirez| first =Ignacio| title =Quién es Federico Elaskar, el arrepentido lavador de dinero| work =Crimen y Razon| date =Apr 17, 2013| url = http://crimenyrazon.com/2726/quien-es-federico-elaskar-el-arrepentido-lavador-de-dinero#.U-5m-vmSzkI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaskar began his work in finance in 2009 as director and CEO of Vanquish Capital Group S.A., a firm that was involved in financial services, international commerce, and real estate transactions. Elaskar formed the firm on May 28, 2009, at age 24, with a start-up capital amounting to 200,000 pesos.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;&lt;ref name=crimen/&gt;

From Vanquish, according to an April 21, 2013, investigative report by ''Clarín'', Elaskar went to the firm SGI,&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt; commonly referred to as “La Rosadita.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Indagarán a Báez por extorsión contra el ex dueño de "La Rosadita"| work =Clarin| date =Jun 1, 2013| url = http://www.clarin.com/politica/Indagaran-Baez-extorsion-dueno-Rosadita_0_929907139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm’s various names and its existence in multiple countries have caused some confusion regarding its exact origins and the precise nature of Elaskar’s relationship to it. ''Clarín'' reported that a firm called SGI Ventures LLC, with offices in [[Miami]], [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Mendoza, Argentina]], was registered in Miami by [[Matias Molinari]].&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt; Another source has stated that on September 8, 2009, Elaskar became a partner, director, and CEO of Southern Globe Investments Argentina (SGI) Bursátil Sociedad de Bolsa S.A., and that Elskar himself formed the firm with a start-up capital of 320,000 pesos. This same source indicates that Elaskar formed SGI Inversiones y Participaciones S.A. in 2011 with a start-up capital of one million pesos.&lt;ref name=crimen/&gt; Yet another source suggests that Elaskar was involved in SGI as early as 2008, with SGI North America LLC being registered in Florida in May 2008 under the joint directorship of Elaskar and Ivanhoe Smester. SGI Ventures LLC, according to this source, was registered in Florida on December 6, 2010, with Elaskar, Matias Molinari, and SGI Argentina SA listed as directors.&lt;ref name=bovedas&gt;{{cite web| last =Gasparini| first =Juan| title = Las bóvedas suizas del kirchnerismo| work =Google books| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-XXhAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT156&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=elaskar+dunamis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ElnGFrEAfN&amp;sig=T35GuNuI_A7GLn8QVJ45F9DyKS8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dAbuU9P1C-nmyQOf14H4BQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=elaskar%20dunamis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Clarín'' stated in its April 21, 2013 report that it had concluded from its investigation that Elaskar is part of a Miami-based “business network” centered on Molinari’s father, the Argentinian politician [[Carlos Molinari]], a political ally of the Kirchners and a contributor to the U.S. presidential campaign of [[Barack Obama]]. At the time of ''Clarín''’s report, Elaskar was a shareholder in North America LLC and Conway SGI Capital LLC. ''Clarín'' noted the participation in both these firms of Smester, who had been convicted in the U.S. of mortgage fraud.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

According to corporate records, Elaskar was also Managing Member of a firm called Conway Global, which was registered as an LLC in Florida on December 6, 2011, and dissolved on September 28, 2012. His fellow director was Smester. Elaskar was also the Manager of Dunamis One Limited Liability Company, registered in Florida on February 16, 2012, and also now inactive.&lt;ref name=bovedas/&gt; On February 3, 2011, Elaskar became director of Assure Investments Limited, registered in the [[U.K.]] on June 25, 2010. His predecessor in this position was identified as “Michael Clifford,” a name that Juan Gasparini, in his 2013 book about the corruption of the Kirchner regime, identified as a “prestanombre,” or front name, which had appeared in the filing records of more than 1400 companies, and which might or might not be the name of a real person. Elaskar registered Avida Capital Markets Corporation in Florida on August 30, 2011, and dissolved it on September 28, 2012.&lt;ref name=bovedas/&gt;

==The K money trail==
{{Main|The Route of the K-Money}}
In April 2013, Elaskar was featured on the TV news program Periodismo para todos, hosted by [[Jorge Lanata]]. Also on the program was businessman and accountant [[Leonardo Fariña]]. Elaskar, identified on the program as a “financier” and former “multimillionaire cadet of Lazaro Baez” who was currently “unemployed,” said he had managed “between $50 and 60 million” as head of SGI, which, he stated, had grown to encompass branches in Mendoza, Argentina, and [[Panama]], as well as offices in the United States. Elaskar said on the program that he had met Fariña in January 2011, and that during the first half of that year he had carried out transactions involving about 50 million euros on behalf of Fariña’s client Lázaro Báez.&lt;ref name=rol/&gt;

“We acted as intermediaries in the delivery of millions of dollars and euros to overseas companies linked to Lazaro Báez, Martin Báez, and Leandro Báez,” Elaskar said, explaining that these men had “managed to create between 40 and 50 offshore companies” in [[Belize]] and in other under-regulated tax havens, and that bank accounts in the Lombard Odier Bank in [[Switzerland]] had been involved in these transactions. A key player in this scheme, Elaskar said, was [[Fabian Rossi]], husband of the celebrated actress [[Iliana Calabro]]. Elaskar also stated that he had ultimately been forced by persons connected with Báez to sell SGI to a firm called Helvetic Services Group, and was told that if he did not sell, he would “end up like Sebastián Forza,” an entrepreneur who had been killed in a famous triple murder in Buenos Aires in 2008.&lt;ref name=rol/&gt;

When Lanata’s program was aired, however, both Elaskar and Fariña claimed that every accusation they had made on camera had been a lie. An investigation ensued, involving hundreds of testimonies and raids.&lt;ref name=rol/&gt;

On April 16, 2013, prosecutor José María Campagnoli filed a criminal lawsuit on April 16, 2013 against Báez for allegedly extorting Elaskar and forcing him to sell SGI.&lt;ref name=lavoz&gt;{{cite web| title =Causa penal por presunta extorsión contra Elaskar irá a la Justicia Federal| work =La Voz| date =Oct 22, 2013| url = http://www.lavoz.com.ar/politica/causa-penal-por-presunta-extorsion-contra-elaskar-ira-la-justicia-federal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2013 article in ''Perfil'' stated that Elaskar had “a weakness” for “imported vehicles,” noting that he had owned several [[BMW]]s and [[Porsche]]s. The article also mentioned a photograph that had recently been made public, purportedly showing Elaskar’s black Porsche parked beside Báez’s private airplane.  In addition, the article maintained that Elaskar, when living in Miami, had crashed one of his Porsches into a church.&lt;ref name=foto&gt;{{cite web| title =El auto de Elaskar junto al avión de Báez| work =Perfil| url = http://noticias.perfil.com/2013-05-08-29005-foto-el-auto-de-elaskar-junto-al-avion-de-baez/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on June 10, 2013, that Elaskar, in four hours of testimony before Federal Judge Sebastian Casanello and prosecutor Guillermo Marijuan, had denied knowing Báez or the purchasers of SGI. Elaskar had also accused Lanata of carrying out “a hit operation” against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Elaskar negó conocer a Lázaro Báez| work =Diario Popular| date =Jun 10, 2013| url = http://www.diariopopular.com.ar/notas/159432-elaskar-nego-conocer-lazaro-baez }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later it was reported that Elaskar, who had submitted an appeal to the Buenos Aires Federal Court through his lawyer, Juan Manuel Ubeira, asking that the indictment against him be withdrawn, had withdrawn the appeal. This action was described by ''Perfil'' as “a strategy to accelerate the pace toward a public trial.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Caso Báez: Federico Elaskar no apeló su procesamiento y está más cerca del juicio oral por lavado de dinero| work =La Nacion| date =Jun 13, 2014| url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1701015-federico-elaskar-procesamiento-juez-federal-sebastian-casanello}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Lázarogate: Federico Elaskar trata de avanzar hacia el juicio oral| work =Perfil| date =Jun 13, 2014| url = http://www.perfil.com/politica/Lazarogate-Federico-Elaskar-trata-de-avanzar-hacia-el-juicio-oral--20140613-0018.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawyer Jorge Chueco, in an interview published on July 3, 2013, said that he had orchestrated Elaskar’s sale of SGI for $1,475,000 to Helvetic, the checks from which had ended up in an account owned by Báez. Chueco said that while arranging the sale, Elaskar had asked that his payment be sent to a foreign firm called Dunamis One Ltd. Chueco and his colleagues refused, whereupon Elaskar, according to Chueco, asked that his payment be made to one Jorge Alberto Cali, which did not happen either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Lavieri| first =Omar| title =Lavado de dinero: habló uno de los abogados que hizo la compra de SGI| work =infobae| url = http://www.infobae.com/2013/07/03/718473-lavado-dinero-hablo-uno-los-abogados-que-hizo-la-compra-sgi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2013, Elaskar’s extortion case against Báez was sent to the Federal Court.&lt;ref name=lavoz/&gt;

After Federal Judge Sebastian Casanello determined that Elaskar and Fariña were linked to criminal activities and had laundered money, he indicted both men on May 7, 2014, for money laundering. Fariña was indicted on five counts, Elaskar on eight.  Both were accused of participating in the whitewashing of funds and in using money that had been obtained through illegal activities. Elaskar was said to have whitewashed more than 25 million pesos “by purchasing high-end cars, properties, land, companies and financial transactions.” Casanello ordered the seizure of 27 million pesos from Elaskar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Duo indicted for money-laundering Judge probes Leonardo Fariña and Federico Elaskar| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =May 8, 2014| url = http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/158887/duo-indicted-for-moneylaundering-judge-probes-leonardo-fari%C3%B1a-and-federico-elaskar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Lázarogate: Procesaron a los financistas Leonardo Fariña y Federico Elaskar| work =Perfil| date =May 7, 2014| url = http://www.perfil.com/politica/Lazarogate--Procesaron-a-los-financistas-Leonardo-Faria-y-Federico-Elaskar-20140507-0021.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Wall Street Journal'' article published on July 28, 2014, about the financial scandal surrounding the Kirchners and Báez recounted Elaskar’s appearance on Lanata’s TV program and his later retraction of his statements. The Journal noted that prosecutor José María Campagnoli had verified Elaskar’s and Fariña’s connection to Báez and “their involvement in an alleged money-laundering scheme that used a network of shell companies” and had “alleged that Mr. Báez was a frontman for the Kirchners, diverting funds earmarked for public-works projects.” The Journal further reported on Casanello’s unsealing of indictments against Fariña and Elaskar “for money laundering unrelated to their alleged involvement with Mr. Báez.” The Journal quoted Elaskar’s comment that on Lanata’s TV show he had been “put in a sausage-making machine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Perez| first =Santiago; Turner, Taos| title =In Argentina, Mix of Money and Politics Stirs Intrigue Around Kirchner| work =Wall Street Journal| date =Jul 28, 2014| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-argentina-mix-of-money-and-politics-stirs-intrigue-around-kirchner-1406601002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on August 15, 2014, that the Swiss government had asked Casanello and Marijuan for cooperation on the money-laundering case against Báez, Fariña, and Elaskar. However, neither Switzerland nor Belize had responded to Casanello’s request to seize relevant bank accounts in those countries; Panama had rejected such a request. Elaskar was described as having “set up several cardboard companies” in Panama with Fabian Rossi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casanello enviaría un pedido de cooperación al juez de nevada - Clarin |work=Massive News |url=http://www.massivenews.com.ar/noticias/casanello-enviaria-un-pedido-de-cooperacion-al-juez-de-nevada-Clarín-15-8-2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis''' "'''Frank'''" '''C. Buckley''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (April 8, 1921 – February 1, 2016) was president and spokesperson for the [[Buckley's]] company, founded by his adoptive father [[W.K. Buckley]], in 1920. In 2005, the company was sold to [[Novartis]].

In 2003, he was made a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] for being "an inspiring example of how one can positively influence the lives of many".&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|7174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Buckley was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1921 and adopted by William Buckley, who had founded Buckley's Company in 1920; one year prior to Francis' adoption. Buckley graduated from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in commerce and finance.  Shortly after graduating from college Buckley enlisted in the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm as a carrier-based fighter pilot and served in [[World War II]] during his time with the Royal Navy Fleet. He started his career in the family business as a traveling door to door salesman for three years.

After Buckley had served his family business as a salesman, he took a position in the Management department. Frank Buckley was more interested in broadcast media, finance, and administration type of business while William was first and foremost a salesman; this dynamic element between the father-son combo proved to be an extremely and immensely effective tandem. William K. Buckley died in 1978.  Frank Buckley assumed his adoptive father's position in the family business as the president.

In the mid-1980s Buckley became the spokesman for Buckley's. He first came on the scene as the spokesman when the company implemented the satirically honest ad campaign that owned up to Buckley's "awful taste". This campaign was featured on many television and radio commercials. Because of Buckley's time and success as the company's spokesman on the many featured commercials, he became a recognizable public figure.

Since Buckley was a small boy, he always sustained an interest in the pharmaceutical industry.

==Politics==
McKenzie launched the [[Patriotic Alliance (South Africa)|Patriotic Alliance]] [[political party]] on 30 November 2013, and became the party's first president. McKenzie, along with long-time friend Kenny Kunene, have become known for using open letters to provoke political debate, cause controversy and attract attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/kenny-kunene-s-letter-to-zuma-1.1535280|title=Kenny Kunene’s letter to Zuma|last=Kunene|first=Kenny|work=IOL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kunene left the EFF months after its formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2013/08/21/kenny-kunene-quits-eff|title=Kenny Kunene quits EFF|work=Sowetan LIVE}}&lt;/ref&gt; before helping to launch the PA. Kunene subsequently also left the PA after the 2014 national elections and said he would no longer be formally involved in politics.

At the end of April 2014, just more than a week before the elections of 7 May, McKenzie wrote a highly critical open letter to EFF president Julius Malema, which gained widespread attention.&lt;ref name="news24.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Elections/News/Hard-hitting-open-letter-to-Julius-Malema-20140424|title=Hard-hitting open letter to Julius Malema|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter and in subsequent interviews, McKenzie referred to Malema as the "biggest threat facing South Africa". This was based partly on the EFF's policies on land expropriation and nationalisation. The primary criticism, however, was focused on the character of Malema himself, whom he accused of not being a real revolutionary, a "false prophet" whose promises would take South Africa to civil war and someone who had "stolen" significant amounts of public money during his political ascent.&lt;ref name="news24.com"/&gt; Malema dismissed the letter as predictable rhetoric prior to an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Elections/News/Malema-responds-to-open-letter-20140424|title=Malema responds to open letter|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4716">The '''Glass Age Development Committee''' was established in 1937 by [[Pilkington]] to promote the use of [[glass]] as a building material in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1964|title=A Multi-Purpose Seven Storey Bridge Project for the Thames in London|journal=Indian Concrete Journal|volume=38|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commissioned designs for many large-scale schemes, none of which were ever built.

Initially its name was the Glass Age Town Planning Committee. The first committee consisted of first-generation modern architects Maxwell Fry, R Furneaux Jordan, Raymond McGrath, Howard Robertson, G Grey Wornum and FRS Yorke. Each was asked to ‘suggest solutions to certain problems of town planning in London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Bournemouth’, using ‘all the structural and decorative resources of the Glass Age, but [to] produce practical schemes that could actually be built. An imaginative use of modern materials, rather than mere romantic fantasy was desired’. This being a marketing tool led by Pilkington, most of the problems were as unrealistic as the solutions. The designs followed early CIAM ideals in sweeping away historical areas such as The Strand and Bond Street in London, and Princes Street in Edinburgh in favour of extrusions of stacked floorplates walled in glass similar to the Miesian skyscrapers c1920.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Parnell (2014) "In praise of advertising", ''The Architectural Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 50s the Committee was formed by Geoffrey A. Jellicoe, Edward D. Mills and Ove Arup &amp; Partners; and it was joined by other architects for individual projects. The design briefs were for Britain in the year 2000, but realistic in that they were to make use of technology that was already available.&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture and Design for the Family in Britain, 1900-1970''; by David Jeremiah (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Notable schemes included a proposal in 1955 to demolish the entire area of [[Soho]] and rebuild it entirely in glass;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Chris|title=Urban Culture|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|year=2004|pages=226|isbn=0-415-30497-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1957 proposal for the replacement of [[St Giles Circus]] in London with a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} tall glass [[heliport]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1957|title=Crystal Gazing|journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology|volume=29|issue=4|pages=97|doi=10.1108/eb032812}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1963 "Crystal Span" proposal for the replacement of [[London]]'s [[Vauxhall Bridge]] with a seven-story glass building straddling the [[River Thames]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cookson|first=Brian|title=Crossing the River|publisher=Mainstream|location=Edinburgh|year=2006|isbn=1-84018-976-2|oclc=63400905|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was to have contained a shopping mall, luxury hotel, residential development and a museum to house the [[modern art]] collection now housed at [[Tate Modern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeremiah|first=David|title=Architecture and Design for the Family in Britain 1900–70|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|year=2000|isbn=0-7190-5889-9|oclc=186445752|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glass Age Development Committee is best known for its ambitious 1968 proposal for a glass and concrete [[Seasteading|offshore city]] housing 21,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=City at Sea to House 30,000|last=|first=|date=29 February 1968|newspaper=Times|access-date=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sea City"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0115965/english/info/future/sea.htm |work=Future City Types |title=Sea City |accessdate=2009-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408032505/http://library.thinkquest.org/C0115965/english/info/future/sea.htm |archivedate=2008-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be anchored off the coast near [[Great Yarmouth]] and accessed from the mainland by [[hovercraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~bat/sea-city.html|title=Sea City|publisher=Austin Tate|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development was to have been called Sea City. The structure would have been {{convert|4700|ft|m}} long and {{convert|3300|ft|m}} wide, and would have rested on concrete islands supported by [[pier (architecture)|piers]].&lt;ref name="Sea City" /&gt; It was intended that the development would have been economically self-sufficient thanks to [[boatbuilding]] workshops, [[fish farming]], and the export of fresh water from an onboard [[desalination]] plant, while a lagoon in the centre of the development would support a tourist industry based on [[Scuba diving|skin diving]] and [[water skiing]].&lt;ref name="Sea City" /&gt;

'''(George) Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl''' [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (19 June 1931 – 27 February 1996), known as ''Wee Iain'', was a Scottish peer and landowner.

==Background and education==
Murray was the only surviving child of [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] George Anthony Murray (1907–1945), who was killed in action in the [[Second World War]], and the Honourable Angela Pearson (1910–1981), daughter of [[Weetman Pearson, 2nd Viscount Cowdray]]. He was a great-grandson of [[George Murray (civil servant)|Sir George Murray]], grandson of the Right Reverend [[George Murray (bishop of Rochester)|George Murray]], son of the Right Reverend [[Lord George Murray (bishop)|Lord George Murray]], second son of [[John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl]] who in turn was eldest son of renowned Scottish Jacobite [[Lord George Murray (general)|Lord George Murray]]. Through his American great grandfather [[General]] [[Daniel Frost]] he was a descendant of the Winthrop family and a distant cousin to former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]].

He attended both [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], before succeeding the 9th duke, his fourth cousin twice removed [[James Stewart-Murray, 9th Duke of Atholl]], as 10th [[Duke of Atholl]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p2204.htm thepeerage.com George Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl]&lt;/ref&gt; With a height of six feet, five inches, he was one of the tallest Scottish peers, leading to the whimsical name of "Wee Iain".&lt;ref name="11thDuke"&gt;
{{cite news|title=The Duke of Atholl|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9272670/The-Duke-of-Atholl.html|date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==
Atholl inherited an estate of approximately 120,000 [[acre]]s (496&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)—although this was a decline from the 190,000 acres (769&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the 19th century, it was still a smaller decline than many other Scottish estates. Under his stewardship, the estate in and around [[Blair Castle]] became a significant area for [[tourism]] and [[forestry]], on which he was an acknowledged expert and spoke many times in the [[House of Lords]], having been [[Scottish representative peer election, 1958|elected]] a [[Representative peer|Scottish Representative Peer]] in 1958.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt; In addition, he resurrected the [[Atholl Highlanders]], the ceremonial private army of the dukedom composed of estate workers and family friends, as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name="11thDuke"/&gt;

He was an active member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]].&lt;ref&gt;Copping, Robert, ''The Monday Club—Crisis and After'' May 1975, page 25, published by the Current Affairs Information Service, Ilford, Essex, (P/B).&lt;/ref&gt; He also held several business appointments, notably as Chairman of BPM Holdings between 1972 and 1983 and of Westminster Press Group between 1974 and 1996 and as a director of [[Pearson Longman]] between 1975 and 1983. In 1980 he was appointed a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of [[Perth and Kinross]].&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Atholl died unmarried in February 1996, aged 64, with the titles passing to his second cousin, once removed [[John Murray, 11th Duke of Atholl|John Murray]], a [[South Africa]]n land surveyor.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt; The day before the death of the 10th Duke, it was announced that he had given [[Blair Castle]] and most of his estates to a [[charitable trust]], thus effectively disinheriting his heir. The new duke had indicated he had little interest in leaving South Africa, and though he honoured the land of his origins, felt "I am a South African, not a Scotsman." &lt;ref name="11thDuke"/&gt;

'''Insolvency''' is the state of being unable to pay the money owed, by a person or company, on time; those in a state of insolvency are said to be ''insolvent''. There are two forms: cash-flow insolvency and balance-sheet insolvency.

'''Cash-flow insolvency''' is when a person or company has enough [[Asset|assets]] to pay what is owed, but does not have the appropriate form of payment.  For example, a person may own a large house and a valuable car, but not have enough liquid assets to pay a debt when it falls due.  Cash-flow insolvency can usually be resolved by negotiation.  For example, the bill collector may wait until the car is sold and the debtor agrees to pay a penalty.

'''Balance-sheet insolvency''' is when a person or company does not have enough assets to pay all of their debts.  The person or company might enter [[bankruptcy]], but not necessarily.  Once a loss is accepted by all parties, negotiation is often able to resolve the situation without bankruptcy.

A company that is balance-sheet insolvent may still have enough cash to pay its next bill on time.  However, most laws will not let the company pay that bill unless it will directly help all their creditors. For example, an insolvent farmer may be allowed to hire people to help harvest the crop, because ''not'' harvesting and selling the crop would be even ''worse'' for his creditors.

It has been suggested that the speaker or writer should either say '''technical insolvency''' or '''actual insolvency''' in order to always be clear - where technical insolvency is a [[synonym]] for balance sheet insolvency, which means that its liabilities are greater than its assets, and actual insolvency is a synonym for the first definition of insolvency ("Insolvency is the inability of a debtor to pay their debt.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graeme Pietersz|title=Moneyterms Investment Definitions|url=http://moneyterms.co.uk/technical-insolvency/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While technical insolvency is a synonym for balance-sheet insolvency, cash-flow insolvency and actual insolvency are not synonyms.  The term "cash-flow insolvent" carries a strong (but perhaps not absolute) connotation that the debtor is balance-sheet solvent, whereas the term "actually insolvent" does not.

==Technical definitions==

Cash-flow insolvency involves a lack of [[accounting liquidity|liquidity]] to pay debts as they fall due.

Balance sheet insolvency involves having negative [[net assets]]—where liabilities exceed assets. Insolvency is not a [[synonym]] for [[bankruptcy]], which is a determination of insolvency made by a [[court of law]] with resulting legal orders intended to resolve the insolvency.

Accounting insolvency happens when total liabilities exceed total assets (negative net worth).&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, Ross-Westerfield-Jordan, 10th e, p.549&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graeme Pietersz|title=Moneyterms Investment Definitions|url=http://moneyterms.co.uk/insolvency/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downes, John, and Jordan Elliot. Goodman. ''Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms''. Hauppauge, NY: Barron's Educational Series, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UK Insolvency Act 1986, Section 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The principal focus of modern insolvency [[legislation]] and business [[debt restructuring]] practices no longer rests on the [[liquidation]] and elimination of insolvent entities but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing [[financial distress]] so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of their business. This is known as '''business turnaround''' or '''business recovery'''. Implementing a business turnaround may take many forms, including keep and restructure, sale as a going concern, or wind-down and exit. In some jurisdictions, it is an [[offence (law)|offence]] under the insolvency laws for a [[corporation]] to continue in business while insolvent. In others (like the United States with its [[Chapter 11]] provisions), the business may continue under a declared protective arrangement while alternative options to achieve recovery are worked out. Increasingly, legislatures have favored alternatives to winding up companies for good.

It can be, in several jurisdictions, grounds for a civil action or even an offence, to continue to pay some [[creditor]]s in preference to other creditors once a state of insolvency is reached.&lt;ref&gt;Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the People's Republic of China (August 27, 2006), Chapter 2, Section 2, Article 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debt restructuring==
Debt restructurings are typically handled by professional insolvency and restructuring practitioners, and are usually less expensive and a preferable alternative to bankruptcy.

[[Debt restructuring]] is a process that allows a private or public company - or a sovereign entity - facing cash flow problems and financial distress, to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent debts in order to improve or restore liquidity and rehabilitate so that it can continue its operations.

==Government debt==
Although the term "bankrupt" may be used referring to a government, sovereign states do not go bankrupt. This is so because bankruptcy is governed by national law; there exists no entity to take over such a government and distribute assets to creditors. Governments ''can'' be insolvent in terms of not having money to pay obligations when they are due. If a government does not meet an obligation, it is in "[[default (finance)|default]]". As governments are [[sovereignty|sovereign]] entities, persons who hold debt of the government cannot seize the assets of the government to re-pay the debt. The recourse for the creditor is to request to be repaid at least some of what is owed. However, in most cases, debt in default is [[refinancing|refinanced]] by further borrowing or [[monetization|monetized]] by issuing more [[currency]] (which typically results in [[inflation]] and may result in [[hyperinflation]]).

==Law==
Insolvency regimes around the world have evolved in very different ways, with laws focusing on different strategies for dealing with the insolvent. The outcome of an insolvent restructuring can be very different depending on the laws of the state in which the insolvency proceeding is run, and in many cases different [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in a company may hold the advantage in different [[jurisdictions]].&lt;ref name="Practitioner"&gt;Joseph Swanson and Peter Marshall, [[Houlihan Lokey]] and Lyndon Norley, Kirkland &amp; Ellis International LLP (2008). A Practitioner's Guide to Corporate Restructuring. City &amp; Financial Publishing, 1st edition {{ISBN|978-1-905121-31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian insolvency law}}
In [[Australia]] Corporate insolvency is governed by the [[Corporations Act 2001]] (Cth). Companies can be put into Voluntary Administration, Creditors Voluntary Liquidation &amp; Court Liquidation. Secured creditors with registered charges are able to appoint Receivers and Receivers &amp; Managers depending on their charge.

===Canada===
{{main|Insolvency law of Canada}}
In [[Canada]], bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]. An alternative regime is available to larger companies (or affiliated groups) under the [[Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act]], where total debts exceed $5 million.&lt;ref name = CCCA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br03125.html | title = Restructure your business through the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act | publisher = Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada| accessdate = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{main|Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code}}
In [[India]], bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the [[Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code]] 2016.The [[Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India|Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI]]) is the [[Regulatory agency|regulator]] for overseeing insolvency ''proceedings'' and entities like Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPA), Insolvency Professionals (IP) and Information Utilities (IU) in [[India]].

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]], owners of businesses that had at any stage traded insolvently (i.e. that had a balance-sheet insolvency) become personally liable for the business' debts. Trading insolvently is often regarded as normal business practice in South Africa, as long as the business is able to fulfill its debt obligations when they fall due.

===Switzerland===
{{main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, insolvency or [[foreclosure]] may lead to the seizure and auctioning off of assets (generally in the case of private individuals) or to [[bankruptcy]] proceedings (generally in the case of registered commercial entities).

===Turkey===
Turkish insolvency law is regulated by Enforcement And Bankruptcy Law (Code No: 2004, Original Name: İcra ve İflas Kanunu). Main concept of the insolvency law is very similar to Swiss and German insolvency laws. Enforcement methods are realizing pledged property, seizure of assets and bankruptcy.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|United Kingdom insolvency law}}
====Insolvency Act 1986====
In the United Kingdom, the term [[bankruptcy]] is reserved for individuals. Insolvency is defined both in terms of [[cash flow]] and in terms of [[balance sheet]] in the UK [[Insolvency Act 1986]], Section 123, which reads in part:

{{Quote
 |
123.-(1) A company is deemed unable to pay its debts ---&lt;br /&gt;(a) if a creditor (by assignment or otherwise) to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served on the company, by leaving it at the company's registered office, a written demand (in the prescribed form) requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor,...
     (2) A company is also deemed unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities...
 | [[Insolvency Act 1986]], Section 123 (Part IV, Chapter VI), p. 68.
 }}

A company which is insolvent may be put into [[liquidation]] (sometimes referred to as winding-up). The directors and shareholders can instigate the liquidation process without court involvement by a shareholder resolution and the appointment of a licensed [[Insolvency Practitioner]] as liquidator. However, the liquidation will not be effective legally without the convening of a meeting of creditors who have the opportunity to appoint a liquidator of their own choice. This process is known as creditors voluntary liquidation (CVL), as opposed to members voluntary liquidation (MVL) which is for solvent companies. Alternatively, a creditor can petition the court for a winding-up order which, if granted, will place the company into what is called compulsory liquidation or winding up by the court. The liquidator realises the assets of the company and distributes funds realised to creditors according to their priorities, after the deduction of costs. In the case of [[Sole Trader Insolvency]], the insolvency options include [[Individual Voluntary Arrangements]] and [[Bankruptcy]].

====Procedures====
It can be a civil and even a criminal offence for directors to allow a company to continue to trade whilst insolvent. However, two new insolvency procedures were introduced by the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] which aim to provide time for the rescue of a company or, at least, its business. These are '''Administration''' and [[Company Voluntary Arrangement]]:

*'''Administration''' is a procedure to protect a company from its creditors in order for it to be able to make significant operational changes or restructuring so that it could continue as a going concern, or at least in order to achieve a better outcome for creditors than via liquidation. In contrast to Chapter 11 in the US where the directors remain in control throughout that restructuring process, in the UK an Administrator is appointed who must be a licensed [[Insolvency Practitioner]] to manage the company's affairs to protect the creditors of the insolvent company and balance their respective interests. Unless the company itself is saved by this process, the company is subsequently put into liquidation to distribute the remaining funds.
*A '''Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)''' is a legal agreement between the company and its creditors, based on paying a fixed amount lower than the outstanding actual debt. These are normally based on a monthly payment, and at the end of the agreed term the remaining debt is written-off. The CVA is managed by a Supervisor who must be a licensed [[Insolvency Practitioner]]. If the CVA fails, the company is usually put into liquidation.

One particular type of '''Administration''' that is becoming more common is called '''pre pack administration''' (more information under [[administration (law)]]). In this process, immediately after appointment the administrator completes a pre-arranged sale of the company's business, often to its directors or owners. The process can be seen as controversial because the creditors do not have the opportunity to vote against the sale. The rationale behind the device is that the swift sale of the business may be necessary or of benefit to enable a best price to be achieved. If the sale was delayed, creditors would ultimately lose out because the price obtainable for the assets would be reduced.

====Receivership====
In addition to the above-mentioned corporate insolvency procedures, a creditor holding security over an asset of the company may have the power to appoint an insolvency practitioner as administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver. The process, latterly known as [[administrative receivership]] or, in Scotland, receivership, has existed for many years and has often resulted in a successful rescue of a company's business via a sale, but not of the company itself. Since the introduction of the collective insolvency procedure of '''Administration''' in 1986, the legislators have decided to set a shelf life on the [[administrative receivership]] or, in Scotland, receivership procedure and it is no longer possible to appoint an administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver under security created after 15 September 2003.

In individual cases the bankruptcy estate is dealt by an official receiver, appointed by the court. In some cases the file is transferred to RTLU (OR Regional Trustee Liquidator Unit) that will assess your assets and income to see if you can contribute towards paying costs of bankruptcy or even discharge part of your debts.

===United States===
{{Main|Bankruptcy in the United States}}
Under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], a person is considered to be insolvent when the party has ceased to pay its debts in the [[ordinary course of business]], or cannot pay its debts as they become due, or is insolvent within the meaning of the [[Bankruptcy in the United States|Bankruptcy Code]]. This is important because certain rights under the code may be invoked against an insolvent party which are otherwise unavailable.

The [[United States]] has established insolvency regimes {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} which aim to protect the insolvent individual or company from the creditors, and balance their respective interests. For example, see [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code]]. However, some state courts have begun to find individual corporate officers and directors liable for driving a company deeper into bankruptcy, under the legal theory of "deepening insolvency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|last=Thompson
|first=David
|journal=Stanford Journal of Law, Business &amp; Finance
|volume=12
|issue=2
|pages=536
|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In determining whether a gift or a payment to a creditor is an unlawful preference, the date of the insolvency, rather than the date of the legally declared bankruptcy, will usually be the primary consideration.

The '''Institute of Certified Professional Managers''' (ICPM) is a US-based, non-profit, educational institute and certification body affiliated with the [[James Madison University]] College of Business, that provides education and [[Professional certification|certification]] in [[management]] to managers, supervisors and leaders working in all industries.  Founded in 1974.

== Certified Manager ==
The Institute of Certified Professional Managers (ICPM) sponsors the professional Certified Manager (CM) certification.  Through a comprehensive program of management and [[leadership]] development and [[Educational assessment|assessment]], the CM  certification validates managerial competency and leadership potential.

The CM certification program comprises application, [[training]] and assessment.  CM applicants meet eligibility requirements for [[education]] and experience to receive approval to pursue the CM certification.  Training on the comprehensive CM body of knowledge comprises 75–90 hours and can be completed in groups, as classroom training, or individually, as self-directed study. A job task analysis performed periodically confirms the [[knowledge, skills and abilities]] and forms the basis of the CM body of knowledge. Applicants control the pace of program completion within 15 months.

The CM certification is obtained by meeting eligibility requirements and passing three CM exams.  Certificants can use the “CM” professional credential after their name, i.e. John Smith, CM. Certificants complete professional development activities annually and pay a professional fee ($50) to maintain current CM status.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== History ==
The Institute of Certified Professional Managers (ICPM) was established in 1974 through  a grant from the George R. Brown Foundation.  The Institute was formed to enhance recognition of management as a profession and to provide direction in the study of management.  Two organizations founded ICPM:  the International Management Council (IMC) and the [[National Management Association]] (NMA).

The International Management Council (IMC) was founded in 1903 by foremen who were members of the [[YMCA]] (Young Men's Christian Association).  Initially, named the Industrial Management Club, its mission was to train line managers for jobs in manufacturing.  IMC chapters were formed in over 40 US states and internationally in Taipei, Taiwan and Japan.  In 1971, the organization’s name was changed to the International Management Council and its membership expanded to include company presidents, managers and first line supervisors.  In 2003, IMC merged with the National Management Association.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The [[National Management Association]] (NMA) was founded in 1925 by Mr. [[Charles F. Kettering]], a pioneer in human resource development.  Initially named the National Association of Foreman, today it goes by "NMA . . . THE Leadership Development Organization" to reflect its focus on leadership development.  NMA is a national, non-profit leadership development organization headquartered in [[Dayton]], [[Ohio]] with a membership of over 22,000.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

'''Kenneth Matiba''' (1 June 1932 – 15 April 2018) was a Kenyan politician and an activist for democracy. He came in at second place in the [[Kenyan general election, 1992|1992 presidential election]]. In November 2007, he announced that he would stand as a presidential candidate in the [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|December 2007 election]].&lt;ref&gt;The Standard, 16 November 2007: [http://www.eastandard.net/news/?id=1143977528 Matiba set to contest presidency] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117022217/http://www.eastandard.net/news/?id=1143977528 |date=17 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matiba placed seventh, with 8,046 votes.

==Early career==
Matiba became a senior civil servant at age 31. Before Kenya attained its independence in December 1963, he became the first indigenous African Permanent Secretary for Education (in May of that year).&lt;ref name="turks"&gt;Daily Nation, 13 April 2003: {{cite web|url=http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/13042003/Comment/Opinion_Analysis1304200324.html |title=The Influential Young Turks of the 60s |accessdate=2017-04-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040109145832/http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/13042003/Comment/Opinion_Analysis1304200324.html |archivedate= 9 January 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matiba was mentored by Carey Francis, headmaster of [[Alliance High School (Kenya)|Alliance High School]], who lobbied for his promotion to permanent secretary. In 1964, Matiba was appointed Permanent Secretary for Commerce under Minister [[Mwai Kibaki]].&lt;ref name="turks" /&gt;

Matiba continued to succeed during the post-colonial period, helped by his connection to the [[Kiambu District|Kiambu]] family of Musa Gitau, one of the first Africans to become a minister in the Kenyan [[Presbyterian Church]] (Matiba is Gitau's son-in-law). Gitau also influenced [[Jomo Kenyatta]], having taught him at the [[Presbyterian Church of East Africa|PCEA]] Center, Thogoto, [[Kikuyu, Kenya|Kikuyu]]. In the patron-client reward system established by Kenyatta after independence, such connections were important to success in the public and private sectors. Matiba later left his civil-service career for one in the hospitality industry, establishing the Alliance Group of Hostels based on the South Coast. He also invested in exclusive private schools, including Hillcrest Preparatory (founded by Frank Thompson) and [[Hillcrest School (Nairobi, Kenya)|Hillcrest Secondary School]].

Matiba was chairman of the [[Kenya Football Federation]] from 1974 to 1978, and was elected to the [[National Assembly of Kenya|Kenyan Parliament]] in the 1983 general elections from the Mbiri Constituency (later renamed [[Kiharu Constituency|Kiharu]]) in the [[Muranga District]].&lt;ref name="Multiparty"&gt;Center for Multiparty Democracy: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080228121210/http://www.cmd.or.ke/images/Politics%20and%20Paliamenterians%20in%20Kenya.pdf Politics and Parliamentarians in Kenya 1944–2007]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Minister of Transport and Communications under the [[Kenya African National Union|KANU]] administration led by President [[Daniel arap Moi]], resigning in December 1988.

==Political activism==
At Moi's behest, Matiba was held without trial at the [[Kamiti Maximum Security Prison]] in 1990 with [[Charles Rubia]], a member of the Kenyan Cabinet who also called for multiparty democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty USA, 7 February 1991: [http://www.amnestyusa.org/regions/africa/document.do?id=578E73685AA90B91802569A6006007FC Medical Concern: Kenneth Matiba]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in prison Matiba was refused medication and suffered a stroke, which affected half his body and incapacitated him for some time. Later, a multiparty system was instituted and Matiba was released.

He was part of the opposition alliance forming the [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]] (FORD). During the December 1992 election, Matiba was the candidate representing [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy-Asili|FORD-Asili]], a party he helped found in splintering from the original FORD. President Moi won the election on the [[Kenya African National Union|KANU]] ticket; Matiba placed second, winning the Kiharu Constituency parliamentary seat in the concurrent parliamentary elections.&lt;ref name="Multiparty"/&gt; 
He [[boycott]]ed the [[Kenyan general election, 1997|December 1997 election]] (citing a lack of democracy), burning his voter's card.&lt;ref&gt;The Standard, 26 November 2006:[http://eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143961617 Anxiety over return of Kenneth Matiba]&lt;/ref&gt; Matiba has a long-standing rivalry with Kenyan President [[Mwai Kibaki]]. Before the [[Kenyan general election, 2002|December 2002 election]] Matiba was leader of the minor Saba Saba Asili party, which declined to join the [[National Rainbow Coalition|NARC]] coalition;&lt;ref&gt;The Standard, 26 November 2006: [http://eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143961618 Why former Kiharu MP will never forgive Kibaki]&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did not run for the presidency or a parliamentary seat.

In his later years, Matiba was dogged by ill-health stemming from his 1990 imprisonment. His business holdings also suffered, with his hotel chain being briefly taken into administration (although he regained control) and Hillcrest School sold by administrators (a case he legally contested).  Matiba regained control of the school, which he later sold to a [[consortium]] led by Fanisi.

He founded ''The People'' newspaper. It began as a weekly in 1992, becoming a daily in 1998; however, it was a drain on Matiba's finances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressreference.com/Gu-Ku/Kenya.html KENYA Press, Media, TV, Radio, Newspapers]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, he remained chairman of Saba Saba Asili and re-registered as a voter.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, 29 September 2007: [http://politics.nationmedia.com/inner.asp?sid=632 Anxiety grips Murang'a as Matiba gets new voter's card]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2000 Matiba released his autobiography, ''Aiming High''.&lt;ref name="turks" /&gt; As of 2010 he lived in Riara Ridge, Rironi (near [[Limuru]]), with his wife, Edith.&lt;ref&gt;The Standard, 27 February 2010: He will be remembered as one of the pioneer fighters of multipartysm in Kenya and was tortured by former president Daniel Moi.

Besides running a brewery, he was a member of the [[Haarlem schutterij]] and served as sergeant during the years 1627-1630, and appears in the [[The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630|schutterstuk]] by [[Hendrik Pot]] of 1630. He was then promoted to lieutenant during the years 1630-1633, and appears in [[The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633]]. He served again in (1636-1639), but died before [[The Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1639|the painting]] was finished that commemorated his service.

He married Agatha Dicx of brewery [[Het Scheepje, Haarlem|Scheepje]] on 27 April 1631. In 1639 Nicolaes died and Agatha remarried, on 7 April 1645, to Mattheus Hoffland.

'''Nicolás Mihanovich''' (1846–1929) was a [[Croatian Argentine]] businessman closely linked to the development of the Argentine [[merchant marine]].

==Life and times==

===The Beginnings===
Nicolás Mihanovich was born '''Nikola Mihanović''' in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], in what is today [[Croatia]], in 1846. Self-educated, he arrived in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1868 and formed a partnership with two of his countrymen: Gerónimo Zuanich and Octavio Cosulich. Operating five [[steam ship]]s by 1879, the group initiated scheduled transports from Buenos Aires to the then-remote outposts of [[Bahía Blanca]] and [[Carmen de Patagones]]. The new route's success led to the purchase of the 1,500-ton ''Watergeus'', which received a materials transport contract from the rapidly expanding [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway]], and to the 1887 establishment of the first [[ferry]] service between Buenos Aires and [[Colonia del Sacramento]] ([[Uruguay]]).&lt;ref name=studia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kadic|first=Branko|title=Los Hermanos Mihanovich: Fundadores de la Flota Mercante Argentina|journal=Studia Croatica|date=Jan–Mar 1961|volume=II|issue=2|url=http://www.studiacroatica.org/revistas/002/00209.htm|accessdate=1 December 2013|location=Buenos Aires|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already the majority stakeholder in ''Nicolás Mihanovich y Compañía'', he bought out his partners in 1888. Facing increasing competition in the late 1880s, the Mihanovich Company's strong financial base put it in a position of great advantage following the ruinous [[Panic of 1890]], which began in Argentina when the overissuance of local [[bond (finance)|bond]]s by the [[Barings Bank]] led to their collapse in value. The first major steam ship operator to fold was ''La Platense'', whose assets of over 1.2 million gold pesos (a similar amount in US$) Mihanovich was able to purchase in 1894 for only 92,000.&lt;ref name=studia/&gt;

===The king of Argentine shipping===
An ongoing rivalry with [[Saturnino Ribes]]' ''Las Mensajerías'' (so named for its prominence in the mail transport business) led to a [[trust (19th century)|trust]] arrangement between the two, whereby Mihanovich ceded control of [[Uruguay River]] shipping to Ribes, who was given control of the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. Ribes' death in 1897, however, left ''Las Mensajerías'' in the hands of heirs opposed to the previous arrangement, though the Mihanovich Company's strength forced the Ribes heirs to sell the company.&lt;ref name=studia/&gt; Purchasing ''Las Mensajerías'' for 450,000 gold pesos, and smaller rivals Giuliani and Balparado as well, the massive ''Sociedad Anónima Nicolás Mihanovich'' was incorporated in 1898; by then, the group operated over 200 steamers.&lt;ref name=historia&gt;[http://www.histarmar.com.ar/BuquesMercantes/HistMarinaMercArg/04Mihanovich.htm Historia y Arqueologia Marítima: La era Mihanovich {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihanovich would operate not only Latin America's largest shipping company, but also the region's premier [[shipyard]], allowing the group to dispanse with the [[outsourcing]] of repairs. The company began to issue [[stock]] and by 1907, the company's [[market capitalization]] reached 7 million gold pesos (Mihanovich's brother, Miguel, sons (Pedro y Nicolás) and other relatives remained majority stakeholders).&lt;ref name=historia/&gt; [[British Empire|British]] investors then quickly brought its capitalization to £2.1 million (US$10 million), leading to the company's registration in [[London]] as the ''Argentina Navigation Company - Nicolás Mihanovich Ltd.'' in 1909; the group, by then, had become a local monopoly of 350 steamers.&lt;ref name=studia/&gt;
 
Freed of competition in waterborne shipping, the group increasingly lost business in his [[riverboat]] unit to the nation's fast-growing [[Rail transport in Argentina|railways]]. Enjoying the advantages of speed and inland access, the [[Entre Ríos Railway]] became enough of an obstacle to prompt Mihanovich to negotiate personally with the line's British owners (though with little success).&lt;ref name=historia/&gt; Mihanovich then diversified into other sectors. He also purchased an extensive [[Quebracho tree|quebracho]] forest to take part in the growing furniture market, a wheat mill, the ''Banco de Italia'' (over half of the 6 million immigrants in Argentina were from that nation),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1990/1/90.01.06.x.html Yale: South American Immigration, Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[abbatoir]], among others.&lt;ref name=studia/&gt; 
 
 
Mihanovich also joined [[German Empire|German]] developer [[Otto Wulff]] in the construction of what became known as the [[Otto Wulff building]]. Completed in 1914, the [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]] neighborhood landmark housed the Embassy of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], by which Emperor [[Franz Joseph I]] named Mihanovich Honorary Consul and [[Edler]] in 1899. Later on the [[emperor]] granted him the title of [[Baron]] (''Nikolaus Freiherr Mihanovich von Dolskidol'' ) in 1912 with the right of transmission for his dedicated efforts towards the empire. 
He also received honours and decorations from others European monarchs, among them; the Cross of Second Order to Naval Merit and Alfonso XIII's Order from [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] of Spain and The [[Order of Saint Stanislaus (Imperial House of Romanov)|Order of Saint Stanislaus]] with stars from [[Nicholas II of Russia|Czar Nicholas II]] of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://construyendoelmuseoportuario.blogspot.com/2009/10/historia-de-los-hermanos-mihanovich.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company, however, remained closest to the British Empire, and although the Mihanovich family owned a 70% share, the company was registered in London. Every new steamer was, moreover, purchased from [[England]]'s famed shipbuilders, including the 6,177-ton [[cargo ship|freighter]] ''Centenario'' (one of the largest at that time in the world).&lt;ref name=historia/&gt;

During his active life, Mihanovich was involved in many charity activities and support various associations. He purchased 800 square kilometres of land in the [[Chaco Province|Chaco]] where he founded a colony called [[Colonia Dalmacia]]. He and his brother Miguel create a foundation for the development of their home town [[Doli, Croatia|Doli]] that still exists today called [http://www.zaklada-mihanovic.hr/ zaklada-mihanovic].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaklada-mihanovic.hr/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twilight===
Competition from the railways helped prompt Mihanovich to sell a number of his surplus freighters to European governments (newly embroiled in [[World War I]]). The perceived [[conflict of interest]] in having Mihanovich, an Austro-Hungarian citizen and official, direct a British-controlled shipping company led to his retirement from the board of directors, in 1916. His elder son, Pedro, briefly succeeded him, though in 1918, Mihanovich sold his family's stake in the group to a consortium led by a British shipping magnate, [[Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant|Owen Philipps]], later Lord Kylsant, and an Argentine investor, [[Alberto Dodero]].&lt;ref name=historia/&gt;

Mihanovich's heir, Pedro, died in 1925 and ultimately, the patriarch outlived all his sons. Later in the decade, he had a 21-story, eclecticist apartment-office complex built in Buenos Aires' [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] area. Inaugurated in 1929, the structure was named the [[Sofitel Buenos Aires|Mihanovich building]] in honor of its developer, who had recently died at age 85.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diager-arte.blogspot.com/2007/09/palacio-mihanovich.html Palacio Mihanovich {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Irish Wave at Park West in Dublin.jpg|thumb|240px|right|''Wave'' by [http://www.angelaconner.co.uk Angela Conner]]]

'''Park West''' ({{Irish place name|Páirc an Iarthair}}) is a large business park within west [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], notable for its public art and with some residential development.  Over 300 companies, with over 10,000 employees, are based there.

==Location and content==
Located just inside the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]] orbital motorway in west Dublin, the development comprises several million square metres of office and retail space, along with a hotel, a private hospital, and three apartment complexes.

Park West is in the administration of [[Dublin City Council]], and [[Dublin postal districts]] [[Dublin 10]] and [[Dublin 12]], chiefly the latter.

===Art===
Park West is home to Europe's tallest wind and water mobile sculpture, ''Wave'' by [[Angela Conner]]. It is a 39.3 metre (129 feet) tall sculpture made of polystyrene covered with layers of carbon resin. It is fixed into a 7.6 metre (25 foot) pit filed with 9.5 tonnes of lead.&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Times Magazine - A Life In the Day; 5 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
The campus is accessible by road (primarily the (New) Nangor Road, as well as Killeen Road and Cloverhill), [[Dublin Bus|bus]] (routes 79A and 151) and [[Iarnród Éireann|rail]] at the ''[[Park West and Cherry Orchard railway station]]''. At a moderate distance to the south is the Kylemore stop on the [[Red Line (Luas)|Luas red line]].

==Environment==
The [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] passes through the business park, with filter beds for the drawing off of water.

The Ruiz de Velasco family were the original owners for 128 years of the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|Acta de Independencia del Imperio Mexicano de 1821]]. This document was passed down through generations from [[Nicolás Bravo]].  On August 22, 1987, Pedro Ruiz de Velasco gave the document as a gift to [[Mexico]].

[[Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu]] accepted this gift and secured this historical document in the ''Museo Historico de Acapulco Fuerte de San Diego'' in [[Acapulco]] in the State of [[Guerrero]].

Pedro Ruiz de Velasco died in [[Mexican Federal District|México D.F.]] at the age of 81.

'''Professional sports''', as opposed to [[amateur sports]], are [[sport|sports]] in which [[athlete|athletes]] receive [[payment]] for their performance.  Professional athleticism has come to the fore through a combination of developments. [[Mass media]] and increased [[leisure]] have brought larger audiences, so that sports organizations or teams can command large incomes.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt; As a result, more [[athlete|sportspeople]] can afford to make athleticism their primary career, devoting the training time necessary to increase skills, physical condition, and experience to modern levels of achievement.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt;  This proficiency has also helped boost the popularity of sports.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"&gt;Andy Miah ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050801000000*/https://www.media.paisley.ac.uk/andymiah/Miah1998ExtremeSpectacle.pdf Sport &amp; the Extreme Spectacle: Technological Dependence and Human Limits]'' (PDF) Unpublished manuscript, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Most sports played professionally also have amateur players far outnumbering the professionals.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

===Baseball===
[[Baseball]] originated before the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). A humble game played on sandlots in particular, scoring and record-keeping gave baseball gravity. "Today," notes John Thorn in The Baseball Encyclopedia, "baseball without records is inconceivable."

In 1871 the first professional baseball league was created.&lt;ref name="Baseball in America" /&gt; By the beginning of the 20th century, most large cities in the eastern United States had a professional baseball team. The teams were divided into two leagues, the National and American leagues. During the regular season, a team played only against other teams within its league. The most victorious team in each league was said to have won the "pennant;" the two pennant winners met after the end of the regular season in the World Series. The winner of at least four games (out of a possible seven) was the champion for that year. This arrangement still holds today, although the leagues are now subdivided and pennants are decided in post-season playoff series between the winners of each division.&lt;ref name="Baseball in America"&gt;{{cite web |title= Baseball in America: A History |publisher= The U.S. Department of State via factmonster.com |accessdate= 14 December 2014 |url= http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0875086.html |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141217101150/http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0875086.html |archivedate= 17 December 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball became popular in the 1920s, when [[Babe Ruth]] led the [[New York Yankees]] to several [[World Series]] titles and became a national hero on the strength of his [[home run]]s (balls that cannot be played because they have been hit out of the field). One of the most noteworthy players was the Brooklyn Dodgers' [[Jackie Robinson]], who became the first African-American player in the major leagues in 1947. Prior to Robinson, black players [[Baseball color line|had been restricted]] to the [[Negro Leagues]].&lt;ref name="Baseball in America" /&gt;

Starting in the 1950s, major league baseball expanded its geographical range. Western cities got teams, either by luring them to move from eastern cities or by forming expansion teams with players made available by established teams. Until the 1970s, because of strict contracts, the owners of baseball teams also virtually owned the players; since then, the rules have changed so that players can become [[free agent]]s, within certain limits, to sell their services to any team. The results have been bidding wars and stars who are paid millions of dollars a year. Disputes between the players' union and the owners have at times halted baseball for months at a time.&lt;ref name="Baseball in America" /&gt;

Japan has also seen a prominent professional baseball circuit develop known as [[Nippon Professional Baseball]], which was founded in 1934 and emerged as an international force after World War II. NPB is considered to be the highest caliber of baseball outside the U.S. major leagues, and the best Japanese talent can emigrate to the U.S. by way of the [[posting system]]. Other prominent countries to play the game include South Korea (where their league has [[Posting system (KBO)|its own posting system]] with Major League Baseball), Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean states.

===American football===

The game of American football was professionalized in the 1890s as a slow, and initially covert, process; [[William Heffelfinger]] and [[Ben "Sport" Donnelly]] were the first to secretly accept payment for playing the game in 1892.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Regional leagues in Chicago, [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit|Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio League|Ohio]] and [[New York Pro Football League|New York]] had coalesced in the 1900s and 1910s, most of which gave way to the first truly national football league, the [[National Football League|American Professional Football Association]], in 1920.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} By 1920, pro football remained overshadowed by the college game. The first game involving an APFA team took place on September 26, 1920, at Douglas Park in Rock Island, Illinois, as the hometown Independents flattened the St. Paul Ideals 48-0. The first head-to-head battles in the league occurred one week later as Dayton topped Columbus 14-0 and Rock Island pasted Muncie 45-0.

Forward passes were rare, coaching from the sidelines was prohibited and players competed on both offense and defense. Money was so tight that Hals carried equipment, wrote press releases, sold tickets, taped ankles, played and coached for the Decatur club. As opposed to today’s standard 16-game schedule, clubs in 1920 scheduled their own opponents and could play non league and even college squads that counted toward their records. With no established guidelines, the number of games played—and the quality of opponents scheduled—by APFA teams varied, and the league did not maintain official standings.&lt;ref&gt;
"The Birth of the National Football League." History.com. A&amp;E Television Networks, 14 December 2014. Web. December 15, 2014. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170528/http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buffalo All-Americans, Chicago Tigers, Columbus Panhandles and Detroit Heralds joined the league before the end of the season, raising the total number of teams to 14, but the inaugural season was a struggle. Games received little attention from the fans—and even less from the press. According to Robert W. Peterson’s book "Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football," APFA games averaged crowds of 4,241. The association bylaws called for teams to pay a $100 entry fee, but no one ever did. Muncie played only one game before dropping out before the end of the season, which concluded on December 19.

At the conclusion of the season there were no playoffs (that innovation, although New York's regional league had used it, would not arrive until 1933) and it took more than four months before the league even bothered to crown a champion. Much as college football did for decades, the APFA determined its victor by ballot. On April 30, 1921, team representatives voted the Akron Pros, who completed the season undefeated with eight wins and three ties while yielding only a total of seven points, the champion in spite of protests by the one-loss teams in Decatur and Buffalo, who each had tied Akron and had more wins. The victors received a silver loving cup donated by sporting goods company Brunswick-Balke-Collender. While players were not given diamond-encrusted rings, they did receive golden fobs in the shape of a football inscribed with the words "World Champions."

Forgotten in the collective sports memory that the league’s official record books listed the 1920 championship as undecided until the 2013. The whereabouts of the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Cup, only given out that one time, are unknown. The legacy of two APFA franchises continues on, however. The Racine Cardinals now play in Arizona, and the Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago in 1921 and changed their name to the Bears the following year. Ten APFA players along with Carr are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which opened its doors in 1963 not far from the Canton automobile dealership that gave birth to the NFL in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170528/http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}
"The Birth of the National Football League." History.com. A&amp;E Television Networks, December 14, 2014. Web. 15 December 2014. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170528/http://www.history.com/news/the-birth-of-the-national-football-league |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The APFA, by 1922 known as the [[National Football League]], has remained the predominant professional football league in the United States, and, effectively, the entire world. The evolution from a haphazard collection of teams in big and small cities to the much more rigid structure it is in the present was gradual; the smaller markets were squeezed out in the late 1920s and early 1930s, a [[NFL Championship Game|championship game]] was established in 1933, a [[NFL Draft|draft]] was established in 1936, and schedules were standardized in the 1930s. A competing league has historically arisen to attempt to challenge the NFL's dominance every 10 to 15 years, but none managed to maintain long-term operations independent of the NFL and only two—the [[All-America Football Conference]] of the late 1940s and the [[American Football League]] of the 1960s—were strong enough to successfully compete against the league before the NFL subsumed their operations. [[Minor league]] football, although their leagues' memberships were unstable, began to arise in the late 1930s and remained viable as a business model up into the 1970s.

A major factor in the NFL's rise to dominance was its [[National Football League on television|embrace of television]] early in the sport's history. As college football heavily restricted the rights of its teams to broadcast games (a policy eventually [[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma|ruled to be illegal]] in 1984), the NFL instead allowed games to be televised nationwide, [[National Football League television blackout policies|except in a team's home city]]; the restriction was softened in the early 1970s, by which point the NFL had secured broadcast deals with all of the [[Big Three television networks|major television networks]], another major factor in the inability of any competing league to gain traction since then.

The related sport of [[Canadian football]] was eventually professionalized by the 1950s, which saw the evolution of the [[Canadian Football League]]. The CFL, despite losing all games in a series of contests against the NFL, was considered to be at least comparable in talent to the American leagues of the 1960s (its lone game against an AFL squad was a victory). Because Canada has a tenth of the population of the United States, the ability to make money from television was much lower, and although some of the cities of Canada were comparable to the major markets of the U.S., teams in places such as Saskatchewan and Hamilton were in markets quite small compared to even the small markets of the NFL, thus the CFL now pays noticeably less than other major professional leagues, but still more than enough to be considered fully professional.

The rise of [[indoor American football]] beginning in the late 1980s has allowed for smaller-scale professional football to be viable.

===Ice hockey===
{{main|Professional ice hockey}}

[[Ice hockey]] was first professionalized in [[Pittsburgh]] in the early 1900s (decade). As Canadians made up the vast majority of hockey players, early American professional leagues imported almost all of their talent before Canadian leagues began to form in the wake of a mining boom, depriving the U.S. leagues and teams of talent. Two distinct circuits formed: the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] in western Canada and the northwestern U.S., and the [[National Hockey Association]] of central Canada, both of which competed for the then-independent [[Stanley Cup]]. The NHA's teams reorganized as the [[National Hockey League]] in 1917, and the West Coast circuit died out by the mid-1920s.

By 1926, the NHL expanded to 10 teams in Canada, and in the northeastern and midwestern United States. However, the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1930s, combined with Canada's entry into World War II (which greatly reduced the league's player pool), led to the league’s retrenchment to six markets: Boston, New York City, Chicago and Detroit in the U.S., and Toronto and Montreal in Canada. These [[Original Six]] cities would be the only cities with NHL franchises from 1935 to 1967. During this time, the NHL was both stagnant and restrictive in its policies, giving teams territorial advantages, having teams with multiple owners in the same family (thus allowing the best players to be stacked onto certain teams), and restricting its players' salaries through [[reserve clause]]s. This stagnation allowed other leagues to arise: the [[Western Hockey League (1952–74)|Western Hockey League]] soon became the ''de facto'' major league of the western states and provinces, and the second-tier [[American Hockey League]] emerged in a number of midwestern markets the NHL had neglected, in addition to a handful of small towns.

Amid pressure from television networks that were threatening to offer the WHL a contract, the NHL [[1967 NHL expansion|doubled in size in 1967]], beginning a period of expansion that lasted through much of the 1970s. The last major challenger to the NHL's dominance was the [[World Hockey Association]], which successfully broke the NHL's reserve clause in court, drove up professional hockey salaries, and continued to pressure the older league into expansion. The WHA merged four of its remaining teams into the NHL in 1979, but had to give up most of its players, as they were still under NHL contract and had to return to their original teams. The NHL made its last pronounced realignment in the 1990s, moving most of the WHA teams out of their markets and establishing a number of new teams in the southern United States.

In Europe, the introduction of professionalism varied widely, and the highest-caliber league on the continent, the [[Soviet Championship League]] (proven to be at least equal to or better than the NHL in the 1970s), was officially composed of [[semi-professional]] [[works team]]s paid for their association with industries or government agencies (the [[HC CSKA Moscow|Red Army squad]] employed members of the armed forces, and the Soviet Union often drafted the best hockey players in the country to serve on the squad). The modern-day descendant of the Soviet league, the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], is fully professional and has a number of teams outside Russia, to the point where it has the resources to sign NHL veterans. Other European countries such as Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Finland, and Austria also have prominent professional leagues.

===Basketball===

{{see also|List of basketball leagues}}
[[Basketball]] was invented in 1891 and the first professional leagues emerged in the 1920s. The [[Basketball Association of America]] was established in 1946 and three years later became the modern [[National Basketball Association]]. The NBA was slower to establish dominance of the sport than other sports in the United States, as it would not do so until 1976, when it absorbed four teams from the [[American Basketball Association]].

Professional basketball has the advantages of much smaller rosters than other professional sports, allowing the sport to be viable in smaller cities than other sports. Professional basketball leagues of varying caliber can be found around the world, especially in Europe and South America.

===Resistance to professionalism===
Professional athleticism is seen as a contradiction of the central ethos of [[sport]], [[competition]] performed for its own sake and pure enjoyment, rather than as a means of earning a living.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt; Consequently, many organisations and commentators have resisted the growth of professional athleticism, saying that it was so incredible that it has impeded the development of sport. For example, [[rugby union]] was for many years a part-time sport engaged in by amateurs, and English [[cricket]] has allegedly suffered in quality because of a "non-professional" approach.&lt;ref name="Sport &amp; the Extreme"/&gt; An important reason why professional sports has been resisted in history was that organisations for professional sports usually did not submit to the international sports federations, and could have their own rules.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} For example, the [[National Basketball Association]] was formerly not a member of the [[FIBA]].

On the other hand, amateur rules heavily favour those countries where all elite players are de facto professionals but are able to retain their amateur status by earning allowances instead of salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coubertin.org/docs/Winter%20Games%20Schantz.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919124001/http://coubertin.org/docs/Winter%20Games%20Schantz.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all [[Eastern bloc]] countries were populated with amateur players who were actually full-time athletes hired as regular workers of a company ([[Krylya Sovetov Moscow|aircraft industry]], [[HC Spartak Moscow|food workers]], [[Traktor Chelyabinsk|tractor industry]]) or organization ([[HC Dynamo Moscow|KGB]], [[HC CSKA Moscow|Red Army]], [[VVS Moscow|Soviet Air Force]]) that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours [[sports club|social sports society]] [[works team|team for their workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html|title=PROTESTING AMATEUR RULES, CANADA LEAVES INTERNATIONAL HOCKEY|author=IIHF|date=2008|publisher=IIHF.com|accessdate=2017-08-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010205021/http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-17.html|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p.&amp;nbsp;59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports salaries==
Men involved in professional sports can earn a great deal of money at the highest levels. For instance, the highest-paid team in professional baseball is [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/teams/salaries?team=tam|title=Tampa Bay Rays 2015 Player Salaries and Team Payroll - ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=16 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405084930/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/teams/salaries?team=tam|archivedate=5 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tiger Woods]] is the highest-paid athlete, totaling $127,902,706, including his [[Testimonial|endorsement]] income,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplestar.co.uk/index.html?celebs=3 « The World's Highest-Paid Athletes »] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726025224/http://www.peoplestar.co.uk/index.html?celebs=3 |date=26 July 2012 }}, ''peoplestar.co.uk'', Retrieved on 11 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which massively exceeds what he earns from tournament golf. Woods recently became the world's first athlete to earn a billion dollars from prize money and endorsements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/54235,sport,news,tiger-woods-becomes-sports-first-billionaire |title=Tiger Woods becomes sport’s first billionaire |last=Underwood |first=Harry |date=1 October 2009 |work=TheWeek.co.uk |accessdate=21 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213035642/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/54235,sport,news,tiger-woods-becomes-sports-first-billionaire |archivedate=13 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have taken the salary of two thousand 1980s professional golfers each making $58,500 to match up with Tiger Woods’ current salary. [[Samuel Eto'o]] is the world's second highest-earning athlete and the highest-paid [[Association football|footballer]] in the world, raking in £35.7 million (over $54 million) a year excluding off-field earnings.&lt;ref name="Samuel Eto'o to become world's highest earning footballer"/&gt; The top ten tennis players make about $3 million a year on average. Much of the growth in income for sports and athletes has come from [[Broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting rights]]; for example, the most recent [[NFL on television|television contract for the NFL]] is valued at nearly [[United States dollar|US$]]5 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NFL renews television deals |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7353238/nfl-re-ups-tv-pacts-expand-thursday-schedule |publisher=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215163439/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7353238/nfl-re-ups-tv-pacts-expand-thursday-schedule |archivedate=15 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the U.S., on the other hand, make much less, for example as of 2014, the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] enforced a maximum salary of US$107,000 for star players (coaches could earn double that).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diana Taurasi's decision to sit out should spark WNBA salary changes|author=Fagan, Kate|date=Feb 4, 2015|publisher=ESPN|url=http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/12272036/diana-taurasi-decision-sit-spark-wnba-salary-changes|accessdate=November 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107155126/http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/12272036/diana-taurasi-decision-sit-spark-wnba-salary-changes|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely driven by the fact that the American viewing audience has far less interest in women's professional sport compared to men's; average in-person attendance and television viewership are both far higher for the NBA compared to the WNBA. According to investopedia.com, a male star like [[Kobe Bryant]] or [[LeBron James]] can individually earn a salary larger than every player in the WNBA combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/sports-active-lifestyle/highest-paid-wnba-player-bcaf4e2c1e892b3d#|title=Who is the highest paid WNBA player?|publisher=Reference.com|accessdate=November 6, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107013612/https://www.reference.com/sports-active-lifestyle/highest-paid-wnba-player-bcaf4e2c1e892b3d|archivedate=7 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the highest leagues, however, the money professional athletes can earn drops dramatically, as fan bases are generally smaller and television revenues are nonexistent. For instance, while the [[National Football League]]'s teams can afford to pay their players millions of dollars each year and still maintain a significant profit, the second-highest American football league in the United States, the [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]], consistently struggled to pay its bills and has continually lost money despite allotting its players only US$20,000 a year, and television networks made the league [[brokered programming|pay for television airtime]] instead of paying the league, making the league's business model unworkable.&lt;ref name=VirginianPilot10032012&gt;[http://hamptonroads.com/2012/10/agent-three-ufl-players-havent-been-paid-yet "Agent: Three UFL players haven't been paid yet,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729163210/http://hamptonroads.com/2012/10/agent-three-ufl-players-havent-been-paid-yet |date=29 July 2013 }} from ''The Virginian-Pilot'', 10 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Joe (10 October 2012).

Retrieved 2011-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Canada, most lower-end professional leagues run themselves as affiliated [[farm team]]s, effectively agreeing to develop younger players for eventual play in the major leagues in exchange for subsidizing those players' salaries; this is known as the [[minor league]] system and is most prevalent in [[professional baseball]] and [[professional ice hockey]]. Otherwise, the league may be required to classify itself as [[semi-professional]], in other words, able to pay their players a small sum, but not enough to cover the player's basic costs of living.

Many professional athletes [[Personal finances of professional American athletes|experience financial difficulties]] soon after retiring, due to a combination of bad investments, careless spending, and a lack of non-athletic skills. The wear and tear of a career in professional sport, can cause physical and mental side effects (such as [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], a condition that has seen a massive rise in public awareness in the 2010s) that can harm a former professional athlete's employability. In the United States, some of these problems are mitigated by the fact that the [[college sports]] system ensures most professional athletes receive a college education with no student debt, a legacy that provides them with a career path after their sports career ends.

==Company history==
Regeneron has developed [[aflibercept]], a [[VEGF]] inhibitor, and [[rilonacept]], an [[interleukin-1]] blocker. VEGF is a protein that normally stimulates the growth of blood vessels, and interleukin-1 is a protein that is normally involved in inflammation.

On March 26, 2012, Bloomberg announced that [[Sanofi]] and Regeneron are in development with a new cholesterol drug which will help reduce cholesterol up to 72% more than the leading brands. The new drug targets the [[PCSK9]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2015/01/26/sanofi-and-regeneron-leapfrog-amgen-in-new-cholesterol-drug-race/#11360b5e6ef3|title=Sanofi And Regeneron Leapfrog Amgen In New Cholesterol Drug Race|last=Husten|first=Larry|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''Rentier capitalism''' is a Marxist term currently used to describe the belief in economic practices of monopolization of access to any (physical, financial, intellectual, etc.) kind of property, and gaining significant amounts of profit without contribution to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterfrase.com/2011/07/slouching-towards-rentier-capitalism/|title=Slouching towards rentier capitalism|author=Peter Frase|date=7 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/academic-publishers-murdoch-socialist|title=Academic publishers make Murdoch look like a socialist|first=George|last=Monbiot|date=29 August 2011|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/wp-content/files_mf/rp159_commentary2_rentiercapitalismiranianpuzzle_doust.pdf|author=Dariush M. Doust|title=Rentier capitalism and the Iranian puzzle|work=Radical Philosophy|date=January–February 2010|pages=45-49|issue=159|format=PDF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the term are unclear; it is often said{{by whom|date=March 2017}} to be used in [[Marxism]], yet the very combination of words [[wikt:rentier|rentier]] and [[capitalism]] was never used by [[Karl Marx]] himself.

==Usage by Marxists==
In his early works, [[Karl Marx]] juxtaposed the terms "rentier" and "capitalist" to show that a rentier tends to exhaust his profits, whereas a capitalist must perforce re-invest most of the surplus value in order to survive competition. He wrote, "Therefore, the means of the extravagant rentier diminish daily in inverse proportion to the growing possibilities and temptations of pleasure. He must, therefore, either consume his capital himself, and in so doing bring about his own ruin, or become an industrial capitalist...."&lt;ref&gt;
Karl Marx, "The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts", Institute of Marxism-Leninism in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 1932. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/epm/]
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Marx believed that capitalism was inherently built upon practices of [[usury]] and thus inevitably leading to the separation of society into two classes: one composed of those who produce value and the other, which feeds upon the first one. In "Theories of Surplus Value" (written 1862-1863), he states "...that interest (in contrast to industrial profit) and rent (that is the form of landed property created by capitalist production itself) are superfetations (i.e., excessive accumulations) which are not essential to capitalist production and of which it can rid itself.  If this bourgeois ideal were actually realisable, the only result would be that the whole of the surplus-value would go to the industrial capitalist directly, and society would be reduced (economically) to the simple contradiction between capital and wage-labour, a simplification which would indeed accelerate the dissolution of this mode of production."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ Karl Marx, "Theories of Surplus-Value", Progress Publishers, 1863]
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hence the extraordinary growth of a class, or rather, of a stratum of rentiers, i.e., people who live by 'clipping coupons' [in the sense of collecting interest payments on bonds], who take no part in any enterprise whatever, whose profession is idleness. The export of capital, one of the most essential economic bases of imperialism, still more completely isolates the rentiers from production and sets the seal of parasitism on the whole country that lives by exploiting the labour of several overseas countries and colonies.&lt;ref&gt;
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism", Lenin’s Selected Works, Progress Publishers, 1963, Moscow, Volume 1, pp. 667–766. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/]
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It therefore becomes clear that the term "rentier capitalism" could not be coined by Marxists simply because of redundancy of the words composing it. Marxist thought perceives capitalism as inherently "rentier", or usury-based, which would lead eventually to its demise precisely because of this inner deficiency in its organization.

==Current usage==
Current usage of the term 'rentier capitalism' describes the gaining of 'rentier' income from ownership or control of assets rather than from capital or labour used for production in a 'free' competitive market. Rentier capitalism has become predominant in capitalistic economies since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Standing, Guy. "The Corruption of Capitalism: Why Rentiers Thrive and Work Does Not Pay, London: Biteback (2016) {{cite weblink | url = https://www.bitebackpublishing.com/books/the-corruption-of-capitalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term [[rentier state]] is mainly used not in its original meaning, as an imperialistic state thriving on labor of other countries and colonies, but as a state which derives all or a substantial portion of its national revenues from the rent of indigenous resources to external clients.

'''Vladimir Filat''' (born 6 May 1969), commonly referred to as '''Vlad Filat''' ({{IPA-ro|vlad fiˈlat|pron}}), is a [[Moldova]]n businessman and politician, founder of [[Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova]]. He was the [[Prime Minister of Moldova]] from 25 September 2009 to 25 April 2013. He also was appointed as the [[Presidents of Moldova|Interim President]] of Moldova for a brief period of time in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://unimedia.info/stiri/-13413.html | title=Guvernul Filat a fost investit cu votul a 53 de deputaţi AIE. Şeful SIS a fos demis de către Parlament. Noul director este Mihai Gheorghe | date=2009-09-25 | accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
Vlad is the second child of Maria and Vasile Filat and was born on May 6, 1969, in [[Lăpușna, Hîncești|Lăpușna]], a commune in the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]]. Alongside his two sisters (Ala and Valentina) and brother Ion, Vlad grew up in a part of Lăpușna called "Talcioc". In 1986, he graduated from high school in his hometown. Between 1986 and 1987, he worked at the school radio station until he was called up for military service. He carried out his [[compulsory military service]] in the [[Soviet Army]] (May 8, 1987 — August 15, 1989), in [[Simferopol]] and [[Sevastopol]]. He activated in [[KGB]] [[Soviet Border Troops]], having the rank of [[private first class]] and being decorated by his KGB superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ziaristionline.ro/2011/01/28/vladimir-vlad-filat-premierul-moldovei-recrut-fruntas-in-trupele-kgb-foto/|title=Vladimir (Vlad) Filat, premierul Moldovei, recrut fruntas in trupele KGB.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989 to 1990, he studied at the Cooperation College (''Kooperativny [[Technikum (Polish education)|technikum]]'') of [[Chișinău]], going on to study law at the [[University of Iași]] (1990–1994). As a student, he was the leader of the "League of students from Bessarabia in Romania", an organization formed by Moldovan students in [[Romania]]. In [[Iași]], among his classmates was [[Alexandru Tănase]]. While he was a student in Iași, he met his wife Sanda in the autumn of 1991; they dated for only three months before they married.

Between 1994–1998, Vlad Filat initiated and conducted more business in Romania. He was general director of "RoMold Trading SRL" in Iași (1994–1997) and the president of the Administrative Council of "Dosoftei" company in Iași (1997–1998).

==Early political activity==
Filat was a member of the [[Democratic Party of Moldova]] from 1997, when the party was founded, until 2007.

Having returned to [[Moldova]] for good in 1998, he was appointed general director of the Department of Privatization and State Property Administration from the Ministry of Economy and Reform of the [[Government of the Republic of Moldova]] (1998-1999).

He was a State minister in the [[Ion Sturza]] [[Cabinet of Moldova|cabinet]] of [[Alliance for Democracy and Reforms]] from 12 March 1999 to 12 November 1999.

In 2000, Filat was elected Vice-President of the Democratic Party. In the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], he became a member of the [[Parliament of the Republic of Moldova|Moldovan Parliament]]. Until March 2009, he was Vice-President of the Parliamentary Commission for Security, Public Order, and Defense. He was also a member of the [[European Union|EU]]-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee.

He ran for [[Mayor of Chișinău]] in the [[Moldovan local election, 2007|2007 local election]] and won 8.32% of the vote, in fourth place. Soon after the local election, in September 2007, he left the Democratic Party after ten years of political activity inside the party.

Filat has been the President of the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova]] since December 2007.

== Moldovan parliamentary election, 2009 ==
{{main|Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009}}
In the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|April 2009 parliamentary election]], his party won 15 seats and in the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009|July 2009 parliamentary election]] [[Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova|PLDM]] became the second party in the country with 18 seats and the first party within the [[Alliance For European Integration]].

== Alliance for European Integration ==
{{main|Alliance for European Integration}}

After the July 2009 parliamentary election, alongside [[Mihai Ghimpu]], [[Marian Lupu]], and [[Serafim Urechean]], Vlad Filat signed the [[Alliance For European Integration]] in a press-conference on August 8, 2009. Towards the end of August 2009, he became the candidate of the Alliance For European Integration for the post of [[Prime Minister of Moldova]].

== Prime Minister ==
{{main|Prime Minister of Moldova|Cabinet of Moldova|Vlad Filat Cabinet (disambiguation){{!}}Vlad Filat Cabinet}}

The [[Constitutional Court of Moldova]] confirmed earlier on September 17, 2009 the legitimacy of [[Mihai Ghimpu]]'s position as [[Acting President of Moldova]], which gave him the right to nominate a prime minister. On the same day, Ghimpu signed a decree nominating Filat for the office of prime minister. Earlier on September 17, the [[Moldovan Parliament|parliament]] approved a new government structure; according to the draft structure, the number of ministries remains unchanged at 16 but their names and responsibilities have been changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/stiri/moldova/parlamentul-republicii-moldova-a-aprobat-structura-noului-guvern-vlad-filat-noul-premier_80430.html|title=Parlamentul Republicii Moldova a aprobat structura noului Guvern: Vlad Filat, noul premier|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance for European Integration gave a vote of confidence to the [[First Filat Cabinet|new government]] headed by PM Vladimir Filat at a plenary meeting on September 25, 2009.

On March 8, 2013 Filat was [[2013 Moldovan government crisis|dismissed]] by motion of censure following charges of corruption, abuse of power and influence peddling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.md/LegislationDocument.aspx?Id=928a2109-946a-4dfa-8caf-797bb43620c3 Moțiune de cenzură asupra activității Guvernului]&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, President [[Nicolae Timofti]] decreed that members of the government should continue to exert their public duties until a new government were to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&amp;view=doc&amp;lang=1&amp;id=347106 Decretul nr. 534-VII, privind demisia Guvernului]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, on April 10, 2013 the President nominated Vlad Filat as a candidate for Prime Minister, authorizing him with the mission of forming a new government.
However, on April 22, 2013, the Constitutional Court ruled that this decree is unconstitutional, stating that a Prime Minister ousted by vote of no confidence following suspicions of corruption cannot further perform this duty and that the President has the constitutional obligation to appoint in the interim capacity a member of the government whose integrity was not affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constcourt.md/libview.php?l=ro&amp;idc=7&amp;id=428&amp;t=/Prezentare-generala/Serviciul-de-presa/Noutati/Mentinerea-in-functie-a-Prim-ministrului-unui-Guvern-demis-pentru-motive-de-coruptie-este-neconstitutionala|title=Menţinerea în funcţie a Prim-ministrului unui Guvern demis pentru motive de corupţie este neconstituţională|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President appointed [[Iurie Leancă]] as Acting Prime Minister on April 25, 2013.

== Arrest and accusations of corruption ==
Filat was stripped of his immunity and handcuffed in parliament on October 15, 2015.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-moldova-protests-filat-idUSKCN0S91BY20151015|title=Moldova detains former PM in parliament over $1 billion fraud|author=Alexander Tanas|date=15 October 2015|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was investigated for the [[$1 billion bank fraud]] and accused of having taken bribes of about $250 million from [[Ilan Shor]], who was chairman of the board at Savings Bank from April to November 28, 2014.

Filat has denied wrongdoing and said the allegations against him are politically motivated.&lt;ref name="Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova-ex-pm-immunity-lifted-fraud-probe/27308192.html|title=Moldova's Ex-PM Detained After Parliament Lifts His Immunity|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2016, Vlad Filat was sentenced to 9 years in prison.

==Honours==

In December 2013 Filat was awarded by the [[President of Moldova]] [[Nicolae Timofti]] with the highest distinction in Moldova, "[[Order of the Republic (Moldova)|Order of the Republic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publika.md/vlad-filat-a-fost-decorat-cu-ordinul-republicii--uite-pentru-ce-merite_1741431.html|title=Vlad Filat a fost decorat cu "Ordinul Republicii". |date=17 June 2015|work=PUBLIKA.MD|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2014 Filat was awarded by the [[President of Romania]] [[Traian Băsescu]] with [[Order of Faithful Service|National Order of Faithful Service]] of level Grand Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ziarulnational.md/presedintele-basescu-i-a-acordat-o-distinctie-lui-vlad-filat/|title=Președintele Băsescu le-a acordat DISTINCȚII lui Vlad Filat, deputatei Maria Ciobanu și scriitorului Iulian Filip|work=ziarulnational.md|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 Filat was awarded by the then-[[President of Georgia]] [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], with one of the highest distinctions in the country – the Order of Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timpul.md/articol/vlad-filat-a-fost-decorat-de-saakasvili-51812.html|title=Vlad Filat a fost decorat de Saakașvili|work=Timpul - Știri din Moldova|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Filat has divorced Sanda Filat in August 2012, a [[psychologist]]. They have two children: Luca (b. 1995) and Iustina (b. 1998).&lt;ref name="copii"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://protv.md/stiri/entertainment/la-brat-cu-cei-doi-copii-ai-sai-cum-a-aparut-sanda-filat-la-ceremonia---477131.html |title=La brat cu cei doi copii ai sai.

'''Won Alexander Cumyow''' ({{zh|first=t|t=溫金有|s=温金有|p=Wēn Jīnyǒu|w=Wen Chin-yu}}) was an early Chinese Canadian public servant and community leader. Born 1861 March 17 or February 14 in [[Port Douglas, British Columbia|Port Douglas]], [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]] (at the north end of [[Harrison Lake]], at the start of the [[Douglas Road]] to [[Lillooet, British Columbia]] during the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]]), Won Cumyow was the oldest son of Won Ling Sing, a [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]-speaking store and restaurant owner who had emigrated in 1858 from China to [[San Francisco]] and later to Port Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Shirley R.|title=Diversity and Multiculturalism: A Reader|publisher=Peter Lang "One of these, Won Alexander Cumyow, was born at Fort Harrison [Port Douglas] in 1861, the son of Hakka-speaking parents who had come from China."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Won Cumyow was the first person of Chinese descent known to have been born within the boundaries of present-day Canada ([[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]] being a colony in 1861). He attended high school in [[New Westminster, British Columbia|New Westminster]] and became a court interpreter (1888)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ccgwiki.vpl.ca/index.php/ccg_wiki/File:Cumyow-Directory2.jpg/ |title=Henderson's British Columbia Gazetteer and Directory |year=1890 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; and labour contractor. He was an interpreter in the [[Vancouver]] police court from 1904 to 1936, speaking English, [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and also the [[Chinook Jargon]] which he had learned as a child at Port Douglas.  He studied law, even articled, but was not permitted a license because, being Chinese, he was denied the vote.

Cumyow voted for the first time in 1890 but provincial legislation in 1895-1896&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~canbc/vote1898/voteregs.htm |title=1898 Voter registration information}}&lt;/ref&gt; stripped Chinese (and Japanese and First Nations) voting rights in elections in BC (though his name still does appear on the [[British Columbia general election, 1898|1898 BC]] voters list).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~canbc/vote1898/votecr.htm |title=Won Cumyow &amp; brother Cumye on 1898 BC Voters' list}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voters' list in federal elections came from the provincial election's voters' list, and so the federal franchise was also blocked. The federal [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923]] also known as the ''Chinese Exclusion Act'', was repealed after World War II on 1947 May 14, and he then voted again in the next [[Canadian federal election, 1949|federal election in 1949]] -- making him the only Chinese person to have voted both before and after the disenfranchisement. A photo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bcbooklook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Unknown-3.jpeg |title=1949 Photo of Cumyow voting}}&lt;/ref&gt; of him voting has been reprinted many times.&lt;!--- According to some accounts, he was also the ''first'' Chinese Canadian to vote in the 1949 federal election, but this is unlikely given the time-zone differences --&gt;

Active in the Vancouver's Chinese community, he was founder of the [[Chinese Empire Reform Association]] (an organization of overseas Chinese, active mostly between 1899 and 1911, made up of mostly the older, more prosperous Chinese merchants in Canada, and supporting the modernization of China through progressive reforms within the framework of a constitutional monarchy rather than by armed revolution), and a president of the [[Chinese Benevolent Association]]. Chinese merchants had formed the [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association]], with the first branch in Victoria in 1884 and the second one in [[Vancouver]] in 1895. The Association was mandatory&lt;ref&gt;All Chinese were asked to donate $2. If they did not, they would have to pay much more if they ever required the services of the association.&lt;/ref&gt; for all Chinese in the area to join, and it did everything from representing members in legal disputes to sending the remains of a member who died back to his or her ancestral homeland in [[China]].

Won Cumyow married Ye Eva Chan 1889 November 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vpl.ca/ccg/pop-up-Marriage_certificate_Won_Alexander_Cumyow.html |title=1889 Marriage certificate}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Chinese Methodist missionary family had adopted her and brought her to Canada from [[Hong Kong]] in 1888. Together Won Cumyow and Ye Eva had ten children. Their third son, [[Gordon Won Cumyow]], took over the position of court interpreter and became the first Chinese notary public in Canada. Won Alexander Cumyow died on October 6, 1955, in Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vpl.ca/ccg/pop-up-Obituary_Won_Alexander_Cumyow.html |title=Vancouver Sun obituary, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Integrated Trade Solution''' is a trade software provided by the [[World Bank]] for users to query several international trade databases. It allows you to query trade statistics ([[export]], [[import]], re-exports and re-imports) from UN COMTRADE, [[tariff]] and [[non-tariff measures]] (NTM) data from [[UNCTAD]] TRAINS and tariff and bound tariff information from [[WTO]], IDB and CTS databases. It also has a module called '''[http://wits.worldbank.org/wits/gptad.html Global Preferential Trade Agreement (GPTAD)]''' to search and browse [[Free Trade Agreement]] (FTA). It also has modules to calculate several trade indicators and perform tariff cut simulation.

WITS now has two sections. One that provides summary '''Trade Statistics by Country''' on total exports, imports, export/import partners, top product groups exported/imported, top exporters and importers in the World. The trade data for each country is divided into four sections. The first section is the Country Profile Summary and provides summary of the key indicators in Trade, Tariffs, Trade Indicators, Top Export and Import partners of the country and top exported products. It also provides development indicators from the World Development Indicator (WDI) such as GDP, GNI per capita, Trade Balance and Trade as percentage of GDP. The next section called country has primarily all country level Trade Indicators, and also indicators from WDI on Merchandise and Services Trade, Trade related taxes and GDP, GNI, GDP per capita and more. The next section is by trading partner and provides the top export or import partners of the country with the trade value, partner share. For exports by default it provides Trade Value and Partner Share, Additional indicators like Total HS 6 digit products traded, and Share in Total Products Traded in percentage can be selected. The imports data at partner level by default as Total Trade, Partner Share, Effectively Applied Weighted Average tariff, and MFN Weighted Average Tariff and number of tariff agreements. Additional indicators such as total number of HS 6 digit level products imported, Product Share as percentage, Simple average tariff effectively applied and MFN tariff, number of dutiable and free lines and more can be selected. The final section is by Product Group and this provides details of exports and imports of the country by various standard product groups like by HS Sector, SITC Revision 2 Standard Product Groups or UNCTAD's Stages of processing. By default the Partner is World but it can be changed to a specific country. For exports by default it provides Trade Value and Product Growth and additional indicators such as Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA), World Growth and Product Growth can be selected. For Imports by default it provides Trade Value and Product share in percentage, and effective applied and MFN weighted average tariff is provided for all product groups. Additional indicators such as Simple Average tariff for Effectively Applied an MFN, number of dutiable lines and free lines and much more can be selected. All indicators and country have metadata and the entire metadata can also be viewed in the metadata page. There is a data availability page indicating data availability for each country by year. Many tables and charts can be embedded as widgets in blogs or other html page. This section is also mobile friendly.

The second section of WITS needs Registration and Login and allows users to perform Advanced Analysis and select their own set of country and country groups, product and product groups, bulk download data, analyze trade competitiveness of countries and perform tariff cut simulation. The trade outcomes module provides a flexible array of options. These options include the selection of countries of interest, product classifications, the usage of reported or mirrored data, and the years of the analysis. In addition, users can also create ad-hoc country and product groups or—when relevant—investigate specific trading partners. It is also possible to generate only a subset of indicators and get comparative data on peer countries. The user’s guideline document provides specific details for these options. As an alternative to the indicator by indicator analysis, the software offers a built-in set of choices that the user can automatically employ to generate the set of indicators by section for the country and the year of choice. The output is data for each indicator along with a companion visualization, which can be easily exported in a number of formats.
WITS allows you to calculate and visualize the following Trade Indicators;

'''Country's Share of World Exports'''

'''Share of Product in Total Exports'''

'''Share of Market in Total Exports'''

'''Hirschman [[Herfindahl index]]'''

'''[[Revealed Comparative Advantage]] Index'''

'''[[Trade Intensity Index]]'''

'''[[Trade Complementarity Index]]'''

'''[[Export Diversification (or Concentration) Index]]'''

'''Export Specialization Index'''

'''Index of Export Market Penetration'''

'''Hummels-Klenow (Products) Intensive Margin'''

'''Hummels-Klenow (Products) Extensive Margin'''

'''Hummels-Klenow (Markets) Intensive Margin'''

'''Hummels-Klenow (Markets) Extensive Margin'''
*http://wits.worldbank.org/WITS/WITS/TradeIndicatorsHelp/TradeIndicators.htm

WITS has a new module called Trade Outcomes Indicators that can be used to review the country-level performance of exports along various dimensions, which together give a comprehensive picture of trade competitiveness. The trade outcomes tool follows the analytical framework developed in the '''World Bank's Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic toolkit'''. It provides indicators along four different dimensions of trade performance: (i) the composition, orientation, and growth of exports and imports, (ii) the degree of export diversification across products and markets, (iii) the level of sophistication of a country’s main exports, and (iv) the survival rate of its export relationships. This framework allows the analyst to evaluate the dynamics of the country’s exports along different margins of trade and to benchmark specific countries’ position with respect to their peers. The toolkit can be used to assess the competitiveness of a country’s overall basket of products as well as specific traded sectors. It facilitates the identification of the primary constraints to improved trade competitiveness and the policy responses to overcome these constraints.

WITS has introduced a module for Global Value Chain (GVC) Analysis using the underlying UN Comtrade data on gross exports and imports. The module construct trade indicators related to country’s participation in Global Value Chains (GVCs). Using the informed classifications based on '''Sturgeon and Memedovic (2011)''' paper. The module allows measuring GVC related performance through: (i) country analysis, (ii) regional analysis, (iii) inter-regional analysis, and analysis of (iv) individual products of interest.
