The '''Abortion Support Network''' is a [[UK]] based charity which provides financial assistance, accommodation and consultation to women from the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] who are seeking an abortion in the UK.

The charity was founded in 2009 by Mara Clarke.&lt;ref name="cosmo"&gt;{{cite web|title=How This Woman Helps Hundreds of Pregnant Women in Ireland Access Safe, Legal Abortions|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a40652/mara-clarke-abortion-support-network-ireland/|website=Cosmopolitan|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues the work of the (now defunct) [[London]] based 1980's [[Irish Women's Abortion Support Group]].

In 2015 they received widespread attention in the UK due to the popular parenting site [[Mumsnet]] using their annual charity fundraising appeal to raise money for the ASN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11666308/Mumsnet-backs-illegal-DIY-abortions.html|title =Mumsnet backs ‘illegal’ DIY abortions|date = 11 June 2015|last = Bingham|first = John|newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 as part of a coalition, ASN made a submission to the [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/Submissions/Eighth-Amendment-of-the-Constitution/Advocacy-Groups-and-Personal-Stories/Advocacy-Groups-May-2017.pdf|title=List of Advocacy Groups, Interest Groups, other Representative Organisations and Political Parties Submissions to the Citizens’ Assembly on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution|last=|first=|date=12 January 2017|website=|publisher=Citizens' Assembly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, ASN fund-raised and provided over £73,000 (€84,000) worth of grants for all associated expenses of obtaining an abortion, including travel. The team of volunteers fielded 1,009 phone calls (685 from Ireland) providing free advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/abortion-support-network-in-a-perfect-world-our-phone-would-never-ring-1.3504703|title=Abortion Support Network: ‘In a perfect world, our phone would never ring’|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethics]] and [[governance]], '''accountability''' is answerability, [[blameworthiness]], [[legal liability|liability]], and the expectation of account-giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dykstra|first=Clarence A.|date=February 1938|title=The Quest for Responsibility|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.2307/1949761|publisher=The American Political Science Review, Vol. 33, No. 1|jstor=1949761}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an aspect of [[governance]], it has been central to discussions related to problems in the [[public sector]], [[nonprofit]] and private ([[corporate]]) and individual contexts. In leadership roles,&lt;ref&gt;Williams,  Reyes(2006) Leadership accountability in a globalizing world. London: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, [[Product (business)|products]], decisions, and policies including the [[Administration (business)|administration]], governance, and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences.

In governance, accountability has expanded beyond the basic definition of "being called to account for one's actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulgan|first=Richard |year=2000|title='Accountability': An Ever-Expanding Concept?|url=|journal=[[Public Administration (journal)|Public Administration]]|volume=78|issue=3|pages=555–573|doi=10.1111/1467-9299.00218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Amanda |year=1995|title=The Chameleon of Accountability: Forms and Discourses|url=|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society |volume=20|issue=2/3|pages=219–237|doi=10.1016/0361-3682(93)E0003-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently described as an account-giving relationship between individuals, e.g. "A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about A's (past or future) actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schedler|first=Andreas|editor=Andreas Schedler |editor2=Larry Diamond |editor3=Marc F.

Accountability is an element of a [[Responsibility assignment matrix|RACI]] to indicate who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one who delegates the work to those responsible.

There are various reasons (legitimate or excuses) why accountability fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Accountable Partner – Why You Fail - Katy Christian Magazine|url = http://katychristianmagazine.com/2015/12/accountable-partner-why-you-fail/|website = Katy Christian Magazine|access-date = 2016-02-13|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and etymology==
"Accountability" stems from late Latin ''accomptare'' (to account), a prefixed form of ''computare'' (to calculate), which in turn derived from ''putare'' (to reckon).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Bruce Stone, O.P. Dwivedi, and Joseph G. Jabbra list 8 types of accountability, namely: moral, administrative, political, managerial, market, legal/judicial, constituency relation, and professional.&lt;ref&gt;Jabbra, J. G. and Dwivedi, 0. P. (eds.), ''Public Service Accountability: A Comparative Perspective'', Kumarian Press, Hartford, CT, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7837-7581-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leadership accountability]] cross cuts many of these distinctions.

===Political===
{{Anchor|Political accountability}}
Political accountability is the accountability of the [[government]], [[civil servants]] and [[politicians]] to the public and to legislative bodies such as a [[congress]] or a [[parliament]].

Hirschman makes substantial contributions to accountability theory, positing exit or voice as pivotal accountability mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exit, Voice, and Loyalty: Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States.|last=Hirschman|first=Albert O.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1970|isbn=9780674276505|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the governor and governed (i.e., [autonomous (auto) - dependent (dep)], [auto-auto], [dep-dep], [dep-auto] ) functions such that the prospect of citizen exit can, not only disciplines ex ante, but also ex post if the state is dependent on the citizens. The literature connects this disposition of autonomy or dependence to its [[fiscal capacity]]. States that are most responsive adjust to exit or voice. Clark &amp; Golder model the dynamics of Hirschman's theory and elaborate important aspects like those that operationalize loyalty as an active choice.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013. “Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.” Unpublished manuscript, University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Exit, voice, and loyalty will be expressed in different ways under differing regimes and given the relevant assumptions. All three of these sufficiently broad categories present ways and means of holding the state accountable.

[[Recall election]]s can be used to revoke the office of an elected official. Generally, however, voters do not have any direct way of holding elected representatives to account during the [[term of office|term]] for which they have been elected. Additionally, some officials and legislators may be appointed rather than elected. [[Constitution]], or [[statute]], can empower a [[legislative body]] to hold their own members, the government, and government bodies to account. This can be through holding an internal or independent [[inquiry]]. Inquiries are usually held in response to an allegation of misconduct or corruption. The powers, procedures and sanctions vary from country to country. The legislature may have the power to [[impeach]] the individual, remove them, or suspend them from office for a period of time. The accused person might also decide to [[resign]] before trial. [[Impeachment in the United States]] has been used both for elected representatives and other civil offices, such as [[United States district court|district court]] [[judge]]s.

In parliamentary systems, the government relies on the support or parliament, which gives parliament power to hold the government to account. For example, some parliaments can pass a [[vote of no confidence]] in the government.

Belsky et al. point out, whereas, under more democratic governance accountability is built into the institution of the state by a habit of regular elections, accountability in autocratic regimes &lt;ref&gt;Besley, Timothy and Masayuki Kudamatsu. 2007. “[http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3764/1/Making_Autocracy_Work.pdf Making Autocracy Work].” Working paper.&lt;/ref&gt; relies on a selectorate; a group that legitimizes or delegitimizes the autocrats powers according to [[selectorate theory]]. The primary mechanism at a selectorate's disposal is deposition, which is a form of exit. Beyond that institutions can act as credible restraints on autocracy as well.

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] found that empowering citizens in developing countries to be able to hold their domestic governments to account was incredibly complex in practice. However, by developing explicit processes that generate change from individuals, groups or communities ([[Theories of Change]]), and by fusing political economy analysis and [[outcome mapping]] tools, the complex state-citizen dynamics can be better understood. As such, more effective ways to achieve outcomes can hence be generated.&lt;ref&gt;Tembo, F., March 2012, [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=6318&amp;title=state-accountability-citizen-voice-mwananchi Citizen voice and state accountability: towards theories of change that embrace contextual dynamics] ''Overseas Development Institute'', retrieved 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the International Budget Partnership (IBP) found that civil society organizations play an important role in achieving accountability outcomes. The IBP case studies showed that CSOs can have an impact in a broad array of political and economic contexts. The researchers concluded that CSOs are most effective when they draw in a broad web of actors from across the accountability system, including the media, auditors, donors, the legislature, executive insiders, and political parties.&lt;ref&gt;van Zyl, Albert, October 2013, [http://internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/CSO-transparency-and-accountability-Governance-HEC-conference.pdf Greasing the Wheels of the Accountability System: How Civil Society Organizations Close the Gap between Transparency and Accountability], ''International Budget Partnership'', retrieved 1 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical===
{{See also|Social accounting|Environmental accounting}}

Within an organization, the principles and practices of ethical accountability aim to improve both the internal standard of individual and group conduct as well as external factors, such as sustainable economic and ecologic strategies. Also, ethical accountability plays a progressively important role in academic fields, such as laboratory experiments and field research. Debates around the practice of ethical accountability on the part of researchers in the social field – whether professional or others – have been thoroughly explored by Norma R.A. Romm in her work on Accountability in Social Research,&lt;ref name=romm&gt;{{cite book|last=Romm|first=Norma R.A.|title=Accountability in Social Research|year=2001|publisher=Klower Academic|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-46564-2|url=https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/book/978-0-306-46564-2?detailsPage=reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; including her book on New Racism: Revisiting Researcher Accountabilities, reviewed by Carole Truman in the journal Sociological Research Online.&lt;ref name=truman&gt;{{cite web|last=Truman|first=Carole|title=Review of New Racism: Revisiting Researcher Accountabilities|url=http://www.socresonline.org.uk/16/2/reviews/3.html|publisher=Sociological Research Online|accessdate=27 August 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here it is suggested that researcher accountability implies that researchers are cognizant of, and take some responsibility for, the potential impact of their ways of doing research – and of writing it up – on the social fields of which the research is part. That is, accountability is linked to considering carefully, and being open to challenge in relation to, one's choices concerning how research agendas are framed and the styles in which write-ups of research "results" are created.

===Administrative===
Internal rules and norms as well as some independent commission are mechanisms to hold civil servants within the administration of government accountable. Within department or ministry, firstly, behavior is bound by rules and regulations; secondly, civil servants are subordinates in a hierarchy and accountable to superiors. Nonetheless, there are independent "watchdog" units to scrutinize and hold departments accountable; legitimacy of these commissions is built upon their independence, as it avoids any conflicts of interests.
The accountability is defined as "an element which is part of a unique responsibility and which represents an obligation of an actor to achieve the goal, or to perform the procedure of a task, and the justification that it is done to someone else, under threat of sanction".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference|author=Feltus C. |title=Aligning Access Rights to Governance Needs with the Responsibility MetaModel (ReMMo) in the Frame of Enterprise Architecture |date=2011 |url=http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal:144013 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724221935/http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal%3A144013 |archivedate=24 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
{{Anchor|Security accountability}}
The traceability of actions performed on a system to a specific system entity (user, process, device). For example, the use of unique user identification and authentication supports accountability; the use of shared [[user ID]]s and [[password]]s destroys accountability.

===Individuals within organizations===
Because many different individuals in large organizations contribute in many ways to the decisions and policies, it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results. This is what is known, following Thompson, as the problem of many hands.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis (2005). “The Problem of Many Hands” in ''Restoring Responsibility: Ethics in Government, Business and Healthcare''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 33-49. {{ISBN|978-0521547222}}&lt;/ref&gt; It creates a dilemma for accountability. If individuals are held accountable or responsible, individuals who could not have prevented the results are either unfairly punished, or they "take responsibility" in a symbolic ritual without suffering any consequences.  If only organizations are held accountable, then all individuals in the organization are equally blameworthy or all are excused. Various solutions have been proposed.  One is to broaden the criteria for individual responsibility so that individuals are held accountable for not anticipating failures in the organization. Another solution, recently proposed by Thompson, is to hold individuals accountable for the design of the organization, both retrospectively and prospectively.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis F. (2014). "Responsibility for Failures of Government: The Problem of Many Hands," ''American Review of Public Administration'' '''44''' (3): 259–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constituency relations ===
Within this perspective, a particular agency of the government is accountable if voices are heard from agencies, groups or institutions outside the public sector representing citizens' interests from a particular constituency or field. Moreover, the government is obliged to empower members of agencies with political rights to run for elections and be elected; or, appoint them into the public sector as a way to make the government representative and to ensure that voices from all constituencies are included in policy-making.

===Public/private overlap===
With the increase over the last several decades in public service provided by private entities, especially in Britain and the United States, some have called for increased political accountability mechanisms for otherwise non-political entities.    Legal scholar Anne Davies, for instance, argues that the line between public institutions and private entities like corporations is becoming blurred in certain areas of public service in the United Kingdom, and that this can compromise political accountability in those areas.  She and others argue that some administrative law reform is necessary to address this accountability gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competition-law.ox.ac.uk/members/profile.phtml?lecturer_code=daviesa |title=oxford law - the faculty and its members : anne davies |publisher=Competition-law.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the public/private overlap in the United States, public concern over the contracting of government services (including military) and the resulting accountability gap has been highlighted recently following the shooting incident involving the Blackwater security firm in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/ed_harriman/2007/09/blackwater_poisons_the_well.html |title=Blackwater poisons the well |publisher=Commentisfree.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2009-08-26 | location=London | first=Ed | last=Harriman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary studies==
Accountability involves either the expectation or assumption of account-giving behavior. The study of account giving as a sociological act was articulated in a 1968 article on "Accounts" by Marvin Scott and Stanford Lyman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Marvin B.|author2=Lyman, Stanford M.|date=February 1968|title=Accounts|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=46–62|doi=10.2307/2092239|pmid=5644339|publisher=American Sociological Review, Vol. 33, No. 1|jstor=2092239}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be traced as well to [[J. L. Austin]]'s 1956 essay "A Plea for Excuses",&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J.L. 1956-7. A plea for excuses. Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society.
Reprinted in [[J. O. Urmson]] &amp; [[G. J. Warnock]], eds., 1979, J. L. Austin: Philosophical Papers, 3rd edition. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 175-204.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he used excuse-making as an example of [[speech act]]s.

Communications scholars have extended this work through the examination of strategic uses of excuses, justifications, rationalizations, apologies and other forms of account giving behavior by individuals and corporations, and [[Philip Tetlock]] and his colleagues have applied experimental design techniques to explore how individuals behave under various scenarios and situations that demand accountability.

Recently, accountability has become an important topic in the discussion about the legitimacy of international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Ruth W.|author2=Keohane, Robert O.|year=2005|title=Accountability and Abuses of Power in World Politics|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=99|issue=1|pages=29–43|doi=10.1017/S0003055405051476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there is no global democratically elected body to which organizations must account, global organizations from all sectors  bodies are often criticized as having large accountability gaps. The Charter 99 for Global Democracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=14&amp;Itemid=55 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516034551/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=14&amp;Itemid=55 |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; spearheaded by the [[One World Trust]], first proposed that cross-sector principles of accountability be researched and observed by institutions that affect people, independent of their legal status. One paradigmatic problem arising in the global context is that of institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] who are founded and supported by wealthy nations or individuals and provide grants and loans, to developing nations. Should those institutions be accountable to their founders and investors or to the persons and nations they lend money to? In the debate over [[global justice]] and its distributional consequences, Cosmopolitans tend to advocate greater accountability to the disregarded interests of traditionally marginalized populations and developing nations. On the other hand, those in the [[Nationalism]] and Society of States traditions deny the tenets of [[moral universalism]] and argue that beneficiaries of global development initiatives have no substantive entitlement to call international institutions to account. The [[One World Trust]] Global Accountability Report, published in a first full cycle 2006 to 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=60|title=Global Accountability Report (GAR)|author=Administrator|work=oneworldtrust.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124021950/http://www.oneworldtrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=73&amp;Itemid=60|archivedate=24 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one attempt to measure the capability of global organizations to be accountable to their stakeholders.

===Accountability in education===
Student accountability is traditionally based on hang school and classroom rules, combined with sanctions for infringement. As defined by National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), accountability is "A program, often legislated, that attributes the responsibility for student learning to teachers, school administrators, and/or students. Test results typically are used to judge accountability, and often consequences are imposed for shortcomings."&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA |date=22 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, some educational establishments such as [[Sudbury Valley School|Sudbury schools]] believe that students are personally responsible for their acts, and that traditional schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action are considered the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Sudbury schools claim that {{"'}}[[Value (ethics)|Ethics]]' is a course taught by life experience". They adduce that the essential ingredient for acquiring values—and for moral action is personal responsibility, that schools will become involved in the teaching of morals when they become communities of people who fully respect each other's right to make choices, and that the only way the schools can become meaningful purveyors of ethical values is if they provide students and adults with real-life experiences that are bearers of moral import. Students are given complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a [[direct democracy]] in which students and staff are equals.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

Data were drawn from an extensive set of field notes made in an ethnographic study at Sudbury Valley School (an ungraded, democratically structured school in Framingham, MA), where students, ranging in age from 4 to 19, are free to choose their own activities and companions. Vignettes were analyzed using grounded theory approach to qualitative analysis, and themes were developed from an analysis of observations of meetings. Each theme describes a participation level that students assume in the process and that provide opportunities for them to develop and deepen understanding of the balance of personal rights and responsibilities within a community. The study adds to the understanding of education and child development by describing a school that differs significantly in its practice from the wider educational community and by validating Kohlberg's thesis about developing moral reasoning.

Accountability standards have been set up, and organizations can voluntarily commit to them. Standards apply in particular to the non-profit world and to [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR) initiatives. Accountability standards include:
* [[INGO Accountability Charter]], signed by a large number of [[NGOs]] to "demonstrate their commitment to accountability and transparency"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517195312/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/about-the-charter/ |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed symbolism==
[[Viktor Frankl]], neurologist, psychiatrist, author, and founder of [[logotherapy]] and one of the key figures in [[existential therapy]], in his book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' recommended "that the [[Statue of Liberty]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] (that has become a symbol of [[Liberty]] and [[Political freedom|Freedom]]) should be supplemented by a [[Statue of Responsibility]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast."]] Frankl stated: "Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness."&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Frankl|Frankl, Viktor Emil]] (1956) ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', p. 209-210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warnock, C.

'''Analogical modeling''' ('''AM''') is a formal theory of [[exemplar theory|exemplar]] based analogical reasoning, proposed by [[Royal Skousen]], professor of Linguistics and English language at [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah]]. It is applicable to language modeling and other categorization tasks. Analogical modeling is related to [[connectionism]] and [[Nearest neighbor (pattern recognition)|nearest neighbor]] approaches, in that it is data-based rather than abstraction-based; but it is distinguished by its ability to cope with imperfect datasets (such as caused by simulated short term memory limits) and to base predictions on all relevant segments of the dataset, whether near or far. In language modeling, AM has successfully predicted empirically valid forms for which no theoretical explanation was known (see the discussion of Finnish morphology in Skousen et al. 2002). &lt;!-- I don't have the book to hand; I know the article in question was pp. 11-25, but I can't give an actual page number for the Finnish prediction. --&gt;

==Implementation==
===Overview===
An exemplar-based model consists of a [[general-purpose modeling]] engine and a problem-specific dataset. Within the dataset, each exemplar (a case to be reasoned from, or an informative past experience) appears as a feature vector: a row of values for the set of parameters that define the problem. For example, in a spelling-to-sound task, the feature vector might consist of the letters of a word. &lt;!-- Re these tasks, it would be appropriate to cite one of the papers of Walter Daelemans or the Induction of Linguistic Knowledge group at Tilburg University. I need to slap the references up on the talk page so someone with a library can find the right one. --&gt; Each exemplar in the dataset is stored with an outcome, such as a phoneme or phone to be generated. When the model is presented with a novel situation (in the form of an outcome-less feature vector), the engine algorithmically sorts the dataset to find exemplars that helpfully resemble it, and selects one, whose outcome is the model's prediction. The particulars of the algorithm distinguish one exemplar-based modeling system from another.

In AM, we think of the feature values as characterizing a context, and the outcome as a behavior that occurs within that context. Accordingly, the novel situation is known as the ''given context.'' Given the known features of the context, the AM engine systematically generates all contexts that include it (all of its ''supracontexts''), and extracts from the dataset the exemplars that belong to each. The engine then discards those supracontexts whose outcomes are [[inconsistent]] (this measure of consistency will be discussed further below), leaving an ''analogical set'' of supracontexts, and probabilistically selects an exemplar from the analogical set with a bias toward those in large supracontexts. This multilevel search exponentially magnifies the likelihood of a behavior's being predicted as it occurs reliably in settings that specifically resemble the given context.

===Analogical modeling in detail===

AM performs the same process for each case it is asked to evaluate. The given context, consisting of n variables, is used as a template to generate &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; supracontexts. Each supracontext is a set of exemplars in which one or more variables have the same values that they do in the given context, and the other variables are ignored. In effect, each is a view of the data, created by filtering for some criteria of similarity to the given context, and the total set of supracontexts exhausts all such views. Alternatively, each supracontext is a theory of the task or a proposed rule whose predictive power needs to be evaluated.

It is important to note that the supracontexts are not equal peers one with another; they are arranged by their distance from the given context, forming a hierarchy. If a supracontext specifies all of the variables that another one does and more, it is a subcontext of that other one, and it lies closer to the given context. (The hierarchy is not strictly branching; each supracontext can itself be a subcontext of several others, and can have several subcontexts.) This hierarchy becomes significant in the next step of the algorithm.

The engine now chooses the analogical set from among the supracontexts. A supracontext may contain exemplars that only exhibit one behavior; it is deterministically homogeneous and is included. It is a view of the data that displays regularity, or a relevant theory that has never yet been disproven. A supracontext may exhibit several behaviors, but contain no exemplars that occur in any more specific supracontext (that is, in any of its subcontexts); in this case it is non-deterministically homogeneous and is included. Here there is no great evidence that a systematic behavior occurs, but also no counterargument. Finally, a supracontext may be heterogeneous, meaning that it exhibits behaviors that are found in a subcontext (closer to the given context), and also behaviors that are not. Where the ambiguous behavior of the nondeterministically homogeneous supracontext was accepted, this is rejected because the intervening subcontext demonstrates that there is a better theory to be found. The heterogeneous supracontext is therefore excluded. This guarantees that we see an increase in meaningfully consistent behavior in the analogical set as we approach the given context.

With the analogical set chosen, each appearance of an exemplar (for a given exemplar may appear in several of the analogical supracontexts) is given a pointer to every other appearance of an exemplar within its supracontexts. One of these pointers is then selected at random and followed, and the exemplar to which it points provides the outcome. This gives each supracontext an importance proportional to the square of its size, and makes each exemplar likely to be selected in direct proportion to the sum of the sizes of all analogically consistent supracontexts in which it appears. Then, of course, the probability of predicting a particular outcome is proportional to the summed probabilities of all the exemplars that support it.

(Skousen 2002, in Skousen et al. 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–25, and Skousen 2003, both passim)

===Formulas===
Given a context with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements:
:total number of pairings: &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;
:number of agreements for outcome ''i'': &lt;math&gt;n_i^2&lt;/math&gt;
:number of disagreements for outcome ''i'': &lt;math&gt;n_i(n - n_i)&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of agreements: &lt;math&gt;\sum{n_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of disagreements: &lt;math&gt;\sum{n_i(n - n_i)} = n^2 - \sum{n_i^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===
This terminology is best understood through an example. In the example used in the second chapter of Skousen (1989), each context consists of three variables with potential values 0-3

:Variable 1: 0,1,2,3
:Variable 2: 0,1,2,3
:Variable 3: 0,1,2,3
The two outcomes for the dataset are ''e'' and ''r'', and the exemplars are:

 3 1 0 e
 0 3 2 r
 2 1 0 r
 2 1 2 r
 3 1 1 r

We define a network of pointers like so:

[[File:Analogical modeling pointer network.svg|300px|Pointer network for example problem]]

The solid lines represent pointers between exemplars with matching outcomes; the dotted lines represent pointers between exemplars with non-matching outcomes.

The statistics for this example are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;n = 5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_r = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n_e = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of pairings: &lt;math&gt;n^2 = 25&lt;/math&gt;
:number of agreements for outcome ''r'': &lt;math&gt;n_r^2 = 16&lt;/math&gt;
:number of agreements for outcome ''e'': &lt;math&gt;n_e^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:number of disagreements for outcome ''r'': &lt;math&gt;n_r(n - n_r) = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:number of disagreements for outcome ''e'': &lt;math&gt;n_e(n - n_e) = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of agreements: &lt;math&gt;n_r^2 + n_e^2 = 17&lt;/math&gt;
:total number of disagreements: &lt;math&gt;n_r(n - n_r) + n_e(n - n_e) = n^2 - (n_r^2 + n_e^2) = 8&lt;/math&gt;
:''uncertainty'' or fraction of disagreement: &lt;math&gt;8/25 = .32&lt;/math&gt;

Behavior can only be predicted for a given context; in this example, let us predict the outcome for the context "3 1 2". To do this, we first find all of the contexts containing the given context; these contexts are called supracontexts. We find the supracontexts by systematically eliminating the variables in the given context; with ''m'' variables, there will generally be &lt;math&gt;2^m&lt;/math&gt; supracontexts. The following table lists each of the sub- and supracontexts; {{overline|x}} means "not x", and ''-'' means "anything".

{| class="wikitable"
! style="text-align:left"|Supracontext
! style="text-align:left"|Subcontexts
|-
|-
| {{mono|3 1 2}}
| 3 1 2
|-

|}
These contexts are shown in the venn diagram below:

[[File:Contexts venn diagramm for analogical modeling.svg|300px|Illustration of sub- and supracontexts]]

The next step is to determine which exemplars belong to which contexts in order to determine which of the contexts are homogeneous. The table below shows each of the subcontexts, their behavior in terms of the given exemplars, and the number of disagreements within the behavior:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! align="left" | Subcontext!! align="left" |Behavior!! align="left" |Disagreements
|-
| 3 1 2
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|-
| 3 1 {{overline|2}}
| 3 1 0 e, 3 1 1 r
| align="center" |2
|-
| 3 {{overline|1}} 2
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} 1 2
| 2 1 2 r
| align="center" |0
|-
| 3 {{overline|1}} {{overline|2}}
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} 1 {{overline|2}}
| 2 1 0 r
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} {{overline|1}} 2
| 0 3 2 r
| align="center" |0
|-
| {{overline|3}} {{overline|1}} {{overline|2}}
| (empty)
| align="center" |0
|}

Analyzing the subcontexts in the table above, we see that there is only 1 subcontext with any disagreements: "3 1 {{overline|2}}", which in the dataset consists of "3 1 0 e" and "3 1 1 r". There are 2 disagreements in this subcontext; 1 pointing from each of the exemplars to the other (see the pointer network pictured above). Therefore, only supracontexts containing this subcontext will contain any disagreements. We use a simple rule to identify the homogeneous supracontexts:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the number if disagreements in the supracontext is greater than the number of disagreements in the contained subcontext, we say that it is heterogeneous; otherwise, it is homogeneous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are 3 situations that produce a homogeneous supracontext:
#The supracontext is empty. This is the case for "3 - 2", which contains no data points. There can be no increase in the number of disagreements, and the supracontext is trivially homogeneous.
#The supracontext is deterministic, meaning that only one type of outcome occurs in it. This is the case for "- 1 2" and "- - 2", which contain only data with the ''r'' outcome.
#Only one subcontext contains any data. The subcontext does not have to be deterministic for the supracontext to be homogeneous. For example, while the supracontexts "3 1 -" and "- 1 2" are deterministic and only contain one non-empty subcontext, "3 - -" contains only the subcontext "3 1 {{overline|2}}". This subcontext contains "3 1 0 e" and "3 1 1 r", making it non-deterministic. We say that this type of supracontext is unobstructed and non-deterministic.

The only two heterogeneous supracontexts are "- 1 -" and "- - -". In both of them, it is the combination of the non-deterministic "3 1 {{overline|2}}" with other subcontexts containing the ''r'' outcome which causes the heterogeneity.

There is actually a 4th type of homogeneous supracontext: it contains more than one non-empty subcontext and it is non-deterministic, but the frequency of outcomes in each sub-context is exactly the same. Analogical modeling does not consider this situation, however, for 2 reasons:
#Determining whether this 4 situation has occurred requires a &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test. This is the only test of homogeneity that requires arithmetic, and ignoring it allows our tests of homogeneity to become statistically free, which makes AM better for modeling human reasoning.
#It is an extremely rare situation, and thus ignoring it will can be expected not to have a large effect on the predicted outcome.

Next we construct the analogical set, which consists of all of the pointers and outcomes from the homogeneous supracontexts.
The figure below shows the pointer network with the homogeneous contexts highlighted.

[[File:AM pointers and homogeneous contexts.svg|300px|Pointer network with homogeneous supracontexts circled]]

The pointers are summarized in the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! align="left" | Homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;supracontext!! align="left" |Occurrences!! align="left" |Number of&lt;br/&gt;pointers
|-
| 
|
|
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! ''e''!!''r''
|}
|-
| {{mono|3 1 -}}
| "3 1 0 e", "3 1 1 r"
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 2
| 2
|}
|-
| {{mono|- 1 2}}
| "2 1 2 r"
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 0
| 1
|}
|-
| {{mono|3 - -}}
| "3 1 0 e", "3 1 1 r"
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 2
| 2
|}
|-
| {{mono|- - 2}}
| "2 1 2 r", "0 3 2 r"
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 0
| 4
|}
|-
| / |
| Totals:
| 
{| class="wikitable"
| 4
| 9
|}
|}

4 of the pointers in the analogical set are associated with the outcome ''e'', and the other 9 are associated with ''r''. In AM, a pointer is randomly selected and the outcome it points to is predicted. With a total of 13 pointers, the probability of the outcome ''e'' being predicted is 4/13 or 30.8%, and for outcome ''r'' it is 9/13 or 69.2%. We can create a more detailed account by listing the pointers for each of the occurrences in the homogeneous supracontexts:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"
|-
! cellpadding="1" | Occurrence!!Number of&lt;br/&gt;homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;supracontexts!!Number of&lt;br&gt;pointers!! align="center" |Analogical&lt;br/&gt;effect
|-
| {{mono|3 1 0 e}}
| 2
| 4
| 30.8%
|-
| {{mono|3 1 1 r}}
| 2
| 4
| 30.8%
|-
| {{mono|2 1 2 r}}
| 2
| 3
| 23.1%
|-
| {{mono|0 3 2 r}}
| 1
| 2
| 15.4%
|-
| {{mono|2 1 0 r}}
| 0
| 0
| 0.0%
|}

We can then see the ''analogical effect'' of each of the instances in the data set.

==Historical context==
Analogy has been considered useful in describing language at least since the time of [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]. [[Noam Chomsky]] and others have more recently criticized analogy as too vague to really be useful (Bańko 1991), an appeal to a ''deus ex machina.'' Skousen's proposal appears to address that criticism by proposing an explicit mechanism for analogy, which can be tested for psychological validity.

==Applications==
Analogical modeling has been employed in experiments ranging from [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)]] to [[orthography]] and [[syntax]].

==Problems==
Though analogical modeling aims to create a model free from rules seen as contrived by linguists, in its current form it still requires researchers to select which variables to take into consideration. This is necessary because of the so-called "exponential explosion" of processing power requirements of the computer software used to implement analogical modeling. Recent research suggests that [[quantum computing]] could provide the solution to such performance bottlenecks (Skousen et al. 2002, see pp 45–47).

[[File:Oresme Spheres crop.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The astral spheres were thought to be planes of [[angel]]ic existence intermediate between earth and [[heaven]].]]
The '''astral plane''', also called the '''astral world''', is a [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] postulated by classical (particularly [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonic]]), medieval, oriental, and [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies and [[Mystery cult|mystery religions]].&lt;ref name="G.R.S.Mead, 1919"&gt;G.R.S.Mead, ''The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition'', Watkins 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world of the [[celestial spheres]], crossed by the soul in its [[astral body]] on the way to being born and [[afterlife|after death]], and is generally believed to be populated by [[angel]]s, spirits or other immaterial beings.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', trans. Desmond Lee, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th century the term was popularised by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and neo-[[Rosicrucianism]].

Another view holds that the astral plane or world, rather than being some kind of boundary area crossed by the soul, is the entirety of spirit existence or spirit worlds to which those who die on Earth go, and where they live out their non-physical lives.  Some writers conflate this realm with heaven or paradise or union with God itself, and others do not.  P. Yogananda wrote in Autobiography of a Yogi, "The astral universe . . . is hundreds of times larger than the material universe . . .[with] many astral planets, teeming with astral beings." (p.416)  When Alice Bailey writes of seeing "Masters . . . upon the inner spiritual planes [who]. . . work with Christ and the planetary hierarchy," she refers to a vision she had of the unseen astral realm that these and countless other beings inhabit.  Christ being in that realm, it is hard to construe it as a non-heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Alice A. Bailey, The Unfinished Autobiography, Lucis Publishing, 1951, pp. 37, 78, 140. Paramahansa Yogananda, Autobiography of a Yogi, SR Fellowship publisher, 1968 edition, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Barzakh]]'', ''olam mithal'' or intermediate world in [[Islam]] is a related concept. In [[Judaism]], it is known as the "World of ''[[Yetzirah]]''", according to [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic]] [[Kabbalah]]. 

==History==
[[Image:Coppo di Marcovaldo, Hell.JPG|thumb|290px|Dante's heavens and hells symbolised the astral spheres and their associated virtues and vices.]]
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}
[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] taught that the stars were composed of a type of matter different from the four [[Classical element|earthly elements]] - a fifth, [[Aether (classical element)|ethereal]] element or quintessence. In the "astral mysticism" of the classical world the human psyche was composed of the same material, thus accounting for the influence of the stars upon human affairs. In his commentaries on Plato's [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], [[Proclus]] wrote;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Man is a little world (mikros cosmos). For, just like the Whole, he possesses both mind and reason, both a divine and a mortal body. He is also divided up according to the universe. It is for this reason, you know, that some are accustomed to say that his consciousness corresponds with the nature of the fixed stars, his reason in its contemplative aspect with Saturn and in its social aspect with Jupiter, (and) as to his irrational part, the passionate nature with Mars, the eloquent with Mercury, the appetitive with Venus, the sensitive with the Sun and the vegetative with the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in; G.R.S.Mead, ''The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition'', Watkins 1919, page 84 (Slightly adapted).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such doctrines were commonplace in mystery-schools and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] and [[gnostic]] sects throughout the Roman Empire and influenced the early Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Copleston]], ''The History of Philosophy Vol 2'', IMAGE BOOKS 1993&amp;ndash;1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians contains a reference to the astral plane or [[astral projection]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hankins|first1=James|title=Ficino, Avicenna and the Occult Powers of the Rational Soul|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3223908}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:2|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Muslims the "astral" world-view was soon rendered orthodox by [[Quran]]ic references to the Prophet's ascent through the seven heavens. Scholars took up the Greek Neoplatonist accounts as well as similar material in [[Hindu]] and [[Zoroastrian]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: "There are two states for man &amp;ndash; the state in this world and the state in the next; there is also a third state, the state intermediate between these two, which can be likened to the dream [state]. While in the intermediate state a man experiences both the other states, that of this world and that in the next; and the manner whereof is as follows: when he dies he lives only in the subtle body, on which are left the impressions of his past deeds, and of those impressions is he aware, illumined as they are by the light of the Transcendent Self"&lt;/ref&gt; The expositions of [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), the [[Brotherhood of Purity]] and others, when translated into Latin in the Norman era, were to have a profound effect upon European mediaeval alchemy and astrology. By the 14th century [[Dante]] was describing his own imaginary journey through the astral spheres of Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miguel Asín Palacios]] ''La Escatología musulmana en la Divina Comedia [Muslim Eschatology in the Divine Comedy]'' (1919). Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'', University of New York Press, ''passim''. Idries Shah, ''The Sufis'', Octagon Press, 1st Ed. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Renaissance]], philosophers, [[Paracelsus|Paracelsians]], [[Rosicrucians]] and alchemists continued to discuss the nature of the astral world intermediate between earth and the divine. Once the telescope established that no spiritual heaven was visible around the solar system, the idea was superseded in mainstream science.{{citation needed|reason=Content unavailable|date=May 2016}}

==The astral plane and astral experience==
{{planes of existence}}
According to occult teachings the astral plane can be visited consciously through [[astral projection]], [[meditation]] and [[mantra]], [[near death experience]], [[lucid dreaming]], or other means.  Individuals that are trained in the use of the astral vehicle can separate their consciousness in the astral vehicle from the physical body at will.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Brennan, ''Astral Doorways'', Thoth Publications 1996 {{ISBN|978-1-870450-21-8}}; Robert Monroe, "Journeys out of the Body,"&lt;/ref&gt;

In early [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] literature the term "astral" may refer to the [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. Later theosophical authors such as [[Annie Besant]] and [[C. W. Leadbeater]] make the astral finer than the [[etheric plane]] but "denser" than the [[mental plane]].  In order to create a unified view of seven bodies and remove earlier [[Sanskrit]] terms, an [[etheric plane]] was introduced and the term "astral body" was used to replace the former [[kamarupa]] - sometimes termed the ''body of emotion, illusion or desire''.&lt;ref name="G.R.S.Mead, 1919" /&gt; Some of those propounding such claims explain their belief that letting go of desires is spiritual progress by noting that, the more one let's go of feelings, the less tied down to the physical world, a world of illusion, and the more connected to the astral, where all is visible and known.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lester, The Eternal Verities, 1962, Sedona, Az, pp. 31-35&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, ''desire-stuff'' may be described as a type of force-matter, in incessant motion, responsive to the slightest ''feeling''. The desire world is also said to be the abode of the dead for some time subsequent to death.  It is also the home  of the [[archangels]]. In the higher regions of the desire world thoughts take a definite form and color perceptible to all, all is light and there is but one long day.

In his book ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', [[Paramhansa Yogananda]] provides details about the astral planes learned from his guru.&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN6fdZR6rXkC&amp;pg=PA400 |title=Autobiography of a Yogi |author=Paramhansa Yogananda |year=1946 |work= |publisher=The Philosophical Library, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yogananda claims that nearly all individuals enter the astral planes after death. There they work out the seeds of past [[Karma (Hinduism)|karma]] through astral incarnations, or (if their karma requires) they return to earthly incarnations for further refinement. Once an individual has attained the meditative state of [[nirvikalpa|nirvikalpa samadhi]] in an earthy or astral incarnation, the soul may progress upward to the "illumined astral planet" of Hiranyaloka.&lt;ref name="Paramhansa Yogananda 1946"/&gt; After this transitional stage, the soul may then move upward to the more subtle causal spheres where many more incarnations allow them to further refine before [[Satcitananda|final unification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reluctant-messenger.com/yogananda/chapter_43.htm |title=Autobiography of a Yogi |author=Paramhansa Yogananda |year=1946 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marilynn Hughes]]' experiences seem to coincide with that described by Paramahamsa Yogananda. Hughes states that the astral plane consists of the third and fourth dimension which are mortal realms overlapping the physical worlds, wherein much of what is experienced in this world is mirrored therein. It is through these astral planes that souls undergo scrutiny of their karma's and are able to purify therefrom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Marilynn |title=The Hammer of Mysticism: Encyclopedic Journey into Out-of-body Travel, Mystical processes and Terms |date=2017 |isbn=9781365829055 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Hammer_of_Mysticism_Encyclopedic_Jou.html?id=S8CPDgAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1268">'''Belle Steel''' was an 18th-century [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] from [[Poleglass]], [[County Antrim]], [[Ireland]].

In Cathal O'Byrne's book ''As I Roved Out'' there are a couple of chapters on Steel. She lived in a cottage in the townland of Poleglass, on the outskirts of [[Belfast]] and [[Lisburn]], along what is now the Stewartstown Road. Her place in history comes from her sympathy for the [[Roman Catholic]] faithful who, under [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Law]], were denied their church buildings for worship. Steel was the trusted custodian of the sacred vessels used in the [[Liturgy]], as well as a small horn used to summon the faithful to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Her name is commemorated in the name of one of the roads through Poleglass. She kept watch and provided warnings to the people attending mass when the soldiers were approaching. She is depicted in many of Belfast's [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] murals.

[[Image:Bijection.svg|thumb|200px|A bijective function, ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'', where set X is {1, 2, 3, 4} and set Y is {A, B, C, D}. For example, ''f''(1) = D.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''bijection''', '''bijective function''', or '''one-to-one correspondence''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] between the elements of two [[set (mathematics)|sets]], where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In mathematical terms, a bijective function ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' is a [[Injective function|one-to-one (injective)]] and [[Surjective function|onto (surjective)]] mapping of a set ''X'' to a set ''Y''.

A bijection from the set ''X'' to the set ''Y'' has an [[inverse function]] from ''Y'' to ''X''.  If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s, then the existence of a bijection means they have the same number of elements. For [[infinite set]]s the picture is more complicated, leading to the concept of [[cardinal number]], a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

A bijective function from a set to itself is also called a ''[[permutation]]''.

Bijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of [[isomorphism]], [[homeomorphism]], [[diffeomorphism]], [[permutation group]], and [[projective map]].

==Definition==
{{details|topic=notation|Function (mathematics)#Notation}}
For a pairing between ''X'' and ''Y'' (where ''Y'' need not be different from ''X'') to be a bijection, four properties must hold:
# each element of ''X'' must be paired with at least one element of ''Y'',
# no element of ''X'' may be paired with more than one element of ''Y'',
# each element of ''Y'' must be paired with at least one element of ''X'', and
# no element of ''Y'' may be paired with more than one element of ''X''.

Satisfying properties (1) and (2) means that a bijection is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] with [[Domain of a function|domain]] ''X''. It is more common to see properties (1) and (2) written as a single statement: Every element of ''X'' is paired with exactly one element of ''Y''. Functions which satisfy property (3) are said to be "[[onto]] ''Y'' " and are called [[Surjective function|surjections]] (or '''surjective functions'''). Functions which satisfy property (4) are said to be "[[one-to-one function]]s" and are called [[Injective function|injections]] (or '''injective functions''').&lt;ref&gt;There are names associated to properties (1) and (2) as well. A relation which satisfies property (1) is called a ''total relation'' and a relation satisfying (2) is a ''single valued relation''.&lt;/ref&gt; With this terminology, a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection, or using other words, a bijection is a function which is both "one-to-one" and "onto".

Bijections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow with tail ({{unichar|2916|RIGHTWARDS TWO-HEADED ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}), as in ''f'' : ''X'' ⤖ ''Y''. This symbol is a combination of the two-headed rightwards arrow ({{unichar|21A0|RIGHTWARDS TWO HEADED ARROW|ulink=Unicode}}) sometimes used to denote surjections and the rightwards arrow with a barbed tail ({{unichar|21A3|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH TAIL|ulink=Unicode}}) sometimes used to denote injections.

==Examples==

=== Batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team===
Consider the [[Batting order (baseball)|batting line-up]] of a [[baseball]] or [[cricket]] team (or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line-up). The set ''X'' will be the players on the team (of size nine in the case of baseball) and the set ''Y'' will be the  positions in the batting order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) The "pairing" is given by which player is in what position in this order. Property (1) is satisfied since each player is somewhere in the list. Property (2) is satisfied since no player bats in two (or more) positions in the order. Property (3) says that for each position in the order, there is some player batting in that position and property (4) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list.

=== Seats and students of a classroom===
In a classroom there are a certain number of seats. A bunch of students enter the room and the instructor asks them all to be seated. After a quick look around the room, the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats, where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in. What the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that:
# Every student was in a seat (there was no one standing),
# No student was in more than one seat,
# Every seat had someone sitting there (there were no empty seats), and
# No seat had more than one student in it. 
The instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students, without having to count either set.

==More mathematical examples and some non-examples==
* For any set ''X'', the [[identity function]] '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''X'' → ''X'', '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''x'', is bijective.
* The function ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''', ''f''(''x'') = 2''x'' + 1 is bijective, since for each ''y'' there is a unique ''x'' = (''y'' − 1)/2 such that ''f''(''x'') = ''y''. In more generality, any [[linear function]] over the reals,  ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''', ''f''(''x'') = ''ax'' + ''b'' (where ''a'' is non-zero) is a bijection. Each real number ''y'' is obtained from (paired with) the real number ''x'' = (''y'' - ''b'')/''a''.
* The function ''f'': ''R'' → (-π/2, π/2), given by ''f''(''x'') = arctan(''x'') is bijective since each real number ''x'' is paired with exactly one angle ''y'' in the interval (-π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) so that tan(''y'') = ''x'' (that is, ''y'' = arctan(''x'')). If the [[codomain]]  (-π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) was made larger to include an integer multiple of π/2 then this function would no longer be onto (surjective) since there is no real number which could be paired with the multiple of π/2 by this arctan function. 
* The [[exponential function]], ''g'': '''R''' → '''R''', ''g''(''x'') = e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, is not bijective: for instance, there is no ''x'' in '''R''' such that ''g''(''x'') = −1, showing that ''g'' is not onto (surjective).  However, if the codomain is restricted to the positive real numbers &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \R^+ \;\equiv\; \left(0,\, +\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''g'' becomes bijective; its inverse (see below) is the [[natural logarithm]] function ln.
* The function ''h'': '''R''' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ''h''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not bijective: for instance, ''h''(−1) = ''h''(1) = 1, showing that ''h''  is not one-to-one (injective).  However, if the [[domain of a function|domain]] is restricted to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\R^+_0 \;\equiv\; \left[0,\, +\infty\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''h'' becomes bijective; its inverse is the positive square root function.

==Inverses==
A bijection ''f'' with domain ''X'' (indicated by ''f'': ''X → Y'' in [[Function (mathematics)#Notation|functional notation]]) also defines a [[converse relation]] starting in ''Y'' and going to ''X'' (by turning the arrows around). The process of "turning the arrows around" for an arbitrary function does not, ''in general'', yield a function, but properties (3) and (4) of a bijection say that this inverse relation is a function with domain ''Y''. Moreover, properties (1) and (2) then say that this inverse ''function'' is a surjection and an injection, that is, the [[inverse function]] exists and is also a bijection. Functions that have inverse functions are said to be [[Invertible function|invertible]]. A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.

Stated in concise mathematical notation, a function ''f'': ''X → Y'' is bijective if and only if it satisfies the condition
:for every ''y'' in ''Y'' there is a unique ''x'' in ''X'' with ''y'' = ''f''(''x'').

Continuing with the baseball batting line-up example, the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order. Since this function is a bijection, it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position.

==Composition==
The [[composition (mathematics)|composition]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g \,\circ\, f&lt;/math&gt; of two bijections ''f'': ''X → Y'' and ''g'': ''Y → Z'' is a bijection. The inverse of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g \,\circ\, f&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (g \,\circ\, f)^{-1} \;=\; (f^{-1}) \,\circ\, (g^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Bijective composition.svg|thumb|300px|A bijection composed of an injection (left) and a surjection (right).]]
Conversely, if the composition &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle g \,\circ\, f&lt;/math&gt; of two functions is bijective, we can only say that ''f'' is [[Injective function|injective]] and ''g'' is [[surjective function|surjective]].

==Bijections and cardinality==
If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s, then there exists a bijection between the two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' [[iff|if and only if]] ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same number of elements. Indeed, in [[axiomatic set theory]], this is taken as the definition of "same number of elements" ([[equinumerosity]]), and generalising this definition to [[infinite set]]s leads to the concept of [[cardinal number]], a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

== Properties ==
* A function ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' is bijective if and only if its [[graph of a function|graph]] meets every horizontal and vertical line exactly once.
* If ''X'' is a set, then the bijective functions from ''X'' to itself, together with the operation of functional composition (∘), form a [[group (algebra)|group]], the [[symmetric group]] of ''X'', which is denoted variously by S(''X''), ''S&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'', or ''X''! (''X'' [[factorial]]).
* Bijections preserve [[cardinalities]] of sets: for a subset ''A'' of the domain with cardinality |''A''| and subset ''B'' of the codomain with cardinality |''B''|, one has the following equalities:
*:|''f''(''A'')| = |''A''| and |''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'')| = |''B''|.
*If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[finite set]]s with the same cardinality, and ''f'': ''X → Y'', then the following are equivalent:
*# ''f'' is a bijection.
*# ''f'' is a [[surjection]].
*# ''f'' is an [[injection (mathematics)|injection]].
*For a finite set ''S'', there is a bijection between the set of possible [[total ordering]]s of the elements and the set of bijections from ''S'' to ''S''.  That is to say, the number of [[permutation]]s of elements of ''S'' is the same as the number of total orderings of that set—namely, ''n''!.

==Bijections and category theory==
Bijections are precisely the [[isomorphism]]s in the [[category theory|category]] '''[[Category of sets|Set]]''' of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and set functions.  However, the bijections are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories.  For example, in the category '''[[Category of groups|Grp]]''' of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], the morphisms must be [[homomorphism]]s since they must preserve the group structure, so the isomorphisms are ''group isomorphisms'' which are bijective homomorphisms.

==Generalization to partial functions==
The notion of one-to-one correspondence generalizes to [[partial functions]], where they are called '''partial bijections''', although partial bijections are only required to be injective. The reason for this relaxation is that a (proper) partial function is already undefined for a portion of its domain; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a [[total function]], i.e. defined everywhere on its domain. The set of all partial bijections on a given base set is called the [[symmetric inverse semigroup]].&lt;ref name="Hollings2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251|date=16 July 2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of defining the same notion is to say that a partial bijection from ''A'' to ''B'' is any relation 
''R'' (which turns out to be a partial function) with the property that ''R'' is the [[Graph of a function|graph of]] a bijection ''f'':''A′''→''B′'', where ''A′'' is a [[subset]] of ''A'' and ''B′'' is a subset of ''B''.&lt;ref name="Borceux1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Borceux|title=Handbook of Categorical Algebra: Volume 2, Categories and Structures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5i2v9q0m5XAC&amp;pg=PA289|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44179-7|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the partial bijection is on the same set, it is sometimes called a '''one-to-one partial [[transformation (function)|transformation]]'''.&lt;ref name="Grillet1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre A. Grillet|title=Semigroups: An Introduction to the Structure Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yM544W1N2UUC&amp;pg=PA228|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-9662-4|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Möbius transformation]] simply defined on the complex plane, rather than its completion to the extended complex plane.&lt;ref name="Campbell2007"&gt;{{cite book|editors=C.M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5615">The '''Blogger's Code of Conduct''' is a proposal by [[Tim O'Reilly]] for [[blog]]gers to enforce civility on their blogs by being civil themselves and moderating comments on their blog.  The code was proposed in 2007 due to threats made to blogger [[Kathy Sierra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/call_for_a_blog_1.html|title=Call for a Blogger's Code of Conduct|publisher=O'Reilly Radar|first=Tim |last=O'Reilly|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly|date=March 3, 2007|accessdate=September 10, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409153021/http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/call_for_a_blog_1.html |archivedate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the code was first reported by [[BBC News]], who quoted O'Reilly saying, "I do think we need some code of conduct around what is acceptable behaviour, I would hope that it doesn't come through any kind of regulation it would come through self-regulation.".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6502643.stm|title=Call for blogging code of conduct|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=March 28, 2007|accessdate=April 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland the proposal for a code was raised in an article in [[Sunday Business Post]] in 2009 by [[Simon Palmer]], a radio presenter and PR consultant in Dublin, after false details in relation to a client had appeared on Irish blogs [http://www.businesspost.ie/#!search/simon%2520palmer Time To Raise Above Blog Standard]. After his comments he was subjected to sustained on line abuse from Irish bloggers and anonymous trolls and even received death threats.

In Nepal, 10 prominent bloggers signed a Code of Ethics for Bloggers, first proposed by [[Ujjwal Acharya]] and finalized after discussion among bloggers, on July 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nepalivoices.com/nepal-blog/2011/07/27/historic-bloggers-sign-code-of-ethics/|title=Historic: Bloggers sign Code of Ethics|publisher=The Radiant Star|first=Ujjwal |last=Acharya|authorlink=Ujjwal Acharya|date=July 27, 2011|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', O'Reilly and [[Jimmy Wales]] based their preliminary list on one developed by the [[BlogHer]] women's blogging support network&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Call for Manners in the World of Nasty Blogs| first=Brad |last=Stone|date=April 9, 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/technology/09blog.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1346347088-tgkihQi2p1Jn13oBc48IFA}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, working with others, came up with a list of seven proposed ideas:
#Take responsibility not just for your own words, but for the comments you allow on your blog.
#Label your tolerance level for abusive comments.
#Consider eliminating anonymous comments.
#Don't feed the [[troll (internet)|troll]]s.
#Take the conversation offline, and talk directly, or find an intermediary who can do so.
#If you know someone who is behaving badly, tell them so.
#Don't say anything online that you wouldn't say in person.

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
Reaction to the proposal was internationally widespread among bloggers and media writers. According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', the [[blogosphere]] described it as "excessive, unworkable and an open door to censorship."&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2905">In [[category theory]] and [[homotopy theory]] the '''Burnside category''' of a [[finite group]] ''G'' is a category whose objects are finite [[G-set|''G''-sets]] and whose morphisms are (equivalence classes of) [[Span (category theory)|spans]] of ''G''-equivariant maps. It is a categorification of the [[Burnside ring]] of ''G''.

==Definitions==
Let ''G'' be a finite group (in fact everything will work verbatim for a [[profinite group]]). Then for any two finite ''G''-sets ''X'' and ''Y'' we can define an equivalence relation among spans of [[G-set|''G''-sets]] of the form &lt;math&gt;X\leftarrow U \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; where two spans &lt;math&gt;X\leftarrow U \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X\leftarrow W \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;are equivalent if and only if there is a ''G''-equivariant bijection of ''U'' and ''W'' commuting with the projection maps to ''X'' and ''Y''. This set of equivalence classes form naturally a monoid under disjoint union; we indicate with &lt;math&gt;A(G)(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; the [[Grothendieck group|group completion]] of that monoid. Taking pullbacks induces natural maps &lt;math&gt;A(G)(X,Y)\times A(G)(Y,Z)\rightarrow A(G)(X,Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally we can define the '''Burnside category''' ''A(G)'' of ''G'' as the category whose objects are finite ''G''-sets and the morphisms spaces are the groups &lt;math&gt;A(G)(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
* ''A(G)'' is an [[additive category]] with direct sums given by the disjoint union of ''G''-sets and zero object given by the empty ''G''-set;
* The product of two ''G''-sets induces a symmetric monoidal structure on ''A(G)'';
* The endomorphism ring of the point (that is the ''G''-set with only one element) is the [[Burnside ring]] of ''G'';
* ''A(G)'' is equivalent to the full subcategory of the homotopy category of genuine ''G''-spectra spanned by the suspension spectra of finite ''G''-sets.

==Mackey functors==
If ''C'' is an [[additive category]], then a ''C''-valued '''Mackey functor''' is an additive functor from ''A(G)'' to ''C''. Mackey functors are important in representation theory and stable equivariant homotopy theory.
* To every ''G''-representation ''V'' we can associate a Mackey functor in vector spaces sending every finite ''G''-set ''U'' to the vector space of ''G''-equivariant maps from ''U'' to ''V''. 
* The homotopy groups of a [[equivariant homotopy theory|genuine ''G''-spectrum]] form a Mackey functor. In fact genuine ''G''-spectra can be seen as additive functor on an appropriately higher categorical version of the Burnside category.

The '''Cascade red fox''' (''Vulpes vulpes cascadensis'') is a subspecies of [[Red Fox|red fox]] native to [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in the United States.

==Range==
The range of the Cascade red fox is estimated to be 4500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but may be as large as 40000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="NatureServe"&gt;Fleckenstein, J.W. [http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Vulpes+vulpes+cascadensis "Vulpes vulpes cascadensis - Merriam, 1900"], ''[[NatureServe]]'', 20 September 2011. Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It lives in the subalpine meadows and parklands of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]], as well as the open forests on the eastern slope. It does not however inhabit the densely forested western slope.&lt;ref&gt;Aubry, Keith Baker. [https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/5517 "The Cascade red fox: distribution, morphology, zoogeoraphy and ecology"], ''[[University of Washington]]'', 26 May 1983. Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It may inhabit the very southern parts of [[British Columbia]].

==North American colonization==
The ancestors of the Cascade red fox colonized [[North America]] after crossing the [[Beringia|Bering landbridge]] during the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian glacation]] over 300,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Gov"&gt;Akins, Jocelyn. [https://www.nps.gov/articles/cascade-fox.htm "Conservation Status of the Cascade Red Fox"] ''[[National Park Service]]'' Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], they were pushed south to escape to ice free forests.  From that point, they adapted to the colder climate and became distinct. After the glaciation, they moved up into the mountains where conditions were similar.

==Current status==
The Cascade red fox is a Natural Heritage Critically Imperiled Species, as well as a Washington Candidate Species for protection.&lt;ref name="NatureServe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/cascade_red_fox.pdf "Cascade Red Fox"] ''[[Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife]]'' Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys have suggested that there has been widespread population loss.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  The number of populations seems to be less than 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eol.org/pages/1270427/details "Vulpes vulpes cascadensis"] ''[[Encyclopedia of Life]]'' Retrieved on 10 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Population trends may be because of habitat loss, timber removal, and increased winter recreation that provides pathways for other less adapted predators to enter alpine areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Lack of information has made conservation efforts much harder.

[[Image:Degradation alfred dreyfus.jpg|thumb|On January 5, 1895, Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]] being cashiered]]
'''Cashiering''' (or '''degradation ceremony'''), generally within [[military]] forces, is a [[ritual]] dismissal of an individual from some position of responsibility for a breach of [[discipline]].

==Etymology==
From the Flemish 'Kasseren' the phrase entered the English language in the late 16th century, during the wars in the [[Low Countries]]. Although the [[Oxford English Dictionary|O.E.D.]] states that the first printed use in this sense appears in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (1603), it appeared in the 1595 tract ''The Estate of English Fugitives'' by [[Lewes Lewkenor]], 'imploring his help and assistance in so hard an extremity, who for recompence, very charitably cashiered them all without the receipt of one penny'.

==Military==
[[File:Galons arrachés à Alfred Dreyfus le jour de sa dégradation.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Dreyfus]]'s ripped off officer stripes, kept in Paris's [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]]]
It is especially associated with the public degradation of disgraced [[military]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. Prior to World War I this aspect of cashiering sometimes involved a parade-ground ceremony in front of assembled troops  with the destruction of symbols of [[Social status|status]]: [[epaulette]]s ripped off shoulders, [[badge]]s and insignia stripped, [[sword]]s broken, [[cap]]s knocked away, and [[medal]]s torn off and dashed upon the ground.

The term originated in the era when [[British Army]] officers generally [[Sale of commissions|bought their commissions]]; being cashiered meant that the amount they had paid was lost, as they could not "sell-out" afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Holmes (military historian) |title=Redcoat: the British soldier in the age of horse and musket |origyear=2001 |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition=Hardback |series= |year=2001 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=[[London]] |language= |isbn=0-00-257097-1 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= Chapter III - Brothers of the Blade|chapterurl= |quote=|page=159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the commission purchase price was a cash bond for good behaviour, forfeited to the Army's cashiers (accountants) in the event of cowardice, desertion or gross misbehaviour.

==Famous examples==
Famous victims of cashiering include [[Francis Mitchell]] (1621), [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald]] (after the [[Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814]]), [[Alfred Dreyfus]] (1894, see [[trial and conviction of Alfred Dreyfus]] and [[Dreyfus affair]]), and [[Philippe Pétain#Postwar trial and legacy|Philippe Pétain]] (1945).

While most closely associated with Captain Dreyfus, the ceremony of formal degradation (''Degradation militaire'') occurred several times in the French military under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. At least one other army officer and a naval officer were subjected to the ritual of having their swords broken and the insignia, braid and buttons publicly torn from their uniforms, after being found guilty of charges of treason. More commonly a number of NCOs and private soldiers underwent similar punishments for committing various serious offenses, before execution or imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jean-Louis|last=Larcade|page=529|title=Zouaves &amp; Tirailleurs: les regiments de march et les regiments mixes (1914–1918). |ISBN=2-9515171-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12487">'''''Clausula rebus sic stantibus''''' ([[Latin]] for "things thus standing"), in [[public international law]], is the [[legal doctrine]] allowing for a [[treaty]] to become inapplicable because of a fundamental change of circumstances. The doctrine is essentially an "escape clause" to the general rule of ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (promises must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the doctrine is a risk to the security of treaties, as its scope is relatively unconfined, the conditions in which it may be invoked must be carefully noted.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Malanczuk, ''Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law'', 7th rev. edn (London: Routledge, 1997), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function in international law==

The doctrine is part of [[customary international law]] but is also provided for in the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], under Article 62 (Fundamental Change of Circumstance). Although the doctrine is not mentioned by name,&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 62 provides the only justifications for its invocation: the circumstances that existed at the time of the conclusion of the treaty were indeed objectively essential to the obligations of treaty (sub-paragraph A), and the instance for the change of circumstances has had a radical effect on the obligations of the treaty (sub-paragraph B).

If the parties to a treaty had contemplated for the occurrence of the changed circumstances, the doctrine does not apply and the provision remains in effect. ''Clausula rebus sic stantibus'' relates to changed circumstances only if they had never been contemplated by the parties. That principle is clarified in the [[Cod Wars|Fisheries Jurisdiction Case]] (''United Kingdom v. Iceland'', 1973).

Although it is clear that a fundamental change of circumstances might justify terminating or modifying a treaty, the unilateral [[denunciation]] of a treaty is prohibited. A [[party (law)|party]] does not have the right to denounce a treaty unilaterally. (However, that has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==History==
A key figure in the formulation of ''clausula rebus sic stantibus'' was the Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]] (1563–1616), who is generally credited for coining the maxim ''omnis conventio intelligitur rebus sic stantibus'' ('every convention is understood with circumstances as they stand').&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 13, citing ''De iure belli libri tres'', lib. 111, cap. XIV.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss legal expert [[Emer de Vattel]] (1714–1767) was the next key contributor. Vattel promoted the view that 'every body bound himself for the future only on the stipulation of the presence of the actual conditions' and so 'with a change of the condition also the relations originating from the situation would undergo a change'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] came to reject the doctrine of ''clausula rebus sic standibus'', but Vattel's thinking continued to influence international law, not least because it helped reconcile 'the antagonism between the static nature of the law and the dynamism of international life'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; While individual cases invoking the doctrine were much disputed, the doctrine itself was little questioned. Its provision in the 1969 [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] established the doctrine firmly but not without dispute as 'a norm of international law'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* According to [[Polybius]], in 211 BC, [[Lyciscus of Acarnania]] argued that the [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacedaemonians]] should abandon their treaty with the [[Aetolian League]] because of fundamentally changed circumstances. That is perhaps the earliest recorded example of the principle of ''rebus sic stantibus'' at work.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elizabeth I of England]] sought to amend the 1585 [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] on the grounds of fundamentally changed circumstances, but her efforts have not been well regarded by modern jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 'classic' case for the doctrine, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] attempted to change the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] on military shipping in the Black Sea. That happened in connection with the Treaty of London (1871), partly by invoking ''clausula rebus sic stantibus''. One important outcome was the insistence by other parties that unilateral termination of a treaty was not legal on those grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 59 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] made [[Batumi]] a [[free port]]. In 1886, Russia terminated the arrangement, partly on the grounds of a fundamental change in circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1881, the [[United States]] attempted to end the [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]] with the [[United Kingdom]]. Various arguments were advanced, including ''clausula rebus sic stantibus''. Although that principle ultimately did not apply in the resolution of the case, it is noteworthy as the first time that the US invoked the principle, as it had previously been opposed to it. The US went on to cite the doctrine again in its arguments for the revision of the [[Treaty of London (1915)]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 1908 [[Bosnian crisis]], [[Austria-Hungary]] renounced its rights and obligations under Article 25 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]]. Austria-Hungary's arguments have been seen as an invocation of fundamentally-changed circumstances. Moreover, despite protests at its actions, Austria-Hungary succeeded, arguably setting a precedent for the use of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 7 February 1923, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] issued an advisory opinion on a case between [[French Third Republic|France]] and the United Kingdom on the application to [[British nationals]] of [[French nationality law|French nationality decrees]] issued by the capitulatory regimes in [[Tunis]] and [[Morocco]]. France cited a fundamental change of circumstances, and the case seems to be the first example of a state invoking ''rebus sic stantibus'' before an international court. However, the states settled before the court was required to issue a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1924, [[Norway]] dissolved its 1907 treaty with [[Sweden]] that had arisen from the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]], citing changed circumstances including the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and Norway's entry into the [[League of Nations]]. Since the 1907 treaty was also time-limited, the case has been seen as a precedent for ''rebus sic stantibus'' applying not only to indefinite treaties.
* In 1926, China came to terms with Belgium after its efforts to denounce the Sino-Belgian Pact (1865), citing fundamentally changed circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 1923, France moved its customs office to [[Gex, Ain]], provoking the 'Freezones Controversy' with Switzerland. The matter was brought before the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], and France invoked ''rebus sic stantibus'', but Switzerland argued that the doctrine did not apply in respect of territorial rights. In 1932, the court found in favour of Switzerland on the basis of fact, but it did not reject that ''rebus sic stantibus'' might be a valid basis for France's argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcourts.com/pcij/eng/decisions/1929/1929.08.19_savoy_gex.htm Case of the Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex], Permanent Court of International Justice,  Parties: France &amp; Switzerland, August 19th, 1929, Initiated March 29th, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second time ''rebus sic stantibus'' had been argued before an international court.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood M. Poonja, ''Termination of Treaties Owing to Fundamental Change of Circumstances (Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus): A Doctoral Dissertation'' [Juris Doctor dissertation, Charles University, Prague, 1977] (Rawalpindi: Abbas Arts, 1982), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compulsory sterilization''', also known as '''forced''' or '''coerced sterilization''', programs are government policies which force people to undergo surgical or other [[Human sterilization|sterilization]].

Other bases for compulsory sterilization have included general population growth management, sex discrimination, "sex-normalizing" surgeries of [[intersex]] persons, limiting the spread of HIV,&lt;ref name="who-2014" /&gt; and reducing the population of ethnic groups. The last is counted as an act of genocide under the [[Statute of Rome]]. Some countries require transgender people to undergo sterilization before [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|gaining legal recognition of their gender]], a practice that [[Juan E. Méndez]], the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on [[Convention Against Torture|torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment]] cites as a violation of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/Regularsession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (A/HRC/22/53)|at=para.&amp;nbsp;78|publisher=Ohchr.org|accessdate=2013-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824161117/http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsory sterilization has been proposed as a means of [[human population planning]].

==Affected populations==

In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]], [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement''. The report references the involuntary sterilization of a number of specific population groups. They include:

* [[Women]], especially in relation to coercive population control policies, and particularly including women living with [[HIV]], indigenous and ethnic minority girls and women. Indigenous and ethnic minority women often face "wrongful stereotyping based on gender, race and ethnicity".
** Funding of welfare mothers by HEW (Health, Education, and Welfare) covers roughy 90% of cost and doctors are likely to concur with the compulsory sterilization of welfare mothers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dear Sisters|last=Baxandall|first=Rosalyn|last2=Gordon|first2=Linda|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-465-01707-2|location=New York, NY|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to cease welfare occur when women do are hesitant to consent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Disabled people]], often perceived as asexual. Women with intellectual disabilities are "often treated as if they have no control, or should have no control, over their sexual and reproductive choices". Other rationales include menstrual management for "women who have or are perceived to have difficulties coping with or managing menses, or whose health conditions (such as epilepsy) or behaviour are negatively affected by menses."
* [[Intersex]] persons, who "are often subjected to cosmetic and other non-medically indicated surgeries performed on their reproductive organs, without their informed consent or that of their parents, and without taking into consideration the views of the children involved", often as a "sex-normalizing" treatment.
* [[Transgender]] persons, "as a prerequisite to receiving gender-affirmative treatment and gender-marker changes".

The report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.&lt;ref name="who-2014" /&gt;

== As a part of human population planning ==
[[Human population planning]] is the practice of artificially altering the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population planning has been implemented by limiting the population's [[birth rate]], usually by government mandate, and has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of [[poverty]], [[carrying capacity|environmental concerns]], [[religion|religious reasons]], and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, some programs have exposed them to exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |title=Interact Worldwide Downloads |publisher=Interact Worldwide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115221710/http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1977 textbook ''[[Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment]]'', the authors discussed in this encyclopedic textbook the possible role of a wide variety of formulations to address human overpopulation. This included the possibility of compulsory sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Egnor |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/08/the_inconvenient_truth_about_p023831.html |title=The Inconvenient Truth About Population Control, Part 2; Science Czar John Holdren's Endorsement of Involuntary Sterilization |website=evolutionnews.org |date=August 14, 2009 |access-date=October 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005193751/http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/08/the_inconvenient_truth_about_p023831.html |archivedate=October 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A government might utilize [[sortition]] to select those to be sterilized in order to avoid accusations of bias or having any other adverse agenda. In ''Ecoscience'', in the chapter entitled "The Human Predicament: Finding A Way Out", the authors speculate about pharmaceuticals that might be developed to sterilize people. Some partial fulfillments of these predictions are the birth control drugs in [[Norplant]] and [[Depo-Provera]]. See also [[sterilization (medicine)#Pharmacological]]. One can further speculate about pharmaceuticals designed to permanently sterilize the gestating human fetus ''in utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/072109_holdren2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095317/http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/072109_holdren2.pdf/ |archivedate=2016-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

=== International law ===
The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits forced sterilization (Article 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531114057/https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |archivedate=2017-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Widespread or systematic forced sterilization has been recognized as a [[Crime against Humanity]] by the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] in the explanatory memorandum.

=== Bangladesh ===

[[Bangladesh]] has a long running government operated civilian exploitative [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] program as a part of its population control policy, where poor women and men are mainly targeted. The government offers 2000 [[Bangladeshi taka|Bangladeshi Taka]] (24 USD) for the woman who are persuaded to undergo [[tubal ligation]] and for the man who are persuaded to undergo [[vasectomy]]. Women are also offered a [[sari]] (a [[garment]] worn by women in [[Indian subcontinent]]) and men are offered a [[lungi]] (a [[garment]] for men) to wear for undergoing sterilization. The referrer, who persuades the woman or man to undergo sterilization gets 300 Bangladeshi Taka (3.60 USD).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|title=পরিবার পরিকল্পনা {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন|website=uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185603/http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|archivedate=2017-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the targeted number of sterilizations per month was 600-1000 in contrast to the insertion of 25,000 [[IUDs]], which was increased in 1978 to about 50,000 sterilizations per month on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AR|first=Khan|last2=I|first2=Swenson|date=1978|title=Acceptability of male sterilization in Bangladesh: its problems and perspectives|url=https://www.popline.org/node/444385|journal=Bangladesh Development Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113002952/https://www.popline.org/node/444385|archivedate=2017-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 50% rise in the amount paid to men coincided with a doubling of the number of vasectomies between 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Liskin|last2=JM|first2=Pile|last3=WF|first3=Quillan|date=1983|title=Vasectomy--safe and simple|url=https://www.popline.org/node/402465|journal=Population Reports.

The men also said they had not received all of the incentives they had been promised.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to another study on 5042 women and 264 men who underwent sterilization, complications such as painful urination, shaking chills, fever for at least 2 days, frequent urination, bleeding from the incision, sore with pus, stitches or skin breaking open, weakness and [[dizziness]] arose after the sterilization. The person's sex, the sponsor and workload in the sterilization center, and the dose of [[sedative]]s administered to women were significantly associated with specific postoperative complaints. Five women died during the study, resulting in a death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 [[Tubal ligation|tubectomies]] (tubal ligations); four deaths were due to [[respiratory arrest]] caused by overuse of sedatives. The death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligation) in this study is similar to the 10.0 deaths/10,000 cases estimated on the basis of a 1979 follow-up study in an Indian female sterilization camp. The presence of a complaint before the operation was generally a good predictor of postoperative complaints.

[[Bangladesh]] is planning to introduce sterilization program in its overcrowded [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee camps, where nearly a million refugees are fighting for space, after efforts to encourage birth control failed. Since 25 August 2017, more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have been fled from [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] state, [[Myanmar]] to neighboring Bangladesh, which is a Muslim majority country, following a military crackdown against [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] Muslims in Rakhine state, Myanmar. Sabura, a Rohingya mother of seven, said her husband believed the couple could support a large family.

“I spoke to my husband about birth control measures. But he is not convinced. He was given two condoms but he did not use them,” she said.

“My husband said we need more children as we have land and property (in [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]]). We don’t have to worry to feed them,” she said.

District family planning authorities have managed to distribute just 549 packets of condoms among the refugees, amid reports they are reluctant to use them. They have asked the government to approve a plan to provide [[Vasectomy|vasectomies]] for men and [[Tubal ligation|tubectomies]] (tubal ligation) for women in the camps.

One volunteer, Farhana Sultana, said the women she spoke to believed birth control was a sin and others saw it as against the tenets of Islam.

Bangladeshi officials say about 20,000 [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee women are pregnant and 600 have given birth since arriving in the country, but this may not be accurate as many births take place without formal medical help.

Every month 250 [[Bangladeshis|Bangladeshi]] people undergo sterilization routinely under government's sterilization program in the border town of [[Cox's Bazar District|Cox’s Bazar]], where the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee Muslims have taken shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|title=Bangladesh to offer sterilisation to Rohingya in refugee camps|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2017-10-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104150415/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|archivedate=2017-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|title=Bangladesh ‘plans to offer to sterilise Rohingya Muslims’ as refugee population grows|date=2017-10-29|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113003155/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|archivedate=2017-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}

Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir’s case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kecFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1039102 Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

As recently as 2017, a number of Indigenous women were not permitted to see their newborn babies unless they agreed to sterilization. Over 60 women are involved in a lawsuit in this case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-november-13-2018-1.4902679/indigenous-women-kept-from-seeing-their-newborn-babies-until-agreeing-to-sterilization-says-lawyer-1.4902693&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/18/canada-indigenous-women-coerced-sterlilization-class-action-lawsuit Human rights groups call on Canada to end coerced sterilization of indigenous women] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In 1978, Chinese authorities became concerned with the possibility of a baby boom that the country could not handle, and they initialized the [[one-child policy]]. In order to effectively deal with the complex issues surrounding childbirth, the Chinese government placed great emphasis on family planning. Because this was such an important matter, the government thought it needed to be standardized, and so to this end laws were introduced in 2002.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China | date=April 22, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=[[Amnesty International]] | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314193515/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | archivedate=March 14, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws uphold the basic tenets of what was previously put into practice, outlining the rights of the individuals and outlining what the Chinese government can and cannot do to enforce policy.

However, recently accusations have been raised from groups such as [[Amnesty International]], who have claimed that practices of compulsory sterilization have been occurring for people who have already reached their one child quota. These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level. An especially egregious example, according to Amnesty International, has been occurring in Puning City, [[Guangdong Province]]. The sterilization drive in this city was in accordance with regulations outlined by the government in the Population and Family Planning Law of 2002. This drive, also known as the [[Iron Fist Campaign]], also is said to have used coercive methods in order to ensure that close to 10,000 women were sterilized, including detaining elderly family members. It is unclear whether support of the increase of the now 90% Han Chinese majority here plays a role&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

The Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, “Some persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.” This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=September 20, 2005 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210000256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | archivedate=February 10, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains unclear to what extent the government has prosecuted or disciplined the officials in charge of family planning in the country.

The policy requires a "social compensation fee" for those who have more than the legal number of children. According to Forbes editor Heng Shao, critics claims this fee is a toll on the poor but not the rich.&lt;ref&gt;Enforcement of One-Child Policy Targets 'The Rich and Famous' in Zhangzhou, China, ''[[Forbes]]'', September 20, 2013. {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909011431/https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |archivedate=2017-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases registered in the Chinese legal system (cf.

One of the first acts by [[Adolf Hitler]] after the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] gave him de facto legal dictatorship over the [[Germany|German]] state was to pass the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (''Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses'') in July 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jkswAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XKgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3703%2C266241 Eugenics Courts Named in Reich.

The Montreal Gazette. June 20, 1934.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was signed by Hitler himself, and over 200 eugenic courts were created specifically as a result of this law. Under it, all doctors in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] were required to report any patients of theirs who were deemed [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], characterized [[mentally ill]] (including [[schizophrenia]] and [[manic depression]]), [[epilepsy|epileptic]], blind, deaf, or physically deformed, and a steep monetary penalty was imposed for any patients who were not properly reported. Individuals suffering from [[alcoholism]] or [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] could also be sterilized. The individual's case was then presented in front of a court of [[Nazism|Nazi]] officials and public health officers who would review their medical records, take testimony from friends and colleagues, and eventually decide whether or not to order a sterilization operation performed on the individual, using force if necessary. Though not explicitly covered by the law, 400 mixed-race "[[Rhineland Bastard]]s" were also sterilized beginning in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988), and Gisela Bock, "Nazi sterilization and reproductive policies" in Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, D.C.: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zzsbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=50wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1710%2C6396277 Wallace R.

By the end of [[World War II]], over 400,000 individuals were sterilised under the German law and its revisions, most within its first four years of being enacted. When the issue of compulsory sterilisation was brought up at the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war, many Nazis defended their actions on the matter by indicating that it was the United States itself from whom they had taken inspiration. The Nazis had many other eugenics-inspired [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]], including their [[T-4 Euthanasia Programme|"euthanasia" programme]] in which around 70,000 people institutionalised or suffering from birth defects were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', Chapter VI, first section (London, 1991, rev. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

India's state of emergency [[The Emergency (India)|between 1975 and 1977]] included a family planning initiative that began in April 1976 through which the government hoped to lower India's ever increasing population.

In the late 2000s, reports in the Israeli media claimed that injections of long-acting contraceptive Depo-Provera had been forced on hundreds of [[Ethiopian Jews in Israel|Ethiopian-Jewish immigrants]] both in transit camps in Ethiopia and after their arrival in Israel. In 2009, feminist NGO [[Haifa Women's Coalition]] published a first survey on the story, which was followed up by [[Israeli Educational Television]] a few years later. Ethiopian-Jewish women said they were intimidated or tricked into taking the shot every three months, sometimes presented to them as vaccine. In 2016 Israel's State Comptroller concluded his inquiry into the affair by claiming that injections of Depo-Provera had not been forced on the women; however, the Comptroller had refused to hear complainants' testimony, and his probe into the role of the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC), whose activists had looked after the women in the Ethiopian transit camps, left open questions, since the JDC official who had handled family programming in Ethiopia refused to give the Comptroller any information.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-forced-birth-control-probe-wouldn-t-hear-complainants-testimony-1.5396634&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first part of the [[Shōwa era]], Japanese governments promoted increasing the number of healthy Japanese, while simultaneously decreasing the number of people deemed to have mental retardation, disability, genetic disease and other conditions that led to inferiority in the Japanese gene pool.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1940_on_20131210024331"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=R.

The ''Leprosy Prevention laws'' of 1907, 1931 and 1953, permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums where forced abortions and sterilization were common and authorized punishment of patients "disturbing peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hansen's sanitarium were houses of horrors |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050128a1.html |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2005-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606085432/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050128a1.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}, {{cite journal |first=Hajime |last=Sato |title=Abolition of leprosy isolation policy in Japan: policy termination through leadership |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=29–46 |date=February 2002 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2002.tb02126.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the colonial Korean ''Leprosy prevention ordinance'', Korean patients were also subjected to hard labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Korean Hansens patients seek redress |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2004-02-26 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040226a4.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120605020715/search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040226a4.html |archivedate=2012-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Race Eugenic Protection Law'' was submitted from 1934 to 1938 to the Diet.

According to the ''Eugenic Protection Law'' (1948), sterilization could be enforced on criminals "with genetic predisposition to commit crime", patients with genetic diseases including mild ones such as total color-blindness, [[hemophilia]], [[albinism]] and [[ichthyosis]], and mental affections such as [[schizophrenia]], [[manic-depression]] possibly deemed occurrent in their opposition and [[epilepsy]], the sickness of Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soshiren.org/shiryou/yuseihogohou.html |title=SOSHIREN / 資料・法律−優生保護法 |publisher=Soshiren.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209082910/http://www.soshiren.org/shiryou/yuseihogohou.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mental sicknesses were added in 1952.

===Peru===
In [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of the ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', a sterilization program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | date=July 24, 2002 | accessdate=April 30, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630062037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | archivedate=June 30, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous people]] (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented on July 28, 1995. The plan was principally financed using funds from [[USAID]] (36 million dollars), the [[Nippon Foundation]], and later, the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA).&lt;ref name=Diplo&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 Stérilisations forcées des Indiennes du Pérou] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510120620/http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 |date=2014-05-10 }}, ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 1995, Fujimori presented a Bill that would revise the "General Law of Population", in order to allow sterilization. Several contraceptive methods were also legalized, all measures that were strongly opposed by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], as well as the Catholic organization [[Opus Dei]]. In February 1996, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) itself congratulated Fujimori on his success in controlling demographic growth.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt;

On February 25, 1998, a representative for USAID testified before the U.S. government's [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on International Relations]], to address controversy surrounding Peru's program. He indicated that the government of Peru was making important changes to the program, in order to:

* Discontinue their campaigns in tubal ligations and vasectomies.
* Make clear to health workers that there are no provider targets for voluntary surgical contraception or any other method of contraception.
* Implement a comprehensive monitoring program to ensure compliance with family planning norms and informed consent procedures.
* Welcome Ombudsman Office investigations of complaints received and respond to any additional complaints that are submitted as a result of the public request for any additional concerns.
* Implement a 72-hour "waiting period" for people who choose tubal ligation or vasectomy. This waiting period will occur between the second counseling session and surgery.
* Require health facilities to be certified as appropriate for performing surgical contraception as a means to ensure that no operations are done in makeshift or substandard facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USAID Testimony: House International Relations Committee, Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, 2/25/98|url=http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|publisher=USAID|accessdate=August 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906034940/http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|archivedate=September 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2001, Minister of Health [[Luis Solari De La Fuente|Luis Solari]] launched a special commission into the activities of the voluntary surgical contraception, initiating a parliamentary commission tasked with inquiring into the "irregularities" of the program, and to put it on an acceptable footing. In July 2002, its final report ordered by the Minister of Health revealed that between 1995 and 2000, 331,600 women were sterilized, while 25,590 men submitted to vasectomies.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt; The plan, which had the objective of diminishing the number of births in areas of poverty within Peru, was essentially directed at the indigenous people living in deprived areas (areas often involved in internal conflicts with the Peruvian government, as with the [[Shining Path]] guerilla group). Deputy Dora Núñez Dávila made the accusation in September 2003 that 400,000 indigenous people were sterilized during the 1990s. Documents proved that President Fujimori was informed, each month, of the number of sterilizations done, by his former Ministers of Health, Eduardo Yong Motta (1994–96), Marino Costa Bauer (1996–1999) and [[Alejandro Aguinaga]] (1999–2000).&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt; A study by sociologist {{ill|Giulia Tamayo León|es}}, ''Nada Personal'' (in English: Nothing Personal), showed that doctors were required to meet quotas. According to ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', "tubal ligation festivals" were organized through program publicity campaigns, held in the ''[[pueblos jóvenes]]'' (in English: shantytowns). In 1996 there were, according to official statistics, 81,762 tubal ligations performed on women, with a peak being reached the following year, with 109,689 ligatures, then only 25,995 in 1998.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

On October 21, 2011, Peru's Attorney General José Bardales decided to reopen an investigation into the cases, which had been halted in 2009 under the statute of limitations, after the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] ruled that President Fujimori’s sterilization program involved [[crimes against humanity]], which are not time-limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 Thousands of Forced Sterilization Cases Reopened in Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235249/http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 |date=2014-04-26 }} Impunity Watch, published November 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear as to any progress in matter of the execution (debido ejecución sumaria) of the suspect in the course of any proof of their relevant accusations in the legal sphere of the constituted people in vindication of the rights of the people of South America. It may carry a parallel to any suspect cases for international investigation in any other continent, and be in the sphere of medical genocide.

The eugenistic legislation was enacted in 1934 and was formally abolished in 1976.

===Switzerland===
In October 1999, Margrith von Felten suggested to the [[National Council of Switzerland]] in the form of a general proposal to adopt legal regulations that would enable reparation for persons sterilized against their will. According to the proposal, reparation was to be provided to persons who had undergone the intervention without their consent or who had consented to sterilization under coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} According to Margrith von Felten:
{{cquote|The history of eugenics in Switzerland remains insufficiently explored. Research programmes are in progress. However, individual studies and facts are already available. For example:

The report of the Institute for the History of Medicine and Public Health "Mental Disability and Sexuality. Legal sterilization in the [[Vaud]] Canton between 1928 and 1985" points out that coercive sterilizations took place until the 1980s, it is unclear if the ethnographic impact has been duly investigated and if Hun-descendant French have been affected, as well as prehistoric human descendant communities. The act on coercive sterilizations of the Vaud Canton was the first law of this kind in the European context.

Hans Wolfgang Maier, head of the Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich pointed out in a report from the beginning of the century that 70% to 80% of [[abortion|terminations]] were linked to sterilization by doctors. In the period from 1929 to 1931, 480 women and 15 men were sterilized in Zurich in connection with termination.

Following agreements between doctors and authorities such as the 1934 "Directive For Surgical Sterilization" of the Medical Association in Basle, eugenic indication to sterilization was recognized as admissible.

A statistical evaluation of the sterilizations performed in the Basle women's hospital between 1920 and 1934 shows a remarkable increase in sterilizations for a psychiatric indication after 1929 and a steep increase in 1934, when a coercive sterilization act came into effect in nearby National Socialist Germany.

A study by the Swiss Nursing School in Zurich, published in 1991, documents that 24 mentally disabled women aged between 17 and 25 years were sterilized between 1980 and 1987. Of these 24 sterilizations, just one took place at the young woman's request.

Having evaluated sources primarily from the 1930s (psychiatric files, official directives, court files, etc.), historians have documented that the requirement for free consent to sterilization was in most of cases not satisfied. Authorities obtained the "[[Informed consent|consent]]" required by the law partly by persuasion, and partly by enforcing it through coercion and threats. Thus the recipients of social benefits were threatened with removal of the benefits, women were exposed to a choice between placement in an institution or sterilization, and abortions were permitted only when women simultaneously consented to sterilization.

More than fifty years after ending the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany, in which racial murder, euthanasia and coerced sterilizations belonged to the political programme, it is clear that eugenics, with its idea of "[[life unworthy of life]]" and "racial purity" permeated even democratic countries. The idea that a "healthy nation" should be achieved through targeted medical/social measures was designed and politically implemented in many European countries and in the U.S.A in the first half of this century. It is a policy incomparable with the inconceivable horrors of the Nazi rule; yet it is clear that authorities and the medical community were guilty of the methods and measures applied, i.e. coerced sterilizations, prohibitions of marriages and child removals – serious violations of human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}}}

Switzerland refused, however, to vote a reparations Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Eugenics had two essential components. First, its advocates accepted as axiomatic that a range of mental and physical handicaps—blindness, deafness, and many forms of mental illness—were largely, if not entirely, hereditary in cause. Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration. The most direct policy implications of eugenic thought were that “mental defectives” should not produce children, since they would only replicate these deficiencies, and that such individuals from other countries should be kept out of the polity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen, King|first=Randall, Desmond|date=Summer 2017|title=Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests, and Policy Variance: Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and the U.S|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248650104|journal=World Politics|volume=53|pages=237–263|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053048/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Randall_Hansen/publication/248650104_Eugenic_Ideas_Political_Interests_and_Policy_Variance_Immigration_and_Sterilization_Policy_in_Britain_and_the_US/links/5548bc640cf27c5000668062/Eugenic-Ideas-Political-Interests-and-Policy-Variance-Immigration-and-Sterilization-Policy-in-Britain-and-the-US.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal targets of the American sterilization programs were the [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] and the [[Mental illness|mentally ill]], but also targeted under many state laws were the deaf, the blind, people with [[epilepsy]], and the physically deformed.

At this time, there were many women that were sent to institutions under the guise of being “[[feeble-minded]]" because they were promiscuous or became pregnant while unmarried.

Some sterilizations took place in [[Incarceration in the United States|prisons and other penal institutions]], targeting [[criminality]], but they were in the relative minority.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Alexandra Stern|Alexandra Minna Stern]], Ph.D. of University of Michigan in Spanish newspaper [[El País]] published on 12 Julz 2013 [http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715102459/http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html |date=2013-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, over 65,000 individuals were sterilized in 33 states under state compulsory sterilization programs in the United States, in all likelihood without the perspectives of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Open WorldCat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kevles|first=Daniel|title=In the name of eugenics: Genetics and the uses of human heredity|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-50702-6|edition=1st|date=April 12, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], public opinion towards eugenics and sterilization programs became more negative in the light of the connection with the [[genocide|genocidal]] policies of [[Nazi Germany]], though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states through the 1970s. The [[Oregon]] Board of Eugenics, later renamed the Board of Social Protection, existed until 1983,&lt;ref name=oregonapology&gt;{{cite web |author=Governor John Kitzhaber |authorlink=John Kitzhaber |date=December 2, 2002 |title=Proclamation of Human Rights Day, and apology for Oregon's forced sterilization of institutionalized patients |url=http://archivedwebsites.sos.state.or.us/Governor_Kitzhaber_2003/governor/speeches/s021202.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528024042/http://archivedwebsites.sos.state.or.us/Governor_Kitzhaber_2003/governor/speeches/s021202.htm |archivedate=May 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the last forcible sterilization occurring in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Sullivan.

(Mirrored in ''Eugene Register-Guard'', November 16, 2002, at [[Google News]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] [[Puerto Rico]] had a sterilization program as well. Some states continued to have sterilization laws on the books for much longer after that, though they were rarely if ever used. California sterilized more than any other state by a wide margin, and was responsible for over a third of all sterilization operations. Information about the California sterilization program was produced into book form and widely disseminated by eugenicists [[E.S. Gosney]] and [[Paul B. Popenoe]], which was said by the government of [[Adolf Hitler]] to be of key importance in proving that large-scale compulsory sterilization programs were feasible.&lt;ref&gt;On California sterilizations and their connection to the Nazi program, see: Stefan Kühl, ''The Nazi connection: Eugenics, American racism, and German National Socialism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994); Alexandra Stern, ''Eugenic nation: faults and frontiers of better breeding in modern America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005); and Wendy Kline, ''Building a better race: gender, sexuality, and eugenics from the turn of the century to the baby boom'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, the governors of many states have made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon&lt;ref name=oregonapology/&gt; and California. Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, ''[[Poe v. Lynchburg Training School &amp; Hospital]]'' (1981), was filed in the courts on the grounds that the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) believes that mental disability is not a reason to deny sterilization.

The inability to pay for the cost of raising children has been a reason courts have ordered coercive or compulsory sterilization.

Abortion remained heavily restricted. By 1965, approximately 34 percent of women of childbearing age had been sterilized, two thirds of whom were still in their early twenties The law was repealed on June 8, 1960.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

=====1940s-1950s=====

Unemployment and widespread poverty would continue to grow in Puerto Rico in the 40s, threatening both U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico and acting as a deterrent for future investment.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In an attempt to attract additional U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico, another round of liberalizing trade policies were implemented and referred to as “[[Operation Bootstrap]].”&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Despite these policies and their relative success, unemployment and poverty in Puerto Rico remained high, high enough to prompt an increase in [[emigration]] from Puerto Rico to the United States between 1950 and 1955.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The issues of [[immigration]], Puerto Rican poverty, and threats to U.S. private investment made population control concerns a prime political and social issue for the United States.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

The 50s also saw the production of social science research supporting sterilization procedures in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Princeton’s [[Office of Population Research]], in collaboration with the Social Research Department at the University of Puerto Rico, conducted interviews with couples regarding sterilization and other birth control.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Their studies concluded that there was a significant need and desire for permanent birth control among Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In response, Puerto Rico’s governor and Commissioner of health opened 160 private, temporary birth control clinics with the specific purpose of sterilization.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

Also during this era, private birth control clinics were established in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; [[Joseph Sunnen]], a wealthy American Republican and industrialist, established the [[Sunnen Foundation]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; The foundation funded new birth control clinics under the title “La Asociación Puertorriqueña el Biensestar de la Familia” and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in an experimental project to determine if a formulaic program could be used to control population growth in Puerto Rico and beyond.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

=====Sterilization Procedures and [[Coercion]]=====
From beginning of the 1900s, U.S. and Puerto Rican governments espoused rhetoric connecting the poverty of Puerto Rico with overpopulation and the “hyper-fertility” of Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Iris|title=Agency And Constraint: Sterilization And Reproductive Freedom Among Puerto Rican Women In New York City|journal=Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development|date=1993|volume=22|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rhetoric combined with eugenics ideology of reducing “population growth among a particular class or ethnic group because they are considered...a social burden,” was the philosophical basis for the 1937 birth control legislation enacted in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; A Puerto Rican Eugenics Board, modeled after a similar board in the United States, was created as part of the bill, and officially ordered ninety-seven involuntary sterilizations.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=Laura|title=Reproducing Empire: Race, Sex, Science, and U.S. Imperialism in Puerto Rico|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-0-520-22255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legalization of sterilization was followed by a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramirez de Arellano|first1=Annette B.|last2=Seipp|first2=Conrad|title=Colonialism, Catholicism, and Contraception: A History of Birth Control in Puerto Rico|date=1983|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-1544-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "B" /&gt; This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; There is additional evidence that true [[informed consent]] was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

By 1949 a survey of Puerto Rican women found that 21% of women interviewed had been sterilized, with sterilizations being performed in 18% of all hospital births statewide as a routine post-partum procedure, with the sterilization operation performed before women left the hospitals after giving birth.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As for the birth control clinics founded by Sunnen, the Puerto Rican Family Planning Association reported that around 8,000 women and 3,000 men had been sterilized in Sunnen's privately funded clinics.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; At one point, the levels of sterilization in Puerto Rico were so high that they alarmed the Joint Committee for Hospital Accreditation, who then demanded that Puerto Rican hospitals limit sterilizations to ten percent of all hospital deliveries in order to receive accreditation.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The high popularity of sterilization continued into the 60s and 70s, during which the Puerto Rican government made the procedures available for free and reduced fees.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; The effects of the sterilization and contraception campaigns of the 1900s in Puerto Rico are still felt in Puerto Rican cultural history today.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;

======Controversy and Opposing Viewpoints======
There has been much debate and scholarly analysis concerning the legitimacy of choice given to Puerto Rican women with regards to sterilization, reproduction, and birth control, as well as with the ethics of economically motivated mass sterilization programs.

Some scholars, such as Bonnie Mass&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; and Iris Lopez,&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; have argued that the history and popularity of mass sterilization in Puerto Rico represents a government-led eugenics initiative for [[population control]].,&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elena&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Elena R.|last2=Fuentes|first2=Liza|title=Population Control by Sterilization: The Cases of Puerto Rican and Mexican-Origin Women in the United States|journal=Latino(a) Research Review|date=2009–2010|volume=7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite the private and government funding of sterilization, coercive practices, and the eugenics ideology of Puerto Rican and American governments and physicians as evidence of a mass sterilization campaign.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Elena" /&gt;

On the other side of the debate, scholars like Laura Briggs&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass sterilization program.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;

=====Effects=====
When the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people.&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; By 1961, the birth rate had dropped to 30.8 per thousand.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1955, 16.5% of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized, this jumped to 34% in 1965.&lt;ref name= "Mass" /&gt;

In 1969, sociologist [[Harriet Presser]] analyzed the 1965 Master Sample Survey of Health and Welfare in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=Presser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Presser|first1=Harriet B.|title=The Role of Sterilization in Controlling Puerto Rican Fertility|journal=Population Studies|date=November 1969|volume=23|issue=3|pages=343–361|doi=10.2307/2172875|jstor=2172875}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She specifically analyzed data from the survey for women ages 20 to 49 who had at least one birth, resulting in an overall sample size of 1,071 women.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; She found that over 34% of women aged 20–49 had been sterilized in Puerto Rico in 1965.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

Presser’s analysis also found that 46.7% of women who reported they were sterilized were between the ages of 34 and 39.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Of the sample of women sterilized, 46.6% had been married 15 to 19 years, 43.9% had been married for 10 to 14 years, and 42.7% had been married for 20 to 24 years.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Nearly 50% of women sterilized had three or four births.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Over 1/3 of women who reported being sterilized were sterilized in their twenties, with the average age of sterilization being 26.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

A survey by a team of Americans in 1975 confirmed Presser's assessment that nearly 1/3 of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As of 1977, Puerto Rico had the highest proportion of childbearing-aged persons sterilized in the world.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1993, [[ethnographic]] work done in New York by [[anthropologist]] Iris Lopez&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; showed that the history of sterilization continued to effect the lives of Puerto Rican women even after they immigrated to the United States and lived there for generations.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; The history of the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico meant that Puerto Rican women living in America had high rates of female family members who had undergone sterilization, and it remained a highly popular form of birth control among Puerto Rican women living in New York.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;

===Mexico===
“Civil Society Organizations such as Balance, Promocion para el Desarrollo y Juventud, A.C., have received in the last years numerous testimonies of women living with HIV in which they inform that misinformation about the virus transmission has frequently lead to compulsory sterilization. Although there is enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed to reduce mother-to-child transmission risks, there are records of HIV-positive women forced to undergo sterilization or have agreed to be sterilized without adequate and sufficient information about their options.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

“A [http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19462/html report] made in El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua concluded that women living with HIV, and whose health providers knew about it at the time of pregnancy, were six times more likely to experience forced or coerced sterilization in those countries. In addition, most of these women reported that health providers told them that living with HIV cancelled their right to choose the number and spacing of the children they want to have as well as the right to choose the contraceptive method of their choice; provided misleading information about the consequences for their health and that of their children and denied them access to treatments that reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in order to coerce them into sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

This happens even when the health norm [http://www.salud.gob.mx/unidades/cdi/nom/005ssa23.html NOM 005-SSA2-1993] states that family planning is “the right of everyone to decide freely, responsibly and in an informed way the number and spacing of their children and to obtain specialized information and proper services” and that “the exercise of this right is independent of gender, age, and social or legal status of persons”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Based on a report by journalist Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women. One doctor reported, “It's ruling number 1098 and it says that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.”, in a loss of the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hackel |first=Joyce |title=Doctors in Uzbekistan Say Government Forcibly Sterilizing Women |website=PRI's The World |date=April 12, 2012 |url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/doctors-in-uzbekistan-say-government-forcibly-sterilizing-women/ |publisher=Theworld.org |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119162605/http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/doctors-in-uzbekistan-say-government-forcibly-sterilizing-women/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt; In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to sterilize women in order to control the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Uzbekistan |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |author=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |website=2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices |date=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052726/https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |archivedate=June 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to sterilize. These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt;

On May 15, 2012, during a meeting with the Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] in [[Moscow]] the Uzbek president Islam Karimov said: "we are doing everything in our hands to make sure that the population growth rate [in Uzbekistan] does not exceed 1.2-1.3"&lt;ref name="RFE/RL"&gt;{{cite news|title="Akhborot" censors Karimov|url=http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=[[RFE/RL]]'s Uzbek Service|date=17 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529011406/http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uzbek version of [[RFE/RL]] reported that with this statement Karimov indirectly admitted that forced sterilization of women is indeed taking place in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt; The main Uzbek television channel, O'zbekiston, cut out Karimov's statement about the population growth rate while broadcasting his conversation with Putin.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt;
It is unclear if there is any genocidal conspiracy in regard of the Mongol type involved, in connection with genetic drain of this type through lack of their reproduction.

Despite international agreement concerning the inhumanity and illegality of forced sterilization, it has been suggested that the Government of Uzbekistan [[#Uzbekistan|continues to pursue such programs]].&lt;ref name=bbc-news-2012-04-12 /&gt;

===Other countries===
Eugenics programs including forced sterilization existed in most Northern European countries, as well as other more or less Protestant countries. Other countries that had notably active sterilisation programmes include [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunnar Broberg]] and [[Nils Roll-Hansen]], eds., ''Eugenics And the Welfare State: Sterilization Policy in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland'' (Michigan State University Press, 2005), it is unclear whether genocide investigations in regard of Hun descendant and pure Aryan types has been undertaken, and if concealment is attempted through the prevalence of cremation and allegation of psychiatric treatment facial mimicry of Mongolian types.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Iceland]], and some countries in [[Latin America]] (including [[Panama]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Home Secretary]] [[Winston Churchill]] was a noted advocate, and his successor [[Reginald McKenna]] introduced a bill that included forced sterilisation. Writer [[G. K. Chesterton]] led a successful effort to defeat that clause of the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913|1913 Mental Deficiency Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin.

In 2015, the [[Court of Protection]] of the [[United Kingdom]] ruled that a woman with six children and an IQ of 70 should be sterilized for her own safety because another pregnancy would have been a "significantly life-threatening event" for her and the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=James Gallagher |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-31128969 |title=Mother of six 'can be sterilised' - court ruling |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=February 12, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208051831/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-31128969 |archivedate=February 8, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical basis==
The basis for many creationists' beliefs is a literal or quasi-literal interpretation of the [[Old Testament]], especially from stories from the [[book of Genesis]]:

* The [[Genesis creation narrative]] (Genesis 1–2) describes how [[God]] brings the Universe into being in a series of creative acts over six days and places the first man and woman ([[Adam and Eve]]) in a divine garden (the [[Garden of Eden]]). This story is the basis of creationist cosmology and biology.
* The [[Genesis flood narrative]] (Genesis 6–9) tells how God destroys the world and all life through a great flood, saving representatives of each form of life by means of [[Noah's ark]]. This forms the basis of creationist geology, better known as [[flood geology]].

A further important element is the interpretation of the [[Biblical chronology]], the elaborate system of life-spans, "generations," and other means by which the Bible measures the passage of events from the creation (Genesis 1:1) to the [[Book of Daniel]], the last biblical book in which it appears. Recent decades have seen attempts to de-link creationism from the Bible and recast it as science; these include [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Carlson, Tremper Longman III, Science, Creation and the Bible: Reconciling Rival Theories of Origins, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; There are also non-Christian forms of creationism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/creationism_1.shtml |title=Creationism and intelligent design |date=2 June 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Islamic creationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/science/03islam.html |title=Creationism, Minus a Young Earth, Emerges in the Islamic World |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[NY Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/16/darwin-evolution-china-politics |title=Darwinism, through a Chinese lens |first=Riazat |last=Butt |date=16 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Several attempts have been made to categorize the different types of creationism, and create a "[[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]" of creationists.&lt;ref name="Scott1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |date=July–August 1999 |title=The Creation/Evolution Continuum |url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/creationevolution-continuum |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=16–17, 23–25 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise-p30"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wise |first=Donald U. |date=January 2001 |title=Creationism's Propaganda Assault on Deep Time and Evolution |url=http://nagt.org/nagt/jge/abstracts/jan01.html |journal=Journal of Geoscience Education |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=30–35 |issn=1089-9995 |accessdate=2014-03-09|bibcode=2001JGeEd..49...30W |doi=10.5408/1089-9995-49.1.30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nagt-pdf-Ross"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Marcus R. |authorlink=Marcus R.

===Young Earth creationism===
{{Main|Young Earth creationism}}
[[File:ICR building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) is a young-Earth creationist organization.]]
Young Earth creationists such as [[Ken Ham]] and [[Doug Phillips]] believe that God created the Earth within the last ten thousand years, literally as described in the Genesis creation narrative, within the approximate time-frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Most young Earth creationists believe that the universe has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the universe than to Earth. [[Creationist cosmologies]] give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other young Earth time frames. Other young Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is what gives the geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth and the universe their much longer [[timeline]]s.

The Christian organizations [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) and the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) both promote young Earth creationism in the US. Another organization with similar views, [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG)—based in both the U.S. and the [[United Kingdom]]—has opened the [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]], to promote young Earth creationism. [[Creation Ministries International]] promotes young Earth views in Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, the US, and the UK. Among [[Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], the [[List of Catholic creationist organisations|Kolbe Center]] for the Study of Creation promotes similar ideas. In 2007, Ken Ham founded the [[Creation Museum]] and [[Ark Encounter]] in northern [[Kentucky]].

===Old Earth creationism===
{{Main|Old Earth creationism}}
Old Earth creationism holds that the physical universe was created by God, but that the creation event described in the Book of Genesis is to be taken figuratively. This group generally believes that the [[age of the universe]] and the age of the Earth are as described by [[astronomer]]s and [[geologist]]s, but that details of [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary theory]] are questionable.&lt;ref name="Scott1999" /&gt;

Old Earth creationism itself comes in at least three types:&lt;ref name="Scott1999" /&gt;

====Gap creationism====
{{Main|Gap creationism}}
Gap creationism, also called "restoration creationism," holds that life was recently created on a pre-existing old Earth. This version of creationism relies on a particular interpretation of {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:1–2|KJV}}. It is considered that the words [[Tohu wa-bohu|''formless'' and ''void'']] in fact denote waste and ruin, taking into account the original Hebrew and other places these words are used in the [[Old Testament]]. Genesis 1:1–2 is consequently translated:

: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." (Original act of creation.)
: "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."

Thus, the six days of creation (verse 3 onwards) start sometime after the Earth was "without form and void." This allows an indefinite "gap" of time to be inserted after the original creation of the universe, but prior to the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation according to Genesis]], (when present biological species and [[human]]ity were created). Gap theorists can therefore agree with the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the age of the Earth and universe, while maintaining a literal interpretation of the biblical text.

Some{{which|date=November 2013}} gap creationists expand the basic version of creationism by proposing a "primordial creation" of biological life within the "gap" of time. This is thought to be "the world that then was" mentioned in [[2 Peter]] 3:3–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Peter|3|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries of fossils and archaeological ruins older than 10,000 years are generally ascribed to this "world that then was," which may also be associated with [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. These views became popular with publications of Hebrew Lexicons such as ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', and Bible commentaries such as the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' and [[E. W. Bullinger|''The Companion Bible'']].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

====Day-age creationism====
{{Main|Day-age creationism}}
Day-age creationism states that the "six days" of the Book of Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, but rather much longer periods (for instance, each "day" could be the equivalent of millions, or billions of years of human time). The physicist [[Gerald Schroeder]] is one such proponent of this view. This version of creationism often states that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "yôm," in the context of Genesis 1, can be properly interpreted as "age."

Strictly speaking, day-age creationism is not so much a version of creationism as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] option which may be combined with other versions of creationism such as progressive creationism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Progressive creationism====
{{Main|Progressive creationism}}
Progressive creationism holds that species have changed or evolved in a process continuously guided by God, with various ideas as to how the process operated—though it is generally taken that God directly intervened in the natural order at key moments in Earth history. This view accepts most of modern physical science including the age of the Earth, but rejects much of modern [[evolutionary biology]] or looks to it for evidence that evolution by [[natural selection]] alone is incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Organizations such as [[Reasons To Believe]], founded by [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], promote this version of creationism.

Progressive creationism can be held in conjunction with [[hermeneutic]] approaches to the Genesis creation narrative such as the [[day-age creationism]] or [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|framework]]/metaphoric/poetic views.

===Philosophic and scientific creationism===
====Creation science====
{{Main|Creation science}}
Creation science, or initially scientific creationism, is a [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2267227 | pmid=18059309 | doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7401131 | volume=8 | issue=12 | title=Taking on creationism.

Okasha's full statement is that "virtually all professional biologists regard creation science as a sham{{snd}}a dishonest and misguided attempt to promote religious beliefs under the guise of science, with extremely harmful educational consequences."&lt;/ref&gt; that emerged in the 1960s with proponents aiming to have young Earth creationist beliefs taught in school science classes as a counter to teaching of evolution. Common features of creation science argument include: creationist cosmologies which accommodate a universe on the order of thousands of years old, criticism of [[radiometric dating]] through a technical argument about [[radiohalo]]s, explanations for the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] as a record of the [[Genesis flood narrative]] (see [[flood geology]]), and explanations for the present diversity as a result of pre-designed genetic variability and partially due to the rapid degradation of the perfect [[genome]]s God placed in "created kinds" or "[[Baraminology|Baramin]]" (see [[Creation science#Creationist biology|creationist biology]]) due to [[mutation]]s.

====Neo-creationism====
{{Main|Neo-creationism}}
Neo-creationism is a [[pseudoscientific]] movement which aims to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the [[scientific community]]. It aims to [[Framing (social sciences)|re-frame]] the debate over the [[Creation myth|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as correct or accurate in public-school curricula violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=morris_neo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=425 |title=Neocreationism |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |authorlink=Henry M.

One of the principal claims of neo-creationism propounds that ostensibly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] orthodox science, with a foundation in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], is actually a dogmatically [[atheism|atheistic]] [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.darwinreconsidered.org/media/MaterialistMythology.pdf |title= Darwinism is Materialist Mythology, Not Science |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |date=October 2004 |website= DarwinReconsidered.org |accessdate=Sep 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents argue that the [[scientific method]] excludes certain explanations of phenomena, particularly where they point towards [[supernatural]] elements, thus effectively excluding religious insight from contributing to understanding the [[universe]]. This leads to an open and often hostile opposition to what neo-creationists term "[[Darwinism]]", which they generally mean to refer to [[evolution]], but which they may extend to include such concepts as [[abiogenesis]], [[stellar evolution]] and the [[Big Bang]] theory.

Unlike their philosophical forebears, neo-creationists largely do not believe in many of the traditional cornerstones of creationism such as a young Earth, or in a dogmatically [[Biblical inerrancy|literal interpretation of the Bible]].

ID originated as a re-branding of creation science in an attempt to avoid a series of court decisions ruling out the teaching of creationism in American public schools, and the Discovery Institute has run [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|a series of campaigns]] to change school curricula.&lt;ref name="Flank_April2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |title=Creationism/ID: A Short Legal History |last=Flank |first=Lenny |website=Talk Reason |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |archivedate=August 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, where curricula are under the control of state governments rather than local school boards, there was a public outcry when the notion of ID being taught in science classes was raised by the Federal Education Minister [[Brendan Nelson]]; the minister quickly conceded that the correct forum for ID, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Deborah |date=October 21, 2005 |title=Intelligent design not science: experts |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, teaching of intelligent design in public schools has been decisively ruled by a [[United States district court|federal district court]] to be in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]], the court found that intelligent design is not science and "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

Dover Area School District/6:Curriculum, Conclusion#Page 136 of 139|Curriculum, Conclusion, p. 136]].&lt;/ref&gt; and hence cannot be taught as an alternative to evolution in public school science classrooms under the jurisdiction of that court. This sets a [[Precedent#Persuasive precedent|persuasive precedent]], based on previous US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions in ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' and ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' (1968), and by the application of the [[Lemon v.

===Geocentrism===
{{Main|Geocentric model}}
In [[astronomy]], the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, or the Ptolemaic system), is a description of the [[Cosmos]] where Earth is at the orbital center of all celestial bodies. This model served as the predominant cosmological system in many ancient civilizations such as [[ancient Greece]]. As such, they assumed that the Sun, Moon, stars, and [[Classical planet|naked eye planets]] circled Earth, including the noteworthy systems of [[Aristotle]] (see [[Aristotelian physics]]) and [[Ptolemy]].

Articles arguing that geocentrism was the biblical perspective appeared in some early creation science newsletters associated with the Creation Research Society pointing to some passages in the Bible, which, when taken literally, indicate that the daily apparent motions of the Sun and the Moon are due to their actual motions around the Earth rather than due to the rotation of the Earth about its axis for example, [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10:12 where the Sun and Moon are said to stop in the sky, and [[Psalms]] 93:1 where the world is described as immobile.&lt;ref name="Numbers1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Numbers |first=Ronald L. |year=1993 |origyear=Originally published 1992; New York: [[Alfred A.

Most contemporary creationist organizations reject such perspectives.{{refn|group="note"|Donald B. DeYoung, for example, states that "Similar terminology is often used today when we speak of the sun's rising and setting, even though the earth, not the sun, is doing the moving. Bible writers used the 'language of appearance,' just as people always have. Without it, the intended message would be awkward at best and probably not understood clearly. When the Bible touches on scientific subjects, it is entirely accurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/1997/11/05/astronomy-bible |title=Astronomy and the Bible: Selected questions and answers excerpted from the book |last=DeYoung |first=Donald B. |date=November 5, 1997 |website=[[Answers in Genesis]] |publisher=Answers in Genesis Ministries International |location=Hebron, KY |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Omphalos hypothesis ===
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}
The Omphalos hypothesis argues that in order for the world to be functional, God must have created a mature Earth with mountains and canyons, rock strata, trees with growth rings, and so on; therefore ''no'' evidence that we can see of the presumed age of the Earth and age of the universe can be taken as reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gosse 1857|Gosse 1857]]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has seen some revival in the 20th century by some modern creationists, who have extended the argument to address the [[Creationist cosmologies#Starlight problem|"starlight problem"]]. The idea has been criticised as [[Last Thursdayism]], and on the grounds that it requires a deliberately deceptive creator.

==Theistic evolution==
{{Main|Theistic evolution}}
Theistic evolution, or evolutionary creation, is a belief that "the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sweet &amp; Feist 2007|Sweet &amp; Feist 2007]], [https://books.google.com/?id=qwaRUNj6S34C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=theistic+evolution+evolutionary+creation#v=onepage&amp;q=theistic%20evolution%20evolutionary%20creation&amp;f=false p. 48], "''Evolutionary Creation'' (or Theistic Evolution) asserts that the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes."&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Scientific Affiliation:

{{quote|A theory of theistic evolution (TE){{snd}}also called evolutionary creation{{snd}}proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve. Usually the "evolution" in "theistic evolution" means Total Evolution{{snd}}astronomical evolution (to form galaxies, solar systems,...) and geological evolution (to form the earth's geology) plus chemical evolution (to form the first life) and biological evolution (for the development of life){{snd}}but it can refer only to biological evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/te2-cr.htm |title=Evolutionary Creation |last=Rusbult |first=Craig |year=1998 |publisher=American Scientific Affiliation |location=Ipswich, MA |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Through the 19th century the term ''creationism'' most commonly referred to [[Creationism (soul)|direct creation of individual souls]], in contrast to [[traducianism]]. Following the publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', there was interest in ideas of Creation by [[divine law]]. In particular, the [[liberal Christianity|liberal theologian]] [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that this illustrated the Creator's power better than the idea of miraculous creation, which he thought ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; When ''On the Origin of Species'' was published, the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] wrote of evolution as "just as noble a conception of Deity."&lt;ref name="Darwinanddesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |title=Darwin and design: historical essay |year=2007 |website=Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=Cambridge University Library |location=Cambridge, UK |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021101910/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2534 |title=Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as [[Lamarckism#Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] were favoured as being more compatible with purpose than natural selection.&lt;ref name="bowl202"&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], pp. 202–08&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theists took the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] and creation are compatible with some or all of modern scientific theory, including specifically evolution; it is also known as "evolutionary creation." In Evolution versus Creationism, [[Eugenie Scott]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] state that it is in fact a type of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 2005|Scott 2005]], pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

It generally views evolution as a tool used by God, who is both the [[Unmoved mover#First cause|first cause]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the day-age creationist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative; however most adherents consider that the first chapters of the Book of Genesis should not be interpreted as a "literal" description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or allegory.

From a theistic viewpoint, the underlying laws of nature were designed by God for a purpose, and are so self-sufficient that the complexity of the entire physical universe evolved from fundamental particles in processes such as [[stellar evolution]], life forms developed in biological evolution, and in the same way the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life by natural causes]] has resulted from these laws.&lt;ref name="The Origin of Life"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/originoflife.html#intro |title=The Origin of Life |last=Moritz |first=Albrecht |date=October 31, 2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one form or another, theistic evolution is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline [[Protestantism|Protestant]] seminaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 1999|Scott 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; For Roman Catholics, human evolution is not a matter of religious teaching, and must stand or fall on its own scientific merits. [[Catholic Church and evolution|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church]] are not in conflict. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] comments positively on the theory of evolution, which is neither precluded nor required by the sources of faith, stating that scientific studies "have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akin |first=Jimmy |date=January 2004 |title=Evolution and the Magisterium |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |journal=[[Catholic Answers|This Rock]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |issn=1049-4561 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804102139/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |archivedate=2007-08-04 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] schools teach evolution without controversy on the basis that scientific knowledge does not extend beyond the physical, and scientific truth and religious truth cannot be in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Guntzel |first=Jeff Severns |url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005a/032505/032505ssn.htm |date=March 25, 2005 |title=Catholic schools steer clear of anti-evolution bias |newspaper=[[National Catholic Reporter]] |location=Kansas City, MO |publisher=The National Catholic Reporter Publishing Company |issn=0027-8939 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic evolution can be described as "creationism" in holding that [[Miracle|divine intervention]] brought about the origin of life or that divine laws govern formation of species, though many creationists (in the strict sense) would deny that the position is creationism at all. In the [[creation–evolution controversy]], its proponents generally take the "evolutionist" side. This sentiment was expressed by Fr. [[George Coyne]], (the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]'s chief astronomer between 1978 and 2006):&lt;blockquote&gt;...in America, creationism has come to mean some fundamentalistic, literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis. Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in a belief that everything depends upon God, or better, all is a gift from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18504 |title=Text of talk by Vatican Observatory director on 'Science Does Not Need God.

While supporting the [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] inherent in modern science, the proponents of theistic evolution reject the implication taken by some [[atheism|atheists]] that this gives credence to [[Ontology|ontological]] [[materialism]].

{{Further|Genesis creation narrative|creation–evolution controversy}}
{{As of|2006}}, most [[Christian]]s around the world accepted evolution as the most likely explanation for the origins of species, and did not take a [[Biblical literalism|literal view]] of the [[Genesis creation myth]]. The United States is an exception where belief in religious [[fundamentalism]] is much more likely to affect attitudes towards evolution than it is for believers elsewhere. Political partisanship affecting religious belief may be a factor because political partisanship in the US is highly correlated with fundamentalist thinking, unlike in Europe.&lt;ref name="Science survey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Jon D. |last2=Scott |first2=Eugenie C. |authorlink2=Eugenie Scott |last3=Okamoto |first3=Shinji |date=August 2006 |title=Public acceptance of evolution |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5788/765 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=313 |issue=5788 |pages=765–66 |doi=10.1126/science.1126746 |pmid=16902112 |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; churches have made statements in favor of evolutionary theory, as have scholars such as the physicist [[John Polkinghorne]], who argues that evolution is one of the principles through which God created living beings. Earlier supporters of evolutionary theory include [[Frederick Temple]], Asa Gray and Charles Kingsley who were enthusiastic supporters of Darwin's theories upon their publication,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polkinghorne 1998|Polkinghorne 1998]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; and the French Jesuit priest and geologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] saw evolution as confirmation of his Christian beliefs, despite condemnation from Church authorities for his more speculative theories. Another example is that of [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theology]], not providing any creation models, but instead focusing on the [[symbol]]ism in beliefs of the time of authoring Genesis and the cultural environment.

Many Christians and Jews had been considering the idea of the creation history as an allegory (instead of historical) long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. For example, Philo, whose works were taken up by early Church writers, wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days, or in any set amount of time.&lt;ref name="Philo_Chapter2"&gt;[[#Philo|Philo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.earlychurch.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/philo.php |title=Philo of Alexandria (c. 20&amp;nbsp;BC{{snd}}c.

In 1950, [[Pope Pius XII]] stated limited support for the idea in his [[Encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |author=Pope Pius XII |authorlink=Pope Pius XII |title=Humani Generis |website=Vatican: the Holy See |publisher=[[Holy See]] |location=St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City |type=[[Encyclical#Catholic usage|Papal encyclical]] |date=August 12, 1950 |accessdate=2011-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=April 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Pope John Paul II]] stated that "new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis," but, referring to previous papal writings, he concluded that "if the human body takes its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual [[soul]] is immediately created by God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pope John Paul II |authorlink=Pope John Paul II |date=October 30, 1996 |title=Magisterium is concerned with question of evolution, for it involves conception of man |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~nmcenter/sci-cp/evolution.html |newspaper=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] |type=Message to the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] |edition=Weekly English |location=Tipografia Vaticana, Vatican City |publisher=Holy See |number=44 |pages=3, 7 |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, Evangelical Christians have continued to believe in a literal Genesis. Members of evangelical Protestant (70%), [[Mormons|Mormon]] (76%) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (90%) denominations are the most likely to reject the evolutionary interpretation of the origins of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2008 |title=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey |url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Social and Political Views |page=95 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-19}} Report 2: Religious Beliefs &amp; Practices, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses adhere to a combination of [[gap creationism]] and [[day-age creationism]], asserting that scientific evidence about the age of the universe is compatible with the Bible, but that the 'days' after Genesis 1:1 were each thousands of years in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|title=Historical Dictionary of Jehovah's Witnesses|date=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810862692|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx6nUwZzeCsC&amp;pg=PA37|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic Christian literal interpretation of creation requires the harmonization of the two creation stories, Genesis 1:1–2:3 and Genesis 2:4–25, for there to be a consistent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2194 |title=Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? |last=Jackson |first=Wayne |website=Apologetics Press |location=Montgomery, Al |accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |last=Tobin |first=Paul N. |year=2000 |title=The Creation Myths: Internal Difficulties |website=The Rejection of Pascal's Wager: A Skeptic's Guide to Christianity |publisher=Paul Tobin |location=Singapore |accessdate=2014-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008175621/http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |archivedate=2014-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes seek to ensure that their belief is taught in science classes, mainly in American schools. Opponents reject the claim that the literalistic biblical view meets the criteria required to be considered scientific. Many religious groups teach that God created the Cosmos. From the days of the early Christian Church Fathers there were allegorical interpretations of the Book of Genesis as well as literal aspects.&lt;ref name="rsf"&gt;[[#Forster &amp; Marston 1999|Forster &amp; Marston 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]], a system of thought and practice derived from the writings of [[Mary Baker Eddy]], interprets the Book of Genesis figuratively rather than literally. It holds that the material world is an illusion, and consequently not created by God: the only real creation is the spiritual realm, of which the material world is a distorted version. Christian Scientists regard the story of the creation in the Book of Genesis as having symbolic rather than literal meaning. According to Christian Science,  both creationism and evolution are false from an absolute or "spiritual" point of view, as they both proceed from a (false) belief in the reality of a material universe. However, Christian Scientists do not oppose the teaching of evolution in schools, nor do they demand that alternative accounts be taught: they believe that both material science and literalist theology are concerned with the illusory, mortal and material, rather than the real, immortal and spiritual. With regard to material theories of creation, Eddy showed a preference for Darwin's theory of evolution over others.&lt;ref name=S&amp;Hp547&gt;[[#Eddy 1934|Eddy 1934]], p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hindu views on evolution}}
According to Hindu creationism, all species on Earth including humans have "devolved" or come down from a high state of pure [[consciousness]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Hindu creationists claim that species of [[plants]] and [[animals]] are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGrath 2010|McGrath 2010]], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Numbers]] says that: "Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu creationism is a form of old Earth creationism, according to Hindu creationists the universe may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the [[Vedas]], the creation myths of which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carper &amp; Hunt 2009|Carper &amp; Hunt 2009]], p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dasgupta 1922|Dasgupta 1922]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic views on evolution}}
[[Islamic views on evolution|Islamic creationism]] is the belief that the universe (including humanity) was directly created by [[God in Islam|God]] as explained in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. It usually views the Book of Genesis as a corrupted version of God's message. The creation myths in the Qur'an are vaguer and allow for a wider range of interpretations similar to those in other Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Islam also has its own school of theistic evolutionism, which holds that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Qur'an. Some [[Muslims]] believe in evolutionary creation, especially among [[liberal movements within Islam]].&lt;ref name="Huffpo"/&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Drake Bennett noted: "Without a Book of Genesis to account for ... Muslim creationists have little interest in proving that the age of the Earth is measured in the thousands rather than the billions of years, nor do they show much interest in the problem of the dinosaurs. And the idea that animals might evolve into other animals also tends to be less controversial, in part because there are passages of the Koran that seem to support it. But the issue of whether human beings are the product of evolution is just as fraught among Muslims."&lt;ref name="Bennett 4"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennett |first=Drake |date=October 25, 2009 |title=Islam's Darwin problem |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |location=Boston, MA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030044754/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |archivedate=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Muslims, such as [[Adnan Oktar]] (also known as Harun Yahya), do not agree that one species can develop from another.&lt;ref name="PrizeforFossil"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/3102103/Creationist-Adnan-Oktar-offers-trillion-pound-prize-for-fossil-proof-of-evolution.html |last=Irvine |first=Chris |date=September 29, 2008 |title=Creationist Adnan Oktar offers trillion-pound prize for fossil proof of evolution |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian0104&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 7, 2004 |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/conferences/story/0,,1117752,00.html |title=Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools |newspaper=The Guardian |type=Conferences |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, unlike orthodox Muslims, Ahmadis believe that humans have gradually evolved from different species. Ahmadis regard [[Adam]] as being the first Prophet of God{{spaced ndash}}as opposed to him being the first man on Earth.&lt;ref name="Masood_Ch13" /&gt; Rather than wholly adopting the theory of natural selection, Ahmadis promote the idea of a "guided evolution," viewing each stage of the evolutionary process as having been selectively woven by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Guided_evolution_and_punctuated_equilibrium-20081104MN.pdf |title=Guided Evolution: Proof From Punctuated Equilibrium |last1=Lahaye |first1=Ataul Wahid |last2=Shah |first2=Zia H. |website=Al Islam |publisher=[[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] |location=London |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has stated in his magnum opus ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' (1998) that evolution did occur but only through God being the One who brings it about.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on evolution}}
For [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] who seek to reconcile discrepancies between science and the creation myths in the Bible, the notion that science and the Bible should even be reconciled through traditional scientific means is questioned. To these groups, science is as true as the [[Torah]] and if there seems to be a problem, [[Epistemology|epistemological]] limits are to blame for apparently irreconcilable points. They point to discrepancies between what is expected and what actually is to demonstrate that things are not always as they appear. They note that even the root word for "world" in the [[Hebrew language]]—עולם (Olam)—means hidden—נעלם (Neh-Eh-Lahm). Just as they know from the Torah that God created man and trees and the light on its way from the stars in their observed state, so too can they know that the world was created in its over the six days of Creation that reflects progression to its currently-observed state, with the understanding that physical ways to verify this may eventually be identified. This knowledge has been advanced by Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]], former philosophy professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Also, relatively old [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources from well before the scientifically apparent age of the universe was first determined are in close concord with modern scientific estimates of the age of the universe, according to Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], and based on Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the first-century [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]]. Many kabbalists accepted the teachings of the [[Sefer HaTemunah]], including the medieval Jewish scholar [[Nahmanides]], his close student [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre]], and [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]]. Other parallels are derived, among other sources, from Nahmanides, who expounds that there was a [[Neanderthal]]-like species with which Adam mated (he did this long before Neanderthals had even been discovered scientifically).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aviezer 1990|Aviezer 1990]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carmell &amp; Domb 1976|Carmell &amp; Domb 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schroeder 1998|Schroeder 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tigay |first=Jeffrey H. |date=Winter 1987–1988 |title=Genesis, Science, and 'Scientific Creationism' |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jtigay/sci.htm |journal=[[Conservative Judaism (journal)|Conservative Judaism]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=20–27 |issn=0010-6542 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism]] does not take the Torah as a literal text, but rather as a symbolic or open-ended work.

Some contemporary writers such as Rabbi Gedalyah Nadel have sought to reconcile the discrepancy between the account in the Torah, and scientific findings by arguing that each day referred to in the Bible was not 24 hours, but billions of years long.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the Earth was created a few thousand years ago, but was deliberately made to look as if it was five billion years old, e.g. by being created with ready made fossils. The best known exponent of this approach being Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;   Others state that although the world was physically created in six 24 hour days, the Torah accounts can be interpreted to mean that there was a period of billions of years before the six days of creation.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, pp. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{main|Bahai Faith and science#Creation}}
In the creation myth taught by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]] founder, the universe has "neither beginning nor ending," and that the component elements of the material world have always existed and will always exist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982|`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982]], [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-79.html#gr8 p. 220]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to evolution and the origin of human beings, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] gave extensive comments on the subject when he addressed western audiences in the beginning of the 20th century. Transcripts of these comments can be found in ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', ''[[Paris Talks]]'' and ''The Promulgation of Universal Peace''. `Abdu'l-Bahá described the human species as having evolved from a primitive form to modern man, but that the capacity to form human intelligence was always in existence.

Most vocal literalist creationists are from the US, and strict creationist views are much less common in other developed countries. According to a study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', a survey of the US, Turkey, [[Japan]] and Europe showed that public acceptance of evolution is most prevalent in Iceland, Denmark and Sweden at 80% of the population.&lt;ref name="Science survey" /&gt; There seems to be no significant correlation between believing in evolution and understanding evolutionary science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culturalcognition.net/blog/2014/5/24/weekend-update-youd-have-to-be-science-illiterate-to-think-b.html |title=Weekend update: You'd have to be science illiterate to think 'belief in evolution' measures science literacy |last=Kahan |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Kahan |date=May 24, 2014 |website=[[Cultural cognition#Cultural cognition project at Yale Law School|Cultural Cognition Project]] |publisher=[[Yale Law School]] |location=New Haven, CT |type=Blog |accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shtulman |first=Andrew |date=March 2006 |title=Qualitative differences between naïve and scientific theories of evolution |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028505000745 |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=170–94 |doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2005.10.001 |pmid=16337619 |issn=0010-0285 |accessdate=2015-03-23|bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
A 2009 [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] poll, showed that almost a quarter of Australians believe "the biblical account of human origins." Forty-two percent believe in a "wholly scientific" explanation for the origins of life, while 32 percent believe in an evolutionary process "guided by God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Maley |first=Jacqueline |date=December 19, 2009 |title=God is still tops but angels rate well |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/god-is-still-tops-but-angels-rate-well-20091218-l5v9.html |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne, Australia |publisher=Fairfax Media |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In Europe, literalist creationism is more widely rejected, though regular opinion polls are not available. Most people accept that evolution is the most widely accepted scientific theory as taught in most schools. In countries with a Roman Catholic majority, [[Catholic Church and evolution|papal acceptance of evolutionary creationism]] as worthy of study has essentially ended debate on the matter for many people.

In the UK, a 2006 poll on the "origin and development of life", asked participants to choose between three different perspectives on the origin of life: 22% chose creationism, 17% opted for intelligent design, 48% selected evolutionary theory, and the rest did not know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 26, 2006 |title=Britons unconvinced on evolution |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4648598.stm |work=BBC News |location=London |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=262 |title=BBC Survey On The Origins Of Life |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 30, 2006 |website=[[Ipsos MORI]] |publisher=Ipsos MORI |location=London |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent 2010 [[YouGov]] poll on the correct explanation for the origin of humans found that 9% opted for creationism, 12% intelligent design, 65% evolutionary theory and 13% didn't know.&lt;ref name="YouGov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdn.yougov.com/today_uk_import/YG-Archives-Pol-Prospect-Evolution-181110.pdf |title=The origin of humans |date=November 20, 2010 |website=YouGov Global |publisher=[[YouGov|YouGov Plc]] |location=London |type=Prospect Survey Results |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, head of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], views the idea of teaching creationism in schools as a mistake.&lt;ref name="Archbishop_2006"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bates |first=Stephen |date=March 20, 2006 |title=Archbishop: stop teaching creationism |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/mar/21/religion.topstories3 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland saw a major controversy over creationism in 2006, when the Deputy Education Minister, [[Mirosław Orzechowski]], denounced evolution as "one of many lies" taught in Polish schools. His superior, Minister of Education [[Roman Giertych]], has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, "as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory." Giertych's father, [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Maciej Giertych]], has opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that [[dinosaur]]s and humans co-existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 18, 2006 |title=And finally... |url=http://www.wbj.pl/?command=article&amp;id=35336&amp;type=wbj |newspaper=[[Warsaw Business Journal]] |location=Warsaw, Poland |publisher=Valkea Media |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
In the US, creationism has become centered in the political controversy over [[Creation and evolution in public education#United States|creation and evolution in public education]], and whether teaching creationism in science classes conflicts with the separation of church and state. Currently, the controversy comes in the form of whether advocates of the intelligent design movement who wish to "[[Teach the Controversy]]" in science classes have conflated [[Relationship between religion and science|science with religion]].&lt;ref name="kitz" /&gt;

[[People for the American Way]] polled 1500 North Americans about the teaching of evolution and creationism in November and December 1999. They found that most North Americans were not familiar with Creationism, and most North Americans had heard of evolution, but many did not fully understand the basics of the theory. The main findings were:

In such political contexts, creationists argue that their particular religiously based origin belief is superior to those of other [[belief system]]s, in particular those made through secular or scientific rationale.

Most Christians disagree with the teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring and Proclaiming the Apostles' Creed |first1=Roger |last1=van Harn |first2=David F. |last2=Ford |first3=Colin E. |last3=Gunton |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8192-8116-6 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ Extract of page 44]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism |first1=Aron |last1=Ra |publisher=Pitchstone Publishing |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-63431-079-6 |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182 Extract of page 182]&lt;/ref&gt; Several religious organizations, among them the [[Catholic Church]], hold that their faith does not conflict with the scientific consensus regarding evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion |title=Statements from Religious Organizations |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2011-03-10|date=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clergy Letter Project]], which has collected more than 13,000 signatures, is an "endeavor designed to demonstrate that religion and science can be compatible."

In his 2002 article "Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem," George Murphy argues against the view that life on Earth, in all its forms, is direct evidence of God's act of creation (Murphy quotes [[Phillip E. Johnson]]'s claim that he is speaking "of a God who acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence."). Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian understanding of God as "the one revealed in the cross and resurrection of Christ." The basis of this theology is [[Isaiah]] 45:15, "Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour."

Murphy observes that the execution of a Jewish carpenter by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities is in and of itself an ordinary event and did not require [[Miracle|divine action]]. On the contrary, for the crucifixion to occur, God had to limit or "empty" himself. It was for this reason that [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote, in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:5-8:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Murphy concludes that,&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as the Son of God limited himself by taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine action in the world to be in accord with rational laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|''methodological'' naturalism]], meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a [[Metaphysical naturalism|''metaphysical'' naturalism]], which proposes that nature is all that there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=George L. |year=2002 |title=Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem |url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/nrcse/IDTHG.html |journal=Covalence: The Bulletin of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Alliance for Faith, Science and Technology |volume=IV |issue=2 |oclc=52753579 |accessdate=2014-03-31}} Reprinted with permission.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit priest [[George Coyne]] has stated that is "unfortunate that, especially here in America, creationism has come to mean...some literal interpretation of Genesis." He argues that "...Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in belief that everything depends on God, or better, all is a gift from God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Brendan|title=From Big Bang to Big Mystery: Human Origins in the Light of Creation and Evolution|date=2012|publisher=New City Press of the Focolare|isbn=978-1565484337|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching of creationism===
Other Christians have expressed qualms about teaching creationism. In March 2006, then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the leader of the world's Anglicans, stated his discomfort about teaching creationism, saying that creationism was "a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories." He also said: "My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it." The views of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]{{snd}}a major American-based branch of the Anglican Communion{{snd}}on teaching creationism resemble those of Williams.&lt;ref name="Archbishop_2006" /&gt;

The National Science Teachers Association is opposed to teaching creationism as a science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSTA Position Statement: The Teaching of Evolution |publisher=National Science Teachers Association | year=2013 |url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/evolution.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the Association for Science Teacher Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ASTE Position Statement on Teaching Biological Evolution |year=2015 |publisher=Association for Science Teacher Education |url=https://theaste.org/about/aste-position-statement-on-teaching-biological-evolution/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Association of Biology Teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NABT Position Statement on Teaching Evolution |publisher=National Association of Biology Teachers |year=2011 |url=http://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/?p=92 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916020337/http://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/?p=92 |archivedate=2015-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Anthropological Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement on Evolution and Creationism |publisher=American Anthropological Association |year=2000 |url=http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2599}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Geosciences Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Geological Institute Position on Teaching Evolution |publisher=American Geoscience Institute |year=2000 |url=http://www.agiweb.org/gapac/evolution_statement.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Geological Society of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2012 |title=Position Statement: Teaching Evolution |publisher=Geological Society of America |url=http://www.geosociety.org/positions/position1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Geophysical Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AGU Position Statement on Teaching Creationism as Science |publisher=American Geophysical Institute |year=1998 |url=http://www.rbsp.info/rbs/CLONE/debate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other professional teaching and scientific societies.

In April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K‐12 Public Schools in the United States'', which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as "Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning." However, they, as well as other "worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |date=July 23, 2010 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randy Moore and Sehoya Cotner, from the biology program at the [[University of Minnesota]], reflect on the relevance of teaching creationism in the article "The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism?" They conclude that "Despite decades of science education reform, numerous legal decisions declaring the teaching of creationism in public-school science classes to be unconstitutional, overwhelming evidence supporting evolution, and the many denunciations of creationism as nonscientific by professional scientific societies, creationism remains popular throughout the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Randy |last2=Cotner |first2=Sehoya |date=May 2009 |title=The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism? |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=429–35 |doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.5.10 |issn=0006-3568 |jstor=25502451|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific criticism===
{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
Science is a system of knowledge based on observation, empirical evidence, and the development of theories that yield testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is often based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=12 p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Some creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all. Therefore, these can neither be confirmed nor disproved by scientists.&lt;ref name="SEaC"&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=10 p. 10], "In science, explanations must be based on naturally occurring phenomena. Natural causes are, in principle, reproducible and therefore can be checked independently by others. If explanations are based on purported forces that are outside of nature, scientists have no way of either confirming or disproving those explanations."&lt;/ref&gt; However, many creationist beliefs can be framed as testable predictions about phenomena such as the age of the Earth, its [[geological history of Earth|geological history]] and the origins, [[biogeography|distributions]] and [[Phylogenetics|relationships]] of living organisms found on it. [[History of science|Early science]] incorporated elements of these beliefs, but as science developed these beliefs were gradually [[Falsifiability|falsified]] and were replaced with understandings based on accumulated and reproducible evidence that often allows the accurate prediction of future results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html |title=An Index to Creationist Claims |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |year=2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Futuyma 2005|Futuyma 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref name="RoA"&gt;[[#Gould 1999|Gould 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider science and religion to be two compatible and complementary fields, with authorities in distinct areas of human experience, so-called [[non-overlapping magisteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=March 1997 |title=Nonoverlapping Magisteria |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |volume=106 |pages=16–22 |issue=3 |issn=0028-0712 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also held by many theologians, who believe that [[Unmoved mover|ultimate origins]] and [[meaning of life|meaning]] are addressed by religion, but favor verifiable scientific explanations of natural phenomena over those of creationist beliefs. Other scientists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dawkins 2006|Dawkins 2006]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; reject the non-overlapping magisteria and argue that, in disproving literal interpretations of creationists, the scientific method also undermines religious texts as a source of truth. Irrespective of this diversity in viewpoints, since creationist beliefs are not supported by empirical evidence, the scientific consensus is that any attempt to teach creationism as science should be rejected.&lt;ref name="RoyalSociety_2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|title=Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design|date=April 11, 2006|website=[[Royal Society]]|publisher=Royal Society|location=London|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602213726/http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|archivedate=2008-06-02|accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism |title=Ten Major Court Cases about Evolution and Creationism |last1=Matsumura |first1=Molleen |last2=Mead |first2=Louise |date=February 14, 2001 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2008-11-04}} Updated 2007-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |title=Ann Coulter: No evidence for evolution? |last=Myers |first=PZ |authorlink=PZ Myers |date=June 18, 2006 |website=[[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]] |publisher=[[ScienceBlogs|ScienceBlogs LLC]] |type=Blog |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809011055/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |archivedate=August 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cropping''' is the removal of a person's [[ear]]s as an act of physical punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stronghold Knights|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was performed along with the [[pillory]]ing or immobilisation in the [[stocks]],&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{harvtxt|Warner|2005|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corlew163"&gt;{{harvtxt|Corlew|Folmsbee|Mitchell|1990|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes alongside punishments such as [[human branding#As punishment|branding]] or fines.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;  The punishment is described in [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]''.&lt;ref name="Hugo"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hugo|1831|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Cropping sometimes occurred as a standalone punishment (such as in the case of [[William Prynne]] for [[seditious libel]]),&lt;ref name="DuCane"&gt;{{harvtxt|Du Cane|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; where criminals' ears would be cut off with a [[blade]].  Cropping was also a secondary punishment to having criminals' ears nailed to the pillory (with the intention that their body movements would tear them off).&lt;ref name="DuCane" /&gt;  In 1538 [[Thomas Barrie]] spent a whole day with his ears nailed to the pillory in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], England, before having them cut off to release him.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ford|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cropping is mentioned in ancient [[Assyrian law]] and the Babylonian [[Code of Hammurabi]].

Cropping was quite rare in [[England]], but more common in [[Guernsey]].&lt;ref name="Ogier14"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ogier|1996|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable cases of cropping in England include [[Thomas Barrie]] in 1538, who reputedly died from [[Acute stress reaction|shock]] following his cropping,&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; and [[John Bastwick]], [[William Prynne]], and [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]] in 1637.&lt;ref name="Dearmer"&gt;{{harvtxt|Dearmer|2009|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, Henry VIII amended the laws on [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] to decree that first offences would be punished with three days in the stocks, second offences with cropping, and third offences with [[hanging]].&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{harvtxt|Adams|1998|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Records show that croppings took place in the [[United States]] in the late 18th century, particularly in states such as [[Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt; and [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Corlew163" /&gt;
 
From page 153 of Reverend Samuel Peters’, General History of Connecticut, during the colonial period we have this account:

“Newhaven is celebrated for giving the name of “Pumpkin Heads” to all of New Englanders. It originated from the “Blue Laws” which enjoined every male to have his hair cut round by a cap. When caps are not to be had, they substituted a hard shell of a pumpkin, which being put on the head every Saturday, the hair is cut by the shell all round the head…….. and fourthly, such persons as have lost their ears for heresy, and other wickedness, cannot conceal their misfortune and disgrace.”

In [[Rhode Island]], cropping was a punishment for crimes such as [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting money]], [[perjury]], and "burning houses, barns, and outbuildings" (but not amounting to [[arson]]).&lt;ref name="PDS"&gt;{{harvtxt|Prison Discipline Society|1826|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cropping (along with the pillory and stocks) was abolished in Tennessee in 1829, with abolition further afield starting from approximately 1839.&lt;ref name="Kellaway"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kellaway|2003|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13393">The '''Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace''' was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on September 13, 1999. This occurred after ten months of negotiations in the context of preparations for the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]].

UN resolution A/53/243..&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a53r243a.htm UN resolution A/53/243&lt;/ref&gt; called for the programme of action to include eight action areas:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Culture of peace through education
* Sustainable economic and social development
* Respect for all human rights
* Equality between women and men
* Democratic participation
* Understanding, tolerance and solidarity
* Participatory communication and the free flow of information and knowledge
* International peace and security
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As explained by [[UNESCO]], "each of these areas of action have been priorities of the United Nations since its foundation; what is new is their linkage through the culture of peace and non-violence into a single coherent concept. Linkages have often been made (for example, democracy, development and peace; equality between women and men with development and peace, and so forth). This is the first time, however, that all these areas are interlinked so that the sum of their complementarities and synergies can be developed."&lt;ref&gt;http://undocs.org/en/A/55/377 International Decade for a Culture of Peace and
Non-Violence for the Children of the World: Report of the Secretary-General&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of Peace== 

United Nations consideration of the culture of peace began in 1992 with the adoption by [[UNESCO]] of a Culture of Peace Programme.  As the programme developed during the following decade, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] began requesting information from UNESCO about its progress.  The General Assembly then declared the Year 2000 as the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]] and requested UNESCO to submit a draft Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which the General Assembly adopted on September 13, 1999.  The General Assembly also declared the Decade 2001-2010 as the [[International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World|International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

Since his retirement from UNESCO where he had promoted the culture of peace in his capacity as Director-General, [[Federico Mayor]] has coordinated the Fundacion Cultura de Paz.  Since his retirement from UNESCO where he chaired the task force for the International Year for the Culture of Peace, [[David Adams (peace activist)|David Adams]] has coordinated the [[Culture of Peace News Network]] which was established for the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]].

== United Nations Resolution A/53/243 ==

After stating that "the creation of the United Nations system itself, based upon universally shared values and goals, has been a major act towards transformation from a culture of war and violence to a culture of peace and non-violence", the UN General Assembly, in its resolution 52/13 of 20 November 1997, requested UNESCO to submit to its next session a draft declaration and programme of action on a culture of peace&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a52r13.htm Resolution A/52/13&lt;/ref&gt;.  UNESCO supplied the requested document &lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001130/113034e.pdf Draft Declaration and Programme of Action submitted by UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;which was then taken under consideration by the General Assembly, beginning in December 1998.  The document encountered resistance and the situation at first was not encouraging&lt;ref&gt;http://culture-of-peace.info/history/Adoption.html Adoption of Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;. One reason was the fact that the draft declaration referred to a "human right to peace," a concept vigorously opposed by the Great Powers&lt;ref&gt;http://roche.apirg.org/public_html/writings/documents/nuclear/LiuCentrePresentation.pdf 
The Human Right to Peace&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The programme of action also calls for a global movement for a culture of peace and the sharing of information among "actors on their initiatives in this regard".

Addressing the General Assembly, Ambassador [[Anwarul Karim Chowdhury]] of Bangladesh, who had chaired the informal consultation process, called it a unique and universal document: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I believe that this document is unique in more than one way. It is a universal document in the real sense, transcending boundaries, cultures, societies and nations. Unlike many other General Assembly documents, this document is action-oriented and encourages actions at all levels, be they at the level of the individual, the community, the nation or the region, or at the global and international levels.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/53/PV.107 United Nations General Assembly Official Records, Fifty-third Session, 107th plenary meeting&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Manifesto 2000 for a culture of peace and nonviolence ==

The Manifesto was drafted for the International Year for the Culture of Peace by a group of Nobel Peace Prize winners in order to translate the resolutions of the United Nations into everyday language addressed to all people.&lt;ref&gt;http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/manifeste/uk_pour_en_savoir_plus.htm UNESCO Information about the Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifesto asked individuals to pledge "in my daily life, in my family, my work, my community, my country and my region, to"&lt;ref&gt;http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/manifeste/uk_manifeste.htm Manifesto text&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Respect the life and dignity of each human being without discrimination or prejudice;
* Practise active nonviolence, rejecting violence in all its forms: physical, sexual, psychological, economic and social, in particular towards the most deprived and vulnerable such as children and adolescents;
* Share my time and material resources in a spirit of generosity to put an end to exclusion, injustice and political and economic oppression;
* Defend freedom of expression and cultural diversity, giving preference always to dialogue and listening without engaging in fanaticism, defamation and the rejection of others;
* Promote consumer behaviour that is responsible and development practices that respect all forms of life and preserve the balance of nature on the planet;
* Contribute to the development of my community, with the full participation of women and respect for democratic principles, in order to create together new forms of solidarity;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Manifesto was translated into more than 50 languages and personally signed by many
Heads of State and Government.  It was diffused throughout the world and individuals were invited to sign and commit themselves to practise its principles in everyday life. As a result, by the end of the International Year, it had been signed by over 74 million individuals, including by more than 1 million each from Brazil, Colombia, India, Japan, Kenya, Nepal and Republic of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001223/122350e.pdf Report on the Progress Made by Unesco in the Implementation of the Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace and on Cooperation with the United Nations System in this Field &lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed data entries for the 20 countries with more than 100,000 signatures are shown on the UNESCO website for the Year&lt;ref&gt;http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/uk_sum_monde.htm World Information Board&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO Culture of Peace Programme ==

The culture of peace resolution and the Manifesto 2000 campaign were the culmination of a decade-long Culture of Peace Programme at UNESCO.  The Programme was adopted by the UNESCO Executive Board in the fall of 1992, in order to ″heal the social wounds of war by local activities of reconciliation and co-operation in countries where Security Council peace-keeping operations are already being implemented or may be anticipated because of developing violence.″&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000938/093829eo.pdf Co-operation to promote a culture of peace&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major test of the Culture of Peace Programme was in El Salvador&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000958/095819eo.pdf Action programme to promote a culture of peace&lt;/ref&gt; using the methodology of "cross-conflict participation" by which the reconciliation of those who had been fighting against each other in the past was promoted by their joint participation in the planning and implementation of projects designed to benefit all concerned in fields such as education, culture, communication and science&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol1_2/UNESCO.htm The UNESCO culture of peace programme in El Salvador: An initial report&lt;/ref&gt;

The national culture of peace programmes did not receive the needed political and financial support from the UNESCO Member States, and were all discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;http://culture-of-peace.info/history/page10.html Early History of the Culture of Peace: National Culture of Peace Projects (1993-1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the most important year in the development of UNESCO/UN culture of peace initiative, three separate initiatives converged: the proclamation of the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]] (2000)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a52r15.htm Proclamation of the year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;; the proposal for the UN Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace (see above); and the initiative of the Nobel Peace Laureates "Campaign for the Children of the World"&lt;ref&gt; https://www.un.org/press/en/1997/19970904.unesco4.sep.html Press conference on appeal for launching decade for culture of non-violence&lt;/ref&gt; that would eventually become the [[International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World|International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]] (2001-2010).

In recent years UNESCO has continued to actively promote the culture of peace in Africa with programs co-ordinated by its field office in Gabon and in cooperation with governments and foundations in Angola and Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref&gt;http://cpnn-world.org/new/?p=11285 Will UNESCO once again play a role in the culture of peace?&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Nations High-Level Meetings on the Culture of Peace ==

Beginning in 2012 the President of the United Nations General Assembly has convened in September a High-Level Forum on the Culture of Peace.  The themes of the 2012 Forum were education, youth outreach, and women’s empowerment. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened the Forum, saying “When we look at the suffering in our world, we know how urgently we need a culture of peace.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/press/en/2012/ga11281.doc.htm General Assembly High-Level Forum on Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, similar High-Level Forums have been held at United Nations Headquarters each September.

==  Fundación Cultura de Paz ==

On his retirement as Director-General of UNESCO, Federico Mayor established the Fundación Cultura de Paz to continue the work he had supervised while at UNESCO.  The Fundación has sponsored many events and projects over the years, including the midterm&lt;ref&gt; http://www.fund-culturadepaz.org/spa/INFORME_CULTURA_DE_PAZ/INFORME/InformeENG.pdf World Report on the Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt; and final &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fund-culturadepaz.org/spa/DOCUMENTOS/Report_on_the_Decade_for_a_Culture_of_Peace.pdf Final civil society report on the Decade&lt;/ref&gt; reports for the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. Mayor is frequently invited to address audiences around the world on the subject of the culture of peace &lt;ref&gt; http://fund-culturadepaz.org/eng/07/cent07ENG.htm News&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fundación maintains an updated History of the Culture of Peace which contains references to hundreds of documents and events that have followed up the recommendations of the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fund-culturadepaz.org/doc/HistoryCultureofPeace.pdf History of the Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture of Peace News Network ==

The [[Culture of Peace News Network]], begun at UNESCO as part of the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]], has been continued as a source of news of events that promote the culture of peace.  It is updated more or less daily with articles from around the world promoting at least one of the eight program areas of the culture of peace, and a review of the news is sent out as a bulletin each month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/the-invisible-yet-existent-culture-of-peace/ The Invisible Yet Existent Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''disposition''' is a quality of character, a [[habit (psychology)|habit]], a preparation, a state of readiness, or a tendency to act in a specified way that may be learned.

The terms [[dispositional belief]] and [[occurrent belief]] refer, in the former case, to a [[belief]] that is held in the [[mind]] but not currently being considered, and in the latter case, to a belief that is currently being considered by the mind.

In [[Bourdieu]]'s theory of fields, dispositions are the natural tendencies of each individual to take on a specific position in any field. There is no strict determinism through one's dispositions. The ''habitus'' is the choice of positions according to one's dispositions. However, in retrospect a space of possibles can always be observed.

A disposition is not a process or event in some duration in time, but rather the state, preparation, or tendency of a structure "in waiting".  In the field of possibilities its actual triggering has a statistical value.

== In metaphysics ==
The debate about dispositions in [[metaphysics]] attempts to understand the fundamental nature of properties, including how they relate to [[Law of nature (science)|laws of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/952728282|title=Dispositions and causal powers|last=Bruno.|first=Kistler, Max. Gnassounou,|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315577616|oclc=952728282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial question asks if dispositions are real. [[Realism, Nominalism, Conceptualism|Realism]] about dispositions, or dispositionalism, argues that dispositions are causally efficacious properties inherent to objects that are sufficient to produce change. Consider fragility. If a glass is suitably struck, it will break. Fragility is a property of the glass that accounts for this breaking. Paradigmatic examples of dispositional properties include fragility, solubility, and flammability. Dispositionalism maintains that even paradigmatic examples of what appears to be qualitative such as squareness has causal powers (for instance - when combined with the property of hardness - to make a square impression in soft wax).&lt;ref&gt;[Shoemaker, S., 1980, ‘Causality and Properties’, in P. van Inwagen (ed.), Time and Cause: Essays Presented to Richard Taylor, Dordrecht: Reidel, 109–135.]&lt;/ref&gt; This view is historically argued for by [[Aristotle]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Contemporary proponents include [[Sydney Shoemaker]], [[Ullin Place|U.T Place]], [[Stephen Mumford]], Alexander Bird, [[George Molnar (philosopher)|George Molnar]], Brian Ellis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Dispositions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others answer that dispositions are not real properties. [[Anti-realism]] about dispositions, or categoricalism, argues that dispositions are ontologically derivative of the interaction categorical (or qualitative) properties and laws. Accordingly calling a glass fragile, is useful shorthand for describing the potential interactions of its microstructure (a categorical property) and the laws of nature; dispositions are not additional elements of being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dispositions Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Dispositions]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the microstructure and laws are enough to explain fragility, there is no causal role for a dispositional property, here fragility, to play. This view is historically argued for by [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], [[David Hume|Hume]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]]. Contemporary proponents, including [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], and [[Jonathan Schaffer]], continue in a neo-Humaen, empiricist tradition that argues for categoricalism on the assumption that there are no necessary connections between distinct existences.&lt;ref&gt;[Hume, D. (1748)An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Oxford: ClarendonPress 1975, ed. L.A. Selby-Bigge and P.H. Nidditch.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle ground views are possible. The most notable is the Limit (or Identity) View defended by [[Charles B. Martin]] and [[John Heil]]. According to this view, dispositional and categorical - or as Martin prefers: "qualitative," because categorical seems to be misleading - predicates are different ways of identifying one and the same property.[6] Additionally, the properties lies on a spectrum in which it could approach either limit; however, it can never reach either end because those concepts are unrealisable. Ontologically, however, there is no real difference between the two. Fragility, for example, is both a real disposition of glass to break upon being struck and an abstraction from the underlying molecular structure. Squareness, to take another example, is both a quality of having four sides of equal length that meet at equal angles and an abstraction from the fact this property interacts with its environment to leave square impressions on soft wax (when combined with the property ‘hardness’).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/33898477|title=Dispositions : a debate|last=1926-2014.|first=Armstrong, D. M. (David Malet),|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415144329|oclc=33898477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, a [[Disposition (law)|disposition]] is a civil or criminal hearing where a case can be resolved.

== In educational research ==
In educational research, a learning disposition are characteristics or attitudes to learning. These may be learned. Some examples are taking responsibility, grit and persistence when faced with problems.

=== In the Catholic Church ===
In Catholic thought, "disposition" has two meanings. Firstly, it may refer to a deliberately practised [[habit]] of behaving in a certain way, for example, "a virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good."&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a7.htm par. 1803]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, it may refer to a state of a person that is required for reception of a [[sacrament]], for example, a disposition of genuine repentance is required for the forgiveness of sins in [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Dictionary'', [https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=36182 Sacramental dispositions].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exclusive or''' or '''exclusive disjunction''' is a [[Logical connective|logical operation]] that outputs true only when inputs differ (one is true, the other is false).&lt;ref name=wolfram&gt;{{cite web|last1=Germundsson|first1=Roger|last2=Weisstein|first2=Eric|title=XOR|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/XOR.html|website=[[MathWorld]]|publisher=[[Wolfram Research]]|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Table of logic symbols|symbolized]] by the prefix operator '''J'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|volume=10|editor-first=Edward|editor-last=Craig|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1998|isbn=9780415073103|page=496|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP9O6OM4iOgC&amp;pg=PA496}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[infix]] operators '''XOR''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|s|_|ˈ|ɔr}}), '''EOR''', '''EXOR''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;⊻&lt;/span&gt;''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;⩒&lt;/span&gt;''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;⩛&lt;/span&gt;''', '''&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;⊕&lt;/span&gt;''', &lt;span style="font-size:150%;"&gt;↮&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="font-size:150%;"&gt;'''&amp;#8802;'''&lt;/span&gt;. The [[negation]] of XOR is [[logical biconditional]], which outputs true only when both inputs are the same.

It gains the name "exclusive or" because the meaning of "or" is ambiguous when both [[operand]]s are true; the exclusive or operator ''excludes'' that case. This is sometimes thought of as "one or the other but not both". This could be written as "A or B, but not, A and B".

More generally, XOR is true only when an odd number of inputs are true. A chain of XORs—''a'' XOR ''b'' XOR ''c'' XOR ''d'' (and so on)—is true whenever an odd number of the inputs are true and is false whenever an even number of inputs are true.

==Truth table==
[[File:Multigrade operator XOR.svg|thumb|220px|Arguments on the left combined by XOR. This is a binary [[Walsh matrix]] (cf. [[Hadamard code]]).]]
The [[truth table]] of A XOR B shows that it outputs true whenever the inputs differ:

* 0, false
* 1, true

==Equivalences, elimination, and introduction==
Exclusive disjunction essentially means 'either one, but not both nor none'. In other words, the statement is true [[if and only if]] one is true and the other is false. For example, if two horses are racing, then one of the two will win the race, but not both of them. The exclusive disjunction &lt;math&gt;p \oplus q&lt;/math&gt;, also denoted by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:120%;"&gt;'''⩛'''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{J}pq&lt;/math&gt;, can be expressed in terms of the [[logical conjunction]] ("logical and", &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;), the [[disjunction]] ("logical or", &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;), and the [[negation]] (&lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;) as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) \land  \lnot (p \land q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The exclusive disjunction &lt;math&gt;p \oplus q&lt;/math&gt; can also be expressed in the following way:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \land \lnot q) \lor (\lnot p \land q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This representation of XOR may be found useful when constructing a circuit or network, because it has only one &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; operation and small number of &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; operations. A proof of this identity is given below:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \land \lnot q) &amp; \lor &amp; (\lnot p \land q) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; ((p \land \lnot q) \lor \lnot p) &amp; \land &amp; ((p \land \lnot q) \lor q) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; ((p \lor \lnot p) \land (\lnot q \lor \lnot p)) &amp; \land &amp; ((p \lor q) \land (\lnot q \lor q)) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; (\lnot p \lor \lnot q) &amp; \land &amp; (p \lor q) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; \lnot (p \land q) &amp; \land &amp; (p \lor q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

It is sometimes useful to write &lt;math&gt;p \oplus q&lt;/math&gt; in the following way:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; \lnot ((p \land q) \lor (\lnot p \land \lnot q))
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
or:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) \land (\lnot p \lor \lnot q)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This equivalence can be established by applying [[De Morgan's laws]] twice to the fourth line of the above proof.

The exclusive or is also equivalent to the negation of a [[logical biconditional]], by the rules of material implication (a [[material conditional]] is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of its [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and its consequence) and [[If and only if|material equivalence]].

In summary, we have, in mathematical and in engineering notation:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  p \oplus q &amp; = &amp; (p \land \lnot q) &amp; \lor &amp; (\lnot p \land q) &amp; = &amp; p\overline{q} + \overline{p}q \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) &amp; \land &amp; (\lnot p \lor \lnot q) &amp; = &amp; (p + q)(\overline{p} + \overline{q}) \\[3pt]
             &amp; = &amp; (p \lor q) &amp; \land &amp; \lnot (p \land q) &amp; = &amp; (p + q)(\overline{pq})
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==Relation to modern algebra==

Although the [[Operation (mathematics)|operators]] &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; ([[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]) and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; ([[Logical disjunction|disjunction]]) are very useful in logic systems, they fail a more generalizable structure in the following way:

The systems &lt;math&gt;(\{T, F\}, \wedge)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\{T, F\}, \lor)&lt;/math&gt; are [[monoid]]s, but neither is a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. This unfortunately prevents the combination of these two systems into larger structures, such as a [[Ring (mathematics)|mathematical ring]].

However, the system using exclusive or &lt;math&gt;(\{T, F\}, \oplus)&lt;/math&gt; '''is''' an [[abelian group]].  The combination of operators &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; over elements &lt;math&gt;\{T, F\}&lt;/math&gt; produce the well-known [[field (mathematics)|field]] [[GF(2)|&lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;]].  This field can represent any logic obtainable with the system &lt;math&gt;(\land, \lor)&lt;/math&gt; and has the added benefit of the arsenal of algebraic analysis tools for fields.

More specifically, if one associates &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; with 0 and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with 1, one can interpret the logical "AND" operation as multiplication on &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt; and the "XOR" operation as addition on &lt;math&gt;F_2&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
   r = p \land q &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; r = p \cdot q \pmod 2 \\[3pt]
  r = p \oplus q &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; r = p + q \pmod 2 \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this basis to describe a boolean system is referred to as [[algebraic normal form]].

==Exclusive "or" in English==
{{essay|section|date=May 2013}}

The Oxford English Dictionary explains "either ... or" as follows:
{{quote|The primary function of ''either'', etc., is to emphasize the [[Mutually independent|perfect indifference]] of the two (or more) things or courses ... ; but a secondary function is to emphasize the mutual exclusiveness, {{=}} either of the two, but not both.&lt;ref&gt;or, conj.2 (adv.3) 2a ''Oxford English Dictionary'', second edition (1989). OED Online.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The exclusive-or explicitly states "one or the other, but not neither nor both." However, the mapping correspondence between formal [[Boolean algebra|Boolean]] operators and natural language conjunctions is far from simple or one-to-one, and has been studied for decades in [[linguistics]] and [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Following this kind of common-sense intuition about "or", it is sometimes argued that in many natural languages, [[English language|English]] included, the word "or" has an "exclusive" sense.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings quotes numerous authors saying that the word "or" has an exclusive sense. See Chapter 3, "The First Myth of 'Or'":&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |last=Jennings |first=R. E. |date=1994 |title=The Genealogy of Disjunction |url= |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The '''exclusive disjunction''' of a pair of propositions, (''p'', ''q''), is supposed to mean  that ''p'' is true or ''q'' is true, but not both.  For example, it might be argued that the normal intention of a statement like "You may have coffee, or you may have tea" is to stipulate that exactly one of the conditions can be true. Certainly under some circumstances a sentence like this example should be taken as forbidding the possibility of one's accepting both options. Even so, there is good reason to suppose that this sort of sentence is not disjunctive at all. If all we know about some disjunction is that it is true overall, we cannot be sure which of its disjuncts is true. For example, if a woman has been told that her friend is either at the snack bar or on the tennis court, she cannot validly infer that he is on the tennis court. But if her waiter tells her that she may have coffee or she may have tea, she can validly infer that she may have tea. Nothing classically thought of as a disjunction has this property. This is so even given that she might reasonably take her waiter as having denied her the possibility of having both coffee and tea.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In English, the construct "either ... or" is usually used to indicate exclusive or and "or" generally used for inclusive.{{dubious|date=January 2013}}  But in Spanish, the word "''o''" (or) can be used in the form "''p o q''" (exclusive) or the form "''o p o q''" (inclusive). Some may contend that any binary or other [[arity|n-ary]] exclusive "or" is true if and only if it has an odd number of true inputs (this is not, however, the only reasonable definition; for example, digital xor gates with multiple inputs typically do not use that definition), and that there is no conjunction in English that has this general property.  For example, Barrett and Stenner contend in the 1971 article "The Myth of the Exclusive 'Or{{' "}} (Mind, 80 (317), 116–121) that no author has produced an example of an English or-sentence that appears to be false because both of its inputs are true, and brush off or-sentences such as "The light bulb is either on or off" as reflecting particular facts about the world rather than the nature of the word "or".  However, the "[[barber paradox]]"—Everybody in town shaves himself or is shaved by the barber, who shaves the barber? -- would not be paradoxical if "or" could not be exclusive (although a purist could say that "either" is required in the statement of the paradox).

Whether these examples can be considered "natural language" is another question.{{dubious|date=January 2013}}  Certainly when one sees a menu stating "Lunch special: sandwich and soup or salad" (parsed as "sandwich and (soup or salad)" according to common usage in the restaurant trade), one would not expect to be permitted to order both soup and salad.  Nor would one expect to order neither soup nor salad, because that belies the nature of the "special", that ordering the two items together is cheaper than ordering them a la carte.  Similarly, a lunch special consisting of one meat, French fries or mashed potatoes and vegetable would consist of three items, only one of which would be a form of potato.  If one wanted to have meat and both kinds of potatoes, one would ask if it were possible to substitute a second order of potatoes for the vegetable.  And, one would not expect to be permitted to have both types of potato and vegetable, because the result would be a vegetable plate rather than a meat plate.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Alternative symbols==
The symbol used for exclusive disjunction varies from one field of application to the next, and even depends on the properties being emphasized in a given context of discussion.  In addition to the abbreviation "XOR", any of the following symbols may also be seen:
* '''&lt;samp&gt;+&lt;/samp&gt;''', a plus sign, which has the advantage that all of the ordinary algebraic properties of mathematical [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] can be used without further ado; but the plus sign is also used for inclusive disjunction in some notation systems; note that exclusive disjunction corresponds to [[addition]] [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2, which has the following addition table, clearly [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the one above:

If using [[binary numeral system|binary]] values for true (1) and false (0), then ''exclusive or'' works exactly like [[addition]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2.

==Computer science==
[[File:XOR ANSI Labelled.svg|thumb|right|114px|Traditional symbolic representation of an XOR [[logic gate]]]]

===Bitwise operation===
{{Main article|Bitwise operation}}
[[File:Z2^4; Cayley table; binary.svg|thumb|[[Nimber]] addition is the ''exclusive or'' of [[natural number|nonnegative integers]] in [[w:binary numeral system|binary]] representation. This is also the vector addition in &lt;math&gt;(\Z/2\Z)^4&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Exclusive disjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:
* 1 XOR 1 = 0
* 1 XOR 0 = 1
* 0 XOR 1 = 1
* 0 XOR 0 = 0
* {{n-ary|1110|2}} XOR {{n-ary|1001|2}} = {{n-ary|0111|2}} (this is equivalent to addition without [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]])

As noted above, since exclusive disjunction is identical to addition modulo 2, the bitwise exclusive disjunction of two ''n''-bit strings is identical to the standard vector of addition in the [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;(\Z/2\Z)^n&lt;/math&gt;.

In computer science, exclusive disjunction has several uses:
* It tells whether two bits are unequal.
* It is an optional bit-flipper (the deciding input chooses whether to invert the data input).
* It tells whether there is an [[Parity (mathematics)|odd]] number of 1&amp;nbsp;bits (&lt;math&gt;A \oplus B \oplus C \oplus D \oplus E&lt;/math&gt; is true [[If and only if|iff]] an odd number of the variables are true).

In logical circuits, a simple [[adder (electronics)|adder]] can be made with an [[XOR gate]] to add the numbers, and a series of AND, OR and NOT gates to create the carry output.

On some computer architectures, it is more efficient to store a zero in a register by XOR-ing the register with itself (bits XOR-ed with themselves are always zero) instead of loading and storing the value zero.

In simple threshold activated [[neural network]]s, modeling the XOR function requires a second layer because XOR is not a linearly separable function.

Exclusive-or is sometimes used as a simple mixing function in [[cryptography]], for example, with [[one-time pad]] or [[Feistel cipher|Feistel network]] systems.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Exclusive-or is also heavily used in block ciphers such as AES (Rijndael) or Serpent and in block cipher implementation (CBC, CFB, OFB or CTR).

Similarly, XOR can be used in generating [[entropy pool]]s for [[hardware random number generator]]s.  The XOR operation preserves randomness, meaning that a random bit XORed with a non-random bit will result in a random bit.  Multiple sources of potentially random data can be combined using XOR, and the unpredictability of the output is guaranteed to be at least as good as the best individual source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Robert B|title=Exclusive OR (XOR) and hardware random number generators|url=http://www.robertnz.net/pdf/xor2.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2013|date=28 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XOR is used in [[RAID]] 3–6 for creating parity information.  For example, RAID can "back up" bytes {{n-ary|10011100|2}} and {{n-ary|01101100|2}} from two (or more) hard drives by XORing the just mentioned bytes, resulting in ({{n-ary|11110000|2}}) and writing it to another drive.  Under this method, if any one of the three hard drives are lost, the lost byte can be re-created by XORing bytes from the remaining drives. For instance,  if the drive containing {{n-ary|01101100|2}} is lost, {{n-ary|10011100|2}} and {{n-ary|11110000|2}} can be XORed to recover the lost byte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nobel|first=Rickard|title=How RAID 5 actually works|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=26 July 2011|url=http://rickardnobel.se/how-raid5-works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

XOR is also used to detect an overflow in the result of a signed binary arithmetic operation. If the leftmost retained bit of the result is not the same as the infinite number of digits to the left, then that means overflow occurred. XORing those two bits will give a "1" if there is an overflow.

XOR can be used to swap two numeric variables in computers, using the [[XOR swap algorithm]]; however this is regarded as more of a curiosity and not encouraged in practice.

[[XOR linked list]]s leverage XOR properties in order to save space to represent [[doubly linked list]] data structures.

In [[computer graphics]], XOR-based drawing methods are often used to manage such items as [[bounding volume|bounding boxes]] and [[cursor (computers)|cursors]] on systems without [[alpha compositing|alpha channels]] or overlay planes.

==Encodings==
Apart from the ASCII codes, the operator is encoded at {{unichar|22BB|XOR|html=}} and {{unichar|2295|CIRCLED PLUS|html=}}, both in block [[Mathematical operators and symbols in Unicode#Mathematical Operators|Mathematical Operators]].

'''Fairness dilemmas''' arise when groups are faced with making decisions about how to share their resources, rewards, or payoffs. Since resources are limited, groups need to decide on fair ways of apportioning them out to their members. These fairness judgments are determined by procedural and distributive forms of social justice. When payouts do not occur according to these norms, conflicts arise.

==Procedural justice==
'''Procedural justice''' deals with the methods used in making the decisions about the allocation of the group's resources. Issues arise in this area when groups do not stick to their agreed upon methods for spreading out these resources. Conflicts will arise when the methods used are not consistent, open, or agreed upon by the group. The question asked by group members in this type of social justice is "did we make the decision in a fair way?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van den Bos |author2=Wilke |author3=Lind |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributive justice==
'''Distributive justice''' deals with how rewards and costs are distributed across the members of the group. Issues might arise in this area when certain members are favored and consistently given premium rewards or apportioned more resources than other members. An analogy here is cutting up a cake into equal pieces, but someone feels that they have unjustly received a smaller piece. The question asked by group members in this type of social justice is "did I get my fair share?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forsyth|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributive norms==
There are five types of distributive norms that help in maintaining distributive justice.
* '''Equity''': this is where members' outcomes are based on their inputs to the group effort. Someone who has given more time, money, energy, risk, or other input, should receive more than someone who has contributed less.
* '''Equality''': here, all group members receive an equal share of the profit, regardless of their amount of input.
* '''Power''': the individuals with higher status, authority, or control receive more in this circumstance. This is akin to managers having a higher salary than lower ranking members of a team of researchers.
* '''Need''': with this norm, people in the group with the greatest needs are provided with the necessary amount of resources required to meet those needs.
* '''Responsibility''': essentially, this is where those who have more share with those who have less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forsyth|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of fairness dilemmas==
The distribution of resources (most often money) is a very common cause of conflict in groups. Individuals tend to push for equality distribution norms when they have not contributed as much to the group. Smaller groups also tend to adopt equality norms, as do women. On the other hand, larger groups, as well as groups that significantly depend on one person's specialized input, prefer equitable distributions for the group.
'''Negative inequity''' is experienced by group members who feel that they are not receiving fair payment for what they have contributed. This often results in lower quality of work, a reduction in effort (perhaps caused by the [[Social loafing#"Sucker" effect/Aversion|sucker effect]]), or complete withdrawal from the group. In contrast, '''positive inequality''' is experienced when members receive too much for the amount of effort they've put forth. This can lead to the individual increasing their efforts to actually deserve what they are receiving, but more often it leads to conflict in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fortin|author2=Fellenz|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individuals tend to be motivated to maximize their personal rewards, so when they feel they are getting less than they deserve, they react negatively. On the flip side, when members feel like they are being rewarded for their input to the group, and they feel that the group is fairly allocating these rewards, they feel esteemed and proud. Members see a motive for group mates to give less rewards, while being less likely to believe they could be over-rewarded. The reaction in the former instance is shaped more by distributive justice, whereas the latter reaction is shaped more by procedural justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blader|author2=Tyler|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fractional Schrödinger equation''' is a fundamental equation of [[fractional quantum mechanics]]. It was discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] (1999) as a result of extending the [[Feynman path integral]], from the Brownian-like to Lévy-like quantum mechanical paths. The term ''fractional Schrödinger equation'' was coined by Nick Laskin.&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2000), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0375-9601(00)00201-2  Fractional Quantum Mechanics and Lévy Path Integrals. ''Physics Letters'' 268A, 298-304].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==

The fractional Schrödinger equation in the form originally obtained by [[Nick Laskin]] is:&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2002), [http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v66/i5/e056108 Fractional Schrödinger equation, ''Physical Review'' E66, 056108 7 pages]. '' (also available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206098)&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''r''' is the 3-dimensional [[position vector]], 
*''ħ'' is the reduced [[Planck constant]], 
*''ψ''('''r''', ''t'') is the [[wavefunction]], which is the quantum mechanical probability amplitude for the particle to have a given position '''r''' at any given time ''t'', 
*''V''('''r''', ''t'') is a [[potential energy]], 
*Δ = &amp;part;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&amp;part;'''r'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]].

Further,
*''D&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a scale constant with [[dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] [D&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;] = [energy]&lt;sup&gt;1 − ''α''&lt;/sup&gt;·[length]&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;[time]&lt;sup&gt;−''α''&lt;/sup&gt;, at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2,  ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =1/2''m'', where ''m'' is a particle mass,
*the operator (−''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''α''/2&lt;/sup&gt; is the 3-dimensional fractional quantum Riesz derivative defined by (see, Ref.[2]);

::&lt;math&gt;
(-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar
)^3}\int d^3pe^{i\frac{\mathbf{pr}}\hbar }|\mathbf{p}|^\alpha \varphi (
\mathbf{p},t),
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the wave functions in the [[position and momentum space]]s; &lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \varphi (\mathbf{p},t)&lt;/math&gt; are related each other by the 3-dimensional [[Fourier transform]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar )^3}\int d^3pe^{i \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}/\hbar}\varphi (\mathbf{p},t),\qquad \varphi (\mathbf{p},t)=\int d^3re^{-i
\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}/\hbar }\psi (\mathbf{r},t).
&lt;/math&gt;

The index ''α'' in the fractional Schrödinger equation is the Lévy index, 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2. Thus, the fractional Schrödinger equation includes a space [[derivative]] of fractional order ''α'' instead of the second order (''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) space derivative in the standard [[Schrödinger equation]]. Thus, the fractional Schrödinger equation is a [[fractional differential equation]] in accordance with modern terminology.&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Samko, A. A. Kilbas, and O. I. Marichev, Fractional
Integrals and Derivatives, Theory and Applications ~Gordon
and Breach, Amsterdam, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main point of the term ''fractional Schrödinger equation'' or a more general term [[fractional quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2000), [http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v62/i3/p3135_1 Fractional Quantum Mechanics, ''Physical Review'' E62, 3135-3145]. '' (also available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1769)&lt;/ref&gt; At ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 fractional Schrödinger equation becomes the well-known [[Schrödinger equation]].

The fractional Schrödinger equation has the following [[operator (physics)|operator]] form

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title=
|equation = &lt;math&gt;
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi (\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}=\hat{H}_\alpha
\psi (\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where the fractional Hamilton operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_\alpha &lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}_\alpha =D_\alpha (-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}+V(\mathbf{r},t). 
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Hamilton operator]], &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_\alpha &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the [[classical mechanics]] [[Hamiltonian function]] introduced by [[Nick Laskin]]

: &lt;math&gt;
H_\alpha (\mathbf{p},\mathbf{r})=D_\alpha |\mathbf{p}|^\alpha +V(\mathbf{r},t),
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' and '''r''' are the momentum and the position vectors respectively.

===Time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation===

The special case when the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H_\alpha &lt;/math&gt; is independent of time
: &lt;math&gt;
H_\alpha =D_\alpha (-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}+V(\mathbf{r}), 
&lt;/math&gt;
is of great importance for physical applications. 
It is easy to see that in this case there exist the special solution of the fractional Schrödinger equation
: &lt;math&gt;
\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=e^{-(i/\hbar )Et}\phi (\mathbf{r}), 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi (\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;
H_\alpha \phi (\mathbf{r}) = E\phi (\mathbf{r}),  
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
D_\alpha (-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\phi (\mathbf{r})+V(\mathbf{r})\phi (
\mathbf{r})=E\phi (\mathbf{r}). 
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the '''time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation''' (see, Ref.[2]).

Thus, we see that the [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\psi (\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; oscillates with a definite frequency. In [[classical physics]] the frequency corresponds to the energy. Therefore, the quantum mechanical state has a definite energy ''E''. 
The probability to find a particle at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute square of the wave function &lt;math&gt;| \psi (\mathbf{r},t) |^2 .&lt;/math&gt;
Because of time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation this is equal to &lt;math&gt;| \phi (\mathbf{r})|^2 &lt;/math&gt;  and does not depend upon the time. 
That is, the probability of finding the particle at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the time. One can say that the system is in a stationary
state. In other words, there is no variation in the probabilities as a function of time.

===Probability current density===
The conservation law of fractional quantum mechanical probability has been discovered for the first time by D.A.Tayurskii and Yu.V. Lysogorski &lt;ref&gt;D.A.Tayurskii and Yu.V. Lysogorskiy, (2011), https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4666, see also, D.A.Tayurskii and Yu.V. Lysogorskiy, (2012), [http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v66/i5/e056108 Super fluid hydrodynamic in fractal dimension space, ''Journal of Physics: Conference Series'' 394 (2012) 012004 5 pages], '' (available online: http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/394/1/012004/pdf/1742-6596_394_1_012004.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \rho (\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf{j}(
\mathbf{r},t)+K(\mathbf{r},t)=0,  
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho (\mathbf{r},t)=\psi ^{\ast }(\mathbf{r},t)\psi (\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;
is the quantum mechanical probability density and the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;
can be called by the fractional probability current density vector

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{D_\alpha \hbar }i\left( \psi ^{*}(\mathbf{r}
,t)(-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2-1}\mathbf{\nabla }\psi (\mathbf{r},t)-\psi (
\mathbf{r},t)(-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2-1}\mathbf{\nabla }\psi ^{*}(
\mathbf{r},t)\right) ,  
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathit{K}(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{D_\alpha \hbar }i\left(\mathbf{\nabla }\psi (\mathbf{r}
,t)(-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2-1}\mathbf{\nabla }\psi ^{*}(\mathbf{r},t)-(\mathbf{\nabla } \psi^{*} (
\mathbf{r},t)(-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2-1}\mathbf{\nabla }\psi (
\mathbf{r},t)\right) ,  
&lt;/math&gt;

here we use the notation (see also [[matrix calculus#Scope|matrix calculus]]): &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\nabla =\partial /\partial r}
&lt;/math&gt;.

It has been found in Ref.[5] that there are quantum physical conditions when the new term &lt;math&gt;\mathit{K}(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; is negligible and we come to the [[continuity equation#Quantum mechanics|continuity equation]] for quantum probability current and quantum density (see, Ref.[2]):

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \rho (\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf{j}(
\mathbf{r},t)=0.  
&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the [[momentum operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{p}}=\frac{\hbar }{i}
\frac{\partial }{\partial \mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; we can write the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt;
in the form (see, Ref.[2])

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{j=}D_{\alpha }\left( \psi (\hat{\mathbf{p}}^{2})^{\alpha /2-1}
\hat{\mathbf{p}}\psi ^{\ast }+\psi ^{\ast }(\hat{\mathbf{p}}^{\ast
2})^{\alpha /2-1}\hat{\mathbf{p}}^{\ast }\psi \right).  
&lt;/math&gt;

This is fractional generalization of the well-known equation for probability current density
vector of standard quantum mechanics (see, Ref.[7]).

    
====Velocity operator====

The quantum mechanical velocity operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{v}}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\mathbf{v}}=\frac{i}{\hbar }(H_{\alpha }\hat{\mathbf{r}}\mathbf{
-}\hat{\mathbf{r}}H_{\alpha }),
&lt;/math&gt;

Straightforward calculation results in (see, Ref.[2])
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{\mathbf{v}}=\alpha D_{\alpha }|\hat{\mathbf{p}}^{2}|^{\alpha
/2-1}\hat{\mathbf{p}}\,. 
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{j=}\frac{1}{\alpha }\left( \psi \hat{\mathbf{v}}\psi ^{\ast
}+\psi ^{\ast }\hat{\mathbf{v}}\psi \right) ,\qquad 1&lt;\alpha \leq 2.
&lt;/math&gt;

To get the [[probability current]] density equal to 1 (the current when one
particle passes through unit area per unit time) the wave function of a free
particle has to be normalized as

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\sqrt{\frac{\alpha }{2\mathrm{v}}}\exp \left[\frac{i}{\hbar }(
\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}-Et)\right],\qquad E=D_{\alpha }|\mathbf{p}|^{\alpha
},\qquad 1&lt;\alpha \leq 2,  
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{v}&lt;/math&gt;  is the particle [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{v}=\alpha D_{\alpha
}p^{\alpha -1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{j=}\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{v}},\qquad \mathbf{v}=\alpha D_{\alpha
}|\mathbf{p}^{2}|^{\frac{\alpha }{2}-1}\mathbf{p,}  
&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed the [[unit vector]].

== Physical applications ==

===Fractional Bohr atom===

{{main article|Bohr atom}}

When &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; is the potential energy of [[hydrogenlike atom]],

: &lt;math&gt;
V(\mathbf{r})=-\frac{Ze^{2}}{|\mathbf{r}|},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the [[electron charge]] and ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]] of the hydrogenlike atom, (so ''Ze'' is the nuclear charge of the atom), we come to following fractional [[eigenvalue]] problem,

: &lt;math&gt;
D_{\alpha }(-\hbar ^{2}\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\phi (\mathbf{r})-\frac{Ze^{2}}{|
\mathbf{r|}}\phi (\mathbf{r})=E\phi (\mathbf{r}).
&lt;/math&gt;

This eigenvalue problem has first been introduced and solved by [[Nick Laskin]]  in.&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2000), [https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1050284 Fractals and quantum mechanics. Chaos 10, 780-790]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the first [[Niels Bohr]] postulate yields
: &lt;math&gt;
 \alpha
D_{\alpha }\left( \frac{n\hbar }{a_{n}}\right) ^{\alpha }=\frac{Ze^{2}}{a_{n}
}, 
&lt;/math&gt;

and it gives us the equation for the [[Bohr radius]] of the fractional hydrogenlike atom
: &lt;math&gt;
a_{n}=a_{0}n^{\alpha /(\alpha -1)}.  
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the fractional Bohr radius (the radius of the lowest, ''n'' = 1, Bohr orbit) defined as,

: &lt;math&gt;
a_{0}=\left( \frac{\alpha D_{\alpha }\hbar ^{\alpha }}{Ze^{2}}\right) ^{1/(\alpha -1)}.  
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[energy levels]] of the fractional hydrogenlike atom are given by

: &lt;math&gt;
E_{n}=(1-\alpha )E_{0}n^{-\alpha/(\alpha -1)},\qquad 1&lt;\alpha \leq 2,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[binding energy]] of the electron in the lowest Bohr orbit
that is, the energy required to put it in a state with ''E'' = 0 corresponding to ''n'' = ∞,

: &lt;math&gt;
E_{0}=\left( \frac{Ze^{2}}{\alpha D_{\alpha }^{1/\alpha }\hbar }\right) ^{\alpha/(\alpha -1)}.  
&lt;/math&gt;

The energy (''α''  − 1)''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; divided by ''ħc'', (''α''  − 1)''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;/''ħc'',  can be considered as fractional generalization of the
[[Rydberg constant]] of standard [[quantum mechanics]]. For ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''Z'' = 1  the formula
&lt;math&gt;(\alpha -1)E_{0}/\hbar c&lt;/math&gt; is transformed into

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ry}=me^{4}/2\hbar ^{3}c&lt;/math&gt;,
which is the well-known expression for the [[Rydberg formula]].

According to the second [[Niels Bohr]] postulate, the frequency of radiation &lt;math&gt;\omega_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt; associated with the transition, say, for example from the orbit ''m'' to the orbit ''n'', is,

: &lt;math&gt;
\omega_{m,n} =\frac{(1-\alpha )E_{0}}{\hbar }\left[ \frac{1}{n^{\frac{\alpha }{
\alpha -1}}}-\frac{1}{m^{\frac{\alpha }{\alpha -1}}}\right]  
&lt;/math&gt;.

The above equations are fractional
generalization of the Bohr model. In the special Gaussian case, when (''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) those equations give us the well-known results of the [[Bohr model]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Bohr, (1913), Phil. Mag. 26, 1, 476, 857&lt;/ref&gt;

===The infinite potential well===

A particle in a one-dimensional well moves in a potential field &lt;math&gt;V({x})&lt;/math&gt;, which is zero for 
&lt;math&gt;-a\leq x\leq a&lt;/math&gt; and which is infinite elsewhere,

: &lt;math&gt;
V(x)=\infty ,\qquad x&lt;-a\qquad \qquad (\mathrm{i})
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
V(x)=0,\quad -a\leq x\leq a\quad \quad \quad \ (\mathrm{ii})  
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
V(x)=\infty ,\qquad \ x&gt;a\qquad \qquad \ (\mathrm{iii})
&lt;/math&gt;

It is evident ''a priori'' that the [[energy spectrum]] will be discrete. The solution of the fractional Schrödinger equation for the stationary state with well-defined energy ''E'' is described by a wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi (x)&lt;/math&gt;, which can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi (x,t)=\left(-i\frac{Et}{\hbar }\right)\phi(x)
&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)&lt;/math&gt;,  is now time independent. 
In regions (i) and (iii),
the fractional Schrödinger
equation can be satisfied only if we take &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. In the middle region
(ii), the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation is (see, Ref.[6]).

: &lt;math&gt;
D_\alpha (\hbar \nabla )^\alpha \phi (x)=E\phi (x).  
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation defines the [[wave functions]] and the energy spectrum within region (ii), while outside
of the region (ii), x&lt;-a and x&gt;a, the wave functions  are zero. The wave function &lt;math&gt;\phi (x)&lt;/math&gt; has to be continuous everywhere, thus we impose the boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;\phi (-a)=\phi (a)=0&lt;/math&gt; for the solutions of the ''time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation'' (see, Ref.[6]). Then the solution in region (ii) can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi (x)=A\exp(ikx) +B\exp(-ikx).
&lt;/math&gt;

To satisfy the boundary conditions we have to choose

:&lt;math&gt;
A = -B\exp(-i2ka),
&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;
\sin(2ka) =0.
&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from the last equation that

:&lt;math&gt;
2ka = n\pi.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the even (&lt;math&gt;\phi _n^{\mathrm{even}}(-x) = \phi _n^{\mathrm{even}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; under reflection &lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow -x&lt;/math&gt;) solution of the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation &lt;math&gt;\phi ^{\mathrm{even}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the infinite potential well is

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi _n^{\mathrm{even}}(x)=\frac 1{\sqrt{a}}\cos \left[ \frac{
n\pi x}{2a}\right] , \quad n = 1, 3, 5, ....
&lt;/math&gt;

The odd (&lt;math&gt;\phi _n^{\mathrm{odd}}(-x) = -\phi _n^{\mathrm{odd}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; under reflection &lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow -x&lt;/math&gt;) solution of the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation &lt;math&gt;\phi ^{\mathrm{even}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; in the infinite potential well is

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi _n^{\mathrm{odd}}(x)=\frac 1{\sqrt{a}}\sin \left[ \frac{
n\pi x}{2a}\right] , \quad n = 2, 4, 6, ....
&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions &lt;math&gt;\phi ^{\mathrm{even}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi ^{\mathrm{odd}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; have the
property that

:&lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_{-a}^{a}dx\phi _{m}^{\mathrm{even}}(x)\phi _{n}^{\mathrm{even}
}(x)=\int\limits_{-a}^{a}dx\phi _{m}^{\mathrm{odd}}(x)\phi _{n}^{\mathrm{odd}
}(x)=\delta _{mn},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta _{mn}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker symbol]] and

:&lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_{-a}^{a}dx\phi _{m}^{\mathrm{even}}(x)\phi _{n}^{\mathrm{odd}
}(x)=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues of the particle in an infinite potential well are (see, Ref.[6])

: &lt;math&gt;
E_n=D_\alpha \left( \frac{\pi \hbar }{2a}\right) ^\alpha n^\alpha ,\qquad
\qquad n=1,2,3....,\qquad 1&lt;\alpha \leq 2.  
&lt;/math&gt;

It is obvious that in the Gaussian case (''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) above equations are ö
transformed into the standard quantum mechanical equations for a [[particle in a box]] (for example, see
Eq.(20.7) in &lt;ref&gt;L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz, Quantum mechanics (Non-relativistic Theory), Vol.3, Third Edition, Course of Theoretical Physics, Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;)

The state of the lowest energy, the [[ground state]], in the infinite potential
well is represented by the &lt;math&gt;\phi _n^{\mathrm{even}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; at ''n''=1,
: &lt;math&gt;
\phi _{\mathrm{ground}}(x)\equiv \phi _1^{\mathrm{even}}(x)=\frac 1{\sqrt{a}
}\cos \left(\frac{\pi x}{2a}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

and its energy is

: &lt;math&gt;
E_{\mathrm{ground}}=D_{\alpha }\left( \frac{\pi \hbar }{2a}\right) ^{\alpha
}.  
&lt;/math&gt;

===Fractional quantum oscillator===

''Fractional quantum oscillator'' introduced by [[Nick Laskin]] (see, Ref.[2]) is the fractional quantum  mechanical model with the  [[Hamiltonian operator]] &lt;math&gt;H_{\alpha ,\beta }&lt;/math&gt; defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\alpha,\beta}=D_{\alpha }(-\hbar ^{2}\Delta )^{\alpha /2}+q^{2}|\mathbf{
r}|^{\beta },\quad 1&lt;\alpha \leq 2,\quad 1&lt;\beta \leq 2,  
&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''q'' is interaction constant.

The fractional Schrödinger equation for the wave
function &lt;math&gt;\psi (\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; of the fractional quantum oscillator is,

:&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi (\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}=D_{\alpha }(-\hbar
^{2}\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)+q^{2}|\mathbf{r}|^{\beta }\psi (
\mathbf{r},t)  
&lt;/math&gt;

Aiming to search for solution in form

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=e^{-iEt/\hbar }\phi (\mathbf{r}),
&lt;/math&gt;

we come to the time-independent fractional Schrödinger equation,

:&lt;math&gt;
D_{\alpha }(-\hbar ^{2}\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\phi (\mathbf{r},t)+q^{2}|\mathbf{
r}|^{\beta }\phi (\mathbf{r},t)=E\phi (\mathbf{r},t).  
&lt;/math&gt;

The Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H_{\alpha,\beta}&lt;/math&gt; is the fractional
generalization of the 3D [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] Hamiltonian of standard quantum
mechanics.

====Energy levels of the 1D fractional quantum oscillator in semiclassical approximation====

The [[energy levels]] of 1D fractional quantum oscillator with the [[Hamiltonian function]] &lt;math&gt;
H_{\alpha}=D_{\alpha }|p|^{\alpha }+q^{2}|x|^{\beta }&lt;/math&gt; were found in semiclassical approximation (see, Ref.[2]).

We set the total energy equal to ''E'', so that

:&lt;math&gt;
E=D_{\alpha }|p|^{\alpha }+q^{2}|x|^{\beta },  
&lt;/math&gt;

whence

:&lt;math&gt;
|p|=\left( \frac{1}{D_{\alpha }}(E-q^{2}|x|^{\beta })\right)
^{1/\alpha }
&lt;/math&gt;.

At the turning points &lt;math&gt;p=0&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the classical motion is
possible in the range &lt;math&gt;|x|\leq (E/q^{2})^{1/\beta }&lt;/math&gt;.

A routine use of the [[Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization]] rule yields

:&lt;math&gt;
2\pi \hbar (n+\frac{1}{2})=\oint
pdx=4\int\limits_{0}^{x_{m}}pdx=4\int\limits_{0}^{x_{m}}D_{\alpha
}^{-1/\alpha }(E-q^{2}|x|^{\beta })^{1/\alpha }dx,  
&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation &lt;math&gt;\oint  &lt;/math&gt; means the integral over one complete period of
the classical motion and &lt;math&gt;x_{m}=(E/q^{2})^{1/\beta }&lt;/math&gt; is the turning point
of classical motion.

To evaluate the integral in the right hand we introduce a new variable &lt;math&gt;y=x(E/q^{2})^{-1/\beta }&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_0^{x_m}D_\alpha ^{-1/\alpha }(E-q^2|x|^\beta )^{1/\alpha }dx=\frac 1{D_\alpha ^{1/\alpha }q^{2/\beta }}E^{\frac 1\alpha +\frac 1\beta
}\int\limits_0^1dy(1-y^\beta )^{1/\alpha }.
&lt;/math&gt;

The integral over ''dy'' can be expressed in terms of the [[Beta-function]],

:&lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_{0}^{1}dy(1-y^{\beta })^{1/\alpha }=\frac{1}{\beta }
\int\limits_{0}^{1}dzz^{\frac{1}{\beta }-1}(1-z)^{\frac{1}{\alpha }}=\frac{1
}{\beta }\Beta \left(\frac{1}{\beta },\frac{1}{\alpha }+1\right).  
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;
2\pi \hbar (n+\frac 12)=\frac 4{D_\alpha ^{1/\alpha }q^{2/\beta }}E^{\frac
1\alpha +\frac 1\beta }\frac 1\beta \Beta\left(\frac 1\beta ,\frac 1\alpha +1\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

The above equation gives the energy levels of stationary states for the 1D fractional quantum oscillator (see, Ref.[2]),

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{n}=\left( \frac{\pi \hbar \beta D_{\alpha }^{1/\alpha }q^{2/\beta }}{2\Beta(
\frac{1}{\beta },\frac{1}{\alpha }+1)}\right) ^{\frac{\alpha \beta }{\alpha
+\beta }}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{\alpha \beta }{\alpha +\beta }}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is generalization of the well-known [[energy levels]] equation of the
standard [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] (see, Ref.[7]) and is transformed into it at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.
It follows from this equation that at &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\alpha }+\frac{1}{\beta }=1&lt;/math&gt; the energy levels are equidistant. When &lt;math&gt;1&lt;\alpha \leq 2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;\beta \leq 2&lt;/math&gt; the equidistant energy levels can be for ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 only. It means that the only standard quantum harmonic oscillator has an [[equidistant]] [[energy spectrum]].

=== Fractional quantum mechanics in solid state systems ===
The effective mass of states in solid state systems can depend on the wave vector k, i.e. formally one considers m=m(k). Polariton Bose-Einstein condensate modes are examples of states in solid state systems with mass sensitive to variations and locally in k fractional quantum mechanics is experimentally feasible [https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03621].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Heterotopia''' is a concept elaborated by philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow ‘other’:  disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming. Heterotopias are worlds within worlds, mirroring and yet upsetting what is outside. Foucault provides examples: ships, cemeteries, brothels, prisons, gardens of antiquity, fairs, Turkish baths and many more. Foucault outlines the notion of heterotopia on three occasions between 1966-67. A [https://foucault.info/documents/heterotopia/foucault.heteroTopia.en/ talk] given to a group of architects is the most well-known explanation of the term.  His first mention of the concept is in his ''preface'' to 'The Order of Things' and refers to texts rather than socio-cultural spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=1971 |title=The Order of Things |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-75335-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Heterotopia follows the template established by the notions of [[utopia]] and [[dystopia]]. The prefix hetero- is from Ancient Greek ἕτερος (héteros, "other, another, different") and is combined with the Greek morpheme τόπος ("place") and means "other place".  A utopia is an idea or an image that is not real but represents a perfected version of society, such as [[Utopia (book)|Thomas More's book]] or [[Le Corbusier]]'s drawings. As Walter Russell Mead has written, "Utopia is a place where everything is good; dystopia is a place where everything is bad; heterotopia is where things are different — that is, a collection whose members have few or no intelligible connections with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mead |first=Walter Russell |date=Winter 1995–1996 |title=Trains, Planes, and Automobiles: The End of the Postmodern Moment |url= |journal=World Policy Journal |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=13–31 |jstor=40209444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterotopia in Foucault==
Foucault uses the term "heterotopia" ({{lang-fr|hétérotopie}}) to describe spaces that have more layers of meaning or relationships to other places than immediately meet the eye. In general, a heterotopia is a physical representation or approximation of a utopia, or a parallel space (such as a prison) that contains undesirable bodies to make a real utopian space impossible.

Foucault explains the link between utopias and heterotopias using the metaphor of a mirror. A mirror is a utopia because the image reflected is a 'placeless place', an unreal virtual place that allows one to see one's own visibility. However, the mirror is also a heterotopia, in that it is a real object. The heterotopia of the mirror 
is at once absolutely real, relating with the real space surrounding it, and absolutely unreal, creating a virtual image. 

Foucault articulates several possible types of heterotopia or spaces that exhibit dual meanings: 
* A ‘crisis heterotopia’ is a separate space like a boarding school or a motel room where activities like coming of age or a honeymoon take place out of sight. Foucault describes the crisis heterotopia as "reserved for individuals who are, in relation to society and to the human environment in which they live, in a state of crisis." He also points that crisis heterotopias are constantly disappearing from society and being replaced by the following heterotopia of deviation. 
* ‘Heterotopias of deviation’ are institutions where we place individuals whose behavior is outside the norm (hospitals, asylums, prisons, rest homes, cemetery).  
* Heterotopia can be a single real place that juxtaposes several spaces.  A garden can be a heterotopia, if it is a real space meant to be a microcosm of different environments, with plants from around the world. 
* 'Heterotopias of time' such as museums enclose in one place objects from all times and styles.  They exist in time but also exist outside of time because they are built and preserved to be physically insusceptible to time’s ravages. 
* 'Heterotopias of ritual or purification' are spaces that are isolated and penetrable yet not freely accessible like a public place. Either entry to the heterotopia is compulsory like in entering a prison, or entry requires special rituals or gestures, like in a [[sauna]] or a [[Turkish bath|hammam]].
* Heterotopia has a function in relation to all of the remaining spaces. The two functions are: heterotopia of illusion creates a space of illusion that exposes every real space, and the heterotopia of compensation is to create a real space—a space that is other.

Foucault's elaborations on heterotopias were published in an article entitled ''Des espaces autres'' (Of Other Spaces). The philosopher calls for a society with many heterotopias, not only as a space with several places of/for the affirmation of difference, but also as a means of escape from authoritarianism and repression, stating metaphorically that if we take the ship as the utmost heterotopia, a society without ships is inherently a repressive one, in a clear reference to [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=October 1984 |title=Des Espace Autres |journal=Architecture, Mouvement, Continuité |volume=5 |pages=46–49}}; it has been translated into English twice, first as {{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |others=trans.

==Heterotopia in the work of other authors==
Human geographers often connected to the [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] school have been using the term (and the author's propositions) to help understand the contemporary emergence of (cultural, social, political, economic) difference and identity as a central issue in larger multicultural cities. The idea of ''place'' (more often related to ethnicity and gender and less often to the social class issue) as a heterotopic entity has been gaining attention in the current context of postmodern, post-structuralist theoretical discussion (and political practice) in Geography and other spatial social sciences. The concept of a heterotopia has also been discussed in relation to the space in which learning takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blair |first=Erik |date=2009 |title=A Further Education College as a Heterotopia |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13596740902717465 |journal=Research in Post-Compulsory Education |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=93–101 |doi=10.1080/13596740902717465}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an extensive debate with theorists, such as [[David Harvey]], that remain focused on the matter of class domination as the central determinant of social heteronomy.

The geographer [[Edward Soja]] has worked with this concept in dialogue with the works of [[Henri Lefebvre]] concerning urban space in the book ''Thirdspace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soja |first=Edward |date=1996 |title=Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-and-Imagined Places |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |isbn=1-55786-675-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Franklin-Brown uses the concept of heterotopia in an epistemological context to examine the thirteenth century [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and [[Ramon Llull]]  as conceptual spaces where many possible ways of knowing are brought together without attempting to reconcile them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin-Brown |first=Mary |date=2012 |title=Reading the World: Encyclopedic Writing in the Scholastic Age |location=Chicago, Ill. |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-26068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media scholar Hye Jean Chung applies the concept of heterotopia to describe the multiple superimposed layers of spaciality and temporality observed in highly digitized audiovisual media. A heterotopic perception of digital media is, according to Chung, to grasp the globally dispersed labor structure of multinational capitalism that produces the audiovisual representations of various spacio-temporalities. &lt;ref&gt;Chung, Hye Jean. ''Media Heterotopias: Digital Effects and Material Labor in Global Film Production'', Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2018, pp.17-37 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterotopia in literature==
The concept of heterotopia has had a significant impact on literature, especially science fiction, fantasy and other [[Speculative fiction|speculative genres]]. Many readers consider the worlds of [[China Miéville]] and other [[weird fiction]] writers to be heterotopias insofar as they are worlds of radical difference transparent or of indifference to their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Joan |date=November 2003 |title=Hybridity, Heterotopia, and Mateship in China Miéville's ''Perdido Street Station'' |journal=Science Fiction Studies |publisher=SF-TH Inc., DePauw University |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=456–476 |jstor=4241204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel R. Delany|Samuel Delany's]] 1976 novel ''[[Triton (novel)|Trouble on Triton]]'' is subtitled ''An Ambiguous Heterotopia'' and was written partly in dialogue with [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula K.

[[File:Indrasnet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 3D rendering of Indra's net.]]
'''Indra's net''' (also called '''Indra's jewels''' or '''Indra's pearls''', [[Sanskrit]] ''Indrajāla'') is a [[metaphor]] used to illustrate the concepts of [[Śūnyatā]] (emptiness),{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=16}} [[pratītyasamutpāda]] (dependent origination),&lt;ref name="Lee_2005_473" &gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2005|p=473}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Buddhist_philosophy#Huayan|interpenetration]]&lt;ref name="Odin_1982_17" &gt;{{harvnb|Odin|1982|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Buddhist philosophy]].

The metaphor was developed by the [[Mahayana|Mahayana school]] in the 3rd century ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' and later by the [[Huayan school]] between the 6th and 8th centuries.{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=16}}

==Avatamsaka Sutra==
[[File:Indras Net-02.png|thumb|right|250px]]
{{Main|Indra|Avatamsaka Sutra|Huayan school}}

"Indra's net" is an infinitely large net of cords owned by the [[Vedic]] [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] [[Indra]], which hangs over his palace on [[Mount Meru]], the [[axis mundi]] of Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. In this metaphor, Indra's net has a multifaceted jewel at each vertex, and each jewel is reflected in all of the other jewels.{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|2000|p=225}} 

In the [[Huayan school]] of [[Chinese Buddhism]], which follows the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]], the image of "Indra's net" is used to describe the interconnectedness of the universe.{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|2000|p=225}} Francis H Cook describes Indra's net thus:

{{quote|Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each "eye" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering "like" stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected ''all'' the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.{{sfn|Cook|1977}}}}

The Buddha in the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'s 30th book states a similar idea:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:If untold buddha-lands are reduced to atoms,
:In one atom are untold lands,
:And as in one,
:So in each.
:The atoms to which these buddha-lands are reduced in an instant are unspeakable,
:And so are the atoms of continuous reduction moment to moment
:Going on for untold eons;
:These atoms contain lands unspeakably many,
:And the atoms in these lands are even harder to tell of.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary. The Flower Ornament Scripture A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 1993, page 891-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Book 30 of the sutra is named "The Incalculable" because it focuses on the idea of the [[infinitude]] of the universe and as Cleary notes, concludes that "the cosmos is unutterably infinite, and hence so is the total scope and detail of knowledge and activity of enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Cleary. The Flower Ornament Scripture A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 1993, page 44&lt;/ref&gt; In another part of the sutra, the Buddhas' knowledge of all phenomena is referred to by this metaphor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They [Buddhas] know all phenomena come from interdependent origination.
They know all world systems exhaustively. They know all the
different phenomena in all worlds, interrelated in Indra's net.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary. The Flower Ornament Scripture A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 1993, page 925.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In Huayan texts==
The metaphor of Indra's net of jewels plays an essential role in the Chinese Huayan school,{{sfn||Cook|1977|p=2}} where it is used to describe the interpenetration (Wylie: ''zung-'jug''; Sanskrit: yuganaddha) of microcosmos and macrocosmos.{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=16-17}} The Huayan text entitled "Calming and Contemplation in the Five Teachings of Huayan" (Huayan wujiao zhiguan 華嚴五教止觀, T1867) attributed to the first Huayan patriarch [[Dushun]] (557–640) gives an extended overview of this concept:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The manner in which all dharmas interpenetrate is like an imperial net of
celestial jewels extending in all directions infinitely, without limit. … As for the imperial net of heavenly jewels, it is known as Indra’s Net, a net which is made entirely of jewels. Because of the clarity of the jewels, they are all reflected in and enter into each other, ad infinitum. Within each jewel, simultaneously, is reflected the whole net. Ultimately, nothing comes or goes. If we now turn to the southwest, we can pick one particular jewel and
examine it closely. This individual jewel can immediately reflect the image
of every other jewel. 
As is the case with this jewel, this is furthermore the case with all the rest of the jewels–each and every jewel simultaneously and immediately reflects each and every other jewel, ad infinitum. The image of each of these limitless jewels is within one jewel, appearing brilliantly. None of the other jewels interfere with this. When one sits within one jewel, one is simultaneously sitting in all the infinite jewels in all ten directions. How is this so? Because within each jewel are present all jewels. If all jewels are present within each jewel, it is also the case that if you sit in one jewel you sit in all jewels at the same time. The inverse is also understood in the same way. Just as one goes into one jewel and thus enters every other jewel while never leaving this one jewel, so too one enters any jewel while never leaving this particular jewel.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Alan. The Practice of Huayan Buddhism, http://www.fgu.edu.tw/~cbs/pdf/2013%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E9%9B%86/q16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Huayan Patriarch [[Fazang]] (643–712) used the golden statue of a lion to demonstrate the Huayan vision of interpenetration to empress Wu:{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=17}}

{{quote|In each of the lion's eyes, in its ears, limbs, and so forth, down to each and every single hair, there is a golden lion. All the lions embraced by each and every hair simultaneously and instantaneously enter into one single hair. Thus, in each and every hair there are an infinite number of lions... The progression is infinite, like the jewels of Celestial Lord Indra's Net: a realm-embracing-realm ad infinitum is thus established, and is called the realm of Indra's Net.{{sfn|Odin|1982|p=17}}}}

==Atharva Veda==
According to Rajiv Malhotra, the earliest reference to a net belonging to Indra is in the [[Atharvaveda|Atharva Veda]] (c. 1000 [[BCE]]).{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=4-5, 210}} Verse 8.8.6. says: 
{{quote|Vast indeed is the tactical net of great Indra, mighty of action and tempestuous of great speed. By that net, O Indra, pounce upon all the enemies so that none of the enemies may escape the arrest and punishment.{{sfn|Ram|2013|p=910}}}}

And verse 8.8.8. says:
{{quote|This great world is the power net of mighty Indra, greater than the great. By that Indra-net of boundless reach, I hold all those enemies with the dark cover of vision, mind and senses.{{sfn|Ram|2013|p=910-911}}}}

The net was one of the weapons of the sky-god Indra, used to snare and entangle enemies.{{sfn|Beer|2003|p=154}} The net also signifies [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[Maya (illusion)|illusion]].{{sfn|Debroy|2013}} According to Teun Goudriaan, Indra is conceived in the Rg Veda as a great magician, tricking his enemies with their own weapons, thereby continuing human life and prosperity on earth.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=211}} Indra became associated with earthly magic, as reflected in the term ''indrajalam'', "Indra's Net", the name given to the occult practices magicians.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=211}} According to Goudriaan, the term ''indrajalam'' seems to originate in verse 8.8.8 from the Atharva Veda, of which Goudriaan gives a different translation:{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}}
{{quote|This world was the net of the great Sakra (Indra), of mighty size; by means of this net of Indra I envelop all those people with darkness.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}}}}

According to Goudriaan, the speaker pretends to use a weapon of cosmical size.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}} The net being referred to here 
{{quote|...was characterized there as the ''antariksa-'', the intermediate space between heaven and earth, while the directions of the sky were the net's sticks (''dandah'') by means of which it was fastened to the earth. With this net Indra conquered all his enemies.{{sfn|Goudriaan|1978|p=214}}}}

==Modern &amp; Western references==
[[File:Dewy_spider_web.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dewy_spider_web.jpg|thumb|"Imagine a multidimensional spider's web in the early morning covered with dew drops. And every dew drop contains the reflection of all the other dew drops.  And, in each reflected dew drop, the reflections of all the other dew drops in that reflection. And so ad infinitum. That is the Buddhist conception of the universe in an image." –[[Alan Watts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.alanwattspodcast.com/index.php?post_id=373289|title=Alan Watts Podcast – Following the Middle Way #3|website=alanwattspodcast.com|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=|accessyear=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===''Gödel, Escher, Bach''===
In ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979), [[Douglas Hofstadter]] uses Indra's net as a metaphor for the complex interconnected networks formed by relationships between objects in a system—including [[social network]]s, the interactions of particles, and the "[[Symbolic interactionism|symbols]]" that stand for [[idea]]s in a [[brain]] or [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last1 =  Hofstadter| first1 = Douglas R.  | authorlink = Douglas Hofstadter  | title = [[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]  | publisher = Basic Books  | year = 1999  | page = 266  | isbn = 0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vermeer's Hat''===
In ''[[Vermeer's Hat]]'' (2007), a history book written by [[Timothy Brook]], the author uses the metaphor:
{{quote| Buddhism uses a similar image to describe the interconnectedness of all phenomena. It is called Indra's Net. When Indra fashioned the world, he made it as a web, and at every knot in the web is tied a pearl. Everything that exists, or has ever existed, every idea that can be thought about, every datum that is true—every dharma, in the language of Indian philosophy—is a pearl in Indra's net. Not only is every pearl tied to every other pearl by virtue of the web on which they hang, but on the surface of every pearl  is reflected every other jewel on the net. Everything that exists in Indra's web implies all else that exists.&lt;ref name="VH(p22)"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;!--end quote--&gt;
Writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', Sarah Burton explains that Brook uses the metaphor, and its interconnectedness, 
{{quote|to help understand the multiplicity of causes and effects producing the way we are and the way we were [...] In the same way, the journeys through Brook's picture-portals intersect with each other, at the same time shedding light on each other.&lt;ref name="Spectator-Burton"&gt;{{cite web | last = Burton | first = Sarah | title = The Net Result | publisher = ''[[The Spectator]]'' | date = 2 August 2008 | url = http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/866241/part_2/the-net-result.thtml | accessdate = 2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Indra's Net: Defending Hinduism's Philosophical Unity''===
In ''[[Indra's Net (book)|Indra's Net]]'' (2014), [[Rajiv Malhotra]] uses the image of Indra's net as a metaphor for
{{quote|
the profound cosmology and outlook that permeates Hinduism. Indra's Net symbolizes the universe as a web of connections and interdependences [...] I seek to revive it as the foundation for Vedic cosmology and show how it went on to become the central principle of Buddhism, and from there spread into mainstream Western discourse across several disciplines.{{sfn|Malhotra|2014|p=4}}

'''Information policy''' is the set of all public laws, regulations and policies that encourage, discourage, or regulate the creation, use, storage, access, and communication and dissemination of [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;Weingarten, F.W. (1989) Federal Information Policy Development: The Congressional perspective. In C. McClure, P. Hernon and H. Relyea (eds), United States Government Information Policies: views and Perspectives (Ablex, Norwood, NJ).&lt;/ref&gt; It thus encompasses any other decision-making practice with society-wide constitutive efforts that involve the flow of information and how it is processed.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"&gt;Braman, S. (2011). Defining information policy. Journal of Information Policy 1-5. http://jip.vmhost.psu.edu/ojs/index.php/jip/article/view/19/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several fundamental issues that comprise information policy. Most prominent are [[public policy]] issues concerned with the use of information for democratization and commercialization of social life. These issues include, inter alia, digital environment, such as [[intellectual property]], economic regulations, freedom of expression, confidentiality or privacy of information, [[information security]], access management, and regulating how the dissemination of public information occurs.

== Overview ==

Information policy became a prominent field of study during the latter half of the 20th century as the shift from an industrial to an information society transpired.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; It has since then evolved from being seen as relatively unimportant to having a much more overarching strategic significance since it establishes the conditions “under which all other decision making, public discourse, and political activity occur.”&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; The growing awareness in the importance of information policy has sparked an interest in various groups to further study and analyze its magnitude. The most common audience for information policy analysis includes undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, policymakers, policy analysts, as well as those members of the public who have taken an interest in understanding the effects of the laws and regulations involving information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

Although information policy generally has a broader definition and encapsulates a multitude of components, its scope and impact can vary depending on the context. For example, in the context of an information lifecycle, information policy refers to the laws and policies that deal with the stages information goes through beginning with its creation, through its collection, organization, dissemination, and finally to its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Marilyn Gell. (1983). The federal role in library and information services. White Plains, N.Y.: Knowledge Industry Publishers Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the context of public administration, information policy is the means by which government employees, institutions, and information systems adapt themselves to an environment in rapid fluctuation and use information for decision-making (e.g., Andersen and Dawes, 1991; also see Bozeman and Bretschneider, 1986, and Stevens and McGowan, 1985). One can see how these two contexts offer varying scopes for the phrase “ information policy.”

Information policy is in fact, a combination of several varying disciplines including [[information sciences|information science]], [[economics]], law, and public policy.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt; Thus, its scope may differ when each of these disciplines analyses or uses it. The information sciences may be more concerned with technical advances and how this impacts information policy, while from a law perspective, issues such as privacy rights and intellectual property may be of greatest focus.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, M. W. (1995) Information Policies: premonitions and prospects. Journal of Information Science 21(4) 273-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==

The earliest sight of information policy was present around the mid-1900s.  The stages to begin evolving from an industrial society to an information society sparked several other transformations.  The common industrial technologies were beginning to be replaced by informational meta-technologies.  Organizations began changing their form, several new architectures of knowledge developed, and most importantly, the information economy replaced industrial and agricultural economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/braman/www/bramanpdfs/027_Braman_Chapt1.pdf |title=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee |publisher=Pantherfile.uwm.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the concept of national information policy was created to protect the data and information that was used in creating public policies. The earliest adopters of information policy included the United States, Australia, as well as several European countries who all recognized the importance for a more standardized governance of information.

Elizabeth Orna contributed to a paper on information policies by providing a brief history of the development of ideas surrounding national and organizational information policies, from the beginning when the [[United Kingdom]] Ministry of Information was established in the [[World War I|First World War]] to present day. The history of information policy is reflected in this chart.

In the 20th century, to cope with the privacy problems of databases, information policy evolved further safeguards. In the USA, the federal [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]] provides individuals the right to inspect and correct personal information in federal datafiles.

== Types and importance ==

The types of information policy can be separated into two different categories.  It can be discussed in the short-term focus exclusively on information science.  It can also have a much broader context in relation to different subjects and be within a larger time period, for example dating back to Roman civilization, the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The obvious reason for the need of information policy deals with the legal issues that can be associated with the advancement of technology.  More precisely, — the digitization of the cultural content made the cost of the copy decreasing to nearly zero and increased the illegal exchange of files, online, via sharing web site or [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] technologies, or off line (copy of hard disks).  As a result, there are many grey areas between what users can and cannot do, and this creates the need for some sort of regulation.  Today, this has led to the creation of SOPA ([[Stop Online Piracy Act]]).  Information policy will mark the boundaries needed to evaluate certain issues dealing with the creation, processing, exchange, access, and use of information.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

1. for avoiding risks (financial losses from incomplete and uncoordinated exploitation of information, wasted time, failures of innovation, and reputation loss);

2. for positive benefits, including negotiation and openness among those responsible for different aspects of information management
 
3. productive use of IT in supporting staff in their use of information

4. ability to initiate change to take advantage of changing environments

== Issues ==

There are some issues around organizational information policies,&lt;ref&gt;Orna Elizabeth, Information Policies, yesterday, today and tomorrow, Journal of Information Science, 34 (4) 2008, pp 547-565, apud N. Moore and J. Steel, Information-Intensive Britain. British Library R &amp; D report No. 6038 (The Policy Studies Institute/British Library Board, London, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; which are the interaction between human beings and technology for using information, the issue to proceed information policy itself, whether top-down or middle-up-down, is the best way to approach information policy in an organization. Also, issues that information tends to be influenced by organization’s culture that result in complexity of information flow. Moreover, the concern about valuing information is discussed by Orna, the fact that value of information is dependant on the user, and it can’t be measured by price. Considering that information is an asset or intellectual capital that becomes valuable when it is used in productive ways.

== Convergence==
Convergence essentially combines all forms of media, telecommunications, broadcasting, and computing by the use of a single technology: digital computers.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"&gt;(Garcia-Murillo and MacInnes, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  It integrates diverse technological systems in the hopes of improving performance of similar tasks.  Convergence is thought to be the result of the need for expansion into new markets due to competition and technological advances that have created a threat of new entrants into various segments of the value chain.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt; As a result, previously disparate technologies interact with one other synergistically to deliver information in new and unique ways and allow for inventive solutions to be developed.

Nearly every innovative trend in the social industry involves adding data or layers of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;(Stanchak, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites have begun interacting with e-mail functionalities, search engines have begun integrating Internet searches with Facebook data, Twitter along with various other social media platforms have started to play a prominent role in the emergency management framework (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) among several others.

In 2012 a prominent issue arose that deals with the convergence of social media with copyright infringement monitoring systems.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"&gt;(Reisinger, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing interest in this topic can be largely attributed to the recent anti-piracy bills: the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] and the [[PROTECT IP Act]]. Various officials from all over the world have expressed an interest in forcing social networks to install and utilize monitoring systems to determine if users are illegally obtaining copyrighted material.&lt;ref name="Reisinger, 2012"/&gt; For example, if implemented, these filters could prevent the illegal sharing of music over social networking platforms. The convergence of search engines and social networks could make this process even easier. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing have begun to merge with social media platforms to link Internet searches to your social networking sites such as Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;(Houck, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; This poses an even greater threat to users since their Internet searches can be monitored via their social networks.

The issue of converging social networks with piracy monitoring systems becomes controversial when it comes to protecting personal data and abiding by [[privacy law]]s. In order for a synergy such as this one to take place, regulatory convergence would need to be considered. Regulatory convergence is the merging of previously disparate industry-based laws and regulations into a single legal and regulatory framework.&lt;ref name="MacInnes 2002"/&gt;

== Internet governance ==

Internet governance has both narrow and broad definitions, thus, making it a complex concept to understand. When most people think of Internet governance, they think of the regulations of the content and conduct that are communicated and acted on through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"&gt;Solum, 2008, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is certainly a broad component of Internet governance, additionally, there are more narrow elements to the definition that are often overlooked. Internet governance also encompasses the regulation of Internet infrastructure and the processes, systems, and institutions that regulate the fundamental systems that determine the capabilities of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, p. 50"/&gt;

Architecture is the foundation of the Internet. The fundamental goal of the Internet architecture is to essentially create a network of networks by interconnecting various computer network systems globally.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"&gt;(Solum, 2008, 68)&lt;/ref&gt; Protocols such as TCP/IP as well as other network protocols serve as the rules and conventions by which computers can communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 67)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, TCP/IP is often viewed as the most important institution of Internet governance.&lt;ref name="Solum, 2008, 68"/&gt; It serves as the backbone to network connectivity.
 
Organizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICANN]]) coordinate the various systems within the Internet on a global level to help preserve the operational stability of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;(Solum, 2008, 48)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, coordination of IP addresses and managing the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) ensure computers and devices can correctly connect to the Internet and can communicate effectively globally. If regulation of these crucial elements of the Internet such as TCP/IP and DNS were governed by disparate principles, the Internet would no longer exist as it does today. Networks, computers, and peripherals would not be able to communicate and have the same accessibility if these foundational elements varied.

== Government roles ==

Like with any policy, there needs to be an agent to govern and regulate it. With information policy in a broader sense, the government has several roles and responsibilities. Some examples include providing accurate information, producing and maintaining information that meets the specific needs of the public, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive information, and making informed decisions on which information should be disseminated and how to distribute it effectively, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, M. (1997) The Field of Information Policy: 1. Fundamental Concepts, Journal of Information Science 23(4) 261-275&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government plays an active role in information policy, the analysis of information policy should not only include the formal decision making processes by government entities, but also the formal and informal decisions of both the private and public sector of governance.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

=== Security vs freedom of information ===

A persistent debate concerning the government role in information policy is the separation of security and freedom of information.  Legislation such as the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USAPATRIOT or USAPA) Act of 2001 is an example of security taking precedence over civil liberties.  The USAPA affected several surveillance and privacy laws to include:&lt;ref name=EPIC&gt;{{cite web|title=USA PATRIOT Act|url=http://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Wire Tapping (Title III) which requires there be probable cause for real-time interception of voice and data communication.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Electronic Communications Privacy Act(ECPA) regulates government access to email and other electronic communications.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
* Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authorizes the government to carry out electronic surveillance against any person, including Americans.&lt;ref name="EPIC"/&gt;
The USAPA was passed in October 2001, not long after 9/11 and without much contention from congress.  Civil liberties advocates argue that the changes made to the standing surveillance laws were done in an abrupt manner and without consideration to basic rights as outlined in the US constitution, specifically [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourth amendment]] rights which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.

== Research methods and tools ==

The five broad methodological strands that Rowlands (1996) identified are current tools for information policy study:

Classification: The tool demonstrates a wide range of issues and subjects on information policy. It helps research to understand the breadth of the subject. The published materials are reasonably well documented and described. It is also good for start-up literature review and research purposes.

Identification of policy issues and options: This tool relies on inputs for information; for example, interviews and questionnaires targeting policy makers and other stakeholders. It is a commonly used in the studies of on-the-job policy makers in government or industry (Moore and Steele, 1991; McIntosh, 1990; Rowlands, 1997).

Reductionism: The reductionist approach control factors to reduce ambiguity. The factors include constraining data collection, analysis and interpretation within the framework of a specific discipline. It helps researchers to notice how a specific factor relates to the overall environment. 
Forecasting and scenario-building: The commonly used model is [[PEST analysis|STEEP framework]]. It helps in reducing uncertainties for a topic that is under studies.

Process-oriented research and cases studies: It provides detailed contextual analyses of particular events. It helps researcher to experience the policy process in semi-real situation and study its outcome.

== The future ==

In regards to the future of information policy, it should be flexible and changing to different circumstances as the ability to access, store, and share information grows.&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, T.J. (1994). Rights in Conflict: public policy in an information age. In: New Worlds in Information and Documentation : Proceedings of the 46th FID Conference and Congress&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvin suggests that information policy might include setting a boundary to the uncertainty in this field.  As information policy becomes a larger and more important topic, it will also become a greater subject to governmental regulation in regards to the future of technology as well.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;  It will also include the studies of these subjects: information science, communications, library science, and technology studies.&lt;ref name="jip.vmhost.psu.edu"/&gt;

The information policies will earn more advantages for national and organizational, such as getting the best from development of [[Web 2.0]] nationally and in organization, influence people for paying attention to the socio aspect and socio-technical system, for securing preservation of digital content, bringing out information product, also respecting all users and making thinking time respectable.

In order to achieve this national organization, it will be important to focus not only on a domestic level but also nationally. Making domestic agencies cooperate internationally (and vice versa) though, will not be overly successful. A single nation can take the lead in establishing communication-based relationships specifically regarding the internet. These relations will need to be slowly and consistently established in order to truly unify any kind of information policy and decision-making. If information policy can be established and guided on a semi-national level, the degree of communication and cooperation throughout the world will increase dramatically. As information policy continues to shape many aspects of society, these international relations will become vital (Harpham, 2011).

Information policy is playing a greater role in the economy leading to the production of goods and services, as well as selling them directly to consumers (UCLA, 2009).  The cost of information varies from a tangible good in that initial costs of the first unit are large and fixed; however, after that, marginal costs are relatively low (MacInnes, 2011).  As an increase from the information services, information can be paralleled to that of manufacturing several years ago (UCLA, 2009).  The digitalization of information allows businesses to make better justified business decisions (MacInnes, 2011).

An '''interpretation of quantum mechanics''' is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of [[quantum mechanics]] corresponds to [[reality]]. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments, there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation.  These views differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is [[determinism|deterministic]] or random, which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered "real", and what is the nature of measurement, among other matters.

Despite nearly a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached amongst physicists and [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] concerning which interpretation best represents reality.

The definition of quantum theorists' terms, such as ''[[wave function]]s'' and ''[[matrix mechanics]]'', progressed through many stages. For instance, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] originally viewed the electron's wave function as its charge density smeared across the [[field (physics)#Waves as fields|field]], whereas [[Max Born]] reinterpreted the absolute square value of the wave function as the electron's [[probability density function|probability density]] distributed across the field.

Although the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] was originally most popular, [[quantum decoherence]] has gained popularity.  Thus the [[many-worlds interpretation]] has been gaining acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidman, L. (2002, March 24). Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Retrieved March 19, 2010, from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/#Teg98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tipler1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank J.

As a rough guide development of the mainstream view during the 1990s to 2000s, consider the "snapshot" of opinions collected in a  poll by Schlosshauer et al. at the 2011 "Quantum  Physics  and  the  Nature  of  Reality" conference of July 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=1301.1069

The authors reference a similarly informal poll carried out by [[Max Tegmark]] at the "Fundamental  Problems in Quantum Theory" conference in August 1997. The main conclusion of the authors is that "the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:
:"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll."

It is noteworthy that only Cramer's [[transactional interpretation]], published in 1986, assigns physical basis to [[Max Born]]'s assertion that the absolute square of the wave function is a probability density.&lt;ref&gt;The Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, R.E.Kastner, Cambridge University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-521-76415-5}}, p35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature ==
More or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:
# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''—a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions
# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''—a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world
Two qualities vary among interpretations:
# [[Ontology]]—claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world
# [[Epistemology]]—claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world

In [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually "governs" outcomes—and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism—is a [[category mistake]].

In a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]—approximately true description or explanation of the natural world—or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.

{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], "Shut up and calculate", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase "shut up and calculate", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could feynman have said this?|journal=Physics Today|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N. David|bibcode=2004PhT....57e..10M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches to resolve conceptual problems introduce new mathematical formalism, and so propose alternative theories with their interpretations.  An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms—[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]]'s [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]—has been demonstrated.

== Challenges ==

# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.
# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. 
# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Bacciagaluppi, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].&lt;ref&gt;''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see "[[Quantum logic]]").  Like contextuality, the "origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators" that describe quantum objects (Omnès 1999).
# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.
# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibnitz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.

== Summaries ==

=== Classification adopted by Einstein ===
An interpretation (i.e. a [[semantics|semantic explanation]] of the formal mathematics of quantum mechanics) can be characterized by its treatment of certain matters addressed by Einstein, such as:
* Realism
* Completeness
* [[Principle of locality#Local realism|Local realism]]
* [[Determinism]]

To explain these properties, we need to be more explicit about the kind of picture an interpretation provides. To that end we will regard an interpretation as a correspondence between the elements of the mathematical formalism '''M''' and the elements of an interpreting structure '''I''', where:
* The ''mathematical formalism'' '''M''' consists of the Hilbert space machinery of [[bra–ket notation|ket-vectors]], [[self-adjoint operator]]s acting on the space of ket-vectors, unitary time dependence of the ket-vectors, and measurement operations. In this context a measurement operation is a transformation which turns a ket-vector into a probability distribution (for a formalization of this concept see [[quantum operation]]s).
* The ''interpreting structure'' '''I''' includes states, transitions between states, measurement operations, and possibly information about spatial extension of these elements. A measurement operation refers to an operation which returns a value and might result in a system state change. Spatial information would be exhibited by states represented as functions on configuration space. The transitions may be [[Quantum indeterminacy|non-deterministic]] or probabilistic or there may be infinitely many states.

The crucial aspect of an interpretation is whether the elements of '''I''' are regarded as physically real. Hence the bare instrumentalist view of quantum mechanics outlined in the previous section is not an interpretation at all, for it makes no claims about elements of physical reality.

The current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = [[EPR paradox|Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?]] | url = | journal = Phys. Rev. | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 777–780 | doi=10.1103/physrev.47.777| bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that paper the authors proposed the concepts ''element of reality'' and the ''completeness of a physical theory''. They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.

Determinism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.

Local realism has two aspects:
* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;
* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.

A precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].

[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].

It should be noted that regardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.

=== Copenhagen interpretation ===
{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}

The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the "standard" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like "where was the particle before I measured its position?" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], "reality is in the observations, not in the electron".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.

=== Many worlds ===
{{Main|Many-worlds interpretation}}

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a [[universal wavefunction]] obeys the same deterministic, [[CPT symmetry|reversible]] laws at all times; in particular there is no (indeterministic and [[irreversibility|irreversible]]) [[wavefunction collapse]] associated with measurement. The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly "splitting" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories—effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].

=== Consistent histories ===
{{Main|Consistent histories}}

The [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schrödinger equation]].

According to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).

=== Ensemble interpretation ===
{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}

The [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles. Probably the most notable supporter of such an interpretation was Einstein:

{{Quote|The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which become immediately unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems.|Einstein in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist'', ed. P.A. Schilpp (Harper &amp; Row, New York)}}

The most prominent current advocate of the ensemble interpretation is Leslie E. Ballentine, professor at [[Simon Fraser University]], author of the graduate level text book ''Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development''. An experiment illustrating the ensemble interpretation is provided in Akira Tonomura's Video clip 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A new version of the ensemble interpretation that relies on a reformulation of probability theory was introduced by Raed Shaiia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oalib.com/index/3138961#.V2dVs9J94dU|title=On the Measurement Problem|first=Raed M.|last=Shaiia|date=9 February 2015|publisher=|doi=10.5923/j.ijtmp.20140405.04|volume=4|journal=International Journal of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics|pages=202–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/physicsraedshaiia/publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]] of quantum mechanics (also known as the pilot wave theory) is a theory by [[Louis de Broglie]] and extended later by [[David Bohm]] to include measurements.  Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schrödinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Action at a distance (physics)|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality. The [[measurement problem]] is resolved, since the particles have definite positions at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maudlin | first1 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Why Bohm's Theory Solves the Measurement Problem | url = | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 479–483 | doi=10.1086/289879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collapse is explained as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]].&lt;ref name="CushingFine2013"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Durr |first1=D. |last2=Zanghi |first2=N. |last3=Goldstein |first3=S.|arxiv=quant-ph/9511016 |title=''Bohmian Mechanics as the Foundation of Quantum Mechanics ''|date=Nov 14, 1995 }} Also published in {{cite book|author1=J.T.

=== Relational quantum mechanics ===
{{Main|Relational quantum mechanics}}
The essential idea behind [[relational quantum mechanics]], following the precedent of [[special relativity]], is that different observers may give different accounts of the same series of events: for example, to one observer at a given point in time, a system may be in a single, "collapsed" [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstate]], while to another observer at the same time, it may be in a superposition of two or more states.  Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of "state" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any "measurement event" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,&lt;ref&gt;David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector. The inherent ambiguity associated with applying Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is subsequently avoided.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.quantum-relativity.org/Quantum-Relativity.pdf relational approach to wave-particle duality].

=== Transactional interpretation ===
{{Main|Transactional interpretation}}
The [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics (TIQM) by [[John G. Cramer]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function). Since the possibility wave is collapsed by interaction with the receiver, consciousness plays no role in the theory, eliminating [[Schrödinger's cat]] paradox.  This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.

=== Stochastic mechanics ===
{{Main|Stochastic interpretation}}
An entirely classical derivation and interpretation of Schrödinger's wave equation by analogy with [[Brownian motion]] was suggested by [[Princeton University]] professor [[Edward Nelson]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = E | year = 1966 | title = Derivation of the Schrödinger Equation from Newtonian Mechanics | url = | journal = Phys.

Fürth (1933), [[I. Fényes]] (1952), and [[Walter Weizel]] (1953), and are referenced in Nelson's paper. More recent work on the stochastic interpretation has been done by M. Pavon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pavon | first1 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Stochastic mechanics and the Feynman integral | url = | journal = J. Math.

=== Objective collapse theories ===
{{Main|Objective collapse theory}}
Objective collapse theories differ from the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] by regarding both the wave function and the process of collapse as ontologically objective (meaning these exist and occur independent of the observer).  In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly ("spontaneous localization") or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role.  Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension to QM means that objective collapse is more of a theory than an interpretation.  Examples include 
* the [[Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Consciousness causes collapse (von Neumann–Wigner interpretation) ===
{{Main|Consciousness causes collapse}}
In his treatise ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] deeply analyzed the so-called [[measurement problem]]. He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the Schrödinger equation (the universal wave function). He also described how measurement could cause a collapse of the wave function.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, John. (1932/1955). ''Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. Translated by Robert T. Beyer.&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view was prominently expanded on by [[Eugene Wigner]], who argued that human experimenter consciousness (or maybe even dog consciousness) was critical for the collapse, but he later abandoned this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[Michael Esfeld, (1999), "Essay Review: Wigner's View of Physical Reality", published in ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', 30B, pp. 145–154, Elsevier Science Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/9501014|author1=Zvi Schreiber|title=The Nine Lives of Schrödinger's Cat|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of the consciousness causes collapse interpretation include:

: '''Subjective reduction research'''
::This principle, that consciousness causes the collapse, is the point of intersection between quantum mechanics and the mind/body problem; and researchers are working to detect conscious events correlated with physical events that, according to quantum theory, should involve a wave function collapse; but, thus far, results are inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Dick J. Bierman and Stephen Whitmarsh. (2006). ''Consciousness and Quantum Physics: Empirical Research on the Subjective Reduction of the State Vector''. in Jack A. Tuszynski (Ed). '''The Emerging Physics of Consciousness'''. p. 27-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nunn | first1 = C. M.

* Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner (''Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness'')
* Amit Goswami (''The Self-Aware Universe'')

=== Many minds ===
{{Main|Many-minds interpretation}}

The many-minds interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]] extends the [[many-worlds interpretation]] by proposing that the distinction between worlds should be made at the level of the mind of an individual observer.

=== Quantum logic ===
{{Main|Quantum logic}}

[[Quantum logic]] can be regarded as a kind of propositional logic suitable for understanding the apparent anomalies regarding quantum measurement, most notably those concerning composition of measurement operations of complementary variables. This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.

* Information ontologies, such as J. A. Wheeler's "[[it from bit]]". These approaches have been described as a revival of [[idealism|immaterialism]]&lt;ref&gt;Timpson, Op. Cit.: "Let us call the thought that information might be the basic category from which all else flows informational immaterialism."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interpretations where quantum mechanics is said to describe an observer's knowledge of the world, rather than the world itself. This approach has some similarity with Bohr's thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"Physics concerns what we can say about nature". (Niels Bohr, quoted in Petersen, A. (1963). The philosophy of Niels Bohr. ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 19(7):8–14.)&lt;/ref&gt; Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to [[instrumentalism]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements.
...A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer's information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The "reduction of the wavepacket" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to "become entangled" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.

Not all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, highlights how well the two-state vector formalism dovetails with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''. In: Juan Gonzalo Muga, Rafael Sala Mayato, Íñigo Egusquiza (eds.): ''Time in Quantum Mechanics'', Volume 1, Lecture Notes in Physics 734, pp.&amp;nbsp;399–447, 2nd ed., Springer, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-540-73472-7}}, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-540-73473-4_13}}, {{arXiv|quant-ph/0105101}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=InKru6zHQWgC&amp;pg=PA443 p. 443]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Branching space-time theories ===
BST theories resemble the many worlds interpretation; however, "the main difference is that the BST interpretation takes the branching of history to be a feature of the topology of the set of events with their causal relationships... rather than a consequence of the separate evolution of different components of a state vector."&lt;ref name="Sharlow" /&gt; In MWI, it is the wave functions that branches, whereas in BST, the space-time topology itself branches.
BST  has applications to Bell's theorem, quantum computation and quantum gravity. It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.&lt;ref name="Sharlow"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; "What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics"] p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other interpretations ===
{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}
As well as the mainstream interpretations discussed above, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].

== Comparison ==
The most common interpretations are summarized in the table below. The values shown in the cells of the table are not without controversy, for the precise meanings of some of the concepts involved are unclear and, in fact, are themselves at the center of the controversy surrounding the given interpretation. For another table comparing interpretations of quantum theory, see reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.04711.pdf|title=What is quantum information?|last=Olimpia,|first=Lombardi,|last2=1979-|first2=Fortin, Sebastian,|last3=Federico,|first3=Holik,|last4=Cristian,|first4=López,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781107142114|location=|pages=|oclc=965759965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No experimental evidence exists that distinguishes among these interpretations. To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to "interpret" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.

Most of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued about by many people.

* {{note label|note1|1}} According to Bohr, the concept of a physical state independent of the conditions of its experimental observation does not have a well-defined meaning. According to Heisenberg the wavefunction represents a probability, but not an objective reality itself in space and time.
* {{note label|note2|2}} According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the wavefunction collapses when a measurement is performed.
* {{note label|note3|3}} Both particle &lt;small&gt;AND&lt;/small&gt; guiding wavefunction are real.
* {{note label|note4|4}} Unique particle history, but multiple wave histories.
* {{note label|note5|5}} But quantum logic is more limited in applicability than Coherent Histories.
* {{note label|note6|6}} Quantum mechanics is regarded as a way of predicting observations, or a theory of measurement.
*  {{note label|note7|7}} Observers separate the universal wavefunction into orthogonal sets of experiences.
* {{note label|note8|8}} In the TI the collapse of the state vector is interpreted as the completion of the transaction between emitter and absorber.
* {{note label|note9|9}} Comparing histories between systems in this interpretation has no well-defined meaning.
* {{note label|note10|10}} Any physical interaction is treated as a collapse event relative to the systems involved, not just macroscopic or conscious observers.
* {{note label|note11|11}} The state of the system is observer-dependent, i.e., the state is specific to the reference frame of the observer.
* {{note label|note12|12}} The transactional interpretation is explicitly non-local.
* {{note label|note13|13}} The assumption of intrinsic periodicity is an element of non-locality consistent  with relativity as the periodicity varies in a causal way.
* {{note label|note14|14}} In the stochastic interpretation is not possible to define velocities for particles, i.e. the paths are not smooth. Moreover, to know the motion of the particles at any moment, you have to know what the Markov process is. However, once we know the exactly initial conditions and the Markov process, the theory is in fact a realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics.
* {{note label|note15|15}} The kind of non-locality required by the theory, sufficient to violate the Bell inequalities, is weaker than that assumed in EPR. In particular, this kind non-locality is compatible with no signaling theorem and Lorentz invariance.
* {{note label|note16|16}} A wavefunction merely encodes an agent’s expectations for future experiences. It is no more real than a probability distribution is in [[Bayesian probability#Dutch book approach|subjective Bayesianism]].
* {{note label|note17|17}} Quantum theory is a tool any agent may use to help manage their expectations. The past comes into play only insofar as an agent’s individual experiences and temperament influence their priors.
* {{note label|note18|18}} Although QBism would eschew this terminology. A change in the wavefunction that an agent ascribes to a system as a result of having an experience represents a change in his or her beliefs about further experiences they may have. See [[Doxastic logic]]. 
* {{note label|note19|19}} Observers, or more properly, participants, are as essential to the formalism as the systems they interact with.

The persons (or entire families) subject to it are [[shunning|shunned]] by their local community.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the most severe sentence imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils, which also impose lesser sanctions such as fines or public shaming. According to a 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' report describing the increasing importance of customary law in Indonesia since 1998, "in a society where the entire cycle of life and religion is tied to ancestral villages, kasepekang is likened to a social and spiritual death sentence."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6279">'''Kneecapping''' is a form of malicious wounding, often as [[torture]], in which the victim is injured in the [[knee]]. The injury is typically inflicted by a low-velocity [[ballistic trauma|gunshot]] to the [[popliteal fossa|knee pit]] with a [[handgun]]. The term is considered a misnomer by medical professionals because only a very small minority of victims suffer damage to the [[patella|kneecap]]. A review of eighty kneecapping victims found that only two had a fractured kneecap. Some victims have their [[elbow]]s and [[ankle]]s shot as well.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|pp=740–741}}

== Treatment ==
The severity of the injury can vary from simple [[soft tissue]] damage to a knee joint fracture with [[neurovascular bundle|neurovascular]] damage. The latter requires several weeks in hospital and intensive [[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient]] [[physical therapy|physiotherapy]] for recovery.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|pp=740–741}} If the damage is too great, [[amputation]] might be necessary,{{sfn|Williams|1997|p=79}} but this rarely occurs. In Northern Ireland thirteen individuals had their legs amputated as a consequence of limb punishment shootings over the duration of [[the Troubles]].{{sfn|Graham|Parke|2004|p=229}} In the long term it is estimated that one out of five victims will walk with a [[limp]] for the rest of their lives.{{sfn|Conroy|1980}}

== History ==
During [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], paramilitaries considered themselves to be law enforcers in their own areas. They used limb punishment shootings to punish drug pushers and child molesters. If the crime was considered to be grave, the victim was also shot in the ankles and elbows, leaving them with six gunshot wounds (colloquially known as a six pack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Duncan|title=Northern Ireland kneecapping victim 'shot four times'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/10056251/northern-ireland-kneecapping-victim-shot-four-times|accessdate=29 October 2016|work=BBC Newbeat|date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2,500 people were victims of these punishment shootings through the duration of the conflict. Those who were attacked carried a [[social stigma]] with them.{{sfn|Williams|1997|pp=78–80}}

The [[Red Brigades]], an [[Italy|Italian]] militant organization, employed these punishment shootings to warn their opponents. They used the method to punish at least 75 people up to December 1978.{{sfn|Orsini|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8dx0xaO__78C&amp;pg=PT13 13], [https://books.google.com/books?id=8dx0xaO__78C&amp;pg=PT121 121]}} More recently this kind of punishment shooting has been employed by [[Hamas]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] to silence their political opponents.{{sfn|Amnesty International UK|2009}}{{sfn|Amnesty International Ireland|2009|p=3}}

The [[Bangladesh Police]] have started kneecapping in the country since 2009 to punish the opposition and preventing them from participating in protests against the government. [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) has published a report on kneecapping in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/29/bangladesh-stop-kneecapping-detainees|title=Bangladesh: Stop ‘Kneecapping’ Detainees|date=29 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In The [[United Kingdom]] although not too common apart from [[Northern Ireland]], when kneecappings have occurred elsewhere a sawn-off or double barrelled shotgun is more likely the choice of firearm due to its easy availability over other weapons among criminals.

==Use as metaphor==
As a [[metaphor]]  "kneecapping" suggests being limited by external imposition in a way that prevents full freedom of movement or utilization of resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">'''Knismesis''' and '''gargalesis''' are the [[science|scientific]] terms, coined in 1897 by [[psychology|psychologist]]s [[G. Stanley Hall]] and [[Arthur Allin]],&lt;ref&gt;Hall, G. S., and A. Allin. (1897) ''The psychology of tickling, laughing and the comic.'' The American Journal of Psychology 9:1&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt; used to describe the two types of [[tickling]]. Knismesis refers to the light, feather-like type of tickling. This type of tickling generally does not induce [[laughter]] and is often accompanied by an [[itch]]ing sensation.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, Christine R. (1999): ''The mystery of ticklish laughter''. American Scientist, July&amp;ndash;August v87 i4 p344(8).&lt;/ref&gt; Gargalesis refers to harder, laughter-inducing tickling, and involves the repeated application of high pressure to sensitive areas.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; While the two terms are used in academic papers, they do not appear in many dictionaries and their origin is rarely declared. The term knismesis comes from the Greek &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;knismos&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; meaning itching&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=knismos&amp;la=greek|title=Definition of knismós in Liddell &amp; Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term gargalesis stems from the Greek &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;gargalizein&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; meaning to tickle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=gargalizein&amp;la=greek|title=Definition of gargalizein in Liddell &amp; Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The suffix &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;-esis&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is used to form nouns of action or process. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.star2.com/living/2018/04/09/tickling-cats-tummy/|title=Tickling A Cat’s Tummy: Invite For Cuddles Or Lacerated Hands? {{!}} Star2.com|date=2018-04-09|work=Star2.com|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knismesis ==
{{wiktionary|knismesis}}
The knismesis phenomenon requires low levels of stimulation to sensitive parts of the body, and can be triggered by a light [[touch]] or by a light [[electric current]]. Knismesis can also be triggered by crawling [[insect]]s or [[parasite]]s, prompting scratching or rubbing at the ticklish spot, thereby removing the pest. It is possible that this function explains why knismesis produces a similar response in many different kinds of animals.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; In a famous example, described in [[Peter Benchley]]'s ''Shark!'', it is possible to tickle the area just under the snout of a [[great white shark]], putting it into a near-[[hypnosis|hypnotic]] [[trance]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17623725.500-the-word-knismesis.html The word knismesis] [[New Scientist]], 7 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gargalesis ==
{{wiktionary|gargalesis}}
The gargalesis type of tickle works on [[primate]]s (which include [[human]]s), and possibly on other species.&lt;ref name = "Provine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Provine | first1 = R. R. | year = 1996 | title = Laughter | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 38–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ultrasonic vocalizations described as "chirping", which play into social behavior and even have therapeutic effects, are reported in rats in response to human tickling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20010728/fob9.asp Science News 2001 - requires signup]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wöhr|first1=M.|last2=Schwarting|first2=R.K.|year=2007|title=Ultrasonic communication in rats: Can playback of 50-kHz calls induce approach behavior?|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|issue=12|pages=e1365|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001365|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panksepp|first1=J.|last2=Burgdorf|first2=J.|year=2003|title="Laughing" rats and the evolutionary antecedents of human joy?|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=79|issue=3|pages=533–547|url=http://caspar.bgsu.edu/~courses/Reading/Papers/2003PanBur.pdf|doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(03)00159-8|pmid=12954448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rygula|first1=R.|last2=Pluta|first2=H.|last3=Popik|first3=P.|year=2012|title=Laughing rats are optimistic|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51959|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051959|pmid=23300582|pmc=3530570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgdorf|first1=J.|last2=Kroes|first2=R.A.|last3=Moskal|first3=J.R.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=Brudzynski|first5=S.M.|last6=Panksepp|first6=J.|year=2008|title=Ultrasonic vocalizations of rats (Rattus norvegicus) during mating, play, and aggression: Behavioral concomitants, relationship to reward, and self-administration of playback|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=122|issue=4|pages=357–367|doi=10.1037/a0012889}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adult female rats may find the tickling sensation adverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paredes-Ramos|first1=P.|last2=Miquel|first2=M.|last3=Manzo|first3=J.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=López-Meraz|first5=M.L.|last6=Coria-Avila|first6=G.A.|year=2012|title=Tickling in juvenile but not adult female rats conditions sexual partner preference|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=107|issue=1|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the [[nerve]]s involved in transmitting "light" touch and itch differ from those nerves that transmit "heavy" touch, pressure and vibration, it is possible that the difference in sensations produced by the two types of tickle is due to the relative proportion of itch sensation versus touch sensation.&lt;ref name = "Selden"&gt;Selden, Samuel T. (2004): ''Tickle''. J Am Acad Dermatol Vol. 50, No. 1: pp. 93–97.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible to trigger a knismesis response in oneself, it is usually impossible to produce '''gargalesthesia''', the gargalesis tickle response, in oneself.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; '''Hypergargalesthesia''' is the condition of extreme sensitivity to tickling.&lt;ref name="Corsini"&gt;Corsini, Raymond J. (1999): ''The Dictionary of Psychology''. Psychology Press: p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;.  The words knismesis and gargalesis were both used by [[Susie Dent]] in an episode of the BBC game show, [[Would I Lie to You? (game show)|Would I Lie to You?]] (Season 11, episode 4).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10831">A '''knowledge society''' generates, shares and makes available to all members of the [[society]] knowledge that may be used to improve the [[human condition]]. A knowledge society differs from an [[information society]] in that the former serves to transform information into resources that allow society to take effective action while the latter only creates and disseminates the [[raw data]].&lt;ref name="Castelfranchi"&gt;Castelfranchi, C. (2007).  [https://jcom.sissa.it/sites/default/files/documents/Jcom0604(2007)C03.pdf Six critical remarks on science and the construction of the knowledge society].  ''Journal of Science Communication, 6''(4), 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity to gather and analyze information has existed throughout [[History of the world|human history.]] However, the idea of the present-day knowledge society is based on the vast increase in data creation and [[Science communication|information dissemination]] that results from the [[innovation]] of [[Information technology|information technologies]].&lt;ref name="Vallima"&gt;Vallima, J. &amp; Hoffman, D. (2008).  Knowledge society discourse and higher education.  ''Higher Education, 56''(3), 265-285.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] World Report addresses the definition, content and future of knowledge societies.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2005).  Toward knowledge societies.  ''UNESCO World Report''.  Conde-sur-Noireau, France:  Imprimerie Corlet.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information and communication technology ==

The growth of [[Information and communication technology]] (ICT) has significantly increased the world’s capacity for creation of raw data and the speed at which it is produced. The advent of the [[Internet]] delivered unheard-of quantities of [[information]] to people. The [[evolution]] of the internet from [[Web 1.0]] to [[Web 2.0]] offered individuals tools to connect with each other [[World Wide Web|worldwide]] as well as become content users and producers. Innovation in [[Information technology|digital technologies]] and [[mobile device]]s offers individuals a means to connect anywhere anytime where digital technologies are accessible. Tools of ICT have the potential to transform [[education]], [[training]], [[employment]] and access to life-sustaining resources for all members of society.&lt;ref name="VanWeert"&gt;van Weert, T. J. (2006).  Education of the twenty-first century:  New professionalism in lifelong learning, knowledge development and knowledge sharing.  ''Education and Information Technologies, 11''(3), 217-237.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
However, this capacity for individuals to produce and use data on a global scale does not necessarily result in [[knowledge]] creation. Contemporary media delivers seemingly endless amounts of information and yet, the information alone does not create knowledge. For knowledge creation to take place, reflection is required to create [[awareness]], meaning and understanding. The improvement of human circumstances requires critical analysis of information to develop the knowledge that assists humankind.&lt;ref name="Castelfranchi" /&gt; Absent reflection and [[critical thinking]], information can actually become "non-knowledge", that which is false or inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Innerarity"&gt;Innerarity, D. (2012).  Power and knowledge:  The politics of the knowledge society, ''European Journal of Social Theory, 16''(1), 3-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The anticipated Semantic Web 3.0 and Ubiquitous Web 4.0 will move both information and knowledge creation forward in their capacities to use intelligence to digitally create meaning independent of user-driven ICT.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, P.L. (2010).  Applying social systems thinking and community informatics thinking in education.  In Rudestam, K.E., &amp; Schoenholtz-Read, J. (Eds.), 91-128.  ''Handbook of online learning''.  Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berners-Lee, T. (2009, Mar 13).  Tim Berners-Lee:  The next web of open, linked data [Video].  Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social theory ==

The [[social theory]] of a knowledge society explains how knowledge is fundamental to the [[politics]], [[economics]], and culture of [[Modernity|modern society.]] Associated ideas include the [[knowledge economy]] created by economists and the [[learning society]] created by educators.&lt;ref name="Vallima" /&gt; Knowledge is a commodity to be traded for economic prosperity. In a knowledge society, [[individual]]s, [[Community|communities]], and organizations produce knowledge-intensive work. [[Peter Drucker]] viewed knowledge as a key [[Economic resources|economic resource]] and coined the term [[knowledge worker]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P.F. (1969).  ''The age of discontinuity:  Guidelines to our changing society''.  New York, NY:  Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; Fast forward to the present day, and in this knowledge-intensive environment, knowledge begets knowledge, new competencies develop, and the result is innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Paavola, S. &amp; Hakkarainen, K. (2005).  The knowledge creation metaphor:  An emergent epistemological approach to learning.  Science &amp; Education, 14, 535-557.&lt;/ref&gt;   
   
A knowledge society promotes [[human rights]] and offers equal, inclusive, and [[universal access to all knowledge]] creation. The UNESCO World Report establishes four principles that are essential for development of an equitable knowledge society:&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;
*[[Cultural diversity]]	
*Equal access to [[education]]
*[[Universal Access|Universal access]] to information (in the [[public domain]])
*[[Freedom of speech|Freedom of expression]]

However, they acknowledge that the [[digital divide]] is an obstacle to achievement of genuine knowledge societies. Access to the internet is available to 39 percent of the world’s population.&lt;ref&gt;Sanou, B. (2013).  The world in 2013:  ICT fact and figures.  Retrieved from http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic represents growth as well as a continued gap. Among the many challenges that contribute to a global digital divide are issues regarding economic resources, [[geography]], age, [[gender]], [[language]], [[education]], social and cultural background, [[employment]] and [[Disability|disabilities]].&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;

== Politics ==

To reduce the span of the digital divide, [[Leadership|leaders]] and [[Politician|policymakers]] worldwide must first develop and understanding of knowledge societies and second, create and deploy initiatives that will universally benefit all populations. The public expects politicians and public institutions to act rationally and rely on relevant knowledge for [[decision-making]].  Yet, in many cases, there are no definitive answers for some of the issues that impact [[human]]kind. [[Science]] is no longer viewed as the provider of unquestionable knowledge and sometimes raises more uncertainty in its search for knowledge. The very advancement of knowledge creates the existence of increased [[ignorance]] or non-knowledge.&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, M. (2010). ''Ignorance and Surprise: Science, Society, and Ecological Design.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that public policy must learn to manage doubt, [[probability]], [[risk]] and uncertainty while making the best decisions possible.&lt;ref name="Innerarity" /&gt;

To confront the uncertainty that comes from an increase in both knowledge and the resulting lack of knowledge, members of a society disagree and make decisions using [[Justification (theology)|justification]] and [[observation]] of consequences.&lt;ref name="Innerarity" /&gt; Public policy may operate with the intent to prevent the worst possible outcome versus find the perfect solution.  [[Democratization]] of expert knowledge occurs when a knowledge society produces and relies on more experts. Expert knowledge is no longer exclusive to certain individuals, professional or organizations. If in a knowledge society, knowledge is a public good to which all people have access, any individual may also serve as a creator of knowledge and receive credit as an expert. Since politicians rely on expert knowledge for decision making, the layperson who may lack specialized knowledge might hold a view that serves as expertise to the political process.

== Education ==

As technologies are deployed to improve global information access, the role of education will continue to grow and change. Education is viewed as a basic human right.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt; For a society where [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[counting]] are a requisite for [[Activities of daily living|daily living]], skills in reading, [[writing]], and [[Elementary arithmetic|basic arithmetic]] are critical for future learning. However, in a knowledge society, education is not restricted to school. The advent of ICT allows learners to seek information and develop knowledge at any time and any place where access is available and unrestricted. In these circumstances, the skill of learning to learn is one of the most important tools to help people acquire formal and informal education.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt; In a knowledge society supported by ICT, the ability to locate, classify and sort information is essential. Equipped with this skill, the use of ICT becomes an active versus a passive endeavor and integral to literacy and lifelong learning.&lt;ref name="UnitedNations" /&gt;

One marker of a knowledge society is continuous innovation that demands [[lifelong learning]], knowledge development, and [[knowledge sharing]]. The institution of education will need to become responsive to changing demands. Education [[professional]]s will need to learn along with everyone else, and as leaders of changing designs in learning, they will serve as a bridge between [[technology]] and [[Education|teaching]].&lt;ref name="VanWeert" /&gt; The ability to individually reflect on personal learning requirements and seek knowledge in whatever method is appropriate characterizes lifelong learning. One model that supports this type of learning is the [[W. Edwards Deming]] [[PDCA|Plan-do-check-act cycle]]&lt;ref name="VanWeert" /&gt; that promotes [[Continual improvement process|continuous improvement]]. Educational professionals will need to prepare learners to be accountable for their own lifelong learning.

Lanner Group continued to develop the WITNESS platform further in parallel to developing its mainstay product of the same name, and since 2002 has introduced new systems providing niche simulation packages for police and healthcare organisations called ''PRISM'' and ''PX-Sim'' respectively.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; In 2006 the company unveiled a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based simulation engine called ''L-SIM'' which is embedded in [[Business Process Management]] (BPM) solutions software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Waller AP, Clark MF, Enstone LR |title=L-SIM : Simulating BPMN Diagrams with a Purpose Built Engine | journal=Proceedings of the 2006 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC 06)|year=2006 | pages=591–597 | publisher=Winter Simulation Conference | isbn=1-4244-0500-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May the same year, a technology partnership with BPM solution provider [[IDS Scheer]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ids-scheer.com/en/News/IDS_Scheer_and_Lanner_announce_partnership_for_Java_based_business_process_simulation/1680.html?referer=23380 | title=IDS Scheer and Lanner announce partnership for Java based business process simulation | publisher=IDS-Sheer.com | accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The L-SIM product is now the simulation engine of IDS Scheer's ARIS Business Simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bob Violino | url=http://www.ciozone.com/index.php/Management/BPM-3-Vendors-To-Watch.html | title=BPM: 3 Vendors To Watch | publisher=CIO Zone | accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's WITNESS platform technology is therefore embedded into current [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], and [[IBM]] [[Business Analysis|BPA]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lanner.com/en/business-partners.cfm | title=Lanner Group company website 'Business Partners' page | accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 2010 the company's main investor was private equity company [[3i]]. On 18 March 2010 Lanner Group announced that it had secured a £3 million new investment deal with ''NVM Private Equity'' replacing [[3i]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worksmanagement.co.uk/article/23429/Lanner-Group-secures-new-funding-with-NVM-tol-execute-growth-plans.aspx | title=Lanner Group secures new funding with NVM to execute growth plans | author=Brian Tinham | publisher=Works Management news | date=22 March 2010 | accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3i continues to retain an interest in Lanner Group as a small minority investor.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;

'''Minnie M. Kenny''' (1929–August 17, 2005) was a [[cryptanalyst]], educator and equal opportunity activist who worked at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). She served as Deputy Commandant at the [[National Cryptologic School]] and was responsible for creating scholarships for NSA employees. The recipient of numerous awards, including the Meritorious and the Exceptional Civilian Service Awards, the presidential Meritorious Executive Award and Distinguished Service Award of the CIA, Kenny was inducted into the [[NSA Hall of Honor|Cryptologic Hall of Honor]] in 2009.

==Biography==
Minnie McNeal was born in 1929 in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Roelofsma|2005}} After graduating from the [[Philadelphia High School for Girls]], she worked for the Philadelphia Commerce Department and the [[United States Census Bureau]] in [[Washington, D. C.]], before being hired in 1951 to work at [[Arlington Hall]] for the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]]. She was part of the first group of [[African Americans]] who were allowed to work upstairs in the Operations Division, out of the basement, and was assigned to the 'U' Street School for training.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}} After her training and the change of the organization from military footing to the [[National Security Agency]] in 1952, McNeal was assigned as a communications clerk to the ALLO (All Other (non-Soviet)) linguistics unit.{{sfn|National Security Agency|1/2009}} She was particularly well known for her expertise in cryptanalysis, language and traffic analysis and worked with an elite "think tank" at NSA, to develop programs for [[cryptanalysis]] and language, serving as chair of the agency's Language Panel.{{sfn|National Security Agency|12/2009}} In 1972, McNeal married Herbert Cornelius Kenny, one of the singers of [[The Ink Spots]], with whom she had a daughter Daphne.{{sfn|''The Washington Post''|1992}}

In 1973, Kenny became the founding editor of NSA's Group B journal ''Dragon Seeds'' and pressed for each cryptanalyst to have their own personal computer as a necessary tool.{{sfn|Kenny|1978|p=11}} From 1975 to 1981, she served in the Office of Techniques and Standards of the NSA, as the chief of the language and linguistics.{{sfn|Stokes|1993}} In 1980, she was the recipient of the Meritorious Civilian Service Award.{{sfn|National Security Agency|1/2009}} Beginning in 1982,{{sfn|Stokes|1993}} Kenny served as Deputy Commandant at the National Cryptologic School,{{sfn|National Security Agency|12/2009}} and worked with traditional Black colleges and universities to increase diversity.{{sfn|Roelofsma|2005}} She introduced computer assisted teaching techniques and founded the Computer Assisted Learning and Instruction Consortium (CALICO) to bring professional language teachers and those who use language together in an international association.{{sfn|Stokes|1993}} In 1984, Kenny was awarded a second civilian honor, the Exceptional Civilian Service Award by the NSA and both presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] awarded her with the Meritorious Executive Award. After a decade working to improve the school, Kenny served on the Department of Defense Congressional Task Force on Women, Minorities, and the Handicapped in Science and Technology and as the NSA Director for Equal Employment Opportunity, before her 1993 retirement. She was a recipient of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s Distinguished Service Award.{{sfn|National Security Agency|1/2009}}

Kenny then served as a Congressional Fellow on the staff of Congressman [[Louis Stokes]] and worked on the drafting of the Underground Railroad Act{{sfn|Roelofsma|2005}} of 1997, which was designed to preserve and protect the history of significant buildings associated with the [[Underground Railroad|historic organization]].{{sfn|Larkin|1997}}

Kenny died August 17, 2005, in [[Columbia, Maryland]], and was buried at St. John's Cemetery in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]].{{sfn|''The Baltimore Sun''|2005}} Posthumously, in 2009, she was inducted into the [[NSA Hall of Honor|Cryptologic Hall of Honor]].

[[PBS]] news anchor [[Gwen Ifill]] is said to be the originator of the phrase.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"/&gt;  [[Charlton McIlwain]], a professor at [[New York University]], defines the syndrome as white women perpetually occupying a privileged role as violent crime victims in news media reporting, and concludes that missing white woman syndrome functions as a type of [[racial hierarchy]] in the cultural imagery of the West.&lt;ref name=NYU&gt;{{cite news |date=May 9, 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22441124 |title=Cleveland abductions: Do white victims get more attention? |work=BBC |quote=Charlton McIlwain, professor New York University: White women occupy a privileged role as violent crime victims in news media reporting. |accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva categorizes the racial component of missing white woman syndrome as a form of racial grammar, through which [[white supremacy]] is normalized by implicit or even invisible standards.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt;

Missing white woman syndrome has led to a number of [[Right-wing populism|right-wing]] [[Law and order (politics)|tough on crime]] measures that were named for white women who disappeared and were subsequently found harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Land Stein, University of Southern Mississippi (2012) THE CULTURAL COMPLEX OF INNOCENCE: AN EXAMINATION OF MEDIA AND SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF MISSING WHITE WOMAN SYNDROME http://aquila.usm.edu/dissertations/858/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laurie Essig Ph.D.|date=2014|title=Racial Politics in the US and the Figure of the White Lady.

Also noteworthy was that news coverage of missing black women was more likely to focus on the victim's baggage, such as abusive boyfriends or a troubled past, while coverage of white women tends to focus on their roles as mothers or daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cheryl L.

==Media coverage==
===United States===
With regard to missing children, statistical research which compares national media reports with [[FBI]] data shows that there is marked under-representation of [[African American]] children in media reports&lt;!--of all kinds, or of crimes only?--&gt; relative to non-African American children. A subsequent study found that girls from [[minority group]]s were the most under-represented in these missing-children news reports by a very large margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Min|first=Seong-Jae|author2=John C Feaster|title=Missing Children in National News Coverage: Racial and Gender Representations of Missing Children Cases|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=July–September 2010|volume=27|issue=3|pages=201–216|url=https://www.academia.edu/857391/Missing_Children_in_National_News_Coverage_Racial_and_Gender_Representations_of_Missing_Children_Cases|accessdate=May 9, 2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zach Sommers, a [[Sociology|sociologist]] at [[Northwestern University]], noted that while there is a sizable body of research that shows that white people are more likely than people of color to appear in news coverage as victims of violent crime there is relatively little when it comes to missing persons cases.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; In 2013, Sommers cross-referenced the missing persons coverage of four national and local media outlets against the FBI's missing persons database. Sommers found black people received disproportionately less coverage than whites and men received disproportionately less coverage than women; Sommers could not directly assess the number of missing white women in the FBI files due to how the data was structured but concluded that there was circumstantial—although not statistically conclusive—evidence that white women received disproportionate coverage.&lt;ref name="Demby"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gene |last=Demby |title=What We Know (And Don't Know) About 'Missing White Women Syndrome' |date=April 13, 2017 |publisher=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/13/523769303/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-missing-white-women-syndrome |accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; In the same study, professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva elucidated that the subtle standard of placing a premium on white lives in the news helps to maintain and reinforce a [[racial hierarchy]] with whites at the top. For example, [[black women]] are members of both a marginalized racial group and a marginalized gender group.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; Crucially, though, black women have an “intersectional experience [that] is greater than the sum of [[racism]] and sexism.” In other words, like white women, black women are subject to sexism, but the form of that sexism differs for black women because of the compounding effects of [[racial discrimination]]; with missing white woman syndrome being a pertinent manifestation of this social phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Demby"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; Sociologists note that the tone of media coverage for black female victims differs markedly from coverage of white female victims in that the former are more likely to be blamed for purportedly putting themselves in harm's way, either knowingly or unknowingly. [[Victim blaming]] in this context reinforces the notion that black female victims are not only less innocent, but also less worthy of rescue relative to white women.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt; Other observers note the lack of publicity given to black female victims of [[police brutality]] in news coverage, attributing the silence to a tradition of “sexism and [[patriarchy]]” in American society.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt;

A report that aired on [[CNN]] noted the differences between the level of media coverage given to Caucasian women like [[Murder of Laci Peterson|Laci Peterson]] and [[Natalee Holloway]], who disappeared in 2002 and 2005 respectively, and [[Murder of LaToyia Figueroa|LaToyia Figueroa]], a pregnant Black Hispanic woman. Figueroa disappeared in Philadelphia the same year Holloway disappeared.

Kym Pasqualini, president of the [[National Center for Missing Adults]], observed that media outlets tend to focus on "[[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]" – typically, affluent young white women and teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/forensics/americas_missing/3.html |title=Damsels in Distress |first=David |last=Krajicek |page=3 |work=[[TruTV|TruTV.com]] |accessdate=July 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728062922/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/forensics/americas_missing/3.html |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' article about the [[disappearance of Tiffany Whitton]], journalist [[Tom Junod]] observed that women of lower social status such as Whitton, a 26-year-old unemployed drug addict who was on parole, do not get much media attention as "media outlets are ruthlessly selective, and they tend to prefer women who are white, pretty, and, above all, innocent". Whitton's mother stated that producers of shows like ''[[Nancy Grace (TV series)|Nancy Grace]]'' told her they weren't interested in her daughter's case.&lt;ref name="Tiffany Whitton"&gt;{{cite news|last=Junod|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Junod|title=Missing: The Curious Anomaly of Tiffany Whitton's Disappearance|url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a44402/missing-tom-junod/|newspaper=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=April 29, 2016|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Cory L. Armstrong wrote in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that "the pattern of choosing only young, white, middle-class women for the full damsel treatment says a lot about a nation that likes to believe it has consigned [[Race (human classification)|race]] and [[Social class|class]] to irrelevance".&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"/&gt; 

===Canada===
According to a study published in ''The Law and Society Association'', [[First Nations|aboriginal]] women who go missing in Canada receive 27 times less news coverage than white women; they also receive "dispassionate and less-detailed, headlines, articles, and images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gilchrist |first=Kristen |title=Invisible Victims: Disparity in Print-News Media Coverage of Missing/Murdered Aboriginal and White Women |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/9/1/4/p239140_index.html |work=AllAcademic.com |date=May 27, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
University of Leicester Criminology Professor Yvonne Jewkes cites the [[murder of Milly Dowler]], the [[murder of Sarah Payne]], and the [[Soham murders]] as examples of "eminently newsworthy stories" about girls from "respectable" middle-class families and backgrounds whose parents used the news media effectively.&lt;ref name=Jewkes&gt;{{cite book|title=Media and Crime|author=Yvonne Jewkes|pages=52–53|year=2004|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=0-7619-4765-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that, in contrast, the street [[murder of Damilola Taylor]], a 10-year- old boy from Nigeria, initially received little news coverage, with reports initially concentrating upon street crime levels and community policing, and largely ignoring the victim. Even when Damilola's father flew into the UK from Nigeria to make press statements and television appearances, the level of public outcry did not, Jewkes asserts, reach "the near hysterical outpourings of anger and sadness that accompanied the deaths of Sarah, [[Murder of Milly Dowler|Milly]], Holly, and Jessica".&lt;ref name=Jewkes /&gt;

In January 2006, London Police Commissioner [[Ian Blair]] described the media as [[institutional racism|institutionally racist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4651368.stm |title=Met chief accuses media of racism |publisher=BBC News |date=January 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4654224.stm |title=The story of two murder victims |publisher=BBC News |date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, he had referred to the murder of two young girls in [[Soham]] in 2002. He said "almost nobody" understood why it became such a big story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4653130.stm |title=Blair apologises to Soham parents |publisher=BBC News |date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two cases of missing white girl syndrome that have been given as contrasting examples: the [[murder of Hannah Williams]] and the [[murder of Danielle Jones]]. It was suggested that Jones received more coverage than Williams because Jones was a middle-class schoolgirl, whilst Williams was from a working-class background with a [[nose piercing|stud in her nose]] and estranged parents.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Homicide|author=Fiona Brookman|year=2005|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=0-7619-4755-8|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Sandile Memela, chief director for [[social cohesion]] at [[South Africa]]'s [[Department of Arts and Culture (South Africa)|Department of Arts and Culture]], noted amidst the [[Oscar Pistorius]] [[Trial of Oscar Pistorius|trial]] that there existed substantial differences between how media outlets reported on the murders of [[Reeva Steenkamp]] and [[Zanele Khumalo]]; two South African models, respectively white and black, who had been murdered by their boyfriends under nearly identical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Memela"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/the-trial-next-door-oscar-pistorius-gets-the-headlines-but-what-about-thato-kutumela-9194821.html |title=The trial next door: Oscar Pistorius gets the headlines, but what about Thato Kutumela? |publisher=The Independent |date=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memela asserted that the discrepancy between the media coverage of the Steenkamp and Khumala murders amounted to "[[Institutional racism|structural racism]]" within South African society, and stated: "As a country we seem to have chosen to ignore the agony, pain and suffering of the Khumalo family for no other reason than that they are black."&lt;ref name="Memela"/&gt;

On September 11, 2014, the South African news network SABC3 aired an investigative report which raised concerns around the “Missing White Woman Syndrome”; where the death of Steenkamp was juxtaposed with the death of Zanele Khumalo.&lt;ref name="SABC3"/&gt;

===Other alleged cases of disproportionate media interest===
====Jessica Lynch====
[[File:JessicaLynch02.jpeg|thumb|News coverage of [[Jessica Lynch]]'s rescue]]
Social commentaries pointed to media bias in the coverage of soldier [[Jessica Lynch]] versus that of her fellow soldiers, [[Shoshana Johnson]] and [[Lori Piestewa]]. All three were ambushed in the same attack during the [[Iraq War]] on March 23, 2003, with Piestewa being killed and Lynch and Johnson being injured and taken prisoner. Lynch, a young, blonde, white woman, received far more media coverage than Johnson (a black woman and a single mother) and Piestewa (a [[Hopi]] from an impoverished background, and also a single mother), with media critics suggesting that the media gave more attention to the woman with whom audiences supposedly more readily identify.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news |title= A case of race?

Lynch herself leveled harsh criticism at this disproportionate coverage that focused only on her, stating in a congressional testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]:

{{quote|I am still confused as to why they chose to lie and tried to make me a legend when the real heroics of my fellow soldiers that day were, in fact, legendary. People like Lori Piestewa and First Sergeant Dowdy who picked up fellow soldiers in harm's way. Or people like Patrick Miller and Sergeant Donald Walters who actually fought until the very end. The bottom line is the American people are capable of determining their own ideals of heroes and they don't need to be told elaborate tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070424110022.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220085535/http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20070424110022.pdf

====Presumed kidnapping of "blonde angel" in Greece====
In October 2013, a girl estimated to be about 4 years of age was found in the custody of a [[Romani people|Roma]] couple in Greece and was presumed to have been abducted.  The story about the "blonde angel" and the search for her biological parents received international media coverage.  A Romani rights activist commented on the case to say "imagine if the situation were reversed and the children were brown and the parents were white".&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/19/21036597-tips-pour-in-after-blonde-girl-without-an-identity-found-in-roma-camp-in-greece Tips pour in after blonde girl 'without an identity' found in Roma camp in Greece] ''[[NBC News]]'' October 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Blumberg (October 28, 2013), [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/antonia-blumberg/blumberg_b_4170868.html Why the Roma 'Blond Angel' Ignited a Week of Racial Profiling] ''[[Huffington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Adams (November 8, 2013), [https://archive.is/20140406192217/http://www.collegiatetimes.com/opinion/article_a879ba26-6391-11e3-99d9-001a4bcf6878.html Abduction case reveals bias on basis of race] ''[[Collegiate Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/world/europe/for-the-roma-fears-of-kidnapping-in-europe-only-mirror-their-own.html For the Roma, Fears of kidnapping in Europe Only Mirror Their Own] ''[[The New York Times]]'' October 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The child was later identified as Maria Ruseva.

====Murder trial defendants====
Critics have also cited excessive media coverage of murder trials where the defendant is female, white, young and attractive, and included them along with Missing White Woman Syndrome instances in an all-encompassing narrative nicknamed the "woman in jeopardy" or "damsel in distress" genre.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farhi"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Farhi |title=Bad girls and gone girls: Why the media tired of ‘missing white women’ |date=December 13, 2015 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bad-girls-and-gone-girls-why-the-media-tired-of-missing-white-women/2015/12/09/5660fb52-9934-11e5-94f0-9eeaff906ef3_story.html |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, the media will focus on the accused, rather than the victim as in Missing White Woman Syndrome cases, and they will be more ambiguous about their guilt than in other criminal cases regardless of evidence. Cited examples include [[Amanda Knox]], [[Jodi Arias]] and [[Casey Anthony]].

==Cited instances==
&lt;!-- THIS IS NOT A LIST OF MISSING PERSONS. ONLY ADD CASES THAT HAVE BEEN LINKED TO MWWS IN RELIABLE SOURCES --&gt;
The following missing person cases have been cited as instances of missing white woman syndrome; media commentators on the phenomenon regard them as garnering a disproportionate level of media coverage relative to contemporary cases involving missing girls or women of non-white ethnicities, and missing males of all ethnicities. The date of death or disappearance is given in parentheses.

[[Morality]] is “the ability to distinguish right from wrong, to act on this distinction and to experience pride when we do the right things and guilt or shame when we do not.” Both Piaget  and Kohlberg &lt;ref name="a"/&gt; made significant contributions to this area of study. Developmental psychologists have divided the subject of morality into three main topics: affective element, cognitive element, and behavioral element. The affective element consists of the emotional response to actions that may be considered right or wrong. This is the emotional part of morality that covers the feeling of guilt as well as empathy. The cognitive element focuses on how people use social cognitive processes to determine what actions are right or wrong. For example, if an eight-year-old child was informed by an authoritative adult not to eat the cookies in the jar and then was left in the room alone with the cookies, what is going on in the child's brain? The child may think “I really want that cookie, but it would be wrong to eat it and I will get into trouble.” Lastly, the behavioral element targets how people behave when they are being enticed to deceive or when they are assisting someone who needs help.

== Moral Affect ==
Moral affect is “emotion related to matters of right and wrong”. Such emotion includes shame, guilt, embarrassment, and pride. Shame is correlated with the disapproval by one's peers. Guilt is correlated with the disapproval of oneself. Embarrassment is feeling disgraced while in the public eye. Pride is a feeling generally brought about by positive opinion of oneself when admired by one's peers &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~steve/Tangney.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empathy]] is also tied in with moral affect and is an emotional unfolding that allows you to be able to understand how another person feels. If we see someone is crying, then we also feel sad. If someone has just accomplished a lifelong goal, we bask in his happiness. Empathy falls under the affective component of morality and is the main reasoning behind selflessness. According to theorist Martin Hoffman, empathy plays a key role in the progression of morality. Empathy causes people to be more prominent in prosocial behavior as discussed earlier. Without empathy, there would be no humanity.

== Moral Reasoning ==
Moral reasoning is the thinking process involved in deciding whether an act is right or wrong.&lt;ref name=a&gt;Sigelman, Carol K., and David R. Shaffer. Life-span Human Development. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole Pub., 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Feeds off the development of social cognition that helps us experience other people's distress. These skills also allow us to go beyond our egocentrism to construct a concept of reciprocity and fairness. According to piaget and kholberg, Moral reasoning progresses through a constant sequence, a very fixed and universal order of stages, each of which contains a consistent way of thinking about moral issues that are all distinct from one another.

=== Jean Piaget’s view ===

Jean Piaget's view: Jean Piaget &lt;ref&gt;http://tigger.uic.edu/~lnucci/MoralEd/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt; was the first psychologist to suggest a theory of moral development. According to Piaget, development only emerges with action, and a person constructs and reconstructs his knowledge of the world as the result of new interactions with his environment. Piaget said that people pass through three different stages of moral reasoning: Premoral period, heteronomous morality, and Autonomous morality. The first stage, premoral, occurs during the preschool years: children show very little awareness or understanding of rules and cannot be considered moral beings. The next stage, heteronomous which is defined as under the rule of another, and it involves children ages 6 to 10 years old. The child will take rules more seriously, believing that they are handed down by authority figures and are sacred and never to be altered. No matter if the intentions were good or bad, any violator to these passed-down rules will be judged as wrongdoing. The last stage, Autonomous, appears at 10 to 11 years of age. Children begin to appreciate that rules are agreements between individuals.

=== Lawrence Kohlberg’s view ===

Lawrence Kohlberg's view: Influenced by Piaget's work, Kohlberg created an influential cognitive development theory of moral development. Like Piaget, Kohlberg formulated that moral growth occurs in a very universal and consistent sequence of three moral levels, but for him the stages in the sequence are connected with one another, and grows out of the preceding stage. Kholberg's view represents a more complex way of thinking about moral issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004152005/http://faculty.plts.edu/gpence/html/kohlberg.htm |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stages of Moral Reasoning ====

The first level of Kohlberg's moral reasoning is called [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|preconventional morality]]. In this stage, children obey rules more externally. This means the children will conform to rules authority sets for them, to avoid punishment or to receive personal rewards. There are two stages within preconventional morality. The first is punishment and obedience orientation. In this stage, the child determines how wrong his action was according to the punishment he receives. If he does not get scolded for his bad act, he will believe he did nothing wrong. The second stage of preconventional morality is called instrumental hedonism. The main principle for this stage is “You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.” A person in the second stage conforms to rules for personal gain. There is a hint of understanding the ruler's perspective, although, the main objective is to gain the benefit in return.

The next level is [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|conventional morality]]. At this level, many moral values have been internalized by the individual. He works to obey rules set by authority and to seek approval. The points of views of others are now clearly recognized and taken into serious consideration. The first stage to this level is labeled “Good boy” or “Good girl” morality. The following stage captures the golden rule “treat others the way you want to be treated.” The emphasis in this stage consists of being nice and meaning well. What is seen as “good” is now what pleases and helps others. The last stage of this level is “Authority and social order- maintaining morality.” This is conforming to set rules created by legitimate authorities that benefits society as a whole. The basis of reciprocation is growing more complex. The purpose of conforming is no longer based on the fear of punishment, but on the value people place on respecting law and doing one's duty for society.

The final level of moral reasoning is [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|postconventional morality]]. The individual determines what the moral ideal for the society is. The individual will begin to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is legal. He will recognize some laws violate basic moral principles. He will go beyond perspectives of social groups or authorities and will start to accept the perspectives of all points of views around the world. In the first stage of postconventional, called “morality of contract, individual rights and democratic accepted law”, all people willingly work towards benefitting everyone. They understand all social groups within a society have different values, but believe all intellectual individuals would agree on two points. First point being freedom of liberty and life. Second, they would agree to having democratic vote for changing unfair laws and improving their society. The final stage of the final level of Kohlberg's moral reasoning is “morality of individual principles of conscience”, At this highest stage of moral reasoning, Kohlberg defines his stage 6 subjects as having a clear and broad concept of universal principles. The stage 6 thinker does not create the basis for morality. Instead, he explores, through self-evaluation, complex principles of respect for all individuals and for their rights that all religions or moral authorities would view as moral. Kohlberg stopped using stage 6 in his scoring manual, saying it was a “theoretical stage”. He began to score postconventional responses only up to stage 5.

== Moral Behavior: The Social Learning Theory ==

The Social Learning Theory is based on the observing of others and modeling behaviors, emotions and attitude of others. This theory is derived from the concept or perspective of behaviorism but has elements of cognitive learning as well. The theory says that people and especially children learn from observing others and their environment around them. It also says that imitation or modeling has a major role in learning and development of the person and their beliefs or morals. Albert Bandura was a major contributor to the theory of social learning and made many contributions to the field with social experiments and research. The social learning theory says that children learn and develop morals from observing what is around them and having role models that they imitate their behavior and learn from. Role models guide children indirectly with developing morals and morality. By watching the response of others and society around them, children learn what is acceptable and what is not acceptable and try to act similar to what is deemed acceptable by the society around them.

For example, a child's older brother or sister tends to serve as one of their first role models, especially because they share the same surroundings and authority figures. When the older child misbehaves or does something unacceptable the younger child takes the older one as an example and acts like him or her. However, if the parent punishes the older child or there is a consequence to their behavior, the younger child often does not act like the older one because they were able to observe that that behavior was “unacceptable” by the “society” surrounding them, meaning their family. This example coincides with the fact that children know that stealing, killing, and lying is bad, and honesty, kindness, and being polite is good.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, A. J., &amp; Owen, S. V. (2006). Mechanisms of moral disengagement. Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions of Morality: Evolutionary Theory ==

The Evolutionary Theory of Morality tries to explain morality and its development in terms of [[evolution]] and how it may at first seem contradictory for humans to have morals and morality in the evolutionary opinion. Evolution has many beliefs and parts to it but as most commonly seen, it is the survival of the fittest. This behavior is driven from the desire to pass on your genes. Whether that means being selfish or caring for your young just to make sure that your genes survive. That may seem to conflict with morality and having morals, however some argue that that may be related and having morality and morals might actually be a factor that contributes to the theory of evolution. Additionally, humans have developed communities and a social lifestyle which makes it necessary to develop morals. In an evolutionary view, a human being that acts immorally will suffer consequences, such as paying a fine, going to prison, or being an outcast. Whatever it is, there is a loss to that human. Therefore, that individual eventually learns that to be accepted in society, it is necessary to develop morals and act on them.&lt;ref&gt;Crain, W. C. (1985). Theories of development. (2nd ed., pp. 118-136). New York: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Infant ==
An infant is not held accountable for wrongdoings because an infant is considered to be amoral. Infants do not have the ability to understand morality at this stage of their life. Infancy ranges from birth to the age of two. It is during this time that infants learn how to be [[prosocial]] and empathetic by observing those around them.&lt;ref name=a /&gt;

=== Early moral training ===

An example of early moral training is given by Roger Burton. Roger Burton observed his 1-year-old daughter Ursula take her sister's Halloween candy. The older sister quickly scolded the infant for doing so. After a week had passed the infant went and stole candy again but was confronted by her mother this time. Yet again the infant stole her sister's candy, so Burton approached his daughter himself. As Burton was about to say something to Ursula, she spoke and said, “No this is Maria’s, not Ursula’s.” This specific example given by Burton shows how the infant grows and imputes morality slowly but surely.&lt;ref name=a /&gt; Over time infants start to understand that their behavior can cause repercussions. The infants learn by observing their surrounding environment. A 1 year old may cease to commit a certain action because of feelings of apprehension due to past experiences of criticism. Both disapproval and reward are key factors in furthering the infants’ development. If a baby is especially close to his mom, her disapproval and reward are that much more impactful in this process than it would be for a baby who was unattached to his mom. Infants are excellent at reading the emotions of others which in turn directs them in knowing what is good and what is bad.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Ross A. "Understanding Values in Relationship: The Development of Conscience." (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; A strong attachment between parent and infant is the key to having success with the infants’ socialization. If the relationship between the two is not stable by 15 months, at 4 the child will show animosity and troublesome behavior. At 5 the child is likely to show signs of destructive behavior. In order to ensure this does not happen, a mutually responsive orientation among the parent and offspring is necessary. Meaning, “A close emotionally positive and cooperative relationship in which child and care giver cares about each other and are sensitive to each other’s needs.” &lt;ref name=a /&gt; With this bond, parents can help their child's conscience grow.&lt;ref name=a /&gt;

=== Empathy and Prosocial Behavior ===

Empathy and Prosocial Behavior: Unlike what Freud, Kohlberg, and Piaget said about infants being focused solely on themselves, Krebs's has a different take on the infant. Krebs's outlook on infants is that they can and do express signs of empathy and prosocial behavior. After being born, newborns show empathy in a primitive way by showing signs of agony when hearing other babies cry. Although it is not certain whether these babies can tell the difference between their own cry and another infants, Martin Hoffman explains that between the age of 1 and 2 infants are more able to perform real moral acts. Hoffman observed a 2-year olds reaction to another child in distress. The 2 year old offered his own teddy bear to his peer. This simple act shows that the 2 year old was putting himself in the shoes of his peer &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Martin J. "Empathy and Moral Development." Implications for Caring and Justice (2000): 12-24. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study was done by Carolyn Zahn-Waxler and her team on this topic. Waxler found that over half of the infants involved took part in at least one act of prosocial behavior &lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Nicole M. "The Development of Empathy: How, When, and Why." (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman feels that as children mature empathy in turn becomes less about oneself and more about cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;Both environment as well as genetics determines how prosocial and empathetic an individual will be.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Child ==

Kohlberg contributed to our understanding of moral development in children and said that moral reasoning is what makes ethical behavior. He said that there are six developmental stages that are constructive that eventually lead to the development of morality. Kohlberg also said that moral development does not just stop or is complete at a certain time or stage but instead that it is continuous and happens throughout a person's lifetime. Kohlberg used stories that are known as Heinz dilemmas which are controversial stories to see what people felt was morally acceptable and what was not. From that he developed his theory with his six stages of moral development which are: obedience, self-interest, conformity, law and order, human rights, and universal human ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S. (2006). Cognition and development.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weighing Intentions ===

As mentioned before, Kohlberg believed that moral development was an ongoing thing and that through experiences it develops and adapts. Moreover, in children's moral thinking there comes a time where morality and moral decisions are made based on consequences, that is to say that they start weighing intentions in order to decide and learn whether something is morally okay or not.

An example of this can be seen in identifying the intentions of specific behaviors. We as a society also operate in that way because the same outcome or behavior can be considered acceptable had the intentions for it been good versus another time where the intentions were bad and in that case it would be unacceptable. In a situation where a child is trying to help their parent clean and misplaces something accidentally, it is easily forgiven and is considered morally acceptable because his/her intentions were good. However, if the child purposely hid the object so their parent would not find it, it is morally unacceptable because the intentions were bad. Ultimately, it is the same situation and same outcome but the intentions are different. At the age of 10–11 years children realize this concept and start justifying their actions and behaviors by weighing their intentions.

=== Understanding Rules ===

In Kohlberg's theory of moral development there are six definite stages. The first stage is called obedience and punishment orientation. And this stage is governed by the concept of having rules, laws, and things that one must follow. In children there is a set of rules set down by their authority figures, often being their parents. At this stage of moral development, morality is defined by these rules and laws that they think are set in stone and can never change. To a child, these rules are ones that can never be wrong and that define good and bad and show the difference between them. Later on however, these rules become more like guidelines and can change based on the situation they are presented in. Another aspect of these rules is the concept of punishment and reinforcement and that's how children realize what is considered morally okay or not.

An example of this is in the dilemmas used by Kolhberg, when he asked children to justify or judge the situation and their answer was always justified by something similar to “this is not fair” or “this is wrong because lying is bad” etc. This shows that at this particular stage children are not yet contributing members in terms of moral development.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R. (2011). Moral development in childhood. Global Post: America's World News Site.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applying Theory of Mind ===

The theory of mind tells us that children need to develop a sense of self in order to develop morality and moral concepts. As the child develops, s/he needs to experience and observe in order to realize how they fit into society and eventually become part of it thereby establishing a sense of self-identity. This sense of self-identity depends on many things and it is important to develop and learn from those stages in order to fully develop understand good from bad.

=== Moral Socialization ===

Moral socialization talks about how morality is passed on. This perspective says that adults or parents pass down and teach their children the acceptable behavior through techniques and teaching as well as punishments and reinforcements. This then shows that children who learn and develop morality have good listening and are more compliant and it is because of that that they are morally developed. Therefore, if a parent fails to teach that to their child, the child then would not develop morality. Moral socialization also has studies that show that parents who use techniques that are not violent or aggressive and unconditional raise children with more conscience. Therefore, these children have more of a sense of morality and are more morally developed.&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, R. E. (2003). Educational Psychology: Theory and Practice, 7e. Boston, MA. Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Adolescent ==

As adolescents gain the ability to independently think about complex and hypothetical ideas, and as they map out their identities, many of them begin to see their values and moral standards and some centralize on their morality. On the other side of the spectrum there are the adolescents who engage in serious antisocial behavior.

=== Changes in moral reasoning ===

The teen years are a significant period for moral growth. The moral reasoning percentage range displays that the preconventional reasoning (stage one and two) decrease rapidly as they reach teen years. During adolescence, conventional reasoning (stage three and four) become the centralized mode of moral thinking. Early year teens reflect stage 2 (instrumental hedonism) - “treat others how you would like to be treated”- or stage 3 (good boy or good girl) which involves earning approval and being polite. Almost half the percent of 16- to 18-year-olds display stage 3 reasoning and only a fifth were scored as stage 4 (authority and social order-maintaining morality) arguments. As adolescents start to age more they begin to take a broad societal perspective and act in ways to benefit the social system. The main developmental trend in moral reasoning occurs during the shift from preconventional to conventional reasoning. During the shift, individuals carry out moral standards that have been passed down by authority. Many teens characterize a moral person as caring fair, and honest. Adolescents who display these aspects tend to advance their moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6127751_The_self-importance_of_moral_identity/file/60b7d51ae8bf70e8b2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antisocial behavior ===

The adolescents who do not internalize society's moral standards, are more likely to be involved in antisocial conduct such as, muggings, rapes, armed robberies, etc. Most antisocial adults start their bad behavior in childhood and continue on into adolescence. Misbehavior seen in childhood increases, resulting in juvenile delinquency as adolescents. Actions such as leaving school early, having difficulty maintaining a job, and later participating in law-breaking as adults. Children who are involved in these risky activities are diagnosed as having conduct disorder and will later develop antisocial personality disorder. There are at least two outcomes of antisocial youths. First, a noticeable group of children who are involved in animal cruelty, and violence amongst their peers which then consistently progresses throughout their entire lifespan. The second group consists of the larger population of adolescents who misbehave primarily due to peer pressure but outgrow this behavior when they reach adulthood. Juveniles are most likely to depend on preconventional moral reasoning. Some offenders lack a well-developed sense of right and wrong. A majority of delinquents are able to reason conventionally but commit illegal acts anyway.&lt;ref&gt;http://psych.colorado.edu/~willcutt/pdfs/Chen_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dodge’s social information processing model ===

Kenneth Dodge progressed on the understanding of aggressive/aggression behavior with creating his social information processing model. He believed that people's retaliation to frustration, anger or provocation do not depend so much on social cues in the situation as on the ways which they process and interpret this information. An individual who is provoked goes through a six step progress of processing information. According to dodge the individual will encode and interpret cues, then clarify goals. Following this, he will respond search and decision, thinking of possible actions to achieve goal to then weigh pros and cons of alternative options. Finally, he will perform behavioral enactment, or take action. People do not go through these steps in the exact order in all cases, they may take two and work on them simultaneously or repeat the steps. Also, an individual may come up with information from not only the current situation, but also from a previous similar social experience and work off of that. The six steps in social information processing advance as one ages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9781441906083-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-855508-p173900832&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patterson’s coercive family environments ===

Gerald Patterson observed that highly antisocial children and adolescents tend to be raised in coercive family environments in which family members try to control the others through negative, coercive tactics. The parental guidance in these households realize they are able to control their children temporarily with threatening them and providing negative reinforcement. The child also learns to use negative reinforcement to get what they want by ignoring, whining and throwing tantrums. Eventually, both sides (parents and children) lose all power of the situation and nothing is resolved. It becomes evident of how a child is raised on how they will become very hostile or present aggressiveness to resolve all their disputes. Patterson discusses how growing up in a coercive family environment creates an antisocial adolescent due to the fact they are already unpleasant to be around they begin to perform poorly in school and are rejected to all their peers. With no alternative option, they turn to the low-achieving, antisocial youths who encourage bad behavior. Dodge's theory is well supported by many cases of ineffective parenting contributing to the child's behavior problems, association with antisocial groups, resulting in antisocial behavior in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/35patterson90.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature and nurture ===

The next theory that may contribute to antisocial behavior is between genetic predisposition and social learning experiences. Aggression is seen more in the evolutionary aspect. An example being, males are more aggressive than females and are involved in triple the amount of crime. Aggression has been present in males for centuries due to male dependence on dominance to compete for mates and pass genes to further generations. Most individuals are born with temperaments, impulsive tendencies, and other characteristics that relate to a delinquent. Although predisposed aspects have a great effect on the adolescent's behavior, if the child grows up in a dysfunctional family and receive poor parenting or is involved in an abusive environment that will increase the chances immensely for antisocial behaviors to appear.

== The Adult==

=== Changes in Moral Reasoning ===

Lawrence Kohlberg has led most of the studies based on moral development in adults. In Kohlberg's studies, the subjects are ranked accordingly at one of the six stages. Stage 1 is called the Obedience and Punishment Orientation. Stage 1 is preconventional morality because the subject sees morality in an egocentric way. Stage 2 is also considered to be preconventional morality and is labeled as Individualism and Exchange. At this stage, the individual is still concentrated on the self and his surrounding environment. Stages 3 and 4 are at level 2, Conventional Morality. Stage 3 is called Interpersonal Relationships and is the point where the individual realizes that people should behave in good ways not only for the benefit of themselves but the family and community as well. Stage 4, Maintaining the Social Order, the individual is more concentrated on society as a whole. Stage 5 and 6 are both at level 3, post-conventional Morality. Stage 5 is the social contract and Individual Rights. At this stage people are contemplating what makes a good society rather than just what makes a society run smoothly. Stage 6, Universal Principles is the last stage which interprets the foundation of justice &lt;ref&gt;Colby et. Al., 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Kohlberg completed a 20-year study and found that most 30-year-old adults were at stage 3 and 4, the conventional level. According to this study there is still room for moral development in adulthood.

=== Kohlberg’s Theory in Perspective ===

Kohlberg's theory of moral development greatly influenced the scientific body of knowledge. That being said, it is now being evaluated and researchers are looking for a more thorough explanation of moral development. Kohlberg stated that there is no variation to his stages of development. Despite this, modern research explains that kids are more morally mature than Kohlberg had noted. On top of that, there is no strong evidence that suggests that people go from conventional to post-conventional. Lastly, it is now known that Kohlberg's theory is biased against numerous numbers of people.

=== New Approaches to Morality ===

The main focus of developmentalists now is how important emotion is in terms of morality. Developmental researchers are examining the emotions of child and adult when exhibiting good and bad behavior. The importance of innate feelings and hunches in regards to morality are also being contemplated by doctors. Researchers have also come up with dual-process models of morality. This process examines Kohlberg's rational deliberation as well as the more recent study of innate feelings and emotions. Joshua Green is one scholar who backs the dual-process models of morality and feels that there are different situations that call for each view. All in all, there are many factors that come into play in deciding whether a person will behave in a certain fashion when dealing with a moral decision.

[[File:もったいない (5305643094).jpg|thumb|''Mottainai'' written on a truck, followed by the sentence "I strive towards [[zero emission]]"]]

'''''Mottainai''''' is a term of Japanese origin that has been used by environmentalists.  The term in Japanese conveys a sense of regret over waste; the exclamation "''Mottainai!'' can translate as "What a waste!"  Japanese environmentalists have used the term to encourage people to "[[Waste hierarchy|reduce, reuse and recycle]]", and [[Kenya]]n environmentalist [[Wangari Maathai]] used the term at the [[United Nations]] as a slogan to promote environmental protection.

== Usage and translation ==

''Mottainai'' is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term conveying a sense of [[regret]] concerning [[waste]].&lt;ref name="daijirin"&gt;[https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%8B%BF%E4%BD%93%E7%84%A1%E3%81%84-645881#E5.A4.A7.E8.BE.9E.E6.9E.97.20.E7.AC.AC.E4.B8.89.E7.89.88 Daijirin Japanese dictionary 2nd ed.] (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "Mottainai!" can be uttered alone as an exclamation when something useful, such as food or time, is wasted, meaning roughly "what a waste!" In addition to its primary sense of "wastefulness", the word is also used to mean "impious; irreverent" or "more than one deserves".&lt;ref&gt;Masuda, K: Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, page 1139. Kenkyusha Ltd., 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mottainai'' in Japanese refers both to physical waste and to wasteful action.  MacQuillan and Preston propose a more elaborate translation that conveys a sense of value and worthiness as "do not destroy (or lay waste to) that which is worthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alan G. MacQuillan |author2=Ashley L. Preston |title=Globally and Locally: Seeking a Middle Path to Sustainable Development |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |location= |isbn=0761811265 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Modern Japanese environmentalism ===
In November 2002, the English-language, Japan-based magazine ''[[Look Japan]]'' ran a cover story entitled "Restyling Japan: Revival of the 'Mottainai' Spirit", documenting the motivation amongst volunteers in a "toy hospital" in Japan to "develop in children the habit of looking after their possessions," the re-emergence of repair shops specializing in repairing household appliances or children's clothes, the recycling of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles and other materials, the collection of waste [[edible oil]], and more generally the efforts to stop the trend of throwing away everything that can no longer be used, i.e. the efforts of reviving "the spirit of ''mottainai''".&lt;ref name="look-japan-2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiba |first=Hitoshi |date=November 2002 |title=Restyling Japan: Revival of the "Mottainai" Spirit |journal=[[Look Japan]] |url=http://www.lookjapan.com/LBcoverstory/02NovCS.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405084940/http://www.lookjapan.com/LBcoverstory/02NovCS.htm |archivedate=April 5, 2004 |accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, Hitoshi Chiba, the author, described ''mottainai'' as follows:

{{cquote|We often hear in Japan the expression 'mottainai', which loosely means 'wasteful' but in its full sense conveys a feeling of awe and appreciation for the gifts of nature or the sincere conduct of other people. There is a trait among Japanese people to try to use something for its entire effective life or continue to use it by repairing it. In this caring culture, people will endeavor to find new homes for possessions they no longer need. The 'mottainai' principle extends to the dinner table, where many consider it rude to leave even a single grain of rice in the bowl. The concern is that this traditional trait may be lost.&lt;ref name="look-japan-2002"/&gt;}}

A modern observance that practices mottainai{{clarify|reason=no meaning to "practising" wasteful|date=March 2018}} is the yearly festival of [[Hari-Kuyō]], or the Festival of Broken Needles.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

At the Opening Ceremony of the Science and Technology in Society Forum in 2005, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi stated: "In Japan, there has long been a spirit characterized by the word ''mottainai'', which could be translated as 'don't waste what is valuable'."&lt;ref name=Koizumi2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://japan.kantei.go.jp/koizumispeech/2005/09/11press_e.html|title=Speeches and Statements by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi|website=japan.kantei.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More footnotes|date=October 2009}}

In [[logic]] and [[probability theory]], two events (or propositions) are '''mutually exclusive''' or '''disjoint''' if they cannot both occur at the same time(be true). A clear example is the set of outcomes of a single coin toss, which can result in either heads or tails, but not both.

In the coin-tossing example, both outcomes are, in theory, [[Collectively exhaustive events|collectively exhaustive]], which means that at least one of the outcomes must happen, so these two possibilities together exhaust all the possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Scott |first2=Donald |last2=Childers |title=Probability and Random Processes |location= |publisher=Academic Press |edition=Second |year=2012 |page=8 |isbn=978-0-12-386981-4 |quote=The sample space is the collection or set of 'all possible' distinct (collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive) outcomes of an experiment. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all mutually exclusive events are collectively exhaustive. For example, the outcomes 1 and 4 of a single roll of a [[six-sided die]] are mutually exclusive (both cannot happen at the same time) but not collectively exhaustive (there are other possible outcomes; 2,3,5,6).

==Logic==
In [[logic]], two mutually exclusive propositions are propositions that [[logical possibility|logically cannot]] be true in the same sense at the same time. To say that more than two propositions are mutually exclusive, depending on context, means that one cannot be true if the other one is true, or at least one of them cannot be true. The term ''pairwise mutually exclusive'' always means that two of them cannot be true simultaneously.

==Probability==
In [[probability theory]], events ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are said to be '''mutually exclusive''' if the occurrence of any one of them implies the non-occurrence of the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 events. Therefore, two mutually exclusive events cannot both occur. Formally said, the intersection of each two of them is empty (the null event): ''A''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∅. In consequence, mutually exclusive events have the property: P(''A'' ∩ ''B'') = 0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intmath.com/Counting-probability/9_Mutually-exclusive-events.php intmath.com]; Mutually Exclusive Events. Interactive Mathematics. December 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, it is impossible to draw a card that is both red and a club because clubs are always black. If just one card is drawn from the deck, either a red card (heart or diamond) or a black card (club or spade) will be drawn. When ''A'' and ''B'' are mutually exclusive, P(''A'' ∪ ''B'') = P(''A'') + P(''B'').&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;[http://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch05-rul.html Stats: Probability Rules.]&lt;/ref&gt; To find the probability of drawing a red card or a club, for example, add together the probability of drawing a red card and the probability of drawing a club. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and thirteen clubs: 26/52 + 13/52 = 39/52 or 3/4.

One would have to draw at least two cards in order to draw both a red card and a club. The probability of doing so in two draws depends on whether the first card drawn were replaced before the second drawing, since without replacement there is one fewer card after the first card was drawn. The probabilities of the individual events (red, and club) are multiplied rather than added. The probability of drawing a red and a club in two drawings without replacement is then 26/52&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;13/51&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 = 676/2652, or 13/51. With replacement, the probability would be 26/52&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;13/52&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 = 676/2704, or 13/52.

In probability theory, the word ''or'' allows for the possibility of both events happening. The probability of one or both events occurring is denoted P(''A'' ∪ ''B'') and in general it equals P(''A'') + P(''B'') – P(''A'' ∩ ''B'').&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt; Therefore, in the case of drawing a red card or a king, drawing any of a red king, a red non-king, or a black king is considered a success. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and four kings, two of which are red, so the probability of drawing a red or a king is 26/52 + 4/52 – 2/52 = 28/52.

Events are [[collectively exhaustive]] if all the possibilities for outcomes are exhausted by those possible events, so at least one of those outcomes must occur. The probability that at least one of the events will occur is equal to one.&lt;ref name="events"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720051423/http://www.cs.stedwards.edu/chem/Chemistry/CHEM4341/BayesPrimer2.pdf Scott Bierman. A Probability Primer. Carleton College. Pages 3-4.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are theoretically only two possibilities for flipping a coin. Flipping a head and flipping a tail are collectively exhaustive events, and there is a probability of one of flipping either a head or a tail. Events can be both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; In the case of flipping a coin, flipping a head and flipping a tail are also mutually exclusive events. Both outcomes cannot occur for a single trial (i.e., when a coin is flipped only once). The probability of flipping a head and the probability of flipping a tail can be added to yield a probability of 1: 1/2 + 1/2 =1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/CliffsReviewTopic/NonMutually-Exclusive-Outcomes.topicArticleId-25951,articleId-25914.html Non-Mutually Exclusive Outcomes. CliffsNotes.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
In [[statistics]] and [[regression analysis]], an [[dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] that can take on only two possible values is called a [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. For example, it may take on the value 0 if an observation is of a male subject or 1 if the observation is of a female subject. The two possible categories associated with the two possible values are mutually exclusive, so that no observation falls into more than one category, and the categories are exhaustive, so that every observation falls into some category. Sometimes there are three or more possible categories, which are pairwise mutually exclusive and are collectively exhaustive — for example, under 18 years of age, 18 to 64 years of age, and age 65 or above. In this case a set of dummy variables is constructed, each dummy variable having two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive categories — in this example, one dummy variable (called D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) would equal 1 if age is less than 18, and would equal 0 ''otherwise''; a second dummy variable (called D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) would equal 1 if age is in the range 18-64, and 0 otherwise. In this set-up, the dummy variable pairs (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can have the values (1,0) (under 18), (0,1) (between 18 and 64), or (0,0) (65 or older) (but not (1,1), which would nonsensically imply that an observed subject is both under 18 and between 18 and 64). Then the dummy variables can be included as independent (explanatory) variables in a regression. Note that the number of dummy variables is always one less than the number of categories: with the two categories male and female there is a single dummy variable to distinguish them, while with the three age categories two dummy variables are needed to distinguish them.

Such [[qualitative data]] can also be used for [[dependent variable]]s. For example, a researcher might want to predict whether someone goes to college or not, using family income, a gender dummy variable, and so forth as explanatory variables. Here the variable to be explained is a dummy variable that equals 0 if the observed subject does not go to college and equals 1 if the subject does go to college. In such a situation, [[ordinary least squares]] (the basic regression technique) is widely seen as inadequate; instead [[probit regression]] or [[logistic regression]] is used. Further, sometimes there are three or more categories for the dependent variable — for example, no college, community college, and four-year college. In this case, the [[multinomial probit]] or [[multinomial logit]] technique is used.

In [[philosophy]], the '''natural order''' is the [[morality|moral]] source from which [[natural law]] seeks to derive its [[authority]].  Natural order encompasses the natural relations of beings to one another in the absence of [[law]], which natural law attempts to reinforce. This is related to [[Dharma]].

In contrast, [[divine law]] seeks authority from [[God]], and [[Jurisprudence|positive law]] seeks authority from [[government]].

The term is used by [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] in his book, ''[[Democracy: The God That Failed|Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order]]'', to defend [[anarcho-capitalism]].

The term is used by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his writings.

'''Austrian units of measurement''' were used in Austria until the adoption of the [[metric system]].

== History ==

In 1756, the ruling Arch duchess of Austria, [[Maria Theresa]], ordered that the Viennese ''[[klafter]]'' as well as its multiples and fractions, should be the state-defined measure of length in the Archduchy of Austria and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The Viennese cubit, that is 1{{frac|3|4}} of the Roman [[cubit]] (cubit's or elbow), was also used as a measure of length.

The law should also have applied to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]], of which Maria Theresa was queen. However, the traditional Roman foot remained in common use in [[Prague]].

When the metric system was introduced by law on 23 July 1871 (which became obligatory on 1 January 1876),&lt;ref&gt;[[History of the metric system#The German Zollverein]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2017}} the length of the ''klafter'' (kl) was established as exactly 1.89648384&amp;nbsp;metres.

[[File:Parmenides.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Parmenides]] was among the first to propose an ontological characterization of the fundamental nature of reality.]]

'''Ontology''' is the [[philosophical]] [[wikt:study|study]] of [[being]]. More broadly, it studies concepts that directly relate to being, in particular [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], [[existence]], [[reality]], as well as the basic [[category of being|categories of being]] and their relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ontology Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as [[metaphysics]], ontology often deals with questions concerning what [[entities]] exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a [[hierarchy]], and subdivided according to similarities and differences.

== Etymology ==
The [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] word ''ontology'' ("study of being") combines ''[[wikt:onto-|onto]]-'' ([[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] [[wikt:ὤν|ὄν]]&lt;!--[sic] (neuter), not ὤν (masculine)--&gt;, ''on'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Present tense]] [[participle]] of the [[verb]] [[wikt:εἰμί|εἰμί]], ''eimí'', i.e. "to be, I am"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genitive|gen.]] ὄντος, ''ontos'', "being; that which is") and ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'' (Gr. [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]], "logical discourse"). See [[classical compound]]s for this type of word formation.&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=ontology|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/ontology|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|ei)mi/1|εἰμί|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[etymology]] is Greek, the oldest extant record of the word itself, the [[New Latin]] form ''ontologia'', appeared in 1606 in the work ''Ogdoas Scholastica'' by [[Jacob Lorhard]] (''Lorhardus'') and in 1613 in the ''Lexicon philosophicum'' by [[Rudolf Göckel]] (''Goclenius'').

The first occurrence in English of ''ontology'' as recorded by the ''OED'' (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', online edition, 2008) came in a work by Gideon Harvey (1636/7–1702): ''Archelogia philosophica nova; or, New principles of Philosophy. Containing Philosophy in general, Metaphysicks or Ontology, Dynamilogy or a Discourse of Power, Religio Philosophi or Natural Theology, Physicks or Natural philosophy'', London, Thomson, 1663.&lt;ref&gt;[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A43008.0001.001?view=toc Early English Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first used in its Latin form by philosophers based on the Latin roots, which themselves are based on the Greek.

[[Leibniz]] is the only one of the great philosophers of the 17th century to have used the term ''ontology''.&lt;ref&gt;Michaël Devaux and Marco Lamanna, "The Rise and Early History of the Term Ontology (1606–1730)", ''Quaestio.Yearbook of the History of the Metaphysics'', 9, 2009, pp. 173-208 (on Leibniz pp. 197-198).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Some philosophers, notably in the traditions of the [[Platonism|Platonic school]], contend that all nouns (including [[abstract noun]]s) refer to existent entities.{{citation needed|date= September 2017}} Other philosophers contend that nouns do not always name entities, but that some provide a kind of shorthand for reference to a collection either of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] or of [[event (philosophy)|events]]. In this latter view, ''[[mind]]'', instead of referring to an entity, refers to a collection of ''mental events'' experienced by a ''[[person]]''; ''[[society]]'' refers to a collection of ''persons'' with some shared characteristics, and ''[[geometry]]'' refers to a collection of specific kinds of intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=XU5atV1nfukC&amp;dq=platonic+writings+griswold&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q= |title= Platonic Writings/Platonic Readings |first= Charles L. |last= Griswold |publisher= Penn State Press |year= 2001 |page= 237 |isbn= 978-0-271-02137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2017}} Between these poles of [[Platonic realism|realism]] and [[nominalism]] stand a variety of [[Moderate realism|other positions]].

=== Some fundamental questions ===
Principal questions of ontology include:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* "What can be said to exist?"
* "What is a thing?"&lt;ref name="Isham"&gt;Isham, C.J. (1995). ''Lectures on Quantum Theory: Mathematical and Structural Foundations'', Imperial College Press, London, {{ISBN|1-86094-000-5}}, pp. 63–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Into what categories, if any, can we sort existing things?"
* "What are the meanings of being?"
* "What are the various [[mode (disambiguation)|mode]]s of being of entities?"

Various [[philosopher]]s have provided different answers to these questions. One common approach involves dividing the extant subjects and predicates into groups called [[category of being|categories]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Such lists of categories differ widely from one another, and it is through the co-ordination of different categorical schemes that ontology relates to such fields as [[library and information science|library science]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. Such an understanding of ontological categories, however, is merely [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]], classificatory. Aristotle's categories are the ways in which a being may be addressed simply as a being, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] ''Categories'' Vol. 1, Loeb Classical Library, transl. H.P. Cooke, Harvard U.P. 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
* what it is (its 'whatness', [[quiddity]], [[haecceity]] or essence)
* how it is (its 'howness' or qualitativeness)
* how much it is (quantitativeness)
* where it is (its relatedness to other beings)

Further examples of ontological questions include:{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
* What is [[existence]], i.e. what does it mean for a being to be?
* Is existence a [[Property (philosophy)|property]]?
* Is existence a genus or general class that is simply divided up by specific differences?
* Which entities, if any, are fundamental?
* Are all entities objects?
* How do the [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of an object relate to the object itself?
* Do physical properties actually exist?
* What features are the [[essence|essential]], as opposed to merely accidental attributes of a given object?
* How many levels of existence or ontological levels are there? And what constitutes a "level"?
* What is a [[physical body|physical object]]?
* Can one give an account of what it means to say that a physical object exists?
* Can one give an account of what it means to say that a non-physical entity exists?
* What constitutes the ''[[identity (philosophy)|identity]]'' of an object?
* When does an object go ''out'' of existence, as opposed to merely ''changing''?
* Do beings exist other than in the modes of objectivity and subjectivity, i.e. is the subject/object split of modern philosophy inevitable?

=== Concepts ===
Essential ontological [[dichotomies]] include:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

* [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] and [[particular]]s
* [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]]
* [[Abstract object|abstract]] and [[Physical object|concrete]] objects
* [[essence]] and [[existence]]
* [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]]
* [[monism]] and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]
* [[idealism]] and [[materialism]]

=== Types ===
Philosophers can classify ontologies in various ways, using criteria such as the degree of abstraction and field of application:&lt;ref name=Petrov /&gt;

# ''[[Upper ontology]]'': concepts supporting development of an ontology, [[meta-ontology]]
# ''Domain ontology'': concepts relevant to a particular topic, [[domain of discourse]], or area of interest, for example, to information technology or to computer languages, or to particular branches of science
# ''Interface ontology'': concepts relevant to the juncture of two disciplines
# ''[[Process ontology]]'': inputs, outputs, constraints, sequencing information, involved in business or engineering processes

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Ontology is an aspect of the [[Samkhya]] school of philosophy from the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4: Samkhya'', Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-60441-1}}, pages 3-11&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[Guna]] which describes the three properties ([[sattva]], [[rajas]] and [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]) present in differing proportions in all existing things, is a notable concept of this school.&lt;ref&gt;"The archaic ontology of Chändogya Upanisad VI.2-5, for example, with its emphasis on primordial Being [sat) in its tripartite manifestations as fire (red), water (white), and food (black), correlated with speech, breath, and mind, probably foreshadows the later Sâmkhya ontological notions of prakrti, the three gunas, and the preexistence of the effect." ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4: Samkhya'', cit. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parmenides and monism ====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
[[Parmenides]] was among the first in the Greek tradition to propose an ontological characterization of the fundamental nature of existence. In his prologue or [[Parmenides#Proem|proem]] he describes two views of [[existence]]; initially that nothing comes from nothing, and therefore [[existence]] is [[Monism|eternal]]. Consequently, our opinions about truth must often be false and deceitful. Most of [[western philosophy]] — including the fundamental concepts of [[falsifiability]] — have emerged from this view. This posits that existence is what may be conceived of by thought, created, or possessed. Hence, there may be neither void nor vacuum; and true reality neither may come into being nor vanish from existence. Rather, the entirety of creation is eternal, uniform, and immutable, though not infinite (he characterized its shape as that of a perfect sphere). Parmenides thus posits that change, as perceived in everyday experience, is illusory. Everything that may be apprehended is but one part of a single entity. This idea somewhat anticipates the modern concept of an ultimate [[grand unification theory]] that finally describes all of existence in terms of one inter-related [[Particle physics|sub-atomic]] reality which applies to everything.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==== Ontological pluralism ====
{{Main|Ontological pluralism}}

The opposite of [[eleatic]] monism is the pluralistic conception of [[Being]]. In the 5th century BC, [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Leucippus]] replaced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8303.html |title=Sample Chapter for Graham, D. W.: Explaining the Cosmos: The Ionian Tradition of Scientific Philosophy |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reality of Being (unique and unchanging) with that of [[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]] and therefore by a more fundamental and elementary [[ontic]] plurality. This thesis originated in the Hellenic world, stated in two different ways by Anaxagoras and by Leucippus. The first theory dealt with "seeds" (which Aristotle referred to as "homeomeries") of the various substances. The second was the atomistic theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/ |title=Ancient Atomism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with reality as based on the [[vacuum]], the atoms and their intrinsic movement in it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The materialist [[atomism]] proposed by Leucippus was [[indeterminism|indeterminist]], but then developed by [[Democritus]] in a [[determinism|deterministic]] way. It was later (4th century BC) that the original atomism was taken again as indeterministic by [[Epicurus]]. He confirmed the reality as composed of an infinity of indivisible, unchangeable corpuscles or [[atom]]s (''atomon'', lit. 'uncuttable'), but he gives weight to characterize atoms while for Leucippus they are characterized by a "figure", an "order" and a "position" in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', I, 4, 985&lt;/ref&gt; They are, besides, creating the whole with the intrinsic movement in the ''vacuum'', producing the diverse flux of being. Their movement is influenced by the ''parenklisis'' ([[Lucretius]] names it [[clinamen]]) and that is determined by the [[Randomness|chance]]. These ideas foreshadowed our understanding of [[physics|traditional physics]] until the nature of atoms was discovered in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, C., Latsis, J. S., &amp; Martins, N. (Eds.). (2013). Contributions to social ontology. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plato ====
[[Plato]] developed this distinction between true reality and illusion, in arguing that what is real are eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] or Ideas (a precursor to [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]]), of which things experienced in sensation are at best merely copies, and real only in so far as they copy ('partake of') such Forms. In general, Plato presumes that all nouns (e.g., 'Beauty') refer to real entities, whether sensible bodies or insensible Forms. Hence, in [[Sophist (dialogue)|''The Sophist'']] Plato argues that Being is a Form in which all existent things participate and which they have in common (though it is unclear whether 'Being' is intended in the sense of [[existence]], [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], or [[identity (philosophy)|identity]]); and argues, against Parmenides, that Forms must exist not only of Being, but also of [[Negation]] and of non-Being (or Difference).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In his [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'']], Aristotle identifies ten possible kinds of things that may be the subject or the predicate of a proposition. For Aristotle there are four different ontological dimensions:{{Citation needed|date=April 2011|reason=three of these are discussed in Book Theta, but I do not see clear support for "four different ontological dimensions"}}
# according to the various categories or ways of addressing a being as such
# according to its truth or falsity (e.g. fake gold, counterfeit money)
# whether it exists in and of itself or simply 'comes along' by accident
# according to its potency, movement (energy) or finished presence ([[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'' Book Theta]]).

According to [[Avicenna]], and in an interpretation of Greek Aristotelian and Platonist ontological doctrines in medieval [[metaphysics]], being is either necessary, contingent ''qua'' possible, or impossible. Necessary being is that which cannot but be, since its non-being entails a contradiction. Contingent ''qua'' possible being is neither necessary nor impossible for it to be or not to be. It is ontologically neutral, and is brought from potential existing into actual existence by way of a cause that is external to its essence. Its being is borrowed unlike the necessary existent, which is self-subsisting and is impossible for it not to be. As for the impossible, it necessarily does not exist, and the affirmation of its being is a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], '[[Avicenna]] and [[Essentialism]], Review of [[Metaphysics]], Vol. 54 (2001), pp. 753-778.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other ontological topics ==

=== Ontological formations ===
The concept of 'ontological formations' refers to formations of social relations understood as dominant ways of living. Temporal, spatial, corporeal, epistemological and performative relations are taken to be central to understanding a dominant formation. That is, a particular ontological formation is based on how ontological categories of time, space, embodiment, knowing and performing are lived—objectively and subjectively. Different ontological formations include the customary (including the tribal), the traditional, the modern and the postmodern. The concept was first introduced by [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James']] ''Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In —Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}&lt;/ref&gt; together with a series of writers including Damian Grenfell and [[Manfred Steger]].

In the [[engaged theory]] approach, ontological formations are seen as layered and intersecting rather than singular formations. They are 'formations of being'. This approach avoids the usual problems of a Great Divide being posited between the modern and the pre-modern. From a philosophical distinction concerning different formations of being, the concept then provides a way of translating into practical understandings concerning how humans might design cities and communities that live creatively across different ontological formations, for example cities that are not completely dominated by modern valences of spatial configuration. Here the work of Tony Fry is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Urban Design in the Global South: Ontological Design in Practice | title= Design in the Borderlands | editor= Tony Fry and Eleni Kalantidou | url= https://www.academia.edu/9161853/Urban_Design_in_the_Global_South_Ontological_Design_in_Practice_2014_ | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontological and epistemological certainty ===
[[René Descartes]], with ''je pense donc je suis'' or ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' or "I think, therefore I am", argued that "the self" is something that we can know exists with [[epistemology|epistemological]] certainty. Descartes argued further that this knowledge could lead to a proof of the certainty of the [[existence of God]], using the [[ontological argument]] that had been formulated first by [[Anselm of Canterbury]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Certainty about the existence of "the self" and "the other", however, came under increasing criticism in the 20th century. Sociological theorists, most notably [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Erving Goffman]], saw the [[Cartesian Other]] as a "Generalized Other", the imaginary audience that individuals use when thinking about the self. According to Mead, "we do not assume there is a self to begin with. Self is not presupposed as a stuff out of which the world arises. Rather, the self arises in the world".&lt;ref name=Hyde&gt;Hyde, R. Bruce. "Listening Authentically: A Heideggerian Perspective on Interpersonal Communication". In ''Interpretive Approaches to Interpersonal Communication'', edited by Kathryn Carter and Mick Presnell. State University of New York Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7914-1847-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mead, G. H. ''The individual and the social self: Unpublished work of George Herbert Mead'' (D. L. Miller, Ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982. (p. 107). {{ISBN|0-226-51673-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Cartesian Other was also used by [[Sigmund Freud]], who saw the [[Ego, superego, and id|superego]] as an abstract regulatory force, and [[Émile Durkheim]] who viewed this as a psychologically manifested entity which represented God in society at large.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Body and environment, questioning the meaning of being ===
Schools of [[metaphysical subjectivism|subjectivism]], [[metaphysical objectivism|objectivism]] and [[relativism]] existed at various times in the 20th century, and the [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] and [[embodied philosophy|body philosophers]] tried to reframe all these questions in terms of bodies taking some specific [[philosophy of action|action]] in an environment. This relied to a great degree on insights derived from scientific research into animals taking instinctive action in natural and artificial settings—as studied by [[biology]], [[ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/napflion.pdf Barry Smith: Objects and Their Environments: From Aristotle to Ecological Ontology] The Life and Motion of SocioEconomic Units (GISDATA 8), London: Taylor and Francis, 2001, 79-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cognitive science]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The processes by which bodies related to environments became of great concern, and the idea of [[being]] itself became difficult to really define. What did people mean when they said "A is B", "A must be B", "A was B"...? Some linguists advocated dropping the verb "to be" from the English language, leaving "[[E-Prime|E&amp;nbsp;Prime]]", supposedly less prone to bad abstractions. Others, mostly philosophers, tried to dig into the word and its usage. [[Martin Heidegger]] distinguished ''human being'' as ''existence'' from the being of things in the world. Heidegger proposes that our way of being human and the way the world is for us are cast historically through a fundamental ontological questioning. These fundamental ontological categories provide the basis for communication in an age: a horizon of unspoken and seemingly unquestionable background meanings, such as human beings understood unquestioningly as subjects and other entities understood unquestioningly as objects. Because these basic ontological meanings both generate and are regenerated in everyday interactions, the locus of our way of being in a historical epoch is the communicative event of language in use.&lt;ref name=Hyde /&gt; For Heidegger, however, communication in the ''first'' place is not among human beings, but language itself shapes up in response to questioning (the inexhaustible meaning of) being.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin, ''On the Way to Language'' Harper &amp; Row, New York 1971. German edition: ''Unterwegs zur Sprache'' Neske, Pfullingen 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the focus of traditional ontology on the 'whatness' or ''quidditas'' of beings in their substantial, standing presence can be shifted to pose the question of the 'whoness' of human being itself.&lt;ref&gt;Eldred, Michael, [http://www.arte-fact.org/sclontlg.html ''Social Ontology: Recasting Political Philosophy Through a Phenomenology of Whoness''] ontos, Frankfurt 2008 xiv + 688 pp. {{ISBN|978-3-938793-78-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontology and language ===
Some philosophers suggest that the question of "What is?" is (at least in part) an issue of ''usage'' rather than a question about facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Introduction to an Ontology of Intellectual Property | publisher=The Scitech Lawyer, ABA| author=Carvalko, Joseph | year= Summer 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is conveyed by an analogy made by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]: Suppose a person refers to a 'cup' as a 'chair' and makes some comments pertinent to a cup, but uses the word 'chair' consistently throughout instead of 'cup'. One might readily catch on that this person simply calls a 'cup' a 'chair' and the oddity is explained.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;Davidson refers to a 'ketch' and a 'yawl'; see p. 18 in {{cite journal |author=Donald Davidson |title=On the very idea of a conceptual scheme |journal=Proceedings and Address of the American Philosophical Association |volume=47 |pages=5–20 |year=1974 |url=http://files.meetup.com/328570/davidson_on-the-very-idea.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, if we find people asserting 'there are' such-and-such, and we do not ourselves think that 'such-and-such' exist, we might conclude that these people are not nuts (Davidson calls this assumption 'charity'), they simply use 'there are' differently than we do. The question of ''What is?'' is at least partially a topic in the philosophy of language, and is not entirely about ontology itself.&lt;ref name=Krieger&gt;{{cite book |author=Uriah Kriegel |url=http://www.uriahkriegel.com/downloads/defenses.pdf |title=Two defenses of common-sense ontology |journal =Dialectica |volume=65 |year=2011 |pages=177–204 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.2011.01262.x |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint has been expressed by [[Eli Hirsch]].&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirsch, Eli |title=Quantifier Variance and Realism: Essays in Metaontology |chapter= Chapter 9: Physical-object ontology, verbal disputes and common sense |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPRqtcjeHPsC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144 |pages=144–177 |isbn=978-0-19-973211-1 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press}} First published as [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2005.tb00506.x/abstract "Physical-Object Ontology, Verbal Disputes, and Common Sense"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch1&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirsch, Eli |title=Quantifier Variance and Realism: Essays in Metaontology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPRqtcjeHPsC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68|pages=68–95 |chapter=Chapter 5: Quantifier variance and realism |isbn=978-0-19-973211-1 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press}} First published as [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1758-2237.2002.tb00061.x/abstract "Quantifier variance and realism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsch interprets [[Hilary Putnam]] as asserting that different concepts of "the existence of something" can be correct.&lt;ref name=Hirsch1 /&gt; This position does not contradict the view that some things do exist, but points out that different 'languages' will have different rules about assigning this property.&lt;ref name=Hirsch1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch2&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirsch, E. |year=2004 |chapter=Sosa's Existential Relativism |title=Ernest Sosa and His Critics |pages=224–232 |editor=John Greco, ed |publisher=Blackwell |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Moz8OeX4w8AC&amp;pg=PA224 |isbn=0-470-75547-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; How to determine the 'fitness' of a 'language' to the world then becomes a subject for investigation.

Common to all [[Indo-European copula]] languages is the double use of the verb "to be" in both stating that entity X exists ("X is.") as well as stating that X has a property ("X is P"). It is sometimes argued that a third use is also distinct, stating that X is a member of a class ("X is a C").   In other language families these roles may have completely different verbs and are less likely to be confused with one another. For example they might say something like "the car has redness" rather than "the car is red".  Hence any discussion of "being" in Indo-European language philosophy may need to make distinctions between these senses.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Ontology and human geography ===
In human geography there are two types of ontology: small "o" which accounts for the practical orientation, describing functions of being a part of the group, thought to oversimplify and ignore key activities. The other "o", or big "O", systematically, logically, and rationally describes the essential characteristics and universal traits. This concept relates closely to Plato's view that the human mind can only perceive a bigger world if they continue to live within the confines of their "caves". However, in spite of the differences, ontology relies on the symbolic agreements among members. That said, ontology is crucial for the axiomatic language frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, F. (2006). Ontology. In B. Warf (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Human Geography''. (pp. 341-343). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reality and actuality ===
According to [[Alfred North Whitehead|A.N. Whitehead]], for ontology, it is useful to distinguish the terms 'reality' and 'actuality'. In this view, an 'actual entity' has a philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority, while a 'real entity' is one which may be actual, or may derive its reality from its logical relation to some actual entity or entities. For example, an occasion in the life of Socrates is an actual entity. But Socrates' being a man does not make 'man' an actual entity, because it refers indeterminately to many actual entities, such as several occasions in the life of Socrates, and also to several occasions in the lives of Alcibiades, and of others. But the notion of man is real; it derives its reality from its reference to those many actual occasions, each of which is an actual entity. An actual occasion is a concrete entity, while terms such as 'man' are abstractions from many concrete relevant entities.

According to Whitehead, an actual entity must earn its philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority by satisfying several philosophical criteria, as follows.
* There is no going behind an actual entity, to find something more fundamental in fact or in efficacy. This criterion is to be regarded as expressing an axiom, or postulated distinguished doctrine.
* An actual entity must be completely determinate in the sense that there may be no confusion about its identity that would allow it to be confounded with another actual entity. In this sense an actual entity is completely concrete, with no potential to be something other than itself. It is what it is. It is a source of potentiality for the creation of other actual entities, of which it may be said to be a part cause. Likewise it is the concretion or realization of potentialities of other actual entities which are its partial causes.
* Causation between actual entities is essential to their actuality. Consequently, for Whitehead, each actual entity has its distinct and definite extension in physical [[Minkowski space]], and so is uniquely identifiable. A description in Minkowski space supports descriptions in time and space for particular observers.
* It is part of the aim of the philosophy of such an ontology as Whitehead's that the actual entities should be all alike, ''qua'' actual entities; they should all satisfy a single definite set of well stated ontological criteria of actuality.

Whitehead proposed that his notion of an occasion of experience satisfies the criteria for its status as the philosophically preferred definition of an actual entity. From a purely logical point of view, each occasion of experience has in full measure the characters of both objective and subjective reality. Subjectivity and objectivity refer to different aspects of an occasion of experience, and in no way do they exclude each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead, A.N.]] (1929). ''Process and Reality'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of other philosophical proposals or candidates as actual entities, in this view, are Aristotle's 'substances', Leibniz' monads, and Descartes '' ′res verae' '', and the more modern 'states of affairs'. Aristotle's substances, such as Socrates, have behind them as more fundamental the 'primary substances', and in this sense do not satisfy Whitehead's criteria. Whitehead is not happy with Leibniz' monads as actual entities because they are "windowless" and do not cause each other. 'States of affairs' are often not closely defined, often without specific mention of extension in physical Minkowski space; they are therefore not necessarily processes of becoming, but may be as their name suggests, simply static states in some sense. States of affairs are contingent on particulars, and therefore have something behind them.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Malet Armstrong|Armstrong, D.M.]] (1997). ''A World of States of Affairs'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|0-521-58064-1}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; One summary of the Whiteheadian actual entity is that it is a process of becoming. Another summary, referring to its causal linkage to other actual entities, is that it is "all window", in contrast with Leibniz' windowless monads.

This view allows philosophical entities other than actual entities to really exist, but not as fundamentally and primarily factual or causally efficacious; they have existence as abstractions, with reality only derived from their reference to actual entities. A Whiteheadian actual entity has a unique and completely definite place and time. Whiteheadian abstractions are not so tightly defined in time and place, and in the extreme, some are timeless and placeless, or 'eternal' entities. All abstractions have logical or conceptual rather than efficacious existence; their lack of definite time does not make them unreal if they refer to actual entities. Whitehead calls this 'the ontological principle'.

=== Microcosmic ontology ===
There is an established and long philosophical history of the concept of atoms as microscopic physical objects.They are far too small to be visible to the naked eye. It was as recent as the nineteenth century that precise estimates of the sizes of putative physical [[atom]]s began to become plausible. Almost direct empirical observation of atomic effects was due to the theoretical investigation of [[Brownian motion]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in the very early twentieth century. But even then, the real existence of atoms was debated by some. Such debate might be labeled 'microcosmic ontology'. Here the word 'microcosm' is used to indicate a physical world of small entities, such as for example atoms.

Subatomic particles are usually considered to be much smaller than atoms. Their real or actual existence may be very difficult to demonstrate empirically.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, D. (1994). Niels Bohr's legacy in contemporary particle physics, pp. 257–268 of ''Niels Bohr and Contemporary Philosophy'', edited by J. Faye, H.J. Folse, Springer, Dordrecht, {{ISBN|978-90-481-4299-6}}, Section 4, Questions of ontology and particle  physics phenomenology, pp. 262–264.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is sometimes drawn between actual and [[virtual particle|virtual]] subatomic particles. Reasonably, one may ask, in what sense, if any, do virtual particles exist as physical entities? For atomic and subatomic particles, difficult questions arise, such as do they possess a precise position, or a precise momentum? A question that continues to be controversial is 'to what kind of physical thing, if any, does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[wave function]] refer?'.&lt;ref name="Isham" /&gt;

=== Ontological argument ===
{{main|Ontological argument}}
The first ontological argument in the [[Christian philosophy|Western Christian]] tradition&lt;ref&gt;"There are three main periods in the history of ontological arguments. The first was in 11th century, when St. Anselm of Canterbury came up with the first ontological argument." Miroslaw Szatkowski (ed.), ''Ontological Proofs Today'', Ontos Verlag, 2012, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] in his 1078 work ''[[Proslogion]]''. Anselm defined God as "that than which nothing greater can be thought", and argued that this being must exist in the mind, even in the mind of the person who denies the existence of God. He suggested that, if the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must also exist in reality. If it only exists in the mind, then an even greater being must be possible—one which exists both in the mind and in reality. Therefore, this greatest possible being must exist in reality. Seventeenth century French philosopher [[René Descartes]] deployed a similar argument. Descartes published several variations of his argument, each of which centred on the idea that God's existence is immediately inferable from a "clear and distinct" idea of a supremely perfect being. In the early eighteenth century, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] augmented Descartes' ideas in an attempt to prove that a "supremely perfect" being is a coherent concept. A more recent ontological argument came from [[Kurt Gödel]], who proposed a [[Formal logic|formal argument]] for God's existence. Norman Malcolm revived the ontological argument in 1960 when he located a second, stronger ontological argument in Anselm's work; [[Alvin Plantinga]] challenged this argument and proposed an alternative, based on [[modal logic]]. Attempts have also been made to validate Anselm's proof using an [[automated theorem prover]]. Other arguments have been categorised as ontological, including those made by Islamic philosophers [[Mulla Sadra]] and [[Allama Tabatabai]].

===Hintikka's locution for existence===

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] puts the view that a useful explication of the notion of existence is in the words "one can find", implicitly in some world or [[Domain of discourse|universe of discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaakko Hintikka|Hintikka, J.]] (1998), ''Paradigms for Language Theory and Other Essays'', Springer Science + Business Media, Dordrecht, {{ISBN|978-90-481-4930-8}}, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4022">An '''option symbol''' is a code by which [[Option (finance)|options]] are identified on an options exchange or a [[futures exchange]].

==History==
Before 2010 the ticker (trading) symbols for US options typically looked like this: ''IBMAF''.
This consisted of a ''root symbol'' ('IBM') + ''month code'' ('A') + ''[[strike price]]'' code ('F'). The root symbol is the symbol of the stock on the stock exchange. After this comes the month code, A-L mean January–December [[call option|calls]], M-X mean January–December [[put option|puts]]. The strike price code is a letter corresponding with a certain strike price (which letter corresponds with which strike price depends on the stock).

On February 12, 2010 the five-character ticker format stopped being used in the US and Canada.

The new standard is now fully in place, as in the first few months after February 12 the LEAP roots and additional roots needed to handle large numbers of options for a given issuer were consolidated into a single root ticker for a given underlying symbol. [[Options Clearing Corporation]]'s (OCC) Options Symbology Initiative (OSI) mandated an industry-wide change to a new option symbol structure, resulting in option symbols 21 characters in length. March 2010 - May 2010 was the symbol consolidation period in which all outgoing option roots will be replaced with the underlying stock symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theocc.com/initiatives/symbology/overview.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111043514/http://www.theocc.com/initiatives/symbology/overview.jsp |archivedate=2010-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2013, [[CBOE]] Mini Options became available for trading on a select group of securities (AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, GLD, and SPY).  These options represent a deliverable of 10 shares of an underlying security, whereas standard equity options represent a deliverable of 100 shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cboe.com/micro/mini/default.aspx|title=Cboe Products - Index Options  Equity Options|website=Cboe.com|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CBOE appended a "7" to the end of the security symbol to represent the mini option contracts.

==The OCC Option Symbol==
The OCC option symbol consists of four parts:
# Root symbol of the underlying stock or [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]], padded with spaces to 6 characters
# Expiration date, 6 digits in the format yymmdd
# Option type, either P or C, for put or call
# Strike price, as the price x 1000, front padded with 0s to 8 digits

Examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interactivebrokers.com/download/ociguide.pdf|title=OCC Option Symbology Initiative (OCI) Implementation Guide|date=September 2012|website=Interactivebrokers.com|accessdate=23 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;SPX   141122P00019500&lt;/pre&gt;This symbol represents a put on SPX, expiring on 11/22/2014, with a strike price of $19.50.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;LAMR  150117C00052500&lt;/pre&gt;This symbol represents a call on LAMR, expiring on 1/17/2015, with a strike price of $52.50.

===Mini Options===
Mini-options contracts trade under a different trading symbol than standard-sized options contracts. Mini-options carry the number "7" at the end of the security symbol.  For example, the Apple mini-options symbol is AAPL7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.cboe.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=745371|work=CBOE|publisher=CBOE|title=CBOE And C2 Plan To Launch Mini-Options On March 18 For AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, GLD And SPY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;AAPL7 131101C00470000&lt;/pre&gt;This symbol represents a mini call option (10 shares) on AAPL, with a strike price of $470, expiring on Nov 1, 2013&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;AAPL  131101C00470000&lt;/pre&gt;This symbol represents the standard call option (100 shares), with the same strike and expiration date.

[[Image:Charlotte Salomon painting in the garden about 1939.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Charlotte Salomon]] painting in her garden about 1939]]
In her biography of the painter [[Charlotte Salomon]], who was transported from Drancy to Auschwitz in September 1943, Mary Felstiner quotes from the testimony of [[Holocaust]] survivors the following points:

For some, Pitchipoi was the nonsense name of a Polish ghetto, a [[Yiddish]] name used by Polish Jews; for some, the word "resonated like an eternal curse"; for others, "Pitchipoi was  a place of compulsory forced labor".&lt;ref&gt;Felstiner, 1994, ''To Paint Her Life'',  pp. 197–199.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was [[Nazi]] policy to keep Jewish prisoners in a state of ignorance about their final destination, so Pitchipoi was invented to fill this vacuum in their knowledge. Most prisoners were murdered on arrival at the [[death camp]]s organised by the Germans.

&lt;/ref&gt;  remaining as a byproduct. It is used commercially as a form of [[waste treatment]] and has been tested for the gasification of [[municipal solid waste]], [[biomass]], [[industrial waste]], [[hazardous waste]], and solid [[hydrocarbons]], such as [[coal]], [[oil sands]], [[Petroleum coke|petcoke]] and [[oil shale]].&lt;ref name=kalinenko/&gt;

== Process ==
Small plasma torches typically use an [[inert gas]] such as [[argon]] where larger torches require [[nitrogen]]. The [[electrode]]s vary from [[copper]] or [[tungsten]] to [[hafnium]] or [[zirconium]], along with various other [[alloy]]s.  A strong electric current under high voltage passes between the two electrodes as an [[electric arc]]. Pressurized inert gas is [[Ionization|ionized]] passing through the plasma created by the arc. The torch's temperature ranges from {{convert|4000|to|25000|F|C|-2}}.&lt;ref name="recoveredenergy"&gt;

The waste is heated, melted and finally [[Vaporization|vaporized]]. Only at these extreme conditions can molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] occur by breaking apart [[Covalent bond|molecular bonds]]. [[molecule|Complex molecules]] are separated into individual [[atoms]]. The resulting elemental components are in a gaseous phase ([[syngas]]). Molecular dissociation using plasma is referred to as "plasma [[pyrolysis]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Feedstocks ===
The feedstock for plasma waste treatment is most often [[municipal solid waste]], [[organic waste]], or both. Feedstocks may also include [[biomedical waste]] and [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] materials.  Content and consistency of the waste directly impacts performance of a plasma facility. Pre-sorting and recycling useful material before gasification provides consistency. Too much inorganic material such as metal and construction waste increases slag production, which in turn decreases [[syngas]] production. However, a benefit is that the slag itself is chemically inert and safe to handle (certain materials may affect the content of the gas produced, however&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;). Shredding waste before entering the main chamber helps to increase syngas production. This creates an efficient transfer of energy which ensures more materials are broken down.&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/plasma-converter.htm| title=How Stuff Works- Plasma Converter|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For improved processing steam is sometimes added into the plasma gasification process.

=== Yields ===

Pure highly calorific [[syngas|synthesis gas]] consists predominantly of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="synconversion"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inorganic compound]]s in the waste stream are not broken down but melted, which includes glass, ceramics, and various metals.

The high temperature and lack of oxygen prevents the formation of many toxic compounds such as [[furan]]s, [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], or [[sulfur dioxide]] in the flame itself. However, dioxins are formed during cooling of the syngas.

Metals resulting from plasma [[pyrolysis]] can be recovered from the slag and eventually sold as a commodity. Inert slag produced from some processes is granulated and can be used in construction.  A portion of the syngas produced feeds on-site turbines, which power the plasma torches and thus support the feed system. This is self-sustaining electric power.&lt;ref name="synconversion"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7253">{{Probability fundamentals}}
The '''Kolmogorov axioms''' are a fundamental part of [[Andrey Kolmogorov]]'s [[probability theory]].
In it, the [[probability]] ''P'' of some [[event (probability theory)|event]] ''E'', denoted &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt;, is usually defined as to satisfy these axioms.
The axioms are described below.

These assumptions can be summarised as follows: Let (Ω,&amp;nbsp;''F'',&amp;nbsp;''P'') be a [[measure space]] with  ''P''(Ω)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Then (Ω,&amp;nbsp;''F'',&amp;nbsp;''P'') is a [[probability space]], with sample space Ω, event space ''F'' and probability measure&amp;nbsp;''P''.

An alternative approach to formalising probability, favoured by some [[Bayesian theory|Bayesians]], is given by [[Cox's theorem]].

== Axioms ==

==={{Anchor|Non-negativity}}First axiom ===
The probability of an event is a non-negative real number:
:&lt;math&gt;P(E)\in\mathbb{R}, P(E)\geq 0 \qquad \forall E \in F&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the event space. In particular, &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt; is always finite, in contrast with more general [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]].  Theories which assign [[negative probability]] relax the first axiom.

=== {{Anchor|Unitarity|Normalization}}Second axiom ===
{{see also|Unitarity (physics)}}
This is the assumption of [[unit measure]]: that the probability that at least one of the [[elementary event]]s in the entire sample space will occur is 1.
: &lt;math&gt;P(\Omega) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

=== {{Anchor|Sigma additivity|Finite additivity|Countable additivity|Finitely additive}}Third axiom ===
This is the assumption of [[&amp;sigma;-additivity]]:
: Any [[countable]] sequence of disjoint sets (synonymous with ''[[Mutual_exclusivity|mutually exclusive]]'' events) &lt;math&gt;E_1, E_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; satisfies 
::&lt;math&gt;P\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty E_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(E_i).&lt;/math&gt;
Some authors consider merely [[finitely additive]] probability spaces, in which case one just needs an [[algebra of sets]], rather than a [[&amp;sigma;-algebra]].  [[Quasiprobability distribution]]s in general relax the third axiom.

== Consequences ==
From the [[Kolmogorov]] axioms, one can deduce other useful rules for calculating probabilities.

=== The probability of the empty set ===

: &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

In some cases, &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is not the only event with probability&amp;nbsp;0.

=== Monotonicity ===

: &lt;math&gt;\quad\text{if}\quad A\subseteq B\quad\text{then}\quad P(A)\leq P(B).&lt;/math&gt; 

If A is a subset of, or equal to B, then the probability of A is less than, or equal to the probability of B.

=== The numeric bound ===
It immediately follows from the monotonicity property that
: &lt;math&gt;0\leq P(E)\leq 1\qquad \forall E\in F.&lt;/math&gt;

== Proofs ==
The proofs of these properties are both interesting and insightful. They illustrate the power of the third axiom, and its interaction with the remaining two axioms. When studying [[axiomatic]] [[probability theory]], many deep consequences follow from merely these three axioms.
In order to verify the monotonicity property, we set &lt;math&gt;E_1=A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2=B\setminus A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\quad A\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_i=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that the sets &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint and &lt;math&gt;E_1\cup E_2\cup\cdots=B&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, we obtain from the third axiom that
: &lt;math&gt;P(A)+P(B\setminus A)+\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(E_i)=P(B).&lt;/math&gt;
Since the left-hand side of this equation is a series of non-negative numbers, and since it converges to &lt;math&gt;P(B)&lt;/math&gt; which is finite, we obtain both &lt;math&gt;P(A)\leq P(B)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
The second part of the statement  is seen by contradiction: if &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing)=a&lt;/math&gt; then the left hand side is not less than infinity
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(E_i)=\sum_{i=3}^\infty P(\varnothing)=\sum_{i=3}^\infty a = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } a=0, \\ \infty &amp; \text{if } a&gt;0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then we obtain a contradiction, because the sum does not exceed &lt;math&gt;P(B)&lt;/math&gt; which is finite. Thus, &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;. We have shown as a byproduct of the proof of monotonicity that &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Further consequences ==
Another important property is:

: &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B).&lt;/math&gt;

This is called the addition law of probability, or the sum rule.
That is, the probability that ''A'' ''or'' ''B'' will happen is the sum of the probabilities that ''A'' will happen and that ''B'' will happen, minus the probability that both ''A'' ''and'' ''B'' will happen. The proof of this is as follows:

Firstly,

:&lt;math&gt;P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B\setminus A)&lt;/math&gt; (by Axiom 3)

So,

:&lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B\setminus  (A \cap B))&lt;/math&gt; (by :&lt;math&gt;P(B \setminus A) = P(B\setminus  (A \cap B))&lt;/math&gt;).

Also, 

:&lt;math&gt;P(B) = P(B\setminus (A \cap B)) + P(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;

and eliminating &lt;math&gt;P(B\setminus (A \cap B))&lt;/math&gt; from both equations gives us the desired result.

An extension of the addition law to any number of sets is the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]].

Setting ''B'' to the complement ''A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;'' of ''A'' in the addition law gives

: &lt;math&gt;P\left(A^{c}\right) = P(\Omega\setminus A) = 1 - P(A)&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the probability that any event will ''not'' happen (or the event's [[Complement_(set_theory)|complement]]) is 1 minus the probability that it will.

== Simple example: coin toss ==
Consider a single coin-toss, and assume that the coin will either land heads (H) or tails (T) (but not both).  No assumption is made as to whether the coin is fair.

We may define:

: &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \{H,T\}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;F = \{\varnothing, \{H\}, \{T\}, \{H,T\}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Kolmogorov's axioms imply that:

: &lt;math&gt;P(\varnothing) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
The probability of ''neither'' heads ''nor'' tails, is 0.

: &lt;math&gt;P(\{H,T\}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
The probability of ''either'' heads ''or'' tails, is 1.

: &lt;math&gt;P(\{H\}) + P(\{T\}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
The sum of the probability of heads and the probability of tails, is 1.

In [[energy conservation|conservation]] and [[energy economics]], the '''rebound effect''' (or '''take-back effect''') is the reduction in expected gains from new technologies that increase the efficiency of [[natural resource|resource]] use, because of behavioral or other systemic responses. These responses usually tend to offset the beneficial effects of the new technology or other measures taken.

While the literature on the rebound effect generally focuses on the effect of technological improvements on energy consumption, the theory can also be applied to the use of any [[natural resource]] or other input, such as [[Labor (economics)|labor]]. The rebound effect is generally expressed as a ratio of the lost benefit compared to the expected environmental benefit when holding consumption constant.&lt;ref name=Grubb&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Grubb| given=M.J.| title=Energy efficiency and economic fallacies| journal=Energy Policy |volume=18 | year=1990 | pages=783–785 | doi=10.1016/0301-4215(90)90031-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, if a 5% improvement in vehicle [[fuel efficiency]] results in only a 2% drop in fuel use, there is a 60% rebound effect (since {{frac|(5-2)|5}} = 60%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Wang|first = Zhaohua|last2 = Han|first2 = Bai|last3 = Lu|first3 = Milin|date = 2016|title = Measurement of energy rebound effect in households: Evidence from residential electricity consumption in Beijing, China|url = |journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume = 58|pages = 852–861|doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'missing' 3% might have been consumed by driving faster or further than before.

The existence of the rebound effect is uncontroversial. However, debate continues as to the magnitude and impact of the effect in real world situations.&lt;ref name=Sorrell&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/asset/3B43125E-EEBD-4AB3-B06EA914C30F7B3E/| title = The rebound effect: An assessment of the evidence for economy-wide energy savings from improved energy efficiency| author = Steven Sorrell | year = 2007 | publisher= UK Energy Research Centre| accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the magnitude of the rebound effect, there are five different rebound effect (RE) types:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Saunders|first = Harry D.|date = 2008|title = Fuel conserving (and using) production functions|url = |journal = Energy Economics|volume = 30|issue = 5|pages = 2184–2235|doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2007.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Super conservation (RE &lt; 0): the actual resource savings are higher than expected savings – the rebound effect is negative. This occurs if the increase in efficiency reduces costs.
#Zero rebound (RE = 0): The actual resource savings are equal to expected savings – the rebound effect is zero.
#Partial rebound (0 &lt; RE &lt; 1): The actual resource savings are less than expected savings – the rebound effect is between 0% and 100%. This is sometimes known as 'take-back', and is the most common result of empirical studies on individual markets.
#Full rebound (RE = 1): The actual resource savings are equal to the increase in usage – the rebound effect is at 100%.
#Backfire (RE &gt; 1): The actual resource savings are negative because usage increased beyond potential savings – the rebound effect is higher than 100%. This situation is commonly known as the [[Jevons paradox]].

In order to avoid the rebound effect, [[environmental economics|environmental economists]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be taxed in order to keep the cost of use the same.&lt;ref name=Wackernagel/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Jevons paradox|Khazzoom-Brookes postulate}}

The rebound effect was first described by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in his 1865 book ''[[The Coal Question]]'', where he observed that the invention in Britain of a more efficient steam engine meant that the use of coal became economically viable for many new uses. This ultimately led to increased coal demand and much increased coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular use fell. According to Jevons, "It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |title=The Coal Question |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |location=London |year=1866 |edition=2nd |at=Chapter VII |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnCQ0.html |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most contemporary authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound effect in the research literature. Although Khazzoom did not use the term, he raised the idea that there is a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the final consumer product.&lt;ref name=Khazzoom&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Khazzoom| given=Daniel J.| title=Economic implications for mandated efficiency in standards for household appliances.| journal= The Energy Journal |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1980 | pages=21–40 | doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol1-no4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in driving speed and/or kilometres driven, as long as the [[price elasticity of demand]] for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in [[garden lighting]] after the introduction of energy-saving [[Light Emitting Diode]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher C. M.|last2=Kuester|first2=Theres|last3=Sánchez de Miguel|first3=Alejandro|last4=Baugh|first4=Kimberly|last5=Jechow|first5=Andreas|last6=Hölker|first6=Franz|last7=Bennie|first7=Jonathan|last8=Elvidge|first8=Christopher D.|last9=Gaston|first9=Kevin J.|last10=Guanter|first10=Luis|title=Artificially lit surface of Earth at night increasing in radiance and extent|journal=Science Advances|date=22 November 2017|volume=3|issue=11|pages=e1701528|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1701528|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701528 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101195115/http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1701528 |archivedate=2018-01-01 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand (the [[Jevons paradox]]).

Khazzoom's thesis was criticized heavily by Michael Grubb&lt;ref name=Grubb/&gt; and [[Amory Lovins]]&lt;ref name=Lovins&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovins|first1=Amory B.|title=Energy Saving Resulting from the Adoption of More Efficient Appliances: Another View|journal=The Energy Journal|date=1988|volume=9|issue=2|doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol9-no2-10|JSTOR=41970456}} And: {{cite journal|last1=Henly|first1=John|last2=Ruderman|first2=Henry|last3=Levine|first3=Mark D.|title=Energy Saving Resulting from the Adoption of More Efficient Appliances: A Follow-up|journal=The Energy Journal|date=1988|volume=9|issue=2|pages=163–170|JSTOR=41970457}}&lt;/ref&gt; who dismissed any disconnection between energy efficiency improvements in an individual market, and an economy-wide reduction in energy consumption. Developing Khazzoom's idea further, and prompting heated debate in the Energy Policy journal at that time, Len Brookes wrote of the fallacies in the energy-efficiency solution to greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=Brookes&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Brookes| given=L.| title=The greenhouse effect: the fallacies in the energy efficient solution| journal=Energy Policy |volume=18 | year=1990 | pages=199–201 | doi=10.1016/0301-4215(90)90145-t}}&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis showed that any economically justified improvements in energy efficiency would in fact stimulate economic growth and increase total energy use. For improvements in energy efficiency to contribute to a reduction in economy-wide energy consumption, the improvement must come at a greater economic cost. Commenting in regard to energy efficiency advocates, he concludes that, "the present high profile of the topic seems to owe more to the current tide of green fervor than to sober consideration of the facts, and the validity and cost of solutions."&lt;ref name=Brookes/&gt;

===Khazzoom-Brookes postulate===
In 1992, economist Harry Saunders coined the term "[[Khazzoom-Brookes postulate]]" to describe the idea that energy efficiency gains paradoxically result in increases in energy use (the modern day equivalent of the [[Jevons paradox]]). He modeled energy efficiency gains using a variety of neo-classical growth models, and showed that the postulate is true over a wide range of assumptions. In the conclusion of his paper, Saunders stated that:&lt;ref name=Saunders&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Saunders| given=Harry| title=The Khazzom-Brookes Postulate and Neoclassical Growth| journal=Energy Journal |volume=13 | year=1992 | pages=131–148 | doi=10.5547/issn0195-6574-ej-vol13-no4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|In the absence of efficiency gains, energy use will grow in lock step with economic growth (energy intensity will stay fixed) when energy prices are fixed. … Energy efficiency gains can increase energy consumption by two means: by making energy appear effectively cheaper than other inputs; and by increasing economic growth, which pulls up energy use. … These results, while by no means proving the Khazzoom-Brookes postulate, call for prudent energy analysts and policy makers to pause a long moment before dismissing it.}}

This work provided a theoretical grounding for empirical studies and played an important role in framing the problem of the rebound effect. It also reinforced an emerging ideological divide between energy economists on the extent of the yet to be named effect.  The two tightly held positions are:
*Technological improvements in energy efficiency enable economic growth that was otherwise impossible without the improvement; as such, energy efficiency improvements will usually back-fire in the long term.
*Technological improvements in energy efficiency may result in a small take-back. However, even in the long term, energy efficiency improvements usually result in large overall energy savings.

Even though many studies have been undertaken in this area, neither position has yet claimed a consensus view in the academic literature. Recent studies have demonstrated that direct rebound effects are significant (about 30% for energy), but that there is not enough information about indirect effects to know whether or how often back-fire occurs. Economists tend to the first position, but most governments, businesses, and environmental groups adhere to the second. Governments and environmental groups often advocate further research into fuel efficiency and radical increases in the efficient use of energy as the primary means for reducing energy use and reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (to alleviate the impacts of [[climate change]]). However, if the first position more accurately reflects economic reality, current efforts to invent fuel-efficient technologies may not much reduce energy use, and may in fact paradoxically increase [[oil]] and [[coal]] consumption, and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, over the long run.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herring&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herring|first=Horace|last2=Roy|first2=Robin|date=2007|title=Technological innovation, energy efficient design and the rebound effect|url=|journal=Technovation|volume=27|issue=4|pages=194–203|doi=10.1016/j.technovation.2006.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of effects==
The full rebound effect can be distinguished into three different economic reactions to technological changes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Sorrell|first = Steve|last2 = Dimitropoulos|first2 = John|date = 2008|title = The rebound effect: Microeconomic definitions, limitations and extensions|url = |journal = Ecological Economics|volume = 65|issue = 3|pages = 636–649|doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Direct rebound effect: An increase in consumption of a good is caused by the lower cost of use. This is caused by the [[substitution effect]].
# Indirect rebound effect: The lower cost of a service enables increased household consumption of other goods and services. For example, the savings from a more efficient cooling system may be put into another luxury good. This is caused by the [[income effect]].
# Economy wide effect: The fall in service cost reduces the price of other goods, creates new production possibilities and increases economic growth.
In the example of improved vehicle fuel efficiency, the direct effect would be the increased fuel use from more driving as driving becomes cheaper. The indirect effect would incorporate the increased consumption of other goods enabled by household cost savings from increased fuel efficiency. Since consumption of other goods increases, the embodied fuel used in the production of those goods would increase as well. Finally, the economy-wide effect would include the long-term effect of the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency on production and consumption possibilities throughout the economy, including any effects on economic growth rates.

===Direct and indirect effects===
[[Image:Efficiencyreboundgraph.png|thumb|right|400px|Direct and Indirect Effects]]

For cost reducing resource efficiency, distinguishing between direct and indirect effects is shown in Figure 1 below.  The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and measured in terms of kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis.  An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing.  This shifts the household budget line rightwards.  The result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price, but also an income effect due to the increased real income.  The substitution effect increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the income effect from QS to Q2.  The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect.  The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2.  The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt; In the manufacturing sector, it has been estimated that there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt; A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur.

The rebound effect can increase the difficulty of projecting the reduction in greenhouse emissions from an improvement in energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=RS20981/&gt; Estimation of the scale of direct effects on residential electricity, heating and motor fuel consumption has been common motivation for research of rebound effects.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt; Evaluation and econometric methods are the two approaches generally employed in estimating the size of this effect.  Evaluation methods rely on quasi-experimental studies and measure the before and after changes to energy consumption from the implementation of energy efficient technology, while econometric methods utilize [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity estimates]] to forecast the likely effects from changes in the effective price of energy services.

Research has found that in [[developed countries]], the direct rebound effect is usually small to moderate, ranging from roughly 5% to 40% in residential space heating and cooling.&lt;ref name=RS20981&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/energy/eng-80.cfm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228115335/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/energy/eng-80.cfm | archivedate = 2007-12-28 |last1=Gottron|first1=Frank | title = Energy Efficiency and the Rebound Effect: Does Increasing Efficiency Decrease Demand? | date=2001|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service reports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greening&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greening|first1=Lorna A. |last2=Greene|first2=David L.|last3=Difiglio|first3=Carmen|title=Energy efficiency and consumption — the rebound effect — a survey|journal=Energy Policy|date=2000|volume=28|issue=6-7|pages=389–401|doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://repositories.cdlib.org/ucei/policy/EPE-014 | title = The Effect of Improved Fuel Economy on Vehicle Miles Traveled: Estimating the Rebound Effect Using U.S. State Data, 1966-2001 | first1 = Kenneth A. |last1=Small | first2=Kurt |last2= Van Dender | date = 21 September 2005 | publisher= University of California Energy Institute: Policy &amp; Economics | accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freire-González | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = Empirical evidence of direct rebound effect in Catalonia | url = | journal = Energy Policy | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 2309–2314 | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2009.12.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the direct rebound effect can be attributed to consumers who were previously unable to use a service.&lt;ref name=Dimitropoulos&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorrell|first=Steve|last2=Dimitropoulos|first2=John|last3=Sommerville|first3=Matt|date=2009|title=Empirical estimates of the direct rebound effect: A review|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1356–1371|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2008.11.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rebound effect may be more significant in the context of the undeveloped markets in [[developing economies]].&lt;ref name=Roy2000&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Roy| given=Joyashree| title=The rebound effect: some empirical evidence from India| journal=Energy Policy |volume=28 | year=2000 | pages=433–438 |doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(00)00027-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antal|first1=Miklós|last2=van den Bergh|first2=Jeroen C.J.M.|title=Re-spending rebound: A macro-level assessment for OECD countries and emerging economies|journal=Energy Policy|date=2014|volume=68|pages=585–590|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect effects from conservation ===
[[Image:Conservationreboundgraph.png|thumb|400px| Figure2: change in preferences of a household revealing indirect effects from conservation]]

For conservation measures, indirect effects closely approximate the total economy-wide effect.  Conservation measures constitute a change in consumption patterns away from particular targeted goods towards other goods. Figure 2 shows that a change in preference of a household results in a new consumption pattern that has less of the target good (QT to QT`), and more of all other goods (QO to QO`).  The [[resource consumption]] or externalities embodied in this other consumption is the indirect effect.

Although a persuasive view has prevailed that indirect effects with respect to energy and greenhouse emissions should be very small due to energy directly comprising only a small component of household expenditure, this view is gradually being eroded.&lt;ref name=Lovins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schipper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schipper|first1=Lee|last2=Grubb|first2=Michael|title=On the rebound?

===Economy wide effects===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Resource decoupling and the rebound effect }}
Even if the direct and indirect rebound effects add up to less than 100%, technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy-wide effects that results in increased resource use for the economy as a whole. In particular, this would happen if increased resource efficiency enables an expansion of production in the economy, and an increase in the rate of [[economic growth]]. For example, for the case of energy use, more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources. It is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates. In the 1970s, sharp increases in petroleum prices led to [[stagflation]] ([[recession]] and [[inflation]]) in the developed countries, whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth. An improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices, and leads to faster economic growth. Economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use, more efficient technologies will lead to increased use, because of this growth effect.

To model the scale of this effect, economists use computational general equilibrium (CGE) models.  While CGE methodology is by no means perfect, results indicate that economy-wide rebound effects are likely to be very high, with estimates above 100% being rather common.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt; One simple CGE model has been made available online for use by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saunders|first1=Harry D|title=A Calculator for Energy Consumption Changes Arising from New Technologies|journal=The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis &amp; Policy|date=2005|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1515/1538-0653.1467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income level variation===

Research has shown that the direct rebound effects for energy services is lower at high income levels, due to less price sensitivity. Studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by UK households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile. Studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Paul|last2=Blundell|first2=Richard|last3=Micklewright|first3=John|title=Modelling Household Energy Expenditures Using Micro-Data|journal=The Economic Journal|date=1989|volume=99|issue=397|page=720|doi=10.2307/2233767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milne|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Boardman|first2=Brenda|title=Making cold homes warmer: the effect of energy efficiency improvements in low-income homes. A report to the Energy Action Grants Agency Charitable Trust|journal=Energy Policy|date=2000|volume=28|issue=6-7|pages=411–424|doi=10.1016/s0301-4215(00)00019-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluation methods have also been used to assess the scale of rebound effects from efficient heating installations in lower income homes in the United Kingdom. This research found that direct effects are close to 100% in many cases.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hong|first1=Sung H.|last2=Oreszczyn|first2=Tadj|last3=Ridley|first3=Ian|title=The impact of energy efficient refurbishment on the space heating fuel consumption in English dwellings|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=2006|volume=38|issue=10|pages=1171–1181|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2006.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; High income households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum comfort level, regardless of the cost – therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating, for it was already optimal. But low-income households are more price sensitive, and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating.&lt;ref name=Dimitropoulos/&gt; In this case, a high direct rebound is likely. This analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption.

The size of the rebound effect is likely to be higher in developing countries according to macro-level assessments &lt;ref name=Antal/&gt; and case studies. One case study was undertaken in rural India to evaluate the impact of an alternative energy scheme.&lt;ref name=Roy2000/&gt; Households were given solar powered lighting in an attempt to reduce the use of kerosene for lighting to zero except for seasons with insufficient sunshine.  The scheme was also designed to encourage a future willingness to pay for efficient lighting.  The results were surprising, with high direct rebounds between 50 and 80%, and total direct and indirect rebound above 100%.  Because the new lighting source was essentially zero cost, operating hours for lighting went up from an average of 2 to 6 per day, with new lighting consisting of a combination of both the no-cost solar lamps and also kerosene lamps.  Also, more cooking was undertaken which enabled an increased trade of food with neighboring villages.

===Rebounds with respect to time===

The individual opportunity of cost is an often overlooked cause of the rebound effect. Just as improved workplace tools result in an increased expectation of productivity, so does the increased availability of time result in an increase in demand for a service.&lt;ref name=Herring/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binswanger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binswanger|first1=Mathias|title=Technological progress and sustainable development: what about the rebound effect?|journal=Ecological Economics|date=2001|volume=36|issue=1|pages=119–132|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00214-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jalas&gt;{{cite journal | surname=Jalas| given=Mikko| title=A time use perspective on the materials intensity of consumption | journal=Ecological Economics|volume=41 | year=2002 | pages=101–123 | doi =10.1016/s0921-8009(02)00018-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand. Because time cost forms a major part of the total cost of commuter transport, rapid modes will reduce real costs, but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption.&lt;ref name=Sorrell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binswanger/&gt; While important, it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time. Time saved can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect.  Labor time saved at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates.  For leisure time saving, this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time.

==Suggested solutions==
In order to ensure that efficiency enhancing technological improvements actually reduce fuel use, the [[ecological economics|ecological economists]] [[Mathis Wackernagel]] and [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be "taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in [[natural capital]] rehabilitation."&lt;ref name=Wackernagel&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wackernagel | first1 = Mathis | last2 = Rees | first2 = William  | year = 1997 | title = Perceptual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital: economics from an ecological footprint perspective | url = | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 3–24 | doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(96)00077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be achieved through, for example, the imposition of a [[ecotax|green tax]], a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] program, higher [[fuel tax]]es or the proposed "restore" approach where part of the savings is directed back to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bindewald|first1=Eckart|title=An R of sustainability that can tame the "conundrum"|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|date=2013|page=1:e46v1|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.46v1|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policies can also directly address projected yearly consumption of energy rather than device efficiency, especially for systems where the use can be accurately projected, such as street lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C. C. M.|last2=Hänel|first2=A.|last3=Hölker|first3=F.|title=Redefining efficiency for outdoor lighting|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2014|volume=7|issue=6|page=1806|doi=10.1039/C4EE00566J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale ==
The Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale (SAS) was introduced by [[Aaron T. Beck]] as a means of assessing two cognitive-personality constructs hypothesized as risk factors in depression. The scale focuses on the two personality traits of Sociotropy (social dependency) and Autonomy (satisfying independency). The development of the SAS was gathered through patient self-reports and patient records collected from therapists. Using psychometrics, from the sample of 378 psychiatric patients questions were placed into a two-factor structure where the final pool of items was 60-109.&lt;ref name="bieling-2000"&gt;{{cite |last1=Bieling |first1=Peter J. |last2=Beck |first2=Aaron T. |last3=Brown |first3=Gregory K. |year=2000 |title=The Sociotropy–Autonomy Scale:Structure and Implications |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=763–780 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishers |url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/194/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1005599714224.pdf?auth66=1397326819_0acc2242811435d4b75cd0911a704dca&amp;ext=.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2014 |doi=10.1023/A:1005599714224}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there each 30 items generated three factors for sociotropy: Concern About Disapproval, Attachment/Cocern About Separation, and Pleasing Others; and three for autonomy: Individualistic or Autonomous Achievement, Mobility/Freedom from Control of Others, and Preference for Solitude. The SAS has 60 items rated on a 5 point scale (ranging from 0 to 4). Scores are then totaled separately on each dimension. The scale has been modified since its development. The current SAS decomposes Sociotropy into two factors (''neediness'' and ''connectedness''). Neediness is associated with the symptoms of depression—and connectedness is a sensitivity towards others, and associated with valuing relationships.

Since the development of the SAS, many other measures of personality constructs have been developed to assess other personality traits with some overlapping with the SAS, but examining for different traits.

== Self-control ==
Sociotropic individuals react differently when faced with situations that involve [[self-control]].&lt;ref name="sato-2011" /&gt; Sociotropic individuals consume more food, or try to match a peer's eating habits when they believe doing so makes the peer more comfortable.&lt;ref name="exline-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Exline |first1=Julie J. |last2=Zell |first2=Anne L. |last3=Bratslavsky |first3=Ellen |last4=Hamilton |first4=Michelle |last5=Swenson |first5=Anne |year=2012 |title=People-pleasing through eating:  Sociotropy predicts greater eating in response to perceived social pressure. |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=169–193 |doi=10.1521/jscp.2012.31.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often hypothesized as being a result of the individual attempting to achieve social approval and avoid social rejection. The social pressure and dependence can cause a loss of self-control in an individual, especially if they are unaware of their desire for social acceptance.

== Depression ==
Much research on Sociotropy focuses on links between personality and the risk for depression. People who are very dependent are classified as sociotropic individuals, and are more prone to depression as they seek to sustain their low self-esteem by establishing secure [[interpersonal relationships]].&lt;ref name="coyne-1995"&gt;{{cite| |last1=Coyne |first1=James C. |last2=Whiffen |first2=Valerie E. |year=1995 |title=Issues in Personality as Diathesis for Depression: The Case of Sociotropy-Dependency and Autonomy-Self-Criticism |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=358–378 |publisher=US: American Psychological Association |url=http://psycnet.apa.org.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/journals/bul/118/3/358.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2014 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.118.3.358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociotropic individuals are heavily invested into their relationships with other people and have higher desires for acceptance, support, understanding, and guidance—which is problematic when relationships fail. People who are sociotropic and going through failed relationships are likely to become depressed due to intensified feelings of abandonment and loss.  Researchers have a hard time figuring out exactly how much personality affects risk for depression, as it is hard to isolate traits for research, though they conclude that a person can either be sociotropic or independent, but not both.

== Research == 
Sociotropy has been linked to other personality traits such as [[introversion]] and lack of assertion. Lack of assertion has been hypothesized to be due to the need to please others to build interpersonal relationships. Individuals who are sociotropic avoid confrontation to prevent abandonment.&lt;ref name="sato-2006"&gt;{{cite| |last1=Sato |first1=Toru |last2=McCann |first2=Doug |year=2007 |title=Sociotropy–autonomy and interpersonal problems |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=153–162 |publisher=Wiley-LISS |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/doi/10.1002/da.20230/pdf |accessdate=9 April 2014 |doi=10.1002/da.20230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the lines of lack of assertion there has also been research studying the connection between sociotropy and shyness. The characteristic interpersonal dependence and fear of social rejection are also attributes of shyness. Research shows that many items from the SAS relate to dimensions of dependence and preoccupations for receiving approval of others, which is problematic in interpersonal relationships for people who are shy. Individuals who are shy and sociotropic have internal conflicts to want to avoid others as well as having strong motives to approach people.&lt;ref name="bruch-1999"&gt;{{cite| |last1=Bruch |first1=Monroe A |last2=Rivet |first2= Kathy M. |last3=Heimberg |first3=Richard G. |last4=Hunt |first4=Anne |last5=McIntosh |first5=Bonnie |year=1999 |title=Shyness and Sociotropy: Additive and Interactive Relations in Predicting Interpersonal Concerns |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=373–406 |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/doi/10.1111/1467-6494.00059/pdf |accessdate=9 April 2014 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from such research concludes that sociotropy predicts other symptoms of discomfort in assertive situations and in conversations.

Research on the subject also seems to connect a link between higher levels of anxiety and sociotropy. Putting excessive amounts of energy into dependent relationships increases anxiety. The behavioral disposition that causes an individual to depend on others for personal satisfaction can also have an effect on their anxiety levels.&lt;ref name="sato-2004" /&gt; The research concluded that anxiety and sociotropy are positively correlated in many situations such as Social Evaluation, Physical Danger, and Ambiguous Situations. Sociotropy and anxiety are present in these situations because they are social by definition, and therefore associated with emphasis on social relationships that are characteristic of sociotropic individuals.

{{General relativity sidebar}}

The '''stress–energy tensor''', sometimes '''stress–energy–momentum tensor''' or '''energy–momentum tensor''', is a [[tensor]] quantity in [[physics]] that describes the [[density]] and [[flux]] of [[energy]] and [[momentum]] in [[spacetime]], generalizing the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]] of [[Newtonian physics]]. It is an attribute of [[matter]], [[radiation]], and non-gravitational [[force field (physics)|force field]]s. The stress–energy tensor is the source of the [[gravitational field]] in the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]], just as mass density is the source of such a field in [[Newtonian gravity]].

==Definition==
The stress–energy tensor involves the use of superscripted variables (''not'' exponents; see [[tensor index notation]] and [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation notation]]). If [[Cartesian coordinates]] in [[SI units]] are used, then the components of the position [[four-vector]] are given by: {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''y''}}, and {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''}}, where ''t'' is time in seconds, and ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are distances in meters.

The stress–energy tensor is defined as the [[tensor]] ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sup&gt; of order two that gives the [[flux]] of the ''α''th component of the [[momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] across a surface with constant ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt; [[coordinate]]. In the theory of [[general relativity|relativity]], this momentum vector is taken as the [[four-momentum]]. In general relativity, the stress–energy tensor is symmetric,&lt;ref&gt;On pp. 141–142 of [[Gravitation (book)|Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler]], section 5.7 "Symmetry of the Stress–Energy Tensor" begins with "All the stress–energy tensors explored above were symmetric. That they could not have been otherwise one sees as follows."&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta} = T^{\beta \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

In some alternative theories like [[Einstein–Cartan theory]], the stress–energy tensor may not be perfectly symmetric because of a nonzero [[spin tensor]], which geometrically corresponds to a nonzero [[torsion tensor]].

==Identifying the components of the tensor==
Because the stress–energy tensor is of order two, its components can be displayed in 4&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;4 matrix form:
:&lt;math&gt;
(T^{\mu\nu})_{\mu,\nu=0,1,2,3} = \begin{pmatrix} T^{00} &amp; T^{01} &amp; T^{02} &amp; T^{03} \\ T^{10} &amp; T^{11} &amp; T^{12} &amp; T^{13} \\ T^{20} &amp; T^{21} &amp; T^{22} &amp; T^{23} \\ T^{30} &amp; T^{31} &amp; T^{32} &amp; T^{33} \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the following, ''i'' and ''k'' range from 1 through 3.

The time–time component is the density of relativistic mass, i.e. the [[energy density]] divided by the speed of light squared.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W., Misner, Thorne, Kip S., Wheeler, John A., (1973). Gravitation. San Frandisco: W. H. Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-0334-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its components have a direct physical interpretation. In the case of a perfect fluid this component is
:&lt;math&gt;T^{00} = \rho,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[relativistic mass]] per unit volume, and for an electromagnetic field in otherwise empty space this component is
:&lt;math&gt;T^{00} = {1 \over c^2}\left(\frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} B^2 \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' and ''B'' are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;d'Inverno, R.A, (1992). Introducing Einstein's Relativity. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-859686-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flux of relativistic mass across the ''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' surface is equivalent to the density of the ''i''th component of linear momentum,
:&lt;math&gt;T^{0i} = T^{i0}.&lt;/math&gt;

The components
:&lt;math&gt; T^{ik}&lt;/math&gt;
represent flux of ''i''th component of linear momentum across the ''x&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' surface.  In particular,
:&lt;math&gt; T^{ii}&lt;/math&gt;
(not summed) represents [[tensile stress|normal stress]], which is called [[pressure]] when it is independent of direction. The remaining components
:&lt;math&gt; T^{ik} \quad i \ne k &lt;/math&gt;
represent [[shear stress]] (compare with the [[stress (physics)|stress tensor]]).

In [[solid state physics]] and [[fluid mechanics]], the stress tensor is defined to be the spatial components of the stress–energy tensor in the [[proper frame]] of reference. In other words, the stress energy tensor in [[engineering]] ''differs'' from the stress–energy tensor here by a momentum convective term.

===Covariant and mixed forms===

In most of this article we work with the contravariant form, ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt; of the stress–energy tensor. However, it is often necessary to work with the covariant form,
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu} = T^{\alpha \beta} g_{\alpha \mu} g_{\beta \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

or the mixed form,
:&lt;math&gt;T^\mu{}_\nu = T^{\mu \alpha} g_{\alpha \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

or as a mixed [[tensor density]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{T}^\mu{}_\nu = T^\mu{}_\nu \sqrt{-g} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In this article we use the spacelike [[Sign convention#Metric signature|sign convention]] (−+++) for the metric signature.

==Conservation law==

===In special relativity===

{{see also|Relativistic angular momentum}}

The stress–energy tensor is the conserved [[Noether's theorem|Noether current]] associated with [[spacetime]] [[translation (physics)|translation]]s.

The divergence of the non-gravitational stress–energy is zero. In other words, non-gravitational energy and momentum are conserved,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{;\nu} = \nabla_\nu T^{\mu \nu}{}. \!&lt;/math&gt;
When gravity is negligible and using a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] for spacetime, this may be expressed in terms of partial derivatives as 
:&lt;math&gt;0 = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{,\nu} = \partial_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The integral form of this is
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \int_{\partial N} T^{\mu \nu} \mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu} \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is any compact four-dimensional region of spacetime; &lt;math&gt;\partial N&lt;/math&gt; is its boundary, a three-dimensional hypersurface; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the boundary regarded as the outward pointing normal.

In flat spacetime and using Cartesian coordinates, if one combines this with the symmetry of the stress–energy tensor, one can show that [[angular momentum]] is also conserved:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = (x^{\alpha} T^{\mu \nu} - x^{\mu} T^{\alpha \nu})_{,\nu} . \!&lt;/math&gt;

===In general relativity===
When gravity is non-negligible or when using arbitrary coordinate systems, the divergence of the stress–energy still vanishes. But in this case,  a [[Divergence#Generalizations|coordinate free definition of the divergence]] is used which incorporates the [[covariant derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \operatorname{div} T = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{;\nu} = \nabla_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu} = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{,\nu} +  \Gamma^{\mu}{}_{\sigma \nu}T^{\sigma \nu} + \Gamma^{\nu}{}_{\sigma \nu} T^{\mu \sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{\mu}{}_{\sigma \nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Christoffel symbol]] which is the gravitational [[force field (physics)|force field]].

Consequently, if &lt;math&gt;\xi^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is any [[Killing vector field]], then the conservation law associated with the symmetry generated by the Killing vector field may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \nabla_\nu (\xi^{\mu} T_{\mu}^{\nu}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \partial_\nu( \sqrt{-g} \ \xi^{\mu} T_{\mu}^{\nu}) &lt;/math&gt;

The integral form of this is
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \int_{\partial N} \sqrt{-g} \ \xi^{\mu} T_{\mu}^{\nu} \ \mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu} = \int_{\partial N}  \xi^{\mu} \mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu} \ \mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

==In general relativity==
In [[general relativity]], the [[symmetric]] stress–energy tensor acts as the source of spacetime [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature]], and is the current density associated with [[gauge transformation]]s of gravity which are general curvilinear [[coordinate transformation]]s. (If there is [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], then the tensor is no longer symmetric. This corresponds to the case with a nonzero [[spin tensor]] in [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan gravity theory]].)

In general relativity, the [[partial derivatives]] used in special relativity are replaced by [[covariant derivative]]s. What this means is that the continuity equation no longer implies that the non-gravitational energy and momentum expressed by the tensor are absolutely conserved, i.e. the gravitational field can do work on matter and vice versa. In the classical limit of [[Newtonian gravity]], this has a simple interpretation: energy is being exchanged with gravitational [[potential energy]], which is not included in the tensor, and momentum is being transferred through the field to other bodies. In general relativity the [[Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor#Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor|Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]] is a unique way to define the ''gravitational'' field energy and momentum densities. Any such [[Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor|stress–energy pseudotensor]] can be made to vanish locally by a coordinate transformation.

In curved spacetime, the spacelike [[integral]] now depends on the spacelike slice, in general. There is in fact no way to define a global energy–momentum vector in a general curved spacetime.

=== The Einstein field equations ===
{{Main|Einstein field equations}}

In general relativity, the stress tensor is studied in the context of the Einstein field equations which are often written as

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R\,g_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci tensor]], &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar (the [[tensor contraction]] of the Ricci tensor), &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], {{mvar|Λ}} is the [[cosmological constant]] (negligible at the scale of a galaxy or smaller), and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gravitational constant]].

==Stress–energy in special situations==

===Isolated particle===
In special relativity, the stress–energy of a non-interacting particle with mass ''m'' and trajectory &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_\text{p}(t) &lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{m \, v^{\alpha}(t) v^{\beta}(t)}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}\;\, \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_\text{p}(t)) = \frac{E}{c^2}\;
 v^{\alpha}(t) v^{\beta}(t)\;\, \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_\text{p}(t)) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(v^{\alpha})_{\alpha=0,1,2,3} \!&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector (which should not be confused with [[four-velocity]], since it is missing a &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt; (v^{\alpha})_{\alpha=0,1,2,3} = \left(1, \frac{d \mathbf{x}_\text{p}}{dt}(t) \right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
δ is the [[Dirac delta function]] and &lt;math&gt; E = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[energy]] of the particle.

===Stress–energy of a fluid in equilibrium===
For a [[perfect fluid]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the stress–energy tensor takes on a particularly simple form
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta} \, = \left(\rho + {p \over c^2}\right)u^{\alpha}u^{\beta} + p g^{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass–energy density (kilograms per cubic meter), &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the hydrostatic pressure ([[pascal (unit)|pascals]]), &lt;math&gt;u^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid's [[four velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;g^{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is the reciprocal of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. Therefore, the trace is given by
:&lt;math&gt;T  = 3p - \rho c^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The four velocity satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;u^{\alpha} u^{\beta} g_{\alpha \beta} = - c^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In an [[inertial frame of reference]] comoving with the fluid, better known as the fluid's [[proper frame]] of reference, the four velocity is 
:&lt;math&gt;(u^{\alpha})_{\alpha=0,1,2,3} = (1, 0, 0, 0) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the reciprocal of the metric tensor is simply
:&lt;math&gt;
(g^{\alpha \beta})_{\alpha,\beta=0,1,2,3} \, = \left( \begin{matrix}
                   - c^{-2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1    
      \end{matrix} \right)
\, &lt;/math&gt;

and the stress–energy tensor is a diagonal matrix
:&lt;math&gt;
(T^{\alpha \beta})_{\alpha,\beta=0,1,2,3} = \left( \begin{matrix}
                   \rho &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; p &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; p &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; p    
      \end{matrix} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor===
{{Main|Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor}}
The Hilbert stress–energy tensor of a source-free electromagnetic field is
:&lt;math&gt; T^{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left( F^{\mu \alpha} g_{\alpha \beta} F^{\nu \beta} - \frac{1}{4} g^{\mu \nu} F_{\delta \gamma} F^{\delta \gamma} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic field tensor]].

===Scalar field===
{{Main|Klein–Gordon equation}}
The stress–energy tensor for a complex scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the Klein–Gordon equation is
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} = \frac{\hbar^2}{m} (g^{\mu \alpha} g^{\nu \beta} + g^{\mu \beta} g^{\nu \alpha} - g^{\mu\nu} g^{\alpha \beta}) \partial_{\alpha}\bar\phi \partial_{\beta}\phi - g^{\mu\nu} m c^2 \bar\phi \phi ,&lt;/math&gt;
and when the metric is flat (Minkowski) its components work out to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} T^{00} &amp; =  \frac{\hbar^2}{m c^4} \left(\partial_0 \bar{\phi} \partial_0 \phi + c^2 \partial_k \bar{\phi} \partial_k \phi \right) + m \bar{\phi} \phi, \\
T^{0i} = T^{i0} &amp; = - \frac{\hbar^2}{m c^2} \left(\partial_0 \bar{\phi} \partial_i \phi + \partial_i \bar{\phi} \partial_0 \phi \right),\ \mathrm{and} \\
T^{ij} &amp; = \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \left(\partial_i \bar{\phi} \partial_j \phi + \partial_j \bar{\phi} \partial_i \phi \right) - \delta_{ij} \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{m} \eta^{\alpha\beta} \partial_\alpha \bar{\phi} \partial_\beta \phi + m c^2 \bar{\phi} \phi\right). 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Variant definitions of stress–energy==
There are a number of inequivalent definitions of non-gravitational stress–energy:

===Hilbert stress–energy tensor===
The Hilbert stress–energy tensor is defined as the [[functional derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta (\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{matter}} \sqrt{-g}) }{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = - 2 \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{matter}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} + g_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{matter} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{matter}}&lt;/math&gt; is the nongravitational part of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] density of the [[action (physics)|action]]. This is symmetric and gauge-invariant. See [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] for more information.

===Canonical stress–energy tensor===
[[Noether's theorem]] implies that there is a conserved current associated with translations through space and time. This is called the canonical stress–energy tensor. Generally, this is not symmetric and if we have some gauge theory, it may not be [[gauge invariant]] because space-dependent [[gauge transformation]]s do not commute with spatial translations.

In [[general relativity]], the translations are with respect to the coordinate system and as such, do not transform covariantly. See the section below on the gravitational stress–energy pseudo-tensor.

===Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress–energy tensor===
{{main|Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress–energy tensor}}
In the presence of spin or other intrinsic angular momentum, the canonical Noether stress energy tensor fails to be symmetric. The Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress energy tensor is constructed from the canonical stress–energy tensor and the spin current in such a way as to be symmetric and still conserved. In general relativity, this modified tensor agrees with the Hilbert stress–energy tensor.

==Gravitational stress–energy==
{{Main|Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor}}
By the [[equivalence principle]] gravitational stress–energy will always vanish locally at any chosen point in some chosen frame, therefore gravitational stress–energy cannot be expressed as a non-zero tensor; instead we have to use a [[pseudotensor]].

In general relativity, there are many possible distinct definitions of the gravitational stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor. These include the Einstein pseudotensor and the [[Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]]. The Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor can be reduced to zero at any event in spacetime by choosing an appropriate coordinate system.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2006}}

'''The Summerland''' is the name given by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]],&lt;ref name="Leadbeater" /&gt; [[Wicca]]ns and some earth-based [[Modern paganism|contemporary pagan]] religions to their conceptualization of an [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-the-summerland-2562874| title=What is the Summerland?|author=Patti Wigington|date=March 19, 2018|publisher=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesterbear.com/Wicca/FAQsummerland.html|title=FAQ:What is the Summerland? Do you think it is a real place?|author=Myth Woodling|date=March 23, 2014|work=Yet Another Wicca...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary|Summerland}}

==History of the concept==
[[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772) inspired [[Andrew Jackson Davis]] (1826–1910), in his major work ''The Great Harmonia'', to say that Summerland is the pinnacle of human spiritual achievement in the afterlife; that is, it is the highest level, or 'sphere', of the afterlife we can hope to enter.

[[C.W. Leadbeater]], a Theosophist, also taught that those who were good in their previous earthly [[incarnation]] went to a place called Summerland between incarnations.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W  ''A Textbook of Theosophy'' 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophy==
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the term "Summerland" is used without the definite article "the". Summerland, also called the [[Astral plane]] Heaven, is depicted as where [[soul]]s who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. 

Theosophists believe the Summerlands are maintained by hosts of [[Deva (New Age)|planetary angels]] serving [[Sanat Kumara]], the [[Nordic alien]] from [[Venusians|Venus]] who Theosophists believe is the governing [[deity]] of Earth and leader of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth. Sanat Kumara is believed to rule over our planet from the [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] of [[Shamballa]], believed by Theosophists to exist on the etheric plane (a plane between the [[physical plane]] and the astral plane), about five miles (8 km) above the [[Gobi Desert]].&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"/&gt;

Theosophists also believe there is another higher level of heaven called [[Devachan]], also called the [[Mental plane]] Heaven, which some but not all souls reach between incarnations — only those souls that are more highly developed [[Spirituality|spiritually]] reach this level, i.e., those souls that are at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|first, second, and third levels of initiation]].&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"/&gt;

The final permanent eternal afterlife heaven to which Theosophists believe most people will go millions or billions of years in the future, after our cycle of reincarnations in this [[Round (Theosophy)|Round]] is over, is called [[Nirvana]], and is located beyond this physical [[Cosmos]].&lt;ref name="Leadbeater"/&gt; In order to attain Nirvana, it is necessary to have attained the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fourth level of initiation]] or higher, meaning one is an ''[[arhat]]'' and thus no longer needs to reincarnate.

[[File:Swatch Irony angle below.jpg|thumb|right|A contemporary [[quartz watch]]]]
'''Time perception''' is a field of study within [[psychology]], [[cognitive linguistics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Evans | first1 = Vyvyan | name-list-format = vanc | title = Language and time: a cognitive linguistics approach | date = 2013 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 978-1-107-04380-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Language_and_Time.html?id=2deaAAAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroscience]] that refers to the subjective experience, or sense, of [[time]], which is measured by someone's own perception of the duration of the indefinite and unfolding of events. The perceived time interval between two successive events is referred to as '''perceived duration.''' Though directly experiencing or understanding another person's perception of time is not possible, such a perception can be objectively studied and inferred through a number of scientific experiments. Time perception is a construction of the sapient brain, but one that is manipulable and distortable under certain circumstances. These temporal illusions help to expose the underlying neural mechanisms of time perception.

Pioneering work, emphasizing species-specific differences, was conducted by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ernst von Baer, Welche Auffassung der lebenden Natur ist die richtige?, Berlin, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words time can be perceived or understood as Subjective Time &amp; [[mwod:objective time|Objective Time]]. 

== Theories ==

[[William J. Friedman]] (1993) also contrasted two theories for a sense of time:&lt;ref name="plato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman_1990"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Friedman W | title = About time: inventing the fourth dimension| year = 1990 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-262-06133-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Friedman_1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedman WJ | title = Memory for the time of past events | journal = Psychological Bulletin | year = 1993 | volume = 113 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–66 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.113.1.44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''The strength model'' of time memory. This posits a ''memory trace'' that persists over time, by which one might judge the age of a memory (and therefore how long ago the event remembered occurred) from the strength of the trace. This conflicts with the fact that memories of recent events may fade more quickly than more distant memories.
*''The inference model'' suggests the time of an event is inferred from information about relations between the event in question and other events whose date or time is known.

Another theory involves the brain's subconscious tallying of "pulses" during a specific interval, forming a biological stopwatch. This theory alleges that the brain can run multiple biological stopwatches at one time depending on the type of task one is involved in. The location of these pulses and what these pulses actually consist of is unclear.&lt;ref name = "Falk_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Falk | first = Dan | name-list-format = vanc | title = Do Humans Have a Biological Stopwatch? | journal = [[Smithsonian Magazine]] | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/do-humans-have-a-biological-stopwatch-164710819/?no-ist | date = Jan 2013 | accessdate = May 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model is only a metaphor and does not stand up in terms of brain physiology or anatomy.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

== Philosophical perspectives ==
{{main|Specious present}}
The ''[[wiktionary:specious|specious]] present'' is the time duration wherein a state of [[consciousness]] is experienced as being in the [[present]].&lt;ref name=james /&gt; The term was first introduced by the philosopher E. R. Clay in 1882 ([[E. Robert Kelly]]),&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;&lt;ref name=andersen /&gt; and was further developed by [[William James]].&lt;ref name=andersen /&gt; James defined the specious present to be "the prototype of all conceived times... the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly sensible". In "Scientific Thought" (1930), [[C. D.

== Neuroscientific perspectives ==

Although the perception of time is not associated with a specific sensory system, [[psychologist]]s and [[neuroscientist]]s suggest that humans do have a system, or several complementary systems, governing the [[perception]] of [[time]].&lt;ref name=unisci&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao SM, Mayer AR, Harrington DL | title = The evolution of brain activation during temporal processing | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–23 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11224550 | doi = 10.1038/85191 | laydate = 27 February 2001 | laysource = UniSci: Daily University Science News | layurl = http://www.unisci.com/stories/20011/0227013.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Time perception is handled by a highly distributed system involving the [[cerebral cortex]], [[cerebellum]] and [[basal ganglia]].&lt;ref name=natneuro /&gt; One particular component, the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]], is responsible for the [[circadian rhythm|circadian (or daily) rhythm]], while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter ([[ultradian]]) timekeeping.

[[Professor Warren Meck]] devised a physiological model for measuring the passage of time. He found the representation of time to be generated by the oscillatory activity of cells in the [[upper cortex]]. The frequency of these cells' activity is detected by cells in the [[dorsal striatum]] at the base of the [[forebrain]]. His model separated explicit timing and implicit timing. Explicit timing is used in estimating the duration of a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. Implicit timing is used to gauge the amount of time separating one from an impending event that is expected to occur in the near future. These two estimations of time do not involve the same neuroanatomical areas. For example, implicit timing often occurs to achieve a motor task, involving the [[cerebellum]], left [[parietal cortex]], and left [[premotor cortex]]. Explicit timing often involves the supplementary motor area and the right prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;

In the popular essay "Brain Time", [[David Eagleman]] explains that different types of sensory information (auditory, tactile, visual, etc.) are processed at different speeds by different neural architectures. The brain must learn how to overcome these speed disparities if it is to create a temporally unified representation of the external world: "if the visual brain wants to get events correct timewise, it may have only one choice: wait for the slowest information to arrive. To accomplish this, it must wait about a tenth of a second. In the early days of television broadcasting, engineers worried about the problem of keeping audio and video signals synchronized. Then they accidentally discovered that they had around a hundred milliseconds of slop: As long as the signals arrived within this window, viewers' brains would automatically resynchronize the signals". He goes on to say that "This brief waiting period allows the visual system to discount the various delays imposed by the early stages; however, it has the disadvantage of pushing perception into the past. There is a distinct survival advantage to operating as close to the present as possible; an animal does not want to live too far in the past. Therefore, the tenth-of- a-second window may be the smallest delay that allows higher areas of the brain to account for the delays created in the first stages of the system while still operating near the border of the present. This window of delay means that awareness is postdictive, incorporating data from a window of time after an event and delivering a retrospective interpretation of what happened."&lt;ref name="urlBRAIN TIME | Edge.org"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://edge.org/conversation/brain-time | title = Brain Time | author = Eagleman DM | authorlink = David Eagleman | date = 2009-06-23 | work =  | publisher = Edge Foundation | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130805000331/http://www.edge.org/conversation/brain-time | archivedate = 2013-08-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments have shown that rats can successfully estimate a time interval of approximately 40 seconds, despite having their [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] entirely removed.&lt;ref name="jaldow"/&gt; This suggests that time estimation may be a low level process.&lt;ref name="mackintosh"/&gt;

== Types of temporal illusions ==
{{see also|Tachypsychia}}
A ''temporal illusion'' is a distortion in the perception of time. ''Time perception'' refers to a variety of time-related tasks. For example:
* estimating ''time intervals'', e.g., "When did you last see your primary care physician?";
* estimating ''time duration'', e.g., "How long were you waiting at the doctor's office?"; and
* judging the ''simultaneity of events ''(see below for examples).

'''Short list of types of temporal illusions''':
*[[Telescoping effect]]: People tend to recall recent events as occurring further back in time than they actually did (backward telescoping) and distant events as occurring more recently than they actually did (forward telescoping).&lt;ref name=jcp /&gt;
*[[Vierordt's law]]: Shorter intervals tend to be overestimated while longer intervals tend to be underestimated
*Time intervals associated with more changes may be perceived as longer than intervals with fewer changes
*Perceived temporal length of a given task may shorten with greater motivation
*Perceived temporal length of a given task may stretch when broken up or interrupted
*Auditory stimuli may appear to last longer than visual stimuli&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wearden JH, Todd NP, Jones LA | title = When do auditory/visual differences in duration judgements occur? | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 10 | pages = 1709–24 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16945856 | doi = 10.1080/17470210500314729 | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470210500314729#.U0XwvOZdUww }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldstone S, Lhamon WT | title = Studies of auditory-visual differences in human time judgment. 1.

=== Kappa effect ===

The [[Kappa effect]] or perceptual time dilation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldreich|first1=Daniel|title=A Bayesian Perceptual Model Replicates the Cutaneous Rabbit and Other Tactile Spatiotemporal Illusions|journal=PLoS ONE|date=28 March 2007|volume=2|issue=3|pages=e333|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000333}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of temporal illusion verifiable by experiment,&lt;ref name=wada /&gt; wherein the temporal duration between a sequence of consecutive stimuli is thought to be relatively longer or shorter than its actual elapsed time, due to the spatial/auditory/tactile separation between each consecutive stimuli. The kappa effect can be displayed when considering a journey made in two parts that take an equal amount of time. Between these two parts, the journey that covers more distance may appear to take longer than the journey covering less distance, even though they take an equal amount of time.

=== Eye movements and "Chronostasis" ===

The perception of space and time undergoes distortions during rapid saccadic eye movements&lt;ref&gt;Cicchini G, Binda P and Morrone M (2009). A model for the distortions of space and time perception during saccadic movement. Front. Syst. Neurosci. Conference Abstract: Computational and systems neuroscience 2009. {{doi|10.3389/conf.neuro.06.2009.03.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chronostasis]] is a type of temporal illusion in which the first impression following the introduction of a new event or task demand to the brain appears to be extended in time.&lt;ref name=yarrow /&gt; For example, chronostasis temporarily occurs when fixating on a target stimulus, immediately following a [[saccade]] (e.g., quick [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]). This elicits an overestimation in the temporal duration for which that target stimulus (i.e., postsaccadic stimulus) was perceived. This effect can extend apparent durations by up to 500 ms and is consistent with the idea that the visual system models events prior to perception.&lt;ref name="Yarrow, Whiteley"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yarrow K, Whiteley L, Rothwell JC, Haggard P | title = Spatial consequences of bridging the saccadic gap | journal = Vision Research | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 545–55 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16005489 | doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2005.04.019 | pmc=1343538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known version of this illusion is known as the '''stopped-clock illusion''', wherein a subject's first impression of the second-hand movement of an analog clock, subsequent to one's directed attention (i.e., saccade) to the clock, is the perception of a slower-than-normal second-hand movement rate (the seconds hand of the clock may seemingly temporarily freeze in place after initially looking at it).&lt;ref name=Knoll2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knöll J, Morrone MC, Bremmer F | title = Spatio-temporal topography of saccadic overestimation of time | journal = Vision Research | volume = 83 | pages = 56–65 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23458677 | doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2013.02.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yarrow, Rothwell"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yarrow K, Rothwell JC | title = Manual chronostasis: tactile perception precedes physical contact | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 13 | pages = 1134–9 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12842013 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00413-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yarrow&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yarrow K, Johnson H, Haggard P, Rothwell JC | title = Consistent chronostasis effects across saccade categories imply a subcortical efferent trigger | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 839–47 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15200711 | doi = 10.1162/089892904970780 | pmc=1266050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120827-how-to-make-time-stand-still | title=The mystery of the stopped clock illusion | work=[[BBC]] - Future - Health - | date=2012-08-27 | accessdate=2012-12-09 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120100128/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120827-how-to-make-time-stand-still | archivedate=2013-01-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of chronostasis extends beyond the visual domain into the [[Auditory system|auditory]] and [[Touch|tactile]] domains.&lt;ref name=Nijhawan&gt;{{cite book | last = Nijhawan | first = Romi | name-list-format = vanc | title=Space and Time in Perception and Action|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-86318-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the auditory domain, chronostasis and duration overestimation occur when observing auditory stimuli. One common example is a frequent occurrence when making telephone calls. If, while listening to the phone's dial tone, research subjects move the phone from one ear to the other, the length of time between rings appears longer.&lt;ref name="Hodinott"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hodinott-Hill I, Thilo KV, Cowey A, Walsh V | title = Auditory chronostasis: hanging on the telephone | journal = Current Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 20 | pages = 1779–81 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12401174 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(02)01219-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tactile domain, chronostasis has persisted in research subjects as they reach for and grasp objects. After grasping a new object, subjects overestimate the time in which their hand has been in contact with this object.&lt;ref name="Yarrow, Rothwell" /&gt; In other experiments, subjects turning a light on with a button were conditioned to experience the light before the button press.

===Oddball effect===
The perception of the duration of an event seems to be modulated by our recent experiences. Humans typically overestimate the perceived duration of the initial event in a stream of identical events&lt;ref name=Rose1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose D, Summers J | title = Duration illusions in a train of visual stimuli | journal = Perception | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177–87 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8577576 | doi = 10.1068/p241177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and unexpected “oddball” stimuli seem to be perceived as longer in duration, relative to expected or frequently presented “standard” stimuli.&lt;ref name=Tse2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tse PU, Intriligator J, Rivest J, Cavanagh P | title = Attention and the subjective expansion of time | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 66 | issue = 7 | pages = 1171–89 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15751474 | doi = 10.3758/BF03196844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oddball effect may serve an evolutionarily adapted “alerting” function and is consistent with reports of time slowing down in threatening situations.

=== Effects of emotional states ===
====Awe====
Research has suggested the feeling of [[awe]] has the ability to expand one's perceptions of time availability. Awe can be characterized as an experience of immense perceptual vastness that coincides with an increase in focus. Consequently, it is conceivable that one's temporal perception would slow down when experiencing awe.&lt;ref name="pmid22886132"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rudd M, Vohs KD, Aaker J | title = Awe expands people's perception of time, alters decision making, and enhances well-being | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1130–6 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22886132 | doi = 10.1177/0956797612438731 | url = http://www.carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/lib/assets/AssetLibrary/2012/Rudd_Vohs_Aaker_2012_psych%20science.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fear====
Possibly related to the [[Time perception#Oddball effect|oddball effect]], research suggests that [[time dilation|time seems to slow down]] for a person during dangerous events (such as a car accident, a robbery, or when a person perceives a potential predator or [[sexual partner|mate]]), or when a person [[skydive]]s or bungee jumps, where they're capable of complex thoughts in what would normally be the blink of an eye (See [[Fight-or-flight response]]).&lt;ref name="just" /&gt; This reported slowing in temporal perception may have been evolutionarily advantageous because it may have enhanced one's ability to intelligibly make quick [[Decision-making|decisions]] in moments that were of critical importance to our survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geoghagen|first1=Tom|title=Turn back the clock|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6926500.stm|publisher=BBC News Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though observers commonly report that time seems to have moved in slow motion during these events, it is unclear whether this is a function of increased time resolution during the event, or instead an illusion created by the remembering of an emotionally salient event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-19477623 Why top sport stars might have 'more time' on the ball] by Jonathan Amos Science correspondent, [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong time dilation effect has been reported for perception of objects that were looming, but not of those retreating, from the viewer, suggesting that the expanding discs — which mimic an approaching object — elicit [[self-referential]] processes which act to signal the presence of a possible danger.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleman, D. &amp; Pariyadath, V.

Research suggests that the effect appears only at the point of retrospective assessment, rather than occurring simultaneously with events as they happened.&lt;ref name="pmid18074019"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stetson C, Fiesta MP, Eagleman DM | title = Does time really slow down during a frightening event? | journal = PLoS One | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = e1295 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18074019 | pmc = 2110887 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0001295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual abilities were tested during a frightening experience — a [[free fall]] — by measuring people's sensitivity to flickering stimuli. The results showed that the subjects' temporal resolution was not improved as the frightening event was occurring. Events appear to have taken longer only in retrospect, possibly because memories were being more densely packed during the frightening situation.&lt;ref name="pmid18074019"/&gt;

People shown extracts from films known to induce [[fear]] often overestimated the elapsed time of a subsequently presented visual stimulus, whereas people shown emotionally neutral clips (weather forecasts and stock market updates) or those known to evoke feelings of sadness showed no difference. It is argued that fear prompts a state of arousal in the [[amygdala]], which increases the rate of a hypothesized "internal clock". This could be the result of an evolved defensive mechanism triggered by a threatening situation.&lt;ref name="pmid21886610"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Droit-Volet S, Fayolle SL, Gil S | title = Emotion and time perception: effects of film-induced mood | journal = Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 33 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21886610 | pmc = 3152725 | doi = 10.3389/fnint.2011.00033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Empathy====
The perception of another persons' emotions can also change our sense of time. The theory of embodied mind (or cognition), caused by [[mirror neuron]]s, helps explain how the perception of other people's emotions has the ability to change one's own sense of time. Embodied cognition hinges on an internal process that mimics or simulates another's emotional state. For example, if person #1 spends time with person #2 who speaks and walks incredibly slowly, person #1's internal clock may slow down.

====Depression====
Depression may increase one's ability to perceive time accurately. One study assessed this concept by asking subjects to estimate the amount of time that passed during intervals ranging from 3 seconds to 65 seconds.&lt;ref name=DepressiveRealism&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kornbrot DE, Msetfi RM, Grimwood MJ | title = Time perception and depressive realism: judgment type, psychophysical functions and bias | journal = PLoS One | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = e71585 | date = 21 August 2013 | pmid = 23990960 | pmc = 3749223 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0071585 | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0071585 | lay-url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130822090326.htm | lay-date = 22 August 2013 | lay-source = Science Daily | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214092825/http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071585 | archivedate = 14 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results indicated that depressed subjects more accurately estimated the amount of time that had passed than non-depressed patients; non-depressed subjects overestimated the passing of time. This difference was hypothesized to be because depressed subjects focused less on external factors that may skew their judgment of time. The authors termed this hypothesized phenomenon "depressive realism."&lt;ref name=DepressiveRealism/&gt;

=== Changes with age ===

Psychologists have found that the subjective perception of the passing of time tends to speed up with increasing age in humans. This often causes people to increasingly underestimate a given interval of time as they age. This fact can likely be attributed to a variety of age-related changes in the [[aging brain]], such as the lowering in dopaminergic levels with older age; however, the details are still being debated.&lt;ref name="pmid18794529"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreher JC, Meyer-Lindenberg A, Kohn P, Berman KF | title = Age-related changes in midbrain dopaminergic regulation of the human reward system | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 39 | pages = 15106–11 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18794529 | pmc = 2567500 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0802127105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16901542"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bäckman L, Nyberg L, Lindenberger U, Li SC, Farde L | title = The correlative triad among aging, dopamine, and cognition: current status and future prospects | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 791–807 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16901542 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8806025"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meck WH | title = Neuropharmacology of timing and time perception | journal = Brain Research.

Very young children literally "live in time" before gaining an awareness of its passing. A child will first experience the passing of time when he or she can subjectively perceive and reflect on the unfolding of a collection of events. A child's awareness of time develops during childhood when the child's attention and short-term memory capacities form — this developmental process is thought to be dependent on the slow maturation of the [[prefrontal cortex]] and [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23045653"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolb B, Mychasiuk R, Muhammad A, Li Y, Frost DO, Gibb R | title = Experience and the developing prefrontal cortex | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 Suppl 2 | issue =  | pages = 17186–93 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23045653 | pmc = 3477383 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1121251109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day to an 11-year-old would be approximately 1/4,000 of their life, while one day to a 55-year-old would be approximately 1/20,000 of their life. This helps to explain why a random, ordinary day may therefore appear longer for a young child than an adult.&lt;ref name=alder&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16422180.900-look-how-time-flies | title = Look how time flies . . . | author = Adler R | date = 1999-12-25 | publisher = New Scientist | accessdate = 2009-10-22 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110614233936/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16422180.900-look-how-time-flies | archivedate = 2011-06-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The short term appears to go faster in proportion to the square root of the perceiver's age.&lt;ref name="Jo_DiLonardo_1994"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Jo DiLonardo | first1 = Mary | name-list-format = vanc | title = Time Does Fly As We Grow Older | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-02-06/features/9402060210_1_psychology-professor-adult-school-year | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = 1994-02-06 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160425120403/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-02-06/features/9402060210_1_psychology-professor-adult-school-year | archivedate = 2016-04-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; So a year would be experienced by a 55-year-old as passing approximately 2¼ times more quickly than a year experienced by an 11-year-old. If long-term time perception is based solely on the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] of a person's age, then the following four periods in life would appear to be quantitatively equal: ages 5–10 (1x), ages 10–20 (2x), ages 20–40 (4x), age 40–80 (8x).&lt;ref name="alder" /&gt;

The common explanation is that most external and internal experiences are new for young children but repetitive for adults. Children have to be extremely engaged (i.e. dedicate many neural resources or significant brain power) in the present moment because they must constantly reconfigure their mental models of the world to assimilate it and manage behaviour properly. Adults however may rarely need to step outside mental habits and external routines. When an adult frequently experiences the same stimuli, they seem "invisible" because already sufficiently and effectively mapped by the brain. This phenomenon is known as [[neural adaptation]]. Thus, the brain will record fewer densely rich memories during these frequent periods of disengagement from the present moment.&lt;ref name="url_The_Buffer_Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-science-of-time-perception-how-to-make-your-days-longer | title = The science of time perception: stop it slipping away by doing new things | author = Cooper BB | date = 2013-07-02 | work =  | publisher = The Buffer Blog | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130816194820/http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-science-of-time-perception-how-to-make-your-days-longer | archivedate = 2013-08-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the subjective perception is often that time passes by at a faster rate with age.

=== Effects of drugs ===
[[Stimulants]] produce overestimates of time duration, whereas [[depressants]] and anaesthetics produce underestimates of time duration.

Psychoactive drugs can alter the judgment of time. These include traditional psychedelics such as [[LSD]], [[psilocybin]], and [[mescaline]] as well as the dissociative class of psychedelics such as [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[ketamine]] and [[dextromethorphan]]. At higher doses time may appear to slow down, speed up or seem out of sequence. In a 2007 study, psilocybin was found to significantly impair the ability to reproduce interval durations longer than 2.5 seconds, significantly impair synchronizing motor actions (taps on a computer keyboard) with regularly occurring tones, and impair the ability to keep tempo when asked to tap on a key at a self-paced but consistent interval.&lt;ref name=wittmann1 /&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|sure=y|date=January 2014}} In 1955, British MP [[Christopher Mayhew]] took [[Mescaline|mescaline hydrochloride]] in an experiment under the guidance of his friend, Dr [[Humphry Osmond]]. On the BBC documentary ''The Beyond Within'', he described that half a dozen times during the experiment, he had "a period of time that didn't end for [him]".

[[Stimulants]] can lead both humans and rats to overestimate time intervals,&lt;ref name=wittmann2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cheng /&gt; while [[depressants]] can have the opposite effect.&lt;ref name=tinklenberg /&gt; The level of activity in the brain of [[neurotransmitters]] such as [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] may be the reason for this.&lt;ref name=arzy /&gt; Dopamine has a particularly strong connection with one's perception of time. Drugs that activate dopamine receptors speed up one's perception of time, while dopamine antagonists cause one to feel that time is passing slowly.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rammsayer_1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rammsayer T | title = Is there a common dopaminergic basis of time perception and reaction time? | journal = Neuropsychobiology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–42 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2573003 | doi = 10.1159/000118549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cannabis and time perception|effect of cannabis on time perception]] has been studied with inconclusive results.

=== Effects of body temperature ===

Time perception may speed up as body temperature rises, and slow down as body temperature lowers. This is especially true during stressful events.&lt;ref name=ncbi2 /&gt;

=== Reversal of temporal order judgment ===

Numerous experimental findings suggest that temporal order judgments of actions preceding effects can be reversed under special circumstances. Experiments have shown that sensory simultaneity judgments can be manipulated by repeated exposure to non-simultaneous stimuli. In an experiment conducted by [[David Eagleman]], a temporal order judgment reversal was induced in subjects by exposing them to delayed motor consequences. In the experiment, subjects played various forms of video games. Unknown to the subjects, the experimenters introduced a fixed delay between the mouse movements and the subsequent sensory feedback. For example, a subject may not see a movement register on the screen until 150 milliseconds after the mouse had moved. Participants playing the game quickly adapted to the delay and felt as though there was less delay between their mouse movement and the sensory feedback. Shortly after the experimenters removed the delay, the subjects commonly felt as though the effect on the screen happened just before they commanded it. This work addresses how the perceived timing of effects is modulated by expectations, and the extent to which such predictions are quickly modifiable.&lt;ref name="pmid16950162"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stetson C, Cui X, Montague PR, Eagleman DM | title = Motor-sensory recalibration leads to an illusory reversal of action and sensation | journal = Neuron | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 651–9 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16950162 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2006.08.006 | url = http://www.eaglemanlab.net/papers/StetsonetalNeuron2006.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928021519/http://www.eaglemanlab.net/papers/StetsonetalNeuron2006.pdf | archivedate = 2013-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment conducted by Haggard and colleagues in 2002, participants pressed a button that triggered a flash of light at a distance after a slight delay of 100 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eagleman DM | title = Human time perception and its illusions | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–6 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18639634 | pmc = 2866156 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2008.06.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By repeatedly engaging in this act, participants had adapted to the delay (i.e., they experienced a gradual shortening in the perceived time interval between pressing the button and seeing the flash of light). The experimenters then showed the flash of light instantly after the button was pressed. In response, subjects often thought that the flash (the effect) had occurred before the button was pressed (the cause). Additionally, when the experimenters slightly reduced the delay, and shortened the spatial distance between the button and the flash of light, participants had often claimed again to have experienced the effect before the cause.

Several experiments also suggest that temporal order judgment of a pair of [[Touch|tactile]] stimuli delivered in rapid succession, one to each hand, is noticeably impaired (i.e., misreported) by crossing the hands over the midline. However, congenitally blind subjects showed no trace of temporal order judgment reversal after crossing the arms. These results suggest that tactile signals taken in by the congenitally blind are ordered in time without being referred to a visuospatial representation. Unlike the congenitally blind subjects, the temporal order judgments of the late-onset blind subjects were impaired when crossing the arms to a similar extent as non-blind subjects. These results suggest that the associations between tactile signals and visuospatial representation is maintained once it is accomplished during infancy. Some research studies have also found that the subjects showed reduced deficit in tactile temporal order judgments when the arms were crossed behind their back than when they were crossed in front.&lt;ref name="pmid11426234"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto S, Kitazawa S | title = Reversal of subjective temporal order due to arm crossing | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 759–65 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11426234 | doi = 10.1038/89559 | url = http://wexler.free.fr/library/files/yamamoto%20(2001)%20reversal%20of%20subjective%20temporal%20order%20due%20to%20arm%20crossing.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142713/http://wexler.free.fr/library/files/yamamoto%20(2001)%20reversal%20of%20subjective%20temporal%20order%20due%20to%20arm%20crossing.pdf | archivedate = 2015-04-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23200703"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sambo CF, Torta DM, Gallace A, Liang M, Moseley GL, Iannetti GD | title = The temporal order judgement of tactile and nociceptive stimuli is impaired by crossing the hands over the body midline | journal = Pain | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–7 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23200703 | doi = 10.1016/j.pain.2012.10.010 | url = http://www.bodyinmind.org/wp-content/uploads/1-s2.0-S0304395912005611-main.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928081457/http://www.bodyinmind.org/wp-content/uploads/1-s2.0-S0304395912005611-main.pdf | archivedate = 2013-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22761307"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi T, Kansaku K, Wada M, Shibuya S, Kitazawa S | title = Neural correlates of tactile temporal-order judgment in humans: an fMRI study | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 1952–64 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 22761307 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhs179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flash-lag effect===

In an experiment, participants were told to stare at an "x" symbol on a computer screen whereby a moving blue doughnut-like ring repeatedly circled the fixed "x" point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Kotler | first1 = Steven | name-list-format = vanc | title = When Life Flashes Before Your Eyes: A 15-Story Drop to Study the Brain's Internal Timewarp | url = http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-03/how-time-flies | website = Popular Science | publisher = Bonnier Corporation | date = 12 April 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141011234410/http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-03/how-time-flies | archivedate = 11 October 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Eagleman | first1 = DM | last2 = Sejnowski | first2 = TJ | name-list-format = vanc | title = Flash-Lag Effect | url = http://www.eaglemanlab.net/flashlag | website = Eagleman Laboratory for Perception and Action | date = 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140801091656/http://eaglemanlab.net/flashlag/ | archivedate = 2014-08-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11184992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel SS, Ogmen H, Bedell HE, Sampath V | title = Flash-lag effect: differential latency, not postdiction | journal = Science | volume = 290 | issue = 5494 | pages = 1051 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11184992 | doi = | url = http://eaglemanlab.net/papers/EagleSejScience3.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055953/http://eaglemanlab.net/papers/EagleSejScience3.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, the ring would display a white flash for a split second that physically overlapped the ring's interior. However, when asked what was perceived, participants responded that they saw the white flash lagging behind the center of the moving ring. In other words, despite the reality that the two retinal images were actually spatially aligned, the flashed object was usually observed to trail a continuously moving object in space — a phenomenon referred to as the flash-lag effect.

The first proposed explanation, called the 'motion extrapolation' hypothesis, is that the visual system extrapolates the position of moving objects but not flashing objects when accounting for neural delays (i.e., the lag time between the retinal image and the observer's perception of the flashing object). The second proposed explanation by David Eagleman and Sejnowski, called the 'latency difference' hypothesis, is that the visual system processes moving objects at a faster rate than flashed objects. In the attempt to disprove the first hypothesis, David Eagleman conducted an experiment in which the moving ring suddenly reverses direction to spin in the other way as the flashed object briefly appears. If the first hypothesis were correct, we would expect that, immediately following reversal, the moving object would be observed as lagging behind the flashed object. However, the experiment revealed the opposite — immediately following reversal, the flashed object was observed as lagging behind the moving object. This experimental result supports of the 'latency difference' hypothesis. A recent study tries to reconcile these different approaches by approaching perception as an inference mechanism aiming at describing what is happening at the present time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khoei MA, Masson GS, Perrinet LU | title = The flash-lag effect as a motion-based predictive shift | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = e1005068 | date = January 2017 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005068 | url = http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005068 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170917104630/http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1005068 | archivedate = 2017-09-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of clinical disorders ===

[[Parkinson's disease]],&lt;ref name=pastor /&gt; [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref name=davalos /&gt; and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD)&lt;ref name=levy /&gt; have been linked to abnormalities in [[dopamine]] levels in the brain as well as to noticeable impairments in time perception. Neuropharmacological research indicates that the internal clock, used to time durations in the seconds-to-minutes range, is linked to dopamine function in the basal ganglia.&lt;ref name="davalos" /&gt; Studies in which children with ADHD are given time estimation tasks shows that time passes very slowly for them. Children with Tourette’s Syndrome, in contrast, who need to use the pre-frontal cortex to help them control their tics, are better at estimating intervals of time just over a second than other children.

In his book ''Awakenings,'' the neurologist Dr. [[Oliver Sacks]] discussed how patients with [[Parkinson's disease]] experience deficits in their awareness of time and tempo. For example, Mr E, when asked to clap his hands steadily and regularly, did so for the first few claps before clapping faster and irregularly, culminating in an apparent freezing of motion. When he finished, Mr E asked if his observers were glad he did it correctly, to which they replied "no". Mr E was offended by this because to him, his claps were regular and steady.&lt;ref name=sacks /&gt;

Dopamine is also theorized to play a role in the attention deficits present with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]. Specifically, dopaminergic systems are involved in [[working memory]] and inhibitory processes, both of which are believed central to ADHD pathology.&lt;ref name=levy /&gt; Children with ADHD have also been found to be significantly impaired on time discrimination tasks (telling the difference between two stimuli of different temporal lengths) and respond earlier on time reproduction tasks (duplicating the duration of a presented stimulus) than controls.&lt;ref name=smith /&gt;

Along with other perceptual abnormalities, it has been noted by psychologists that [[schizophrenia]] patients have an altered sense of time. This was first described in psychology by Minkowski in 1927.&lt;ref name=franck /&gt; Many schizophrenic patients stop perceiving time as a flow of causally linked events. It has been suggested that there is usually a delay in time perception in schizophrenic patients compared to normal subjects.

These defects in time perception may play a part in the hallucinations and delusions experienced by schizophrenic patients according to some studies. Some researchers suggest that "abnormal timing judgment leads to a deficit in action attribution and action perception."&lt;ref name=franck/&gt;

===Sleep===
The perception of time is temporarily suspended during [[sleep]], or more often during [[REM sleep]]. This can be attributed to the [[altered state of consciousness]] associated with sleep that prevents [[Spatial disorientation|awareness of the surroundings]], which would make it difficult to remain informed of the passing of time — new memories are rarely made during sleep. Therefore, upon waking up in the morning a person subjectively feels no time has passed but reasons that many hours have elapsed simply because it is now light outside. The passing of time must be inferred by observations of objects (e.g., the sun’s location, the moon, a clock's time) [[theory of relativity|relative]] to the previous evening. So, time may feel as passing "faster" during sleep due to the lack of reference points. Another experience sometimes reported is a long [[dream]] seeming to go on for hours when it actually lasted only a few seconds or minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/human-body-mind/why-does-time-go-so-fast-when-you%E2%80%99re-asleep|title=Why does time go so fast when you’re asleep?|date=7 February 2016|work=BBC Science Focus|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6894">'''Transnational Barrios''' as a concept within [[Latin America]]n and [[Latino]] studies explains the social construction of space, place, culture, traditions, and artistic symbolic meanings that are established beyond national boundaries by diverse Latina/o populations in communities of a hosting country. Therefore '''Transnational Barrios''' are seen by scholars as critical spaces to celebrate and embrace cultural production, political mobilizations, [[ethnic identity]] and [[solidarity]], and develop a sense of belonging within communities. 

''Transnational'' as defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, is extending or going beyond national boundaries or consisting of persons from different nationalities.

According to Anthropologist ''Michael Kearney'', ''Transnational'' deals with forms of organization and identity of Latinas/os that are not restricted by national boundaries, meaning not being constraint by nation-state of origin in order to form a collective identity in a hosting country.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Michael. “Transnationalism in California and Mexico at the End of Empire,” In Border Identities: Nation and State at International Frontiers. Ed. Thomas W. Wilson and Hastings Connan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 117-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Barrio|''Barrios'']] refer to a part of an inner city area mostly composed of a Spanish-speaking population. “Both historically and today, barrio formations are the result of specific plans and policies on the local, state, and federal levels that have resulted in high levels of racial segregation, substandard and limited housing stock, poor schooling, and severely circumscribed mobility.”&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Gina M., Frank A Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. “Introduction,” Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as ''Gina M. Perez'', ''Frank A. Guridy'', and ''Adrian Burgos Jr.'' believe that one must use the ''transnational'' approach in Latin American and Latino Studies to create a framework that will better apprehend the diverse experiences of Latinas/os in multiple contexts. As well as confronting the negative notions of ''Barrios'' as being places of social dislocation, and marginalized and criminalized locations. '''Transnational Barrios''' therefore strive to create and progress through new meanings, experiences, and identities of diverse and compelling Latina/o populations of various communities throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Gina M., Frank A Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. “Introduction,” Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Transnational Barrios==
An example of a '''Transnational Barrio''' is explained in ''Cary Cordova’s'' article “''The Mission in Nicaragua''”&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, Cary. “The Mission in Nicaragua,” In Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. Ed. Gina M. Perez, Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; in regards to the Nicaraguan community in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]] of San Francisco. Nicaraguans in the U.S. mobilized in the 1970s during the ''[[Sandinista]] revolution'' to rally support for the overthrow of the current oppressive regime of ''[[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio Somoza]]''. They believed that if the Sandinistas succeeded then Nicaragua would become a model for freedom and equality around the world, including the U.S. As citizens in Nicaragua were struggling with control over their own lives, so too were Nicaraguans in the U.S. due to the lack of social reforms needed by the community, mainly because of U.S. capitalism. Artists and activists used the ideas of the Nicaraguan revolution to express the political needs of Latinos in ''San Francisco'' and the Americas. Poets such as ''Alejandro Murguia, Roberto Vargas and Nina Serrano'' accomplished this by creating events such as poetry readings, rallies, demonstrations, and the creation of murals to illustrate the struggles of people in Nicaragua and in the U.S. Cordova demonstrates that the barrio served as a ''transnational space'' where ideas such as revolution, liberation and equality and political mobilization and solidarity could be transformed and used together to fight the revolution abroad and fight the war on the home front.  

[[Lourdes Gutierrez Najera]] describes another example of using barrios as a ''transnational space'' with her study of Oaxacans in the city of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez Najera, Lourdes. “Hayandose,” In Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. Ed. Gina M. Perez, Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211-232.&lt;/ref&gt; In her article "Hayandose", to maintain their Zapotec and Yalalteco indigenous identity, Oaxacans organize to aid one another in times of crisis such as in the viewing of a young Oaxacan individual where a traditional Oaxacan funeral ceremony was conducted in the Koreatown district of Los Angeles. Such practices demonstrate that their strong ties are established and maintained with their hometowns. Given the marginality of indigenous people both in Mexico and the U.S. they create a space of inclusion and belonging by practicing the same customs that they perform in Oaxaca. Traditional Oaxacan dances and festivals known as ''[[Guelaguetza|Guelaguetza's]]'' are as well an important means to celebrate their indigenous roots and reaffirm their ethnic membership within transnational borders. This folkloric dance along with the other customs Zapotecs and Yalaltecos bring with them, situate their barrio as a transnational space.

[[Nuyorican Movement|''The Nuyorican poetry movement'']] of the 1970s in Manhattan’s Lower Eastside is one more example of a '''Transnational Barrio'''.  The Nuyorican movement was seen as a venue for spoken word performances, stand-up comedy, poetry slams, musical performances and theater productions. The use of code switching between Spanish and English demonstrated the concern for the low income, poor experience of life in New York for Puerto Ricans, which strongly made visible the political motivation behind the poetry movement. ''Miguel Algarin, Miguel Pinero, Bittman “Bimbo” Rivas and Lucky Cienfuegos'' were among the creators and poets of the movement in the 1970s along with other poets such as ''Bob Holman, Saul Williams, Sarah Jones, and Beau Sia''. The transnational space created in the barrios of Manhattan’s Lower Eastside provide New York Puerto Ricans, or as they called themselves Nuyoricans, a chance to mobilize leftist ideals in their poetry, art performances and literature.

The '''use of force''', in the context of [[law enforcement]], may be defined as the "amount of effort required by police to compel compliance by an unwilling subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Police Use of Force |url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/pages/welcome.aspx |website=National Institute of Justice |publisher=Office of Justice Programs |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Use of force doctrines''' can be employed by [[law enforcement officers]] and [[military personnel]] on guard duty. The aim of such doctrines is to balance the needs of security with [[Ethics|ethical]] concerns for the [[rights]] and well-being of intruders or suspects. Injuries to [[civilians]] tend to focus attention on [[Self-defense (theory)|self-defense]] as a [[Excuse (legal)|justification]] and, in the event of death, the notion of [[justifiable homicide]].

[[U.S. military|U.S. military personnel]] on guard duty are given a "use of force briefing" by the sergeant of the guard before being assigned to their post.

For the [[English law]] on the use of force in crime prevention, see [[Self-defence in English law]]. The [[Australia]]n position on the use of troops for civil policing is set out by [[Michael Hood]] in ''Calling Out the Troops: Disturbing Trends and Unanswered Questions'';&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/2005/33.html&lt;/ref&gt; compare "Use of Deadly Force by the South African Police Services Re-visited"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisa.org.za/section_49.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218065028/http://www.crisa.org.za/section_49.pdf |archivedate=February 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Malebo Keebine-Sibanda]] and [[Omphemetse Sibanda]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==History==
Use of force dates back to the beginning of established [[law enforcement]], with a fear that officers would abuse their power.  In today's society this fear still exists and one of the ways to fix this problem is to require police to wear body cameras and to have them turned on during all interactions with civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alpert|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Dunham|first2=Roger G.|title=Understanding Police Use of Force: Officers, Suspects, and Reciprocity|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=17|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of force continuum==
{{main|Use of force continuum}}

The use of force may be standardized by a [[use of force continuum]], which presents guidelines as to the degree of force appropriate in a given situation. One source identifies five very generalized steps, increasing from least use of force to greatest. It is only one side of the model, as it does not give the levels of subject resistance that merit the corresponding increases in force.[http://www.policeone.com/writers/columnists/marksman/articles/123080/] Each successive level of force is meant to describe an escalating series of actions an officer may take to resolve a situation, and the level of force used rises only when a lower level of force would be ineffective in dealing with the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Use-of-Force Continuum | url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/continuum.htm | date=August 4, 2009 |publisher=National Institute of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically any style of a use of force continuum will start with officer presence, and end with the use of deadly force.

#Presence (using the effect of the presence of an authority figure on a subject)
#Verbalization (commanding a subject)
#Empty hand control (using empty hands to search, relieve weapons, immobilize, or otherwise control a subject)
#Intermediate weapons (using non-lethal chemical, electronic or impact weapons on a subject)
#Deadly Force (using any force likely to cause permanent injury or death to a subject)

Use of force continuums can be further broken down.

===''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989)===
On November 12, 1984 Graham, who was a diabetic, felt an insulin reaction coming on and rushed to the store with a friend to get some orange juice. When the store was too crowded, he and his friend proceeded to go to another friend's house. In the midst of all this, he was being watched by Officer Connor, of the [[Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department|Charlotte City Police Department]] police department. While on their way to the friend's house, the officer stopped the two of them and called for backup. After several other officers arrived, one of them [[handcuffs|handcuffed]] Graham. Eventually, when Connor learned that nothing had happened in the convenience store, the officers drove Graham home and released him. Over the course of the encounter, Graham sustained a broken foot, cuts on his wrists, a bruised forehead and an injured shoulder. The Supreme Court held that it was irrelevant whether Connor acted in good faith, because the use of force must be judged based on its objective reasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham vs. Connor |url=http://law.uark.edu/documents/Bailey-CrimPro-Graham-v.-Connor.pdf |accessdate=August 4, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021064117/http://law.uark.edu/documents/Bailey-CrimPro-Graham-v.-Connor.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985)===
On October 3, 1974, Officers Elton Hymon and Leslie Wright of the [[Memphis Police Department]] were called to respond to a possible burglary. When they arrived to the scene, a woman standing on the porch began to tell them that she heard glass breaking and that she believed the house next door was being broken into. Officer Hymon went to check, where he saw Edward Garner, who was fleeing the scene. As Garner was climbing over the gate, Hymon called out "police, halt", and when Garner failed to do so, Hymon fatally shot Garner in the back of the head, despite being "reasonably sure" that Garner was unarmed. The Supreme Court held deadly force may be used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon only if the officer has [[probable cause]] to believe that the suspect poses a serious risk to the officer or to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tennessee v. Garner|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/471/1.html|accessdate=August 12, 2015|quote="[Deadly] force may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape [of a fleeing suspect] and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nelson v. City of Davis'' (2004)===
On April 16, 2004, what was supposed to be known as the "biggest party in history" took place at the annual [[UC Davis]] picnic. Due to the large number of participants at this party, people began to illegally park their cars. Sgt. John Wilson demanded that officers start to issue parking tickets to the illegally parked cars. Tickets were also issued to the underage drinkers. Wilson called the owner of the apartment complex because of the disturbances that were being caused; loud music and the sounds of bottles breaking. Wilson was consented by the complex apartment owner to have non-residents to leave the complex. 30 to 40 officers were rounded up with riot gear - including pepper ball guns - to try to disperse the crowd of 1,000 attendees. The officers gathered in front of the complex where 15 to 20 students, including Timothy C. Nelson, were attempting to leave, but no instructions police were given by the police. Officers began to fire [[Pepper-spray projectile|pepper-balls]], one of which struck Nelson in the eye. He collapsed immediately and was taken to the hospital much later on, where he suffered multiple injuries including temporary blindness and a permanent loss of visual acuity. He endured multiple surgeries to try to repair the injury. Nelson lost his athletic scholarship due to his injury and was forced to withdraw from UC Davis. The officers were unable to find any criminal charges against Nelson. The Ninth Circuit held that the use of force was unreasonable and the officers were not entitled to [[qualified immunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson v. City of Davis|url=http://www.willamette.edu/wucl/resources/journals/wlo/9thcir/2012/07/nelson-v-city-of-davis.html|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'' (2014) ===
On July 18, 2014, a West Memphis police officer stopped Donald Rickard for a broken headlight. As the officer talked with Rickard he noticed that there was an indentation in the [[windshield]] and that Rickard was acting very erratic. The officer asked Rickard to step out of the vehicle. Rickard at that point fled the scene. A high speed chase ensued, which involved several other officers. Rickard lost control of his vehicle in a parking lot, and officers exited their vehicles to approach Rickard. Rickard again tried to flee, hitting several police cruisers and nearly hitting several officers. At this time officers opened fire on Rickard. The officers fired a total of 15 rounds which resulted in the death of both Rickard and his passenger. The Supreme Court ruled that the use of force was justified, because the objective reasonableness of the use of deadly force must be based on the situation in which it was used, and not on hindsight.&lt;ref&gt;''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', 134 S. Ct. 2012, 572 U.S., 188 L. Ed. 2d 1056 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. statistics ==
Of the 40 million people in the [[United States]] who had face to face contact with the police 1.4%, or 574,000, reported use of force or the threat of use of force being directed at them. About a quarter of the 574,000 incidents involved the police officer pointing the gun at the subject of the incident and 53.5% of the incidents saw the officer using physical force such as kicking, grabbing, and pushing. In addition, 13.7% of those that had force used against them or were threatened with the use of force submitted complaints to the offending officer's department. Of those that received use of force from a police officer or were threatened with use of force almost 75% reported that they believed it was excessive and unwarranted. This statistic was consistent across the Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic races.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice. (2011). ''Contacts Between Police and the Public, 2008. ''(NCJ 234599). Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the ''Washington Post'' found that 385 Americans were fatally shot by law enforcement officers in the first five months of 2015, an average of more than two fatal shootings a day, which was more than twice the rate reported in official statistics. 221 of those killed were armed with guns, and 68 were armed with knives or other blades..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fatal-police-shootings-in-2015-approaching-400-nationwide/2015/05/30/d322256a-058e-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html?hpid=z1| author=Kimberly Kindy| title=Fatal police shootings in 2015 approaching 400 nationwide| publisher=The Washington Post| date=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Officer attributes==
===Education===

Studies have shown that law enforcement personnel with some college education (typically two-year degrees) use force much less often than those with little to no higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galvan|first1=Astrid|title=Study: Educated Cops Less Likely To Use Force|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/3023320metro11-30-10.htm|accessdate=October 10, 2014|work=Albuquerque Journal|date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In events that the educated officers do use force, it is usually what is considered "reasonable" force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worden|first1=Robert E.|title=And Justice for All: Understanding and Controlling Police Abuse of Force|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|pages=23–51|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these findings, very little - only 1% - of police forces within the United States have education requirements for those looking to join their forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rydberg|first1=Jason|last2=Terrill|first2=William|title=The Effect of Higher Education on Police Behavior|journal=Police Quarterly|year=2010|volume=13|issue=1|pages=92–120|url=http://pqx.sagepub.com/content/13/1/92.full.pdf+html|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that police work deeply requires experience that can only be gained from actually working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paoline III|first1=Eugene A.|last2=Terrill|first2=William|title=Police Education, Experience, and the Use of Force|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|date=February 2007|volume=34|issue=2|page=182|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/34/2/179.full.pdf+html|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experience===
It is argued that the skills for performing law enforcement tasks well cannot be produced from a classroom setting. These skills tend to be better gained through repeated exposure to law enforcement situations while in the line of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terrill|first1=William|title=Police Education, Experience, and the Use of Force|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|date=February 2007|volume=34|issue=2|page=182|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/34/2/179.full.pdf+html|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results as to whether or not the amount of experience an officer has contributes to the likelihood that they will use force differ among studies.

=== Other characteristics ===
It has not been strongly found that the race, class, gender, age etc. of an officer affects the likelihood that they will use force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Travis|first1=Jeremy|last2=Chaiken|first2=Jan|last3=Kaminski|first3=Robert|title=Use of Force by Police|journal=National Institute of Justice|date=October 1999|page=9|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/176330-1.pdf|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situational factors may come into play.

==== Split-second syndrome====
Split-second syndrome is an example of how use of force can be situation-based. Well-meaning officers may resort to the use of force too quickly under situations where they must make a rapid decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunham|first1=Roger G.|last2=Alpert|first2=Geoffrey P.|title=Critical Issues in Policing|date=2010|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=466|edition=6|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departmental attributes==
Policies on use of force can differ between departments. The type of policies established and whether or not they are enforced can affect an officer's likeliness to use force. If policies are established, but not enforced heavily by the department, the policies may not make a difference. For example, the [[Rodney King]] case was described as a problem with the departmental supervision not being clear on policies of (excessive) force. Training offered by the department can be a contributing factor, as well, though it has only been a recent addition to include information on when to use force, rather than how to use force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunham|first1=Roger G.|last2=Alpert|first2=Geoffrey P.|title=Critical Issues in Policing|date=2010|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=513–527|edition=6|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One departmental level policy that is currently being studied and called for by many citizens and politicians is the use of body cameras by officers. In one study body cameras were shown to reduce the use of force by as much as 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Effect of Police Body-Worn Cameras on Use of Force and Citizens’ Complaints Against the Police: A Randomized Controlled Trial|author1=Barak Ariel |author2=William A. Farrar |author3=Alex Sutherland |year = 2014|journal = Journal of Quantitative Criminology|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime levels ==
At the micro level, violent crime levels in the neighborhood increase the likelihood of law enforcement use of force. In contrast, at the meso level violent neighborhood crime does not have that much effect on use of force.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H., Vaughn, M. S., &amp; Lim, H. (2014). The effect of neighborhood crime levels on police use of force: An examination at micro and meso levels. Journal of Criminal Justice, 42(6), 491-499&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==
In England and Wales the use of (reasonable) force is provided to [[police]] and any other [[person]] from Section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], which states:

"A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large".

Use of force may be considered lawful if it was, on the basis of the facts as the accused honestly believed them,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/#Reasonable_Force CPS: Self-Defence and the Prevention of Crime]&lt;/ref&gt; necessary and reasonable.

(Further provision about when force is "reasonable" was made by [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_9#pt5-pb5-l1g76 section 76] of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]].)
