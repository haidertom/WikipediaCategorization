Chi was arrested for theft in 1998 in [[San Angelo, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Shon Gables &amp; Steve Stoler, "Plano man behind explosives probe shared mistrust of government," June 22, 2012, WFAA-TV Dallas-Fort Worth, at {{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625005312/http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Chi allegedly expressed support for [[Tax protester (United States)|tax protesters]] [[Edward and Elaine Brown]]. He posted a [[YouTube]] video stating that he would not file federal income tax returns or pay [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, June 22, 2012, "Officials say Texas man tried to blow up natural gas pipeline in suburban Dallas neighborhood," as published in the ''Washington Post'', at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/officials-say-texas-man-tried-to-blow-up-natural-gas-pipeline-in-suburban-dallas-neighborhood/2012/06/22/gJQAbLVjvV_story.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he was sentenced to three years probation in [[Orange County, California]] on a weapons charge. According to the [[Associated Press]], his three-year probation was revoked in 2009. Chi also faced a charge in [[Collin County, Texas]], for allegedly failing to identify himself as a fugitive.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, June 22, 2012, "Officials say Texas man tried to blow up natural gas pipeline in suburban Dallas neighborhood," as published in the ''Washington Post'', at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/officials-say-texas-man-tried-to-blow-up-natural-gas-pipeline-in-suburban-dallas-neighborhood/2012/06/22/gJQAbLVjvV_story.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shon Gables &amp; Steve Stoler, "Plano man behind explosives probe shared mistrust of government," June 22, 2012, WFAA-TV Dallas-Fort Worth, at {{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625005312/http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008, he self-published a novel, ''Yellow on the Outside, Shame on the Inside: Asian Culture Revealed''. In the book, he disclosed frustrations with his parents and allegedly threatened to [[Suicide|kill himself]].&lt;ref&gt;Shon Gables &amp; Steve Stoler, "Plano man behind explosives probe shared mistrust of government," June 22, 2012, WFAA-TV Dallas-Fort Worth, at {{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625005312/http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) arrested Chi after a series of suspicious explosions near midnight on the night of June 17–18, 2012, near a gas pipeline in a residential area of [[Plano, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woodard |first=Teresa |url=http://www.khou.com/news/texas-news/Suspect-in-Plano-explosion-revealed-FBI-searches-home-again-159999955.html |title=Suspect in Plano explosion revealed, FBI searches home again &amp;#124; khou.com Houston |publisher=Khou.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200845/http://www.khou.com/news/texas-news/Suspect-in-Plano-explosion-revealed-FBI-searches-home-again-159999955.html |archivedate=2014-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chi allegedly told police he had been hit by a car, but the police concluded that he was trying to tamper with a natural gas system and that a homemade bomb detonated in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;"FBI: Plano Explosion Suspect Identified," June 22, 2012, KDFW Television News, Dallas, at [http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Plano-Explosion-Suspect-Identified-159990885.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, June 22, 2012, "Officials say Texas man tried to blow up natural gas pipeline in suburban Dallas neighborhood," as published in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/officials-say-texas-man-tried-to-blow-up-natural-gas-pipeline-in-suburban-dallas-neighborhood/2012/06/22/gJQAbLVjvV_story.html].&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, 2012, the ''[[The Dallas Morning News|Dallas Morning News]]'' reported that during the investigation, law enforcement personnel found an explosive device in Chi's residence, and that a "bomb squad hauled a device out of the house, encased it in a protective steel container, buried it in a hole in Kaufman County and blew it up...."&lt;ref&gt;Avi Selk, June 25, 2012, "New court docs: Makeshift lab, terrorism books found in Plano bomb suspect’s bedroom," ''Dallas Morning News'', at {{cite web |url=http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2012/06/court-docs-makeshift-bomb-lab-terrorism-books-found-in-plano-gas-main-suspects-bedroom.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720183300/http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2012/06/court-docs-makeshift-bomb-lab-terrorism-books-found-in-plano-gas-main-suspects-bedroom.html/ |archivedate=2015-07-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with the incident, Chi was indicted by a Federal grand jury on a charge of possession of a destructive device in violation of the [[National Firearms Act]]; the indictment was filed on July 11, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Indictment, docket entry #12, July 11, 2012, ''United States v.

Anson Chi'', case no. 4:12-cr-00155-RAS-DDB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Sherman Div.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a superseding indictment handed down on February 14, 2013, Chi was charged with possession of an unregistered firearm in the form of an explosive, malicious use of explosive materials, and using or carrying a destructive device during a crime of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Wigglesworth, Feb. 20, 2013, "Plano bombing suspect faces new charges in indictment," ''Dallas Morning News'', at [http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2013/02/plano-bombing-suspect-faces-new-charges-in-indictment.html/].&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2013, Chi pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to destroy a natural gas pipeline used in interstate commerce, and to a charge of possessing an explosive device not registered with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.&lt;ref&gt;"Texas man reaches plea deal in pipeline blast case," Associated Press, June 3, 2013, at [https://news.yahoo.com/texas-man-reaches-plea-deal-pipeline-blast-case-230303052.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas issued an order granting Chi's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;Oral order, Feb. 26, 2014, ''United States v. Chi'', case no. 4:12-cr-00155-RAS-DDB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2014, a Second Superseding Indictment was filed against Chi in the case. He was charged with one count of knowingly possessing a destructive device not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, in violation of {{usc|26|5841}}, {{usc|26|5845}}, {{usc|26|5861}}, and {{usc|26|5871}}; one count of malicious use of an explosive, in violation of subsection (i) of {{usc|18|844}}; one count of using or carrying a destructive device during a crime of violence, in violation of subsection (c)(1)(B)(ii) of {{usc|18|924}}; and one count of making a false declaration before a court, in violation of {{usc|18|1623}}.&lt;ref&gt;Second Superseding Indictment, docket entry 98, May 14, 2014, ''United States v. Chi'', case no. 4:12-cr-00155-RAS-DDB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Chi again pleaded guilty. On June 11, 2015, he was sentenced to twenty years in prison, based on a guilty plea to one count of possession of an unregistered firearm, and one count of malicious use of an explosive device. The sentence was ten years on the first count and twenty years on the latter count, but the two sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. Chi was also ordered to pay other amounts, including $28,127.77 in restitution to Atmos Energy in connection with the damage to the pipe line.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment of Conviction, June 11, 2015, docket entry 237, ''United States v. Anson Chi'', case no. 4:12-cr-00155-RAS-DDB, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Apocalypse of Lorvão''''' is an [[illuminated manuscript]] from [[Lorvão]], Portugal containing the ''[[Commentary on the Apocalypse]]'' of [[Beatus of Liébana|Beatus]] of [[Santo Toribio de Liébana|Liébana Monastery]], Spain. 

It is currently kept at the [[Torre do Tombo National Archive]] in [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063606/POR_280_004.html|title=Apocalipsis of Lorvao|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
This is a well-dated manuscript whose origin is identified through its [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], which indicates that it was completed in 1189 in the [[scriptorium]] of the Lorvão monastery in the present municipality of [[Penacova]], near [[Coimbra]]. It was signed by the scribe Egeas, who might also be the author of illustrations. It remained preserved in the abbey until the nineteenth century, including while the monastery changed denomination in 1205 and hosted a [[Cistercian]] community.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt; 

The historian [[Alexandre Herculano]] discovered the manuscript in the library of the monastery in 1853 and transferred it to the national archives of Portugal in Lisbon to be part of the corpus of documents and texts in the history of Portugal (''Portugalliae Monumenta Historica''). The manuscript is still preserved there.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of eleven manuscripts of Beatus in the Iberian record of the [[Memory of the World Register]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/fr/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/the-manuscripts-of-the-commentary-to-the-apocalypse-beatus-of-liebana-in-the-iberian-tradition/ Présentation sur le site de l'UNESCO]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
This is the only manuscript of the Beatus Commentary on the Apocalypse of Liébana, also called Beatus, produced in Portugal during the [[Middle Ages]]. This is a relatively primitive version of the text, probably copied from a ninth century original. It is written in a [[Carolingian minuscule]] style that made the transition to the [[Blackletter|Gothic]]. His miniatures are at number 70, including 18 full-page, 20 of the half-page and the other smaller and variable dimensions. The manuscript also retains its original binding.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;These illustrations were considered archaic for the time, marked by a thick stroke and colors dominated by orange and yellow. They may have been copied from an older model, perhaps close to the original manuscript written by [[Beatus of Liebana]]. There are also repeatedly scenes of everyday life at the time of [[Sancho I of Portugal]]. Finally, [[Beatus map]] belonging to the manuscript has been preserved but only half of it. It was reunited with the manuscript after being separated from it.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4040">The '''blue-green [[shan shui]]''' ({{zh|s=青绿山水|t=青綠山水|p=Qīng-Lǜ Shān-Shuǐ}}), is a Chinese [[painting]] style of "[[Shan shui]]". It tends to refer to an "ancient style" rather than modern ones. The main colours of the paintings are [[blue]]s and [[green]]s, and in the early period it was painted using [[mineral]] [[dye]]s. It's said this style was first formulated by Li Sixun ({{zh|s=[[:zh:李思训|李思训]]|t=李思訓|p=Lǐ Sī-Xùn|links=no}}),&lt;ref name="Baidu Li Sixun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/94288.htm |title=李思训 (''Li Sixun (Tang Dynasty general, politician and painter)'') |publisher=[[Baidu]].com [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=January 1, 2010|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; a general, politician and famous painter in [[Tang Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Baidu blue-green shan shui"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/6996.htm |title=青绿山水 (''Blue-green Shan Shui'') |publisher=[[Baidu]].com [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=January 1, 2010|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and sub-styles==
[[Image:Emperor Minghuang's Journey to Sichuan, Freer Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Emperor Minghuang's Journey to Sichuan''; a '''blue-green shan shui''' painting depicting the flight of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] from [[Chang'an]], a late [[Ming Dynasty]] painting after an original by [[Qiu Ying]] (1494–1552).]]
Similar styles appeared before the [[Tang Dynasty]], especially in the period of the [[Six Dynasties]].&lt;ref name="Baidu blue-green shan shui"/&gt; Many historic records show that Li father and sons – Li Sixun (father) and Li Zhaodao (son, {{zh|c=[[:zh:李昭道|李昭道]]|p=Lǐ Zhāo-Dào|links=no}}, son of Li Sixun), largely developed the painting techniques and formulated the style.&lt;ref name="Baidu Li Sixun"/&gt;

There are mainly two styles of this painting:&lt;ref name="Baidu blue-green shan shui"/&gt;
* Shibi Qingyuan ({{zh|s=式笔青綠|t=式筆青綠|p=Shì-Bǐ Qīng-Lǜ|links=no}})
* Yibi Qingyuan ({{zh|s=意笔青綠|t=意笔青綠|p=Yì-bǐ Qīng-Lǜ|links=no}})

==Schools==

[[Tang Dynasty]]:
* General ''blue-green shan shui''.
Late [[Northern Song Dynasty]]:
* ''Bright green shan shui'' ({{zh|c=金碧山水|p=Jīn-Bì Shān-Shuǐ|links=no}})
* ''Great blue-green shan shui'' ({{zh|s=大青绿山水|t=大青綠山水|p=Dà Qīng-Lǜ Shān-Shuǐ|links=no}})
* ''Little blue-green shan shui'' ({{zh|s=小青绿山水|t=小青綠山水|p=Xiǎo Qīng-Lǜ Shān-Shuǐ|links=no}})
[[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]]:
* The ''little blue-green shan shui'' is the dominant style/school. Especially in the Late [[Ming Dynasty]], the painter [[Lan Ying]] (Chinese: 蓝瑛; Pinyin: Lán Yīng) from [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]] (Chinese: [[:zh:浙派|浙派]]) developed the style to an historic climax.&lt;ref name="Baidu blue-green shan shui"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baidu Lan Ying"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/88731.htm |title=蓝瑛 (''Lan Ying (painter)'') |publisher=[[Baidu]].com [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=January 1, 2010|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burmese ceramics''' refers to [[ceramic art]] and [[pottery]] designed or produced as a form of [[Burmese art]]. The tradition of Burmese ceramics dates back to the third millennium BCE. Pottery and ceramics were an essential part of the trade between Myanmar and its neighbours.

The village of [[Kyaukmyaung (Sagaing)]] is an important traditional production centre.

'''''Chair''''' is a public artwork designed as an advertisement by Bassett Furniture, located at the intersection of Martin Luther King Ave. and V. Street S.E., in the [[Anacostia]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States of America]]. ''Chair'' was originally surveyed as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] survey in 1994. It was once considered the world's largest chair,&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculptures! | year=1994 | title=Chair, (sculpture). | work=SOS! | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!323187~!0#focus | accessdate= 1 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been overtaken by works like ''[[Broken Chair]]'' in [[Geneva]] and the temporary ''The Writer'' on [[Hampstead Heath]] in London.

==Description==

The chair, which stands 19 1/2 feet high, is a detail-to-detail replica of a [[Duncan Phyfe]] style chair. Painted brown with a white and brown striped "cushion", the chair is entirely made of [[aluminum]]. Weighing between 4,000 and 4,600 pounds, the chair sits on a concrete base.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Acquisition==

The chair was built in 1959 by Virginia-based furniture maker [[Bassett Furniture]]. The concept for the chair came from Charles Curtis, of the Curtis Brothers Furniture company, as a clever way to bring customers to their family showroom which was located on the grounds where the chair is currently placed.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

The piece was dedicated on July 11, 1959, and a plaque was placed with it, stating:

:THE WORLD'S LARGEST CHAIR
:PRESENTED TO
:CURTIS BROS.
:FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP
:AND SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC/BY THE
:BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES.
:THE CHAIR MADE OF SOUND HONDURAS MAHOGANY
:IS 19 1/2 FEET TALL AND WEIGHS 4000 POUNDS
:DEDICATED JULY 11, 1959
:DESIGNED
:LEO M. HIRAMETT
:BUILT BY J. E. BASSETT, JR.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Re-dedication==
John Kidwell, the caretaker of the Chair, frequently patched holes that would form after heavy rains with cement. During the days of August 23–24, 2005, the original Chair was disassembled by a backhoe and taken away for restoration. Made entirely of [[Honduras Mahogany]], the legs had begun to [[Dry rot|rot]]. On April 25, 2006, the chair was returned by Curtis Properties (was Curtis Brothers), however, this was a new chair, made entirely of brown aluminum. Over 250 people attended the re-dedication including [[Anthony A. Williams|Mayor Anthony A. Williams]].&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Schwartzman | title=The Big Chair, Rebuilt to Last | work=Anacostia | publisher=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/15/AR2006041500871.html | accessdate= 2 Feb 2011 | date=April 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the dedication of a new chair, a new plaque was placed, reading:

:THE BIG CHAIR
:RE-DEDICATION APRIL 25, 2006
:THIS COMMUNITY LANDMARK REPRESENTS THE CURTIS COMPANIES
:LONG-STANDING ALLEGIANCE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND
:STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO UNITY, PROSPERITY, AND GOOD WILL
:TO ALL WASHINGTONIANS AND FRIENDS OF ANACOSTIA.

This new chair was designed by Devery Lomax managed by John Kidwell. It was fabricated by Cinnbar, an Orlando-based business known for their oversized objects, and Nelson's Welding. The new chair cost over $40,000 to build. Upon its delivery, by flatbed truck, overpasses had to be avoided due to the size of the chair.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

==Looking Glass House==

On August 13, 1960, Rebecca Kirby (aka Lynn Arnold) moved "onto" the chair. A 10-by-10-foot cubicle was built and placed on the seat, furnished with a shower, bed, toilet, heater, air conditioner and balcony. Placed upon the chair by way of forklift, Kirby lived in the chair for 42 days. In the cubicle, she would watch TV, read books, and talk on the telephone, as well as dine, as her meals were delivered every day.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

Kirby would step outside onto the balcony every few hours to greet visitors who learned about her living situation due to newspapers advertising her as "Alice in the Looking Glass House". Visitors would be encouraged to guess how long she'd maintain her residency. Her then 14-month-old son, Richard, visited often, being placed in a dumb waiter and sent up to see her.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

After 42 days, Kirby "decided to return to earth," earning $1,500 for her stay.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

==Community reception==

The Chair has been received as a part of neighborhood life since its original installation. Anacostia, a neighborhood that has seen economic and cultural ups and downs prides itself on a landmark that withstands the community's evolution.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

The Chair is often used as a geographic marker for direction giving and holiday celebration; [[Santa Claus]] sits upon the chair during [[Christmas]]. When the Chair was reinstalled in 2006, community members surrounded the giant, clapping, yelling and photographing the new chair.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

During the [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots]] the Chair was one of the few landmarks to go unscathed in a neighborhood heavily affected by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s death.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Schwartzman | title=The Return of the Big Chair: A Very Big Deal | work=Anacostia | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/25/AR2006042501682.html | accessdate= 1 Feb 2011 | date=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CODICOLOGY.jpg|thumb|upright|Codicological signs]]
'''Codicology''' (from [[Latin]] {{Lang|la|[[codex]]}}, [[genitive]] {{Lang|la|codicis}}, "notebook, book"; 
and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{Lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the study of [[codex|codices]] or manuscript books written on parchment (or paper) as physical objects. It is often referred to as 'the archaeology of the book', concerning itself with the materials ([[parchment]], sometimes referred to as membrane or [[vellum]], [[paper]], pigments, inks and so on), and techniques used to make books, including their binding.

There are no clear-cut definitions: some codicologists say that their field encompasses [[palaeography]], the study of handwriting, while some palaeographers say that their field encompasses codicology. The study of written features such as [[marginalia]], [[glosses]], ownership inscriptions, etc. falls in both camps, as does the study of the [[illuminated manuscript|physical aspects of decoration]], which otherwise belongs to [[art history]].

By a close examination of the physical attributes of a book, it is sometimes possible to establish the history and provenance of a book, or to match up long-separated elements originally from the same book.  Palaeographers and codicologists may also study the history of libraries, manuscript-collecting and of book-cataloguing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9542">'''Custom-fit''' means [[personalization|personalized]] with regard to shape and size. A customized product would imply the modification of some of its characteristics according to the customers requirements such as with a [[custom car]]. However, when fit is added to the term, customization could give the idea of both the geometric characteristics of the body and the individual customer requirements,&lt;ref&gt;Tuck et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''e.g.'', the steering wheel of the Formula 1 driver [[Fernando Alonso]].

The custom-fit concept can be understood as the idea of offering one-of-a-kind products that, due to their intrinsic characteristics and use, can be totally adapted to geometric characteristics in order to meet the user requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Anton et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

With this new concept, industry moves from a resource based manufacturing system to a knowledge based manufacturing system and from [[mass production]] to individual production. This encourages the [[Lean manufacturing|Lean Production]] trend as established by Toyota, or in other words, an efficiency-based production.

==Research==
There are some studies referring to the positive impacts this concept would have on society:
* Customised Motorcycle Seats&lt;ref&gt;Ong et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* Orthopaedic Profession&lt;ref&gt;Wagner et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The research studies found in February 2008 on the subject are the following:
* Customised Motorcycle and Helmet&lt;ref&gt;Tuck et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* Knee and Manxilo-facial Implants and Prosthetics Sockets&lt;ref&gt;Dolinsek, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical Tools==

===Data Capturing===
The process starts with the capturing of data directly from the user by [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] techniques with the ultimate aim of manufacturing products using [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] techniques.

===Process Design and Validation===
* Converting scanned data directly and automatically into final models ready for printing: [[Digital Cad Approach]] and [[Hybrid Approach]].
* Representing Structure for Functionally Graded Material:
# [[Interface Innerspace]] developed by TNO which integrates the RDT Centers in The Netherlands.
# [[Multi Phase Topology Optimisation]], designed by [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer]] (comparable to TNO in Germany).
# Finite Element Representation [[Finite element analysis]] used by Materialise in Belgium.
* A [[rapid manufacturing]] interface called [[Slice Raster Inteface]], also designed by Materialise.

Although all these developments have been of great interest, the RM-processes have not fallen behind, due to improvement of new Rapid Prototyping [[Direct digital manufacturing]] techniques.

===Rapid Manufacturing Systems, Tools and Materials===
* The Metal Printing Process developed by SINTEF in Norway, produces 3D products with metal powder with different graduation, sintered layer-by-layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rm-platform.com/index.php?option%3Dcom_docman%26task%3Ddoc_download%26gid%3D287 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191045/http://www.rm-platform.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=287 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MPP aims to become the equivalent of a high speed 3D-printer that produces three-dimensional objects directly from powder materials. This technique is based on the process principles of [[xerographic]] printers, (for example, laser or [[LED printer]]s) that combine electrostatic printing with photography. The MPP process approach uses the same fundamental principles to build solid objects on a layer-by-layer basis. Layers of powder materials are generated by attracting different metal- and/or ceramic powders to their respective position on a charged pattern on a photoreceptor by means of an electrostatic field. The attracted layer is transferred to a punch and transported to the consolidation unit where each layer of part material is sintered onto the previous by pressure and heat. The procedure is repeated layer-by-layer until the three-dimensional object is fully formed and consolidated.

MPP has the ability to print different powders within the same layer and progressively change from one material to another, i.e., producing a functionally graded material. In addition to this, MPP uses external pressure to speed the densification process (sintering), which allows manufacturing with a wide range of materials and opens the possibility to produce unique material combinations and microstructures.

* The High Viscosity [[Inkjet printing]] developed by TNO has the capability of printing with one or more materials with graded structures in a single process using additive technology.

It has several print heads that produce continuous streams of material droplets at high frequency. The High Viscosity Inkjet Printing machine is also capable of printing multi-materials simultaneously and also enables the mixing and grading of materials in any combination that is desired. This will enable the manufacturing of products with two or more materials that are graded and there will be no distinct boundary between the materials. This will result in products with unique mechanical properties.

Dr. Michiel Willemse who is leading the project says, "The process is unique in its capability to print highly viscous, UV curable, resins. Material formulations with viscosities up to 500 mPa•s (at ambient temperature) have been printed successfully. This offers the opportunity to print products with unequaled mechanical properties when compared to any other printing systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/materials_science/report-100199.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725192316/http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/materials_science/report-100199.html |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Plastic Powder Printing Process developed by The Monfort University in the United Kingdom is based on the concept of fusing layers of a wide range of plastic powders in the desired combination by laser [[printing]]. PPP aims to develop the equivalent of a high speed [[laser printer]] that produces three-dimensional 3D objects from plastic powder where powder is first deposited by means of laser printing /electrophotography technique and subsequently fused under infrared heating units to make solid layers. Layers are consolidated further to make 3D plastic objects. Various [[thermoplastics|thermoplastic]] toners from standard engineering polymers like [[polyethylene]] (high and low density), [[polypropylene]], and [[polystyrene]] have already been deposited using this technique and later fused with infrared rays to form the layers.

'''''Dante's Dream''''' (full title '''''Dante's Dream at the Time of the Death of Beatrice''''') is a [[painting]] from [[1871]] by the English [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. It hangs in the [[Walker Art Gallery]], [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England.

Rossetti had a lifelong interest in the Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]].  The painting was inspired by Dante's poem ''[[La Vita Nuova]]''. In this poem Dante dreams that he is led to the death-bed of [[Beatrice Portinari]], who was the object of his unfulfilled love.  Dante, in black, stands looking towards the dying Beatrice who is lying on a bed.  Two female figures in green hold a canopy over her.  An angel in red holds Dante's hand and leans forward to kiss Beatrice.

In the painting, Rossetti creates a visionary world with complex symbols.  The symbols include the green clothes of Beatrice's attendants, signifying hope; spring flowers in the foreground symbolising purity; and red doves for love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 1994| title = The Walker Art Gallery| edition = | publication-place = London | publisher = Scala| page = 68| isbn = 1-85759-037-6 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is Rossetti's largest painting.&lt;ref name=wag/&gt;  The model for Beatrice was Jane Morris, the wife of William Morris. Annie Miller, who is thought to have been one of Rossetti's mistresses,{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} posed as a grieving hand maiden. The Walker Art Gallery bought the painting directly from the artist in 1881 for £1575 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1575|1881|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}).&lt;ref name=wag&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/conservation/dantesdream/| title = Dante's Dream: Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1871) | accessdate = 23 April 2010| publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Inflation-fn|UK}}  The acquisition was negotiated by Victorian novelist [[Hall Caine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The sale of ‘Dante’s Dream at the time of the Death of Beatrice’ to the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool: The Correspondence between D.

Again in 1904 the painting was noted to be in "a bad condition" and it was considered that its condition had been worsened by its journey to and from Berlin.  The painting was sent in 1908 to the [[National Gallery]] in London to be [[lining of paintings|relined]], that is, for a new canvas to be glued to the original.  It was then returned to Liverpool. During the Second World War, it was removed from its stretcher, rolled and stored in the basement of the gallery.  In 1941 the painting was moved, together with other large paintings from the gallery, to [[Ellesmere College]] in [[Shropshire]].  It was noted at this time that it had sustained some damage.  Conservation work was carried out on the painting in 1960 and in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/conservation/dantesdream/history.aspx| title = Conservation history of "Dante's Dream"| accessdate = 23 April 2010| publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dante's Dream'' is a painting in [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]], measuring {{convert|216|cm|in|0}} by {{convert|312.4|cm|in|0}}.&lt;ref name=wag/&gt;  It was examined in 2003 and found to be in good condition, with no evidence of any recurrence of the former problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/conservation/dantesdream/today.aspx| title = Dante's Dream today | accessdate = 23 April 2010| publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Drowning Girl''''' (also known as '''''Secret Hearts''''' or '''''I Don't Care! I'd Rather Sink''''') is a 1963 painting in oil and synthetic polymer paint on canvas by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Using the conventions of [[comic book]] art, a [[speech balloon|thought bubble]] conveys the thoughts of the figure, while [[Ben-Day dots]] echo the effect of the mechanized printing process. It is one of the most representative paintings of the [[pop art]] movement, and part of the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s permanent collection since 1971. The painting is considered among Lichtenstein's most significant works, perhaps on a par with his acclaimed 1963 diptych ''[[Whaam!]]''. ''Drowning Girl'' has been described as a "masterpiece of melodrama", and is one of the artist's earliest images depicting women in tragic situations, a theme to which he often returned in the mid-1960s.

The painting shows a teary-eyed woman on a turbulent sea. She is emotionally distressed, seemingly from a romance. A thought bubble reads: "I Don't Care! I'd Rather Sink&amp;nbsp;— Than Call Brad For Help!" This narrative element highlights the clichéd [[melodrama]], while its graphics reiterate Lichtenstein's theme of [[painterly]] work imitating mechanized reproduction. The work is derived from a 1962 [[DC Comics]] panel, while also borrowing from [[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' and from elements of modernist artists [[Jean Arp]] and [[Joan Miró]]. It is one of several Lichtenstein works that mention a character named Brad who is absent from the picture. Both the graphical and narrative elements of the work are cropped from the source image.

==Background==

During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Art Movements|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/modern-art-movements.htm|publisher=ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ART|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Lichtenstein]] made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. [[Andy Warhol]] produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960.

When Lichtenstein made his transition to comic-based work, he began to mimic the style while adapting the subject matter. He applied simplified color schemes and commercial printing-like techniques. The style he adopted was "simple, well-framed images {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} solid fields of bold color often bounded by thick, stark border lines."&lt;ref name=TLoC:WaP&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Todd|title=The Language of Comics: Word and Image |year=2001|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-414-7|page=42|editor1-last =Varnum | editor1-first = Robin | editor2-last = Gibbons | editor2-first = Christina T.|chapter=Coyotes and Visual Ethos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borrowed technique was "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of Ben-Day dots used in newspaper printing".&lt;ref name=TGEoAA&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA158 |title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art| accessdate= June 15, 2013| year =2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-533579-1|page=158| editor-last =Marter | editor-first = Joan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]] asserts that this is an adaptation of the [[ligne claire]] style associated with [[Hergé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.pbs.org/pov/tintinandi/special_tintinamerica.php#.UcDzjtjxGF9 |title=Essay: Tintin in America|accessdate=June 19, 2013| publisher= [[PBS]]|author=Bengal, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein once said of his technique: "I take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental."&lt;ref name=PApRLda7&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Pop-Art-pioneer-Roy-Lichtenstein-dead-at-73/id-43b85ac8a5a6ab361d2adb164e6a10ce |title=Pop Art pioneer Roy Lichtenstein dead at 73|accessdate=June 10, 2013|date=September 29, 1997|agency=[[Associated Press]]| last =Monroe | first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of ''Drowning Girl'' is an example of Lichtenstein's post-1963 comics-based women who "look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as if they all came out of the same pot of makeup."{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 23}}  In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein produced several "fantasy drama" paintings of women in love affairs with domineering men causing women to be miserable, such as ''Drowning Girl'', ''Hopeless'' and ''[[In the Car]]''.  These works served as prelude to 1964 paintings of innocent "girls next door" in a variety of tenuous emotional states.&lt;ref name=W113/&gt; "In ''Hopeless'' and ''Drowning Girl'', for example, the heroines appear as victims of unhappy love affairs, with one displaying helplessness&amp;nbsp;... and the other defiance (she would rather drown than ask for her lover's help)."&lt;ref name=W113/&gt; ''Drowning Girl'', the aforementioned works and ''[[Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But...]]'' are among those tragedies that make the author a popular draw at museums.&lt;ref name=RLARatNGoAWD&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gaithersburg.patch.com/blog_posts/roy-lichtenstein-a-retrospective-at-the-national-gallery-of-art-washington-dc |title=Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=December 11, 2012|work=[[Gaithersburg Patch]]| last =Borchert | first = Vian Shamounki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Drowning Girl'' is derived from the [[splash page (comics)|splash page]] from "Run for Love!", illustrated by Tony Abruzzo and lettered by [[Ira Schnapp]], in ''Secret Hearts'' #83 (November 1962), [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| artist=Tony Abruzzo|letterer=Ira Schnapp|story=Run for Love!|title=Secret Hearts | issue=83 | publisher =DC Comics|date=November 1963|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Waldman | 1993 | pp = 118–19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arntson|first=Amy E.|title = Graphic Design Basics |year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-00693-9|page= 165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same comic book issue that inspired ''Hopeless''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image-duplicator.com/sat/sat_source_details.php?source_id=21212|title=Secret Hearts #83 (a)|accessdate= June 11, 2013 | publisher = Lichtenstein Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Lichtenstein was parodying various types of sources such as commercial illustrations, comic imagery and even modern masterpieces. The masterpieces represented what could have been dubbed the "canon" of art and was thought of as "high art," while the "low-art" subject matter included comic strip images. His masterworks sources included the likes of [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]. During this time in his career, Lichtenstein noted that "the things that I have apparently parodied I actually admire."&lt;ref name= CtoaPAm&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=61860#.UbHwPtjxGF8|title=Christie's to offer a Pop Art masterpiece: Roy Lichtenstein's Woman with Flowered Hat|accessdate=June 7, 2013|date=|work=ArtDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Lichtenstein was exploring the theme of "industrialization of emotion". In Lichtenstein's obituary, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Christopher Knight (art critic)|Christopher Knight]] said the work was "a witty rejoinder to [[Willem de Kooning|De Kooning]]'s famously brushy paintings of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/30/news/mn-37730/2 |title=Pop Art Icon Lichtenstein Dies|accessdate=June 23, 2013|date=September 30, 1997|work= The [[Los Angeles Times]]| last =Knight | first = Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comic romances often depicted stereotypical representations of thwarted passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J1t8g_yX1wcC&amp;pg=PA289 | title = Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books|accessdate=June 7, 2013|publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn = 1-60473-267-9 | year =2009|page=289| last =Gabilliet | first = Jean-Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Lichtenstein Foundation website claims that Lichtenstein did not begin using his [[opaque projector]] technique until the fall of 1963,&lt;ref name=C/&gt; Lichtenstein described his process for producing comics based art, including ''Drowning Girl'':

==Description==
Some sources describe the subjects of Lichtenstein's tragic girls series as heroines (in the sense that they are the counterparts to the heroes),&lt;ref name =RLAR@NGoA/&gt; and others do not (in the sense that they are not heroic).&lt;ref name=TGtUSPC&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA490|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture| last =Kongden | first = Kristen| editor1-last = Browne | editor1-first = Ray B | editor2-first = Pat | editor2-last = Browne |publisher=Popular Press 3|isbn=0-87972-821-3|page= 490|year= 2001 | accessdate =June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Drowning Girl'' is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in to the power of the ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Because Lichtenstein only presents a single frame, the viewer does not know what happened before this moment and what is going to happen after it.  Furthermore, the viewer has no way to know who Brad is and why she is so reluctant to call him.&lt;ref name=RLAR@NGoA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcist.com/2012/10/roy_lichtenstein_a_retrospective_na.php|title=Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective @ National Gallery of Art|accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=October 11, 2012|last1=Rand|first1=Kelly|first2=Julia|last2=Langley|work=[[DCist]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228085008/http://dcist.com/2012/10/roy_lichtenstein_a_retrospective_na.php|archivedate=February 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art'', the most important element of Lichtenstein's procedure in the early 1960s was "the enlargement and unification of his source material".&lt;ref name =TGEoAA /&gt; Although, according to some sources, the changes made to produce ''Drowning Girl'' are not regarded as significant,&lt;ref name=W113&gt;{{Harvnb | Waldman | 1993 | p = 113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein made several notable changes from the original source: "In the original illustration, the drowning girl's boyfriend appears in the background, clinging to a capsized boat. Lichtenstein cropped the image dramatically, showing the girl alone and encircled by a threatening wave. He changed the caption from 'I don't care if I have a cramp!' to 'I don't care!' and the boyfriend's name from Mal to Brad."&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3542&amp;page_number=3&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=''Drowning Girl'': Roy Lichtenstein (American, 1923–1997) |accessdate=May 23, 2012|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the former narrative change, Lichtenstein removed evidence that the drowning girl has a cramp in her leg.&lt;ref name=RLAR@NGoA/&gt; With the latter narrative change, Lichtenstein attempted to change the perception of the boyfriend. When discussing another work (''[[I Know...Brad]]''), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of clichéd oversimplification.{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 110}}

Lichtenstein's method entailed "strengthening of the formal aspects of the composition, a stylization of motif, and a 'freezing' of both emotion and actions".&lt;ref name =TGEoAA /&gt; Although comic-book panels depict a moment in time, ''Drowning Girl'' is borrowed from an example of a comic-book panel depiction of a moment relatively more "pregnant" with past- and future-dependent drama than most moments.&lt;ref name=PoR&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lFxCRvrm9zAC&amp;pg=PA156 |title=Pictures of Romance: Form against Context in Painting and Literature|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]| last = Steiner | first = Wendy|isbn=0-226-77229-2|year=1987|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work also marks a phase in Lichtenstein's career when many of his works were given [[present participle|present-participial]] titles such as ''[[Sleeping Girl]]'', ''[[Crying Girl]]'' and ''Blonde Waiting'', which accentuates the works' "relation to process and action."&lt;ref name=PoR/&gt; According to ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art'', during this phase of Lichtenstein's career "a constant if restrained and a gentle sense of humor contribute just as much to the cheerful lightness of Lichtenstein's work as the balanced, completely harmonious composition."&lt;ref name=TGEoAA /&gt;

[[File:Roy Lichtenstein Drowning Girl narrative.jpg|left|thumb|Narrative content of ''Drowning Girl'']]
Narrative content was in the forefront of much of Lichtenstein's work as a means to engage the viewer.&lt;ref name=RLDW63&gt;{{Harvnb | Waldman | 1993 | p = 63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Measuring 171.6&amp;nbsp;cm × 169.5&amp;nbsp;cm (67.625 in × 66.75 in), ''Drowning Girl'' presents "a young woman who seems to have cried herself a river&amp;nbsp;... literally drowning in emotion," according to Janis Hendrickson. The [[melodrama]] makes it clear that she has been hurt by a "Brad", the name given to several of Lichtenstein's heroes.&lt;ref name=RLJH34a&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein| last =Hendrickson | first = Janis|publisher = [[Benedikt Taschen]]|year=1993|isbn=3-8228-9633-0|page=34|chapter=The Pictures That Lichtenstein Made Famous, or The Pictures That Made Lichtenstein Famous|quote=The ''Drowning Girl'' (Ill. p. 31) (1963) shows a young woman who seems to have cried herself a river. She is literally drowning in emotion and has abandoned herself to its destructive forces. Brad, the name of the man involved with several of Lichtenstein's "heroines", must have hurt her badly.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vian Shamounki Borchert says that the caption makes it clear that the subject is practically "drowning in a sea of tears".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gaithersburg.patch.com/blog_posts/roy-lichtenstein-a-retrospective-at-the-national-gallery-of-art-washington-dc|title=Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=December 11, 2012|work=[[Gaithersburg Patch]]| last =Borchert | first = Vian Shamounki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In typical Lichtenstein fashion, the tragic female is presented "in a suspended state of distress."&lt;ref name=RLAR@NGoA/&gt; According to Janis Hendrickson, the subject's head appears to rest on a wave as if it were a pillow and lies in the water as if it were a bed, creating a blend of "eroticism and final resting place".&lt;ref name=RLJH34b&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein| last =Hendrickson | first = Janis|publisher = [[Benedikt Taschen]]|year=1993|isbn=3-8228-9633-0|page=34|chapter=The Pictures That Lichtenstein Made Famous, or The Pictures That Made Lichtenstein Famous|quote=She is lying in the water as if it were a bed, a mixture of eroticism and final resting place.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waters of the sea swirl around the subject's waves of hair creating the perception of a whirlpool.&lt;ref name=RLAR@NGoA/&gt; The painting is representative of Lichtenstein's affinity for single-frame drama that reduces the viewer's ability to identify with it and that abstracts emotion. His use of industrial and mechanical appearance further trivialize the sentiments,&lt;ref name=RLJH34/&gt; although the painterly touches add to its simplification.&lt;ref name=DftM /&gt;

==General context==
In the early 1960s Lichtenstein's theme of comics-based work was hotly debated. In a 1963 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, [[Brian O'Doherty]] wrote that Lichtenstein's work was not art, saying Lichtenstein was "one of the worst artists in America" who "briskly went about making a sow's ear out of a sow's ear."&lt;ref name=PApRLda7/&gt; This was part of a widespread debate about the merits of Lichtenstein's comic blow-ups as true art. In January 1964 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' ran a story under the title "Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?" on this controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/lifemagroy.htm |title=Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.? |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |date=January 31, 1964 |work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |publisher=Lichtenstein Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104111859/http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/lifemagroy.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later reviews were much kinder. [[Todd Brewster]] noted that this may have been motivated by popular demand; he told ''Life'' in 1986 that "Those cartoon blowups may have disturbed the critics, but collectors, tired of the solemnity of abstract expressionism, were ready for some comic relief. Why couldn't the funny pages be fine art?"&lt;ref name = PApRLda7 /&gt; His work is now widely accepted, although some criticize him for borrowing from comics without attributing the original creators, paying royalties, or seeking permission from copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/may/image-duplicator-pop-arts-comic-theft |title=Image Duplicator: pop art's comic debt |accessdate=June 18, 2013 |date=May 13, 2013 |last=Steven |first=Rachael |work=[[Creative Review]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002013823/http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/may/image-duplicator-pop-arts-comic-theft |archivedate=October 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Barsalou has dedicated decades to identifying all of Lichtenstein's source materials and has posted more than 1,000 images on [[Flickr]] detailing Lichtenstein's unrecognized sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/02/02/deconstructing-lichtenstein-source-comics-revealed-and-credited/ |title=Deconstructing Lichtenstein: Source Comics Revealed and Credited |accessdate=June 23, 2013 |date=February 2, 2011 |last=Childs |first=Brian |publisher=Comics Alliance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112223049/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/02/02/deconstructing-lichtenstein-source-comics-revealed-and-credited/ |archivedate=January 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics question Lichtenstein's artistic skills. [[Everett Kinstler]] said that despite Lichtenstein's association with romance comics, in his day "no comics publisher would have hired Lichtenstein—he wasn't good enough."

''Drowning Girl'' was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the [[Tate Modern]] in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and [[The Centre Pompidou]] from July 3 to November 4, 2013.&lt;ref name="Kirkova, Deni"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/roy-lichtenstein_n_1533997.html |title='Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective' Debuts At The Art Institute of Chicago | type = photograms |accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=May 22, 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012–13 retrospective, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' described ''Drowning Girl'' as Lichtenstein's "masterpiece of melodrama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/18/roy-lichtenstein-retrospective-at-tate-modern-review_n_2710865.html |title= Roy Lichtenstein: Retrospective At Tate Modern (Review) | accessdate =June 6, 2013|date=February 18, 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]]| last =Parker | first = Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish art critic and [[Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]] director [[Poul Erik Tøjner]] called the work an example of Lichtenstein's "post-[[coital]] perdition" pieces, describing it as the "star witness" of this genre of his works. He notes that the subject is reaching far-flung depths as she acts out of pride.&lt;ref name=RLAAA19&gt;{{Harvnb | Holm | Tøjner | Caiger-Smith | 2003 | p = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tøjner perceived eroticism in this painting, likening the open mouth to a vaginal feature and noting the singularity of Lichtenstein using an open mouth. With that in mind, he compares the tears to [[ejaculate]] residue.&lt;ref name=RLAAA21&gt;{{Harvnb | Holm | Tøjner | Caiger-Smith | 2003 | p = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|thumb|Lichtenstein acknowledges that the wave is adapted from [[Hokusai]]'s famous print, ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.&lt;ref name=RLJH34 /&gt;]]
This was painted at the apex of Lichtenstein's use of enlarged dots, cropping and magnification of the original source.{{Sfn | Rondeau | Wagstaff | 2012 | p = 32}}  [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curator Diane Waldman notes that Lichtenstein made ''Drowning Girl'' a cornerstone of his career because of "his extraordinary sense of organization, his ability to use a sweeping curve and manipulate it into an allover pattern".&lt;ref name=RLDW75&gt;{{Harvnb | Waldman | 1993 | p = 75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'', the work is "a mix of cliché, melodrama, pathos, and absurdity&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists|page= 282|isbn = 978-0-19-512878-9 |year=2007| last =Morgan | first = Ann Lee|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is described by art scholar Jonathan Fineberg as "a remarkably impassive style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Art Since 1940: Strategies of Being| last =Fineberg | first = Jonathan|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]] | isbn = 0-8109-1951-6|year=1995|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image is typical of Lichtenstein's depiction of comic subjects responding to a situation in a clichéd manner.{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 15}}

Lichtenstein's tinkering with the source material resulted in a recomposition with sharper focus after he eliminated several elements that distract from the depiction of the woman, such as the [[capsizing|capsized]] boat, troubled male subject and the general seascape. The result was swirling, swooping waves and "animate white foam" that envelope the subject with a "pictorial buoyancy" that form an "aquatic continuum".&lt;ref name=RLMoMA /&gt;

''Drowning Girl'' presents an "unmistakeable acknowledgement to the flamboyant linearism of [[Art Nouveau]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Illustrated History of Pop Art| last =Pierre | first = José|publisher=Eyre Methuen|isbn=0-413-38370-9|page=94|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waves are intended to "recall [[Hokusai]] as well as the biomorphic forms of [[Jean Arp|Arp]] and [[Joan Miró|Miró]];"{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 26}} just as the source comics may have intended to.{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 91}}  Lichtenstein has claimed a strong relation between the original comic book source panel and Hokusai's ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', making this work a bridge between the two.{{Sfn | Rondeau | Wagstaff | 2012 | p = 48}}  The adaptation of the wave print is said to add a decorative look and feel to the painting, without which the work might be much more alarming to the viewer.&lt;ref name= RLJH34&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein| last =Hendrickson | first = Janis|publisher=[[Benedikt Taschen]] |year= 1993 | isbn = 3-8228-9633-0 |page=34|chapter = The Pictures That Lichtenstein Made Famous, or The Pictures That Made Lichtenstein Famous}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein even made the connection between ''Drowning Girl'''s arabesque waves and "the Art Nouveau aesthetic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Retro: The Culture of Revival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2d8J08XNdKEC&amp;pg=PA66 |accessdate=June 6, 2013|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]| last =Guffey | first = Elizabeth E.|isbn=1-86189-290-X|year= 2006 | pages =66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this work, Lichtenstein stated:
{{Quote |text=In the ''Drowning Girl'' the water is not only Art Nouveau, but it can also be seen as Hokusai. I don't do it just because it is  another reference. Cartooning itself sometimes resembles other periods in art&amp;nbsp;– perhaps unknowingly&amp;nbsp;... They do things like the little Hokusai waves in the ''Drowning Girl''.

Tøjner describes the work as "Lichtenstein's finest formulation of a counter-image to the many explosions in his universe", noting that the drama is past its peak although it may seem to be at a crescendo.&lt;ref name=RLAAA19/&gt; He also notes that "the tears are drawn with classic Lichtenstein waxy fullness" despite the surrounding water, which must be significant since "naturalistic justification" is absent.&lt;ref name=RLAAA19/&gt; A November 1963 ''Art Magazine'' review stated that this was one of the "broad and powerful paintings" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery.&lt;ref name=RLOF4/&gt; Nonetheless, the name of the work was not universally known.  In a December 1964 ''Art Magazine'' review of his October 24&amp;nbsp;– September 19, 1964 Castelli Gallery show, Lichtenstein was referred to as the author of ''I Don't Care, I'd Rather Sink'' (''Drowning Girl'').&lt;ref name=RLOF4/&gt; According to Gary Garrels of the Museum of Modern Art, the work is a "poetics of the utterly banal, of displaced ordinariness" resulting in an "image frozen in time and space", making it "iconic".&lt;ref name =DftM&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aFikE_v1OJIC&amp;pg=PA28 |title = Drawing from the Modern: 1945–1975|volume=2|page=28|accessdate = June 6, 2013 |year=2005|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]| last =Garrels | first = Gary|isbn=0-87070-664-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing this to the source, Garrels says it is a rendering "in a simplified vocabulary" produced while Lichtenstein put aside his mechanical objectivity.&lt;ref name=DftM /&gt; According to ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art'', extreme examples of his formalization become "virtual abstraction" when the viewer recalls that the motif is an element of a larger work. Thus, Lichtenstein reinforced a non-realist view of comic strips and advertisements, presenting them as artificial images with minimalistic graphic techniques. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material stressed the plainness of his motifs as an equivalent to mechanical commercial drawing, leading to implications about his statements on modern industrial America. Nonetheless, Lichtenstein appears to have accepted the American capitalist industrial culture.&lt;ref name =TGEoAA /&gt;

Lanchner wrote of how Lichtenstein's translation of a "highly charged" content with coolly handled presentation intensified the contrast between the two.&lt;ref name=RLMoMA/&gt; While contrasting Lichtenstein's [[Ben-Day dots]] use in ''Drowning Girl'' with another artist's work, Sarah Rich and Joyce Henri Robinson note that the work "satirizes the melodrama of soap operas and serial comics, turning the drama of the title figure's potential suicide into a high camp performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmkJe9li2BgC&amp;pg=PA13|title=Through the Looking Glass: Women and Self-Representation in Contemporary Art|accessdate = June 7, 2013 |publisher=[[Palmer Museum of Art]]|year=2003| last1 =Rich | first1 = Sarah | first2 = Joyce Henri | last2 = Robinson|isbn = 0-911209-60-3 | page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Eclogue of Theodulus''''' was a [[Latin]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] dialogue, which became a standard school text of the [[Middle Ages]]. Scholarship generally dates it to the 10th century, though earlier dates are also given.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald E. Pepin, ''An English Translation of the Auctores Octo: A Medieval Reader'', Mediaeval Studies 12 (The Edwin Mellen Press, 1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;25–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is attributed to [[Gottschalk of Orbais]], and in fact the name ''Theodolus'' is the Greek translation of ''Gottschalk'' (God's slave). The poem is an argument between Alithia (truth) and Pseustis (falsehood}, with Phronesis (reason), acting as referee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9yIXeZNrDHQC&amp;pg=PA529&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;dq=%22Eclogue+of+Theodulus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=njRybYyz5m&amp;sig=KUydE-ckeis9_jlZ1rh3zrVDt9c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YfxITeXNLsW44garxKyqDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Eclogue%20of%20Theodulus%22&amp;f=false The Cambridge Medieval History]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A gloss is a marginal notation regarding the main text in a document. Shown is a parchment page from the Royal Library of Copenhagen.]]
A '''gloss''' ({{ety|la|glossa}}; {{ety|gre|''γλῶσσα'' glōssa|language}}) is a brief notation, especially a [[marginalia|marginal]] one or an [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] one, of the meaning of a word or wording in a text. It may be in the language of the text, or in the reader's language if that is different. 

A collection of glosses is a ''[[glossary]].'' A collection of medieval legal glosses, made by [[glossators]], is called an ''apparatus''. The compilation of glosses into glossaries was the beginning of [[lexicography]], and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses. The [[German Romanticism|German Romantic movement]] used the expression of gloss for poems commenting on a given other piece of poetry, often in the Spanish [[Décima]] style. 

Glosses were originally notes made in the margin or between the lines of a text in a [[classical language]]; the meaning of a word or passage is explained by the gloss. As such, glosses vary in thoroughness and complexity, from simple marginal notations of words one reader found difficult or obscure, to interlinear [[translation]]s of a text with cross references to similar passages. Today [[bracket#Parentheses|parenthetical]] explanations in [[scientific writing]] and [[technical writing]] are also often called glosses. [[Hyperlink]]s to a [[glossary]] sometimes supersede them.

==Etymology==
The word "gloss" was first used in the 1570s to refer to the insertion of a word as an explanation. It began to be used to mean to "explain away" in the 1630s, and originated from the concept of a note being inserted in the margin of a text to explain a difficult word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.etymonline.com/word/gloss|title=Gloss|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Biblical gloss}}
Glosses and other marginal notes were a primary format used in medieval Biblical [[theology]], and were studied and memorized for their own merit. Many Biblical passages came to be associated with a particular gloss, whose truth was taken to be scriptural. Indeed, in one case, it is generally reckoned that an early gloss explicating the doctrine of the Trinity made its way into the Scriptural text itself, in the passage known as the "three heavenly witnesses" or the ''[[Comma Johanneum]]'', which is present in the Vulgate Latin and the third and later editions of the Greek [[Textus Receptus]] collated by Erasmus (the first two editions excluded it for lack of manuscript evidence), but is absent from all modern critical reconstructions of the New Testament text, such as [[Westcott and Hort]], [[Tischendorf]], and [[Nestle-Aland]].

==In law==
{{See also|Glossator}}
In the medieval legal tradition, the glosses on [[Roman law]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] created standards of reference, so-called ''sedes materiae'' (literally: seat of the matter). In [[common law]] countries, the term "judicial gloss" refers to what is considered an authoritative or "official" [[Statutory interpretation|interpretation]] of a statute or regulation by a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial glosses are often very important in avoiding contradictions between statutes, and determining the [[constitutionality]] of various provisions of law.

==In literature==
A gloss, or ''glosa'', is a verse in traditional [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] literature and music which follows and comments on a refrain (the "''mote''"). See also [[villancico]].

==In philology==
[[Image:Codiceemil.jpg|thumb|The [[Glosas Emilianenses]] are glosses added to this Latin codex that are now considered the first phrases written in the [[Castilian language]].]]
Glosses are of some importance in [[philology]], especially if one language&amp;mdash;usually, the language of the author of the gloss&amp;mdash;has left few texts of its own. The [[Reichenau Glosses]], for example, gloss the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] [[Bible]] in an early form of one of the [[Romance languages]], and as such give insight into late [[Vulgar Latin]] at a time when that language was not often written down. A series of glosses in the [[Old English language]] to Latin Bibles give us a running translation of Biblical texts in that language; see ''[[Old English Bible translations]]''. Glosses of Christian religious texts are also important for our knowledge of [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. Glosses frequently shed valuable light on the vocabulary of otherwise little attested languages; they are less reliable for [[syntax]], because many times the glosses follow the word order of the original text, and translate its [[idiom]]s literally.

==In linguistics{{anchor|In linguistics}}==
{{Main|Interlinear gloss}}
In [[linguistics]], a simple gloss in running text may be marked by quotation marks and follow the transcription of a foreign word. Single quotes are a widely used convention.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle. 2004. ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; For example: 

* A [[Cossack]] longboat is called a ''chaika'' 'seagull'.
* The [[moose]] gains its name from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] ''mus'' or ''mooz'' ('twig eater').

A longer or more complex transcription may rely upon an ''[[interlinear gloss]]''.  Such a gloss may be placed between a [[text corpus|text]] and its translation when it is important to understand the structure of the language being glossed, and not just the overall meaning of the passage.

===Glossing sign languages{{anchor|Glossing signed languages}}{{anchor|Glossing sign languages}}===
[[Sign language]]s are typically transcribed word-for-word by means of a gloss written in the predominant oral language in all capitals; [[American Sign Language]] and [[Auslan]] would be written in English. [[Prosody (linguistics)|Prosody]] is often glossed as superscript words, with its scope indicated by brackets. 

{{quotation|[I LIKE]&lt;sup&gt;NEGATIVE&lt;/sup&gt; [WHAT?]&lt;sup&gt;RHETORICAL&lt;/sup&gt;, GARLIC.
&lt;br&gt;"I don't like garlic."}}

Pure [[fingerspelling]] is usually indicated by hyphenation.  Fingerspelled words that have been lexicalized (that is, fingerspelling sequences that have entered the sign language as linguistic units and that often have slight modifications) are indicated with a hash.  For example, ''W-I-K-I'' indicates a simple fingerspelled word, but ''#JOB'' indicates a lexicalized unit, produced like ''J-O-B'', but faster, with a barely perceptible ''O'' and turning the "B" hand palm side in, unlike a regularly fingerspelled "B".

'''Katolophyromai''' ({{lang-el|κατολοφύρομαι}}), is the headword in a musical fragment from the first [[stasimon]] of ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'' by [[Euripides]] (lines 338-344, Vienna Papyrus G 2315). It means "I cry, lament so much." In 1892, among a number of papyri from [[Hermopolis]], Egypt, in the collection of [[Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria]], a fragment was discovered and published&lt;ref&gt;Mitteilungen aus der Sammlung der Papyrus Erzherzog Rainer vol. 5 part 3&lt;/ref&gt; by the papyrologist [[Karl Wessely]], containing a mutilated passage with [[musical notation]]. Although Vienna Papyrus G 2315 dates to the third century B.C., the melody recorded on it may have been written much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Mathiesen (1999) places it about 125 years after the death of Euripides. Cambridge University Press (1928) in the Augustan age.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The full text of the musical fragment reads as follows:
{{quote|{{lang|grc|κατολοφύρομαι, κατολοφύρομαι&lt;br/&gt;ματέρος αἷμα σᾶς, ὅ σ’ ἀναβακχεύει,&lt;br/&gt;ὁ μέγας ὄλβος οὐ μόνιμος ἐν βροτοῖς,&lt;br/&gt;ἀνὰ δὲ λαῖφος ὥς τις ἀκάτου θοᾶς τινάξας δαίμων&lt;br/&gt;κατέκλυσεν δεινῶν πόνων ὡς πόντου&lt;br/&gt;λάβροις ὀλεθρίοισιν ἐν κύμασιν}}
:[I cry, I cry, your mother’s blood that drives you mad, great happiness in mortals never lasting, but like a sail of a swift ship, which a god shook up and plunged it with terrible troubles into the greedy and deadly waves of sea.]}}

The arrangement of the fragmentary text differs from the traditional editions, in which the lines begin with {{lang|grc|ματέρος αἷμα}} (mother’s blood) and {{lang|grc|κατολοφύρομαι}} appears after {{lang|grc|βροτοῖς}} (mortals). Unlike other fragments, however, the text and musical notations are quite well preserved.

==Poetic features==
The [[Meter (poetry)|rhythm]] of the song is [[catalectic]] [[trochaic tetrameter]] and the ''tónos'' or ''trópos'' is [[Lydian mode|Lydian]]. The preserved vocal notes coincide with the Ancient Doric or Phrygian ''harmonia'' transmitted by [[Aristides Quintilianus]],&lt;ref&gt;Aristides Quintilianus. ''On Music'' 1.18 and 2.80. https://books.google.com/books?id=8xS_ky1OhqAC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392&amp;dq=Aristides+Quintilianus+On+Music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wx0nTNxSRn&amp;sig=os9mEJO5UimjIGM7Qx4oMhaiiwM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihv6zJ5eXRAhXs24MKHfhhCoYQ6AEISDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristides%20Quintilianus%20On%20Music&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; the Damon ''harmoniai'', in [[enharmonic genus]], which was usual in tragedy of fifth century BC.

==Authorship==
Whether this fragment represents the original music Euripides composed in 408 BC is an open question, given also the absence of 5th century BC musical inscriptions. Nevertheless, there is some evidence in favour of the authenticity. [[Psellus]] and [[Plutarch]] credit Euripides and [[Agathon]] with the introduction of chromatic genus and the fragment accords with it but also with observations of [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Aristophanes]] about the complexity of Euripidean style, which appear in the source: alteration of textual rhythm, reduplication of syllables and chromatic or disjunct musical lines. If the Hellenistic and Roman era musicians and musicologists imitated and reproduced the Classical works the same way librarians, grammarians, [[Atticist]]s did for literature, this would be another argument or point of further discussion.

{{italic title}}
'''''Locus amoenus''''' ([[Latin]] for "pleasant place") is a [[literary topos]] involving an [[utopia|idealized place]] of safety or comfort. A ''locus amoenus'' is usually a beautiful, shady lawn or open woodland, or a group of idyllic islands, sometimes with connotations of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] or [[Elysium]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Russell, ''A History of Heaven'' (1998) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Robert Curtius]] wrote the concept's definitive formulation in his ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' (1953) p. 183-202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Maerten Ryckaert - Rocky Pastoral Landscape - WGA20594.jpg|thumb|Maerten Ryckaert, ''Rocky Pastoral Landscape'']]
A ''locus amoenus'' will have three basic elements: trees, grass, and water. Often, the garden will be in a remote place and function as a landscape of the mind. It can also be used to highlight the differences between urban and rural life or be a place of refuge from the processes of time and mortality. 

In some works, such gardens also have overtones of the regenerative powers of [[human sexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see [https://archive.org/details/paradicesonlymap00osma   Evett, David. "Paradice's Only Map": The "Topos" of the "Locus Amoenus" and the Structure of Marvell's "Upon Appleton House." PMLA. 85.3(1970):504-513.]&lt;/ref&gt; marked out by flowers, springtime, and goddesses of love and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;W. Shullenberger, ''Lady in the Labyrinth'' (2008) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Classical===

The literary use of this type of setting goes back, in Western literature at least, to [[Homer]],&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Russell, ''A History of Heaven'' (1998) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and it became a staple of the [[pastoral]] works of poets such as [[Theocritus]] and [[Virgil]]. [[Horace]] (''[[Ars poetica]]'', 17) and the commentators on Virgil, such as [[Servius]], recognize that descriptions of ''loci amoeni'' have become a rhetorical commonplace.

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', the function of the ''locus amoenus'' is inverted, to form the "locus terribilis". Instead of offering a respite from dangers, it is itself usually the scene of violent encounters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~zuern/demo/explication/loc/locus1.html  John David Zuern, "Locus Amoenus"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
The Middle Ages merged the classical ''locus amoenus'' with biblical imagery, as from the [[Song of Songs]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Shullenberger, ''Lady in the Labyrinth'' (2008) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew of Vendôme]] provided multiple accounts of how to describe the ''locus amoenus'',&lt;ref&gt;H. Pleij, ''Dreaming of Cockaigne'' (2013) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Dante]] drew on the [[Literary topos|commonplace]] for his description of the Earthly Paradise: "Here spring is endless, here all fruits are."&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
[[File:Deverell Walter Howard A Scene from As You Like It.jpg|thumb|Characters in the Forest of Arden in Shakespeare's ''As You Like It'']]
The ''locus amoenus'' was a popular theme in the works of such Renaissance figures as [[Ariosto]] and [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Shullenberger, ''Lady in the Labyrinth'' (2008) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakespeare]] made good use of the ''locus amoenus'' in his long poem ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;P. Cheney, ''Shakespeare, National Poet-Playwright'' (2004) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The trope also fed into his construction, in many plays, of what [[Northrop Frye]] has called the Shakespearean "green world" – a space that lies outside of city limits, a [[Liminality|liminal]] space where erotic passions can be freely explored, away from civilization and the social order – such as the Forest of Arden in ''[[As You Like It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Shurbanov, ''Shakespeare's Lyricized Drama'' (2010) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; A mysterious and dark, feminine place, as opposed to the rigid masculine civil structure, the green world can also be found featured in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''  and ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''.{{fact|date=September 2011}}

===Modern===
In the 20th century the ''locus amoenus'' appears in the work of [[T. S. Eliot]], as in the Rose Garden of ''[[Burnt Norton]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (1973) p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Neset, ''Arcadian Waters and Wanton Seas'' (2009) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lothlórien]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''J. R. R. Tolkien'' (2001) p. 196-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sinister doubles==
The [[Splitting (psychology)|split-off]] obverse of the ''locus amoenus'' is the apparently delectable but in fact treacherous garden, often linked to a malign sexuality, as in [[Circe]]'s palace or the Bower of Bliss in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (1971) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alcornoques.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Cork oaks]]
'''Los Alcornocales Natural Park''' (in Spanish, '''Parque natural de Los Alcornocales''') is a [[natural park (Spain)|natural park]] located in the south of [[Spain]], in the autonomous community of [[Andalusia]]; it is shared between the provinces of [[Cádiz (province)|Cádiz]] and [[Málaga (province)|Málaga]]. The natural park occupies a territory spanning seventeen municipalities with a total population of about 380,000.  "Los Alcornocales" means "the cork oak groves". 

Nearly all of the uninhabited land in the park is covered by Mediterranean native forest. While some of the land has been cleared for cattle ranches, much of the human activity in the park is devoted to exploitation of the forest's resources: [[hunting]] wild game, collecting [[Mushroom hunting|wild mushrooms]], and foraging for good specimens of [[tree heath]]. 
The tree heath (''Erica arborea'', called "brezos" in Spanish) is a small evergreen shrub, rarely more than two or three meters high; it is the source of the reddish briar-root wood used in making tobacco pipes, and its wood is excellent raw material for making [[charcoal]].

Above all, however, the park's forests are exploited for the production of [[Cork (material)|cork]].  The [[cork oak]] (''Quercus suber'') is a tree with a spongy layer of material lying between the outer surface of its bark and the underlying living layer called the ''[[phloem]]'' (which, in turn, encloses the non-living woody stem.)  Cork is generated by a specialized layer of tissue called ''[[cork cambium]]''.  Properly done, harvesting cork from a given tree can be undertaken every ten to twelve years without damaging the tree; the cork cambium simply regenerates it. Cork has many commercial uses, including wine-bottle stoppers, bulletin boards, coasters, insulation, sealing material for jar lids, flooring, gaskets for engines, fishing bobbers, handles for fishing rods and tennis rackets, etc.

==Climate==
Given the geographic position of Los Alcornocales, the dominant climate in the zone is, logically, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], but a series of factors contribute to its uniqueness. Its close proximity to the sea helps keep the temperature relatively mild all year long. The average rainfall usually reaches over 800 L/m², with certain zones receiving more than 1,400 L/m² thanks to the ocean front. In the mountain ranges to the south, there are great fogs known as the ''barbas del Levante'' (the beards of the east wind). These fogs provide the humidity to form precipitation during the long dry seasons that usually characterize Mediterranean climates. The strong East wind is known as El Levante, and is associated with high temperatures.  The wind from the West, which frequently brings rain, is known as El Poniente. These winds make this area one of the best places to construct [[wind farm]]s in all of Spain.

==Flora==
[[Image:Korkeiche Andalusien2004.jpg|thumb|Trunk of a cork tree]]
The park is characterized by the most extensive forest of cork in Spain and one of the largest in the world. In contrast to the mountains of cork in other latitudes where the tree density is low, in this zone the trees form an authentic forest with a rich variety of shrub and herbaceous vegetation intimately connected.  This assures a natural regeneration of the forest, a good mix of ages, and a high level of floral and animal [[biodiversity]].

Forests and smaller wooded areas within the park are comprised mainly by [[Cork oak|cork oaks]] (''Quercus suber''), [[Portuguese oak|Portuguese oaks]] (''Quercus faginea''), [[Pyrenean oak]]s (''Quercus pyrenaica''), [[Olive|olive trees]] (''Olea europaea''), [[alder]]s (''Alnus glutinosa''), [[Holly|holly trees]] (''Ilex aquifolium''), [[Bay laurel|bay laurels]] (''Laurus nobilis''), [[Rhododendron ponticum|rhododendrons]] (''Rhododendron ponticum''), [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, and [[lichen]]s.

==History==

The cork oak groves of Los Alcornocales are situated in a strategic place.  They sit astride two important axes, one an east-west axis, the other north-south.  The land here has allegiances to both the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; similarly, it forms the throat of a bridge between [[Europe]] and [[Africa]], a bridge broken only by the narrow [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. Its geographic position is the circumstance, as much as its climate, topography, or suitability for agriculture, that has dictated its patrimony.

[[Image:CorchoAlcornocales.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Cork collected from oaks]]
The area has been populated for tens of thousands of years. This is attested by the presence of archaeological remnants of settlements by [[Neanderthal]]s dating back more than thirty thousand years, as well as stone implements, engravings, and cave paintings from both the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] ages. Of the greatest interest to visitors, however, are the Bronze Age cave dwellings that dot the area. Of more than fifty caves discovered so far, there are three that have special artistic value: the Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras (Cave of the Figures on the Precipice), which has been compared to the [[Sistine Chapel]] among examples of cave art; the Cave of the High Laja, that houses pictures of the earliest-known boats to ply the Mediterranean; and the [[Cave of Bacinete]], with more than a hundred pictographic representations in a magnificent state of conservation. 

Later in history, a succession of civilizations and cultures, one superimposed on the next, has dominated this area, all of whom have contributed to its ethnological character. Each has left its marks on the landscape; there are megalíthic monuments, Iberian, Phoenician, and Roman ruins, Arab strongholds, etc. Many of the towns that today comprise the park reached their highest state of civilization during the Muslim [[Nasrid dynasty]], when this area was on the western fringe of the [[Kingdom of Granada]]. Today, in this area, many examples of the architecture introduced during the period of Muslim occupation survive; among them are the unique [[White Towns of Andalusia]]. [[Jimena de la Frontera]], [[Castellar de la Frontera]], and [[Medina Sidonia]] are magnificent examples.

==Caves==
The '''Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras''', located near the town of [[Benalup-Casas Viejas]], belongs to the group of paleolithic and neolithic sites in southern [[Spain]] that have examples of rock art that the Spanish call "[[art sureño]]" (southern art). In 1913, [[Juan Cabré]] and [[Eduardo Hernández-Pacheco]] began the first systematic studies of "art sureño" at this cave. The paintings are mostly representations of birds and odd four-footed man-like figures dating from neolithic times.
[[Image:Tajo-x.jpg|left|thumb|Cave painting of deer at Tajo de las Figuras]]

In 1924 the ''Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras'' was declared an Artistic Architectonic Monument by the Spanish state.  For several decades, in order that visitors might better able to discern the paintings on the wall, tour guides have repeatedly sprayed water on them.  This practice has resulted in the deposition of layers of lime on the paintings.  Beginning in 2005, an effort to restore them was undertaken.

==The ecological disaster at La Janda==
[[Image:Grus grus 1 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|250px|right|thumb|A Eurasian crane]]
Near the ''Cueva del Tajo de las Figuras'' was the ancient ''Laguna de la Janda'', a haven where millions of birds, both resident and migratory species, found a suitable habitat for feeding and reproduction. Unfortunately, during the middle part of the twentieth century, this important ecological niche was destroyed.  To support local rice-growing, water from the lagoon and its associated fresh-water wetlands was diverted, and the area dried up almost completely.  In the process, the last reproductive Spanish population of the [[Common crane|Eurasian crane]] (''Grus grus'') was lost as well.

==Towns and cities within the park==

[[Image:RutaMolinos.jpg|thumb|Path near [[Alcalá de los Gazules]]]]
All or part of sixteen municipalities of the [[Cádiz (province)|Province of Cádiz]] lie within the Natural Park of Los Alcornocales : [[Alcalá de los Gazules]], [[Algar, Cádiz|Algar]], [[Algeciras]], [[Arcos de la Frontera]], [[Benalup-Casas Viejas]], [[Benaocaz]], [[Castellar de la Frontera]], [[El Bosque, Cádiz|El Bosque]], [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Jimena de la Frontera]], [[Los Barrios]], [[Medina-Sidonia]], [[Prado del Rey]], [[San José del Valle]], [[Tarifa]] and [[Ubrique]]. Likewise, there is one town in Málaga province, [[Cortes de la Frontera]], that has land within park boundaries. There are lots of paths connecting these municipalities, nowadays used for [[hiking]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2524">'''Los Cinco Pintores''' ("The Five Painters") was a group of early 20th-century artists in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] that included [[William Howard Shuster|Will Shuster]], [[Fremont Ellis]], [[Walter Mruk]], [[Jozef Bakos]], and [[Willard Nash]].

By 1921, Shuster, Ellis, Mruk, Bakos, and Nash had all moved to Santa Fe, and the five formed their [[artist collective]] in 1921. At the time, the five painters were all in their 20s and new to Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Edna|title=Los Cinco Pintores|year=1975|publisher=Museum of New Mexico Press|location=Santa Fe|isbn=0-89013-080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their stated goal was to "take art to the people" by exhibiting in places such as schools, hospitals, factories, and even the [[New Mexico Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hold Art in a Penitentiary|journal=American Art News|date=January 7, 1922|volume=20|issue=13|page=4|jstor=25589890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December of that year, the [[New Mexico Museum of Art]] presented the first of several exhibitions as a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schimmel|first1=Julie|title=Art in New Mexico, 1900-1945 Paths to Taos and Santa Fr|date=1986|publisher=National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=0-89659-598-6|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their Midwestern Touring Exhibit in 1922, they also arranged a show in Los Angeles in 1923 call "Exhibition of Painting by Artists of New Mexico".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewandowski|first1=Stacia|title=Light, Landscape and the Creative Quest : Early Artists of Santa Fe|date=2011|publisher=Salska Arts|location=New Mexico|isbn=9780615469171|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[modern art|modernist]] painters were inspired by [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] people and landscapes for their subject matter. They formally disbanded in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Traugott|first1=Joseph|title=New Mexico Art Through Time : Prehistory to the Present|date=2012|publisher=Museum of New Mexico Press|location=Santa Fe|isbn=9780890135457|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Los Restos Indígenas de Pichilemu''''' (''The Indigenous Remains of Pichilemu'') was a 1908 book published by [[Chilean people|Chilean]] [[historiographer]] [[José Toribio Medina]].

Medina presents a report of his examination to indigenous rests found in a [[Pichilemu]] grotto (currently named ''Virgin's Grotto''—{{lang-es|Gruta de la Virgen}}) by [[Agustín Ross]] and Evaristo Merino in 1908. The book contains two sheets, that show some tools that [[Promoucae]]s indigenous used.

A '''luminogram''' is an image created by exposure of [[photosensitive]] materials to light without the intervention of an object.

==Technique==
The light is modulated by varying the intensity through distance from the photosensitive surface, the power of the light source, or by the use of filters or gels or motion of the light.  The paper can itself be shaped to create the desired effects in the final image.  Many of [[László Moholy-Nagy]]'s [[photogram]]s were luminograms. The image is created by variations in light shape and intensity. They can be created using a small light source, as from a flashlight, that is moved to expose the photosensitive [[substrate (printing)|substrate]]. Moholy-Nagy used this technique to create many of his photograms.
Gottfried Jäger (photographic theorist) describes this as "the result of pure light design; the rudimentary expression of an interaction of light and photosensitive material… a kind of self representation of light."

==Luminograms: then and now==

'''[[László Moholy-Nagy]]''' (1895-1946), American, born in Austria-Hungary (in Bacsborsod).  Moved to Vienna in late 1919 after serving in the Austro-Hungarian army.
In 1919 he and his wife Lucia Moholy began experimenting with the process of making photograms, and Lucia Moholy (Czechoslovakia) developed a technique they called the photogram.

Moholy-Nagy produced photogram and luminogram images from 1922 in Berlin continuously until his death in 1946. 
Chronologically they can be considered from three groups of images: 
Berlin Bauhaus period (1923-1928), 
his period of exile in London (1935-1937), 
and the United States (1937-1946). [http://www.fundaciotapies.org/site/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=471]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
Moholy-Nagy considered the "mysteries" of the light effects and the analysis of space as experienced through the photogram to be important principles that he experimentally explored and advanced in his teaching throughout his life. [László Moholy-Nagy, Vision in Motion (1947)]. 
Moholy-Nagy's luminograms are completely about light and design. Moholy-Nagy approached the light sensitive photographic paper as a blank canvas and used light to literally paint on the surface with and without the interference of an intervening object. (Andreas Haus, "Laszló Moholy-Nagy, Photographs and Photograms," Pantheon Books, 1980, translation from the German by Frederick Sanson  pp 51–52)
 
'''Jo Bradford''' (born 1972), Contemporary Visual Artist, specialising in contemporary colour reversal luminograms, [[cliché verre]] and [[photogram]]s.  Born Hertfordshire, UK, Lives &amp; works in Cornwall, UK.  Graduated [[University College Falmouth]] (with Distinction) MA: Photographic Critical Practice, 2004. Bradford creates Colour Luminograms, sometimes referred to as Lumigrams.  Works in private studio darkroom, exhibits regularly.  Bradford originated as a member of the "Seeing The Light" stable of photographic artists, including Jonathan Shaw, in the early 2000s, under the wing of "Seeing the Light" company director, Rhonda Wilson MBE.

Bradfords work and that of Martina Corry grow out of spontaneity of hand and arm movement, paradoxically disciplined by an imposed compositional order. Masks are placed where the light should not reach and make its mark, during each distinct exposure period. It is in the distance from the surface and the speed and direction of the movement that the work is allowed to be spontaneous.  Debate surrounds the fact that some of the works by all of these artist could be classed as cliché verre - a contemporary re-visioning of an older process, the technique was popular in the 1850s with such French artists as Camille Corot, Jean-François Millet, Théodore Rousseau, and Eugène Delacroix. The most prominent 20th-century exponent of cliché-verre was the Hungarian-American designer [[György Kepes]], and the technique was also explored by [[Joan Fontcuberta]] in his "Frottogram" series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jca-online.com/fontcuberta.html Joan Fontcuberta (interview with A. D. Coleman).] ''Journal of Contemporary Art'' 1991;4(1):34-48. Retrieved 10 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martina Corry''' is a visual artist, living and working in Ireland, within the field of photography, she graduated from the University of Ulster in 1999 with an MFA (with Distinction) specialising in photography.  She creates black and white luminograms often presented on aluminium, which have been exhibited in Ireland.  These black and white works are more akin to the earlier works of Moholy-Nagy than the more contemporary colour work of Bradford and Rob and Nick Carter

'''Rob and Nick Carter's''' luminogram work are in the medium of Cibachrome, the Carters have spent a decade of experimenting with the photogram, on the border of painting and photography.  The colour modulations are orientated around blue, green, orange and purple and developed out of the artists' fascination with the orange/blue complementarity of Goethe's colour circle.

'''Jon Lybrook''' of Colorado, USA has been making luminograms since the early 1990s.  Inspired by the work of avant-garde filmmaker [[Stan Brakhage]], [http://chronosynthesis.com/jon-lybrook.html Jon Lybrook's] [http://lytescapes.com Lytescapes Series] of luminograms combine painting and photography, employing ortho-chromatic graphics art film, custom photo chemicals, and a variety of masking techniques.

'''Mike Jackson''' (born 1966) is a British experimental and fine art photographer based in North Dorset, England. He moved away from working with traditional camera techniques in 2015 and is currently progressing the Luminogram process into new directions in which he has become regarded as a leading practitioner.
Past awards and accolades include being named a Finalist for the Hasselblad Masters Award (2008, 2009, 2010) and winner of the 2013 Chris Beetles Award.
His work has been exhibited internationally and is part of various private collections. His work with the Luminogram process is based around the concept of 'sculpting light' for photographic paper to 'translate' into form.  He has been quoted as saying that the Luminogram process allows him to use nature as a reference rather than as a subject from which to copy.

[[File:Dansende Marieke.JPG|thumb|Marieke]]

'''''Marieke''''' is a 1988 statue in [[Bruges]], designed by [[Jef Claerhout]]. It is a homage to [[Jacques Brel]]'s famous song "[[Marieke (song)|Marieke]]". &lt;ref&gt;https://zoeken.erfgoedbrugge.be/resultaten.php?nav_id=0-0&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.erfgoedcelbrugge.be/images/filelib/coupure_746.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://kw.knack.be/west-vlaanderen/nieuws/standbeeld-marieke-gehuldigd/article-normal-150031.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The statue was built at the request of journalist and Brel fan [[Johan Anthierens]]. It was revealed in 23 July 1988 by mayor [[Frank Van Acker]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://zoeken.erfgoedbrugge.be/resultaten.php?nav_id=0-0&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.erfgoedcelbrugge.be/images/filelib/coupure_746.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://kw.knack.be/west-vlaanderen/nieuws/standbeeld-marieke-gehuldigd/article-normal-150031.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2012 the statue was clothed with knitted sleeves by anonymous pranksters. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/ps3ljkmk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statue==
The statue is located at the Coupure in [[Bruges]]. It depicts a young woman, Marieke, who lived "between the towers of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]" according to Brel's song of the same name. &lt;ref&gt;https://zoeken.erfgoedbrugge.be/resultaten.php?nav_id=0-0&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.erfgoedcelbrugge.be/images/filelib/coupure_746.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[poetry]], the term '''monody''' has become specialized to refer to a poem in which one person laments another's death.  (In the context of [[ancient Greek literature]], monody, {{lang|grc|μονῳδία}} could simply refer to lyric poetry sung by a single performer, rather than by a [[Greek chorus|chorus]].)

In music, '''monody''' refers to a solo vocal style distinguished by having a single [[melody|melodic]] line and instrumental accompaniment. Although such music is found in various cultures throughout history, the term is specifically applied to [[Italy|Italian]] song of the early 17th century, particularly the period from about 1600 to 1640. The term is used both for the style and for individual songs (so one can speak both of monody as a whole as well as a particular monody). The term itself is a recent invention of scholars. No composer of the 17th century ever called a piece a monody.  Compositions in monodic form might be called [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]], [[motet]]s, or even [[concerto]]s (in the earlier sense of "[[concertato]]", meaning "with instruments").

In monody, which developed out of an attempt by the [[Florentine Camerata]] in the 1580s to restore [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ideas of melody and declamation (probably with little historical accuracy), one solo voice sings a melodic part, usually with considerable [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], over a rhythmically independent bass line.  Accompanying instruments could be [[lute]], [[chitarrone]], [[theorbo]], [[harpsichord]], [[Organ (music)|organ]], and even on occasion [[guitar]].  While some monodies were arrangements for smaller forces of the music for large ensembles which was common at the end of the 16th century, especially in the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], most monodies were composed independently.  The development of monody was one of the defining characteristics of early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] practice, as opposed to late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] style, in which groups of voices sang independently and with a greater balance between parts.

Other musical streams which came together in the monody were the madrigal and the motet, both of which developed into solo forms after 1600 and borrowed ideas from the monody.

Contrasting passages in monodies could be more melodic or more declamatory:  these two styles of presentation eventually developed into the [[aria]] and the [[recitative]], and the overall form merged with the [[cantata]] by about 1635.

The parallel development of solo song with accompaniment in [[France]] was called the ''[[air de cour]]'':  the term monody is not normally applied to these more conservative songs, however, which retained many musical characteristics of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] ''[[chanson]]''.

An important early treatise on monody is contained in [[Giulio Caccini]]'s song collection, ''[[Le nuove musiche]]'' (Florence, 1601).

{{Apartheid}}

The [[apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]] began in 1948 and lasted until 1994. It involved a harsh system of [[racial segregation]], and placed all political power in the hands of a [[White South African|white minority]].&lt;ref name=grundlingh/&gt; Opposition to apartheid manifested in a variety of ways, including boycotts, non-violent protests, and armed resistance.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012"/&gt; Music played a large role in the [[Internal resistance to apartheid|movement against apartheid]] within South Africa, as well as in international opposition to apartheid.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=153}}&lt;ref name=Jolaosho&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jolaosho|first=Tayo|url=http://www.folkways.si.edu/magazine-spring-2014-anti-apartheid-freedom-songs-then-and-now/south-africa/music/article/smithsonian |title=Anti-Apartheid Freedom Songs Then and Now|journal=Folkways Magazine |publisher=Smithsonian |date= |accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impacts of songs opposing apartheid included raising awareness, generating support for the movement against apartheid, building unity within this movement, and "presenting an alternative vision of culture in a future democratic South Africa."{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=435–436}}

The lyrical content and tone of this music reflected the atmosphere that it was composed in. The protest music of the 1950s, soon after apartheid had begun, explicitly addressed peoples' grievances over [[pass laws]] and forced relocation. Following the [[Sharpeville massacre]] in 1960 and the arrest or exile of a number of leaders, songs became more downbeat, while increasing censorship forced them to use subtle and hidden meanings.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–39}} Songs and performance also allowed people to circumvent the more stringent restrictions on other forms of expression.&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt; At the same time, songs played a role in the more militant resistance that began in the 1960s. The [[Soweto uprising]] in 1976 led to a renaissance, with songs such as "[[Soweto Blues]]" encouraging a more direct challenge to the apartheid government. This trend which intensified into the 1980s, with racially mixed fusion bands testing the laws of apartheid, before these were dismantled with the release of [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1990 and the eventual restoration of majority rule in 1994.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–39}} Through its history, anti-apartheid music within South Africa faced significant censorship from the government, both directly and via the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]]; additionally, musicians opposing the government faced threats, harassment, and arrests.

Musicians from other countries also participated in the resistance to apartheid, both by releasing music critical of the South African government, and by participating in a cultural boycott of South Africa from 1980 onward. Examples included "[[Biko (song)|Biko]]" by [[Peter Gabriel]], "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]" by [[Artists United Against Apartheid]] and a [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute|concert in honour of Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday]]. Prominent South African musicians such as [[Miriam Makeba]] and [[Hugh Masekela]], forced into exile, also released music critical of apartheid, and this music had a significant impact on Western popular culture, contributing to the "moral outrage" over apartheid.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–20}} Scholars have stated that anti-apartheid music within South Africa, although it received less attention worldwide, played an equally important role in putting pressure on the South African government.

==Background and origins==
{{Further information|Apartheid}}
Racial segregation in South Africa had begun with the arrival of Dutch colonists in South Africa in 1652, and continued through centuries of British rule thereafter.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2002/&gt; Racial separation increased greatly after the British took complete control over South Africa in the late 19th century, and passed a number of laws early in the 1900s to separate racial groups.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012"/&gt; The 1923  [[Natives Urban Areas Act|Natives (Urban Areas) Act]] forced black South Africans to leave cities unless they were there to work for white people, and excluded them from any role in the government.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012"/&gt; The system of [[apartheid]] was implemented by the [[Afrikaner]] [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) after they were voted into power in 1948, and remained in place for 46 years. The [[White South African|white minority]] held all political power during this time.&lt;ref name=grundlingh&gt;{{cite web|last=Grundlingh|first=Albert|title="Rocking the boat"?

There was significant resistance to this system, both within and outside South Africa. Opposition outside the country often took the form of boycotts of South Africa.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012"/&gt; Within the country, resistance ranged from loosely organised groups to tightly knit ones, and from non-violent protests to armed opposition from the [[African National Congress]].&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012"/&gt; Through this entire process, music played a large role in the resistance.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt; Music had been used in South Africa to protest racial segregation before apartheid began in 1948. The ANC had been founded in 1912, and would begin and end its meetings with its anthem "[[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]]", an early example of music in the resistance to racial segregation.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; Another such example was "iLand Act" by [[R. T. Caluza]], which protested the [[Natives Land Act, 1913|Native Land Act]], and was also adopted as an anthem by the ANC.{{sfn|Ansell|2005|p=21}} Commentator Michela Vershbow has written that the music of the movement against apartheid and racial segregation "reflected [the] widening gap" between different racial groups and was also an attempt "to communicate across it".&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; Music in South Africa had begun to have explicitly political overtones in the 1930s, as musicians tried to include African elements in their recordings and performances to make political statements.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=21–23}} In the 1940s, artists had begun to use music to criticise the state, not directly in response to racial segregation, but as a response to persecution of artists. Artists did not see their music as being directly political: [[Miriam Makeba]] would state "people say I sing politics, but what I sing is not politics, it is the truth".{{sfn|Schumann|2008|p=22}}

==South African music==
[[File:Dorothy Masuka.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Dorothy Masuka|Singer [[Dorothy Masuka]] (pictured here in 2015), who wrote "uDr. Malan Unomthetho Onzima" (Dr. Malan's Government is Harsh)]]

===1950s: Pass laws and resettlement===
As the apartheid government became more entrenched in the 1950s,{{sfn|Muller|2006|pp=70–71}} musicians came to see their music as more political in nature, led partly by a campaign of the African National Congress to increase its support.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=21–23}}  ANC activist and trade unionist [[Vuyisile Mini]] was among the pioneers of using music to protest apartheid. He penned "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" ("Watch Out, Verwoerd"), in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]. Poet [[Jeremy Cronin]] stated that Mini was the embodiment of the power that songs had built within the protect movement.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt; Mini was arrested in 1963 for "political crimes," and sentenced to death; fellow inmates described him as singing "Ndodemnyama" as he went to the gallows. The song achieved enduring popularity, being sung until well after the apartheid government had collapsed by artists such as Makeba and [[Afrika Bambaataa]].&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt; Protests songs became generally more popular during the 1950s, as a number of musicians began to voice explicit opposition to apartheid.  "uDr. Malan Unomthetho Onzima" (Dr. Malan's Government is Harsh) by [[Dorothy Masuka]] became well-known, as did a number of songs by other women composers written as part of a campaign against [[Pass laws|carrying passes]],{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=22–25}} which required black citizens to carry a document at all times showing their racial and tribal identity.{{sfn|Ansell|2005|p=78}}

In 1954 the NP government passed the [[Bantu Resettlement Act, 1954|Bantu Resettlement Act]], which, along with the 1950 [[Group Areas Act]], [[Forced displacement|forcibly moved]] millions of South Africans into townships in racially segregated zones.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; This was part of a plan to divide the country into a number of smaller regions, including tiny, impoverished [[bantustan]]s where the black people were to live.&lt;ref name=BBC2002/&gt; In 1955, the settlement of [[Sophiatown]] was destroyed, and its 60,000 inhabitants moved, many to a settlement known as [[Meadowlands, Gauteng|Meadowlands]].&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; Sophiatown had been a center of African jazz music prior to the relocation.{{sfn|Ansell|2005|pp=68–72}} The move was the inspiration for the writing of the song "[[Meadowlands (song)|Meadowlands]]", by [[Strike Vilakezi]]. As with many other songs of the time, it was popularised both within and outside the country by Miriam Makeba.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; Makeba's song "Sophiatown is Gone" also referred to the relocation from Sophiatown, as did "Bye Bye Sophiatown" by the [[Sun Valley Sisters]].{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=24–26}} Music not directly related to the movement was also often harnessed during this period: the [[South African Communist Party]] would use such music for its fundraising dances, and the song "Udumo Lwamaphoyisa" (A Strong Police Force) was sung by lookouts to provide warnings of police presence and liquor raids.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=24–26}}

===1960s: Sharpeville massacre and militancy===
[[File:Murder at Sharpeville 21 March 1960.jpg|thumb|A painting of the Sharpeville Massacre of March 1960]]

The [[Sharpeville massacre]] occurred on 21 March 1960, and in its aftermath apartheid was intensified and political dissent increasing suppressed. The ANC and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan Africanist Conference]] were banned, and 169 black leaders were tried for treason. A number of musicians, including Makeba, [[Hugh Masekela]], [[Abdullah Ibrahim]], [[Jonas Gwangwa]], [[Chris McGregor]], and [[Kippie Moeketsie]] went into exile.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=24–26}}{{sfn|Ansell|2005|p=108}} Some, such as Makeba and Masekela, began using their music to raise awareness of apartheid.&lt;ref name=Lynskey&gt;{{cite web|author=Dorian Lynskey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/06/nelson-mandela-protest-song-special-aka |title=Nelson Mandela: the triumph of the protest song|publisher=The Guardian |date=6 December 2013|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those musicians that remained found their activities constrained. The new townships that black people had been moved to lacked facilities for recreation, and large gatherings of people were banned. The South African Broadcasting Corporation tightened its broadcasting guidelines, preventing "subversive" music from being aired. A recording by Masuka referring to the killing of [[Patrice Lumumba]] led to a raid on her studio and her being declared a wanted individual, preventing her from living in South Africa for the next 30 years.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=24–27}}

The new townships that black people were moved to, despite their "dreary" nature, also inspired politically charged music, a trend which continued into the 1970s. "[[In Soweto]]" by [[The Minerals]] has been described as an "infectious celebration of a place" and of the ability of its residents to build a community there.{{sfn|Coplan|2005|p=10}} Yakhal' Inkhomo ("The Bellowing of the Bull", 1968), by Winston "Mankunku" Ngozi, was a jazz anthem that also expressed the political energy of the period. Theatrical performances incorporating music were also a feature of the townships, often narrowly avoiding censorship.{{sfn|Coplan|2005|p=10}} The cultural isolation forced by apartheid led to artists within South Africa creating local adaptations of popular genres, including rock music, soul, and jazz.{{sfn|Coplan|2005|p=10}}

As the government became increasingly harsh in its response to growing protests, the resistance shifted from being completely non-violent towards armed action.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders founded the [[uMkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), a militant wing of the ANC, which began a campaign of sabotage. During this period, music was often referred to as a "weapon of struggle."&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; Among MK members in training camps, a song called "Sobashiy'abazali" ("We Will Leave Our Parents") became very popular, invoking as it did the pain of leaving their homes.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; The [[Toyi-toyi]] chant also became popular during this period, and was frequently used to generate a sense of power among large groups to intimidate government troops.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt;

===1970s: ANC cultural groups and Soweto uprising===
[[File:Abdullah Ibrahim 06N4688.jpg|thumb|alt=Man seated at piano|Jazz pianist Abdullah Ibrahim (pictured here in 2011) composed "[[Mannenberg]]", an instrumental piece that invoked themes of freedom and cultural identity.]]
In the early 1970s, the ANC held to the belief that its primary activity was political organising, and that any cultural activity was secondary to this. This belief began to shift with the establishment of the [[Mayibuye Cultural Ensemble]] in 1975, and the [[Amandla Cultural Ensemble]] later in the 1970s.{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=424–434}} Mayibuye was established as a growing number of ANC activists argued that cultural events needed to form a part of their work, and could be used to raise awareness of apartheid, gather support, and drive political change. The group was established by ANC activists [[Barry Feinberg]] and [[Ronnie Kasrils]], who named it after the slogan ''Mayibuye iAfrika'' (Let Africa Return).{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=424–429}} The group consisted of several South African performers, and used a mixture of songs, poetry, and narrative in their performance, which described life under the apartheid government and their struggle against it. The songs were often performed in three- or four-part [[harmony]].{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=424–429}} The group performed more than 200 times across Europe, and were seen as the cultural arm of the ANC. The group experienced personal and organisational difficulties, and disbanded in 1980.{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=424–429}}

In 1976 the government of South Africa decided to implement the use of [[Afrikaans]] as the medium of instruction in all schools instead of English. In response, high school students began a series of protests that came to be known as the [[Soweto Uprising]].&lt;ref name=BBC2002/&gt; 15,000–20,000 students took part; the police, caught unprepared, opened fire on the protesting children.{{sfn|Muller|2006|pp=74–75}}{{sfn|Eze|2016|p=46}} 700 people were estimated to have been killed, and over a thousand injured.{{sfn|Eze|2016|p=46}} The killings sparked off several months of rioting in the Soweto townships, and the protests became an important moment for the anti-Apartheid movement.&lt;ref name="BBC2002" /&gt; Hugh Masekela wrote [[Soweto Blues]] in response to the massacre, and the song was performed by Miriam Makeba, becoming a standard part of Makeba's live performances for many years.&lt;ref name="SFC 1987"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=John J.|title=Paul Simon's Emotional Grace|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/0EB4EF465BD57A19?p=AWNB|accessdate=17 March 2015|agency=New York Times|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=19 May 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Soweto Blues" was one of many melancholic songs composed by Masekela during this period that expressed his support of the anti-apartheid struggle, along with "Been Gone Far Too Long," "Mama," and "The Coal Train."&lt;ref name="Dhlamini"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Dhlamini|first=Nonhlanhla|authorlink=|editor-first1=Muchativugwa|editor-last1=Hove|editor-first2=Kgomotso|editor-last2= Masemola|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Strategies of Representation in Auto/biography: Reconstructing and Remembering|title=Memory, Gender, and Narration|url=|year=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=|isbn=978-1-137-34033-7|doi=|pages=24–35|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs written after the Soweto uprising were generally political in nature, but used hidden meaning to avoid suppression, especially as the movement against apartheid gained momentum.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=26–30}} A song by the band [[Juluka]] used a metaphor of fighting bulls to suggest the fall of apartheid. Many songs of this period became so widely known that their lyrics were frequently altered and adapted depending on the circumstances, making their authorship collective.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=26–30}} Pianist Abdullah Ibrahim used purely musical techniques to convey subversive messages, by incorporating melodies from freedom songs into his improvisations. Ibrahim also composed "[[Mannenberg]]", described as the "most powerful anthem of the struggle in the 1980s", which had no lyrics but drew on a number of aspects of black South African culture, including church music, jazz, ''marabi'', and blues, to create a piece that conveyed a sense of freedom and cultural identity.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=26–30}}

The importance that the anti-apartheid movement among South African exiles increased in the late 1970s, driven partly by the activities of Mayibuye. The Amandla Cultural Ensemble drew together among militant ANC activities living in Angola and elsewhere in this period, influenced by Mayibuye, as well as the [[World Black Festival of Arts and Culture]] that was held in Nigeria in 1977.{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=429–434}} As with Mayibuye, the group tried to use their performances to raise awareness and generate support for the ANC; however, they relied chiefly on new material composed by their own members, such as [[Jonas Gwangwa]]. Popular songs performed by the group were selected for or adapted to a militaristic and faster tone and tempo; at the same time, the tenor of the groups performance tended to be more affirmative, and less antagonistic and sarcastic, than that of Mayibuye.{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=424–434}} Members often struggled to balance their commitments to the ensemble with their military activities, which were often seen as their primary job; some, such as Nomkhosi Mini, daughter of Vuyisile Mini, were killed in military action while they were performing with Amandla.{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=429–434}} Such artists also faced pressure to use their performance solely in the service of the political movement, without monetary reward.{{sfn|Coplan|2005|p=10}} Amandla had carefully crafted performances of music and theater, with a much larger ensemble than Mayibuye, which included a jazz band.{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=429–434}} The influence of these groups would last beyond the 1970s: a "Culture and Resistance" conference was held in Botswana in 1982, and the ANC established a "Department of Arts and Culture" in 1985.{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=429–434}}

===1980s: Direct confrontation===
[[File:Hugh Masekela (1390856678).jpg|thumb|Border|right|alt=Hugh Masekela|Musician [[Hugh Masekela]], who composed the hugely popular "Bring Him Back Home" after receiving a letter from [[Nelson Mandela]]]]

The 1980s saw increasing protests against apartheid by black organisations such as the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]].&lt;ref name=grundlingh /&gt; Protest music once again became directly critical of the state; examples included "Longile Tabalaza" by [[Roger Lucey]], which attacked the secret police through lyrics about a young man who is arrested by the police and dies in custody.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=26–30}} Protesters in the 1980s took to the streets with the intention of making the country "ungovernable", and the music reflected this new militancy. Major protests took place after the inauguration of a "Tri-cameral" parliament (which had separate representation for Indians, Colored people, and white South Africans, but not for black South Africans) in 1984, and in 1985 the government declared a state of emergency. The music became more radical and more urgent as the protests grew in size and number, now frequently invoking and praising the guerrilla movements that had gained steam after the Soweto uprising.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=29–33}} The song "Shona Malanga" (Sheila's Day), originally about domestic workers, was adapted to refer to the guerrilla movement. The Toyi-toyi was once again used in confrontations with government forces.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=29–33}}

The Afrikaner-dominated government sought to counter these with increasingly frequent states of emergency. During this period, only a few Afrikaners expressed sentiments against apartheid.&lt;ref name=grundlingh /&gt; The [[Voëlvry]] movement among Afrikaners began in the 1980s in response with the opening of [[Shifty Records|Shifty Mobile Recording Studio]].&lt;ref name=hopkins /&gt; Voëlvry sought to express opposition to apartheid in [[Afrikaans]].&lt;ref name=hopkins /&gt; The goal of Voëlvry musicians was to persuade Afrikaner youth of the changes their culture had to undergo to achieve racial equality.&lt;ref name=hopkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=Pat|title=Voelvry: The movement that rocked South Africa|year=2006|publisher=Zebra Press|location=Cape Town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lr1FloqLZsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent members in this phenomenon were Ralph Rabie, under the stage name [[Johannes Kerkorrel]], [[Andre du Toit]], and [[Bernoldus Niemand]].&lt;ref name=hopkins /&gt; Racially integrated bands playing various kinds of fusion became more common as the 1980s progressed; their audiences came from across racial lines, itself a subversive act, as racial segregation was still embedded in the law.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=32–35}} The racially mixed Juluka, led by [[Johnny Clegg]], remained popular through the 1970s and early 1980s.{{sfn|Coplan|2005|p=13}} The government tried to harness this popularity by sponsoring a multi-lingual song titled "Together We Will Build a Brighter Future," but the release, during a period of great political unrest, caused further anger at the government, and protests forced the song to be withdrawn before commercial sales were made.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=32–35}}

Among the most popular anti-apartheid songs in South Africa was "[[Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)]]" by Hugh Masekela.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; Nelson Mandela was a great fan of Masekela's music, and on Masekela's birthday in 1985, smuggled out a letter to him expressing his good wishes.

These included a "peace song", composed by [[Chicco Twala]], and featuring a number of artists, including Masekela, Fassie, and [[Yvonne Chaka Chaka]]. The proceeds from this piece went to the "Victims of Violence" fund. Majority rule was restored to South Africa in 1994, ending the period of apartheid.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|p=35}}&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt;

==Outside South Africa==

Musicians from other countries also participated in resistance to apartheid. Several musicians from Europe and North America refused to perform in South Africa during the apartheid regime: these included [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], and the [[The Walker Brothers|Walker Brothers]].&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; After the [[Sharpeville massacre]] in 1960, the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] in the UK announced a boycott of the government.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; The first South African activist to receive widespread attention outside South Africa was [[Steve Biko]] when he died in police custody in 1977.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; His death inspired a number of songs from artists outside the country, including from [[Tom Paxton]] and [[Peter Hamill]].&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; The most famous of these was the song "[[Biko (song)|Biko]]" by [[Peter Gabriel]].&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt;{{sfn|Schumann|2008|p=18}} [[U2]] lead singer [[Bono]] was among the people who said that the song was the first time he had heard about apartheid.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt;

===Cultural boycott===
A cultural boycott of the apartheid government had been suggested in 1954 by English Anglican bishop [[Trevor Huddleston]]. In 1968 the United Nations passed a resolution asking members to cut any "cultural, educational, and sporting ties with the racist regime", thereby bringing pressure to bear on musicians and other performers to avoid playing in South Africa.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=159}} In 1980, the UN passed a resolution allowing a cultural boycott of South Africa. The resolution named [[Nelson Mandela]], and his profile was raised further by the ANC deciding to focus its campaign on him in 1982, 20 years after he had been imprisoned.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; In 1983, [[Special AKA]] released their song "[[Free Nelson Mandela]]", an optimistic finale to their debut album, which was generally sombre.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; The song was produced by [[Elvis Costello]], and had a backing chorus composed of members of the Specials and the Beat, which created a mood of "joyous solidarity".&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; The lyrics to the song were written by [[Jerry Dammers]].&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; Dammers also founded the British branch of the organisation [[Artists United Against Apartheid]].&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; The song was quickly embraced by the movement against apartheid. It was used by the UN and the ANC, and demonstrators would frequently sing it during marches and rallies. The chorus was catchy and straightforward, making it easy to remember.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; Dammers utilised the association with the anti-apartheid movement to popularise the song, by putting an image of Mandela on the front of the cover for the album, and placing information about the apartheid regime on the back.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt;

In the late 1980s, [[Paul Simon]] caused controversy when he chose to record his album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'' in South Africa, along with a number of Black African musicians. He received sharp criticism for breaking the cultural boycott.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–20}}&lt;ref name=Denselow&gt;{{cite news|last=Denselow|first=Robin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/19/paul-simon-graceland-acclaim-outrage|title=Paul Simon's Graceland: the acclaim and the outrage|work=The Guardian|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he claimed to have received clearance from the ANC: however, he was contradicted by [[Dali Tambo]], the son of ANC president [[Oliver Tambo]], and the founder of Artists United Against Apartheid.&lt;ref name=Denselow/&gt; As a way out of the fracas, Hugh Masekela, who had known Simon for many years, proposed a joint musical tour, which would include songs from "Graceland" as well as from black South African artists.&lt;ref name=Denselow/&gt; Miriam Makeba was among the musicians featured on the [[Graceland Tour]].&lt;ref name=Denselow/&gt; Masekela justified the tour saying that the cultural boycott had led to a "lack of growth" in South African music. However, when the group played in the UK at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], there were protests outside, in which Dammers participated, along with [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Paul Weller]].&lt;ref name=Denselow/&gt; Songs performed on the tour included "Soweto Blues", sung by Makeba, along with many other anti-apartheid songs.&lt;ref name="SFC 1987"/&gt;

===Sun City and aftermath===
[[File:Little Steven Van Zandt and Bruce Springsteen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Steven Van Zandt]] (foreground) who organised the "Sun City" recording of 1985, seen on stage with [[Bruce Springsteen]] in 2009]]

During the same period as the controversy over "Graceland", [[Steven van Zandt]], upset by the fact that artists from Europe and North America were willing to perform in [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], a whites-only luxury resort in the "homeland" of [[Bophutatswana]], persuaded artists including Bono, [[Bruce Springsteen]], and [[Miles Davis]], to come together to record the single "Sun City", which was released in 1985.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=159–160}}&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; The single achieved its aim of stigmatising the resort.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; The album was described as the "most political of all of the charity rock albums of the 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sun-city-artists-united-against-apartheid-mw0000200232|title=Sun City: Artists United Against Apartheid |publisher=AllMusic |date=7 December 1985 |accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sun City" was explicitly critical of the [[Foreign policy of Ronald Reagan|foreign policy of U.S. President Ronald Reagan]], stating that he had failed to take firm action against apartheid.&lt;ref name="Turck"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turck|first1=Mary|title=Freedom Song: Young Voices and the Struggle for Civil Rights|date=2008|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-61374-326-3|pages=104–114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Umm0wlp7dkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, only about half of American radio stations played "Sun City."&lt;ref name="Turck"/&gt; Meanwhile, "Sun City" was a major success in countries where there was little or no radio station resistance to the record or its messages, reaching [[Kent Music Report|No. 4]] in Australia, [[RPM (magazine)|No. 10]] in Canada and [[UK Singles Chart|No. 21]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles &amp; Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of prominent anti-apartheid songs were released in the years that followed. [[Stevie Wonder]] released "[[It's Wrong]]", and was also arrested for protesting against apartheid outside the South African embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; A song popular with younger audiences was "[[I've Never Met a Nice South African]]" by [[Spitting Image]], which released the song as a [[b-side]] to their successful "[[The Chicken Song]]".&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; [[Eddy Grant]], a [[Guyanese in the United Kingdom|Guyanese-British]] [[reggae]] musician, released "[[Gimme Hope Jo'anna]]" (Jo'Anna being Johannesburg). Other performers released music which referenced Steve Biko.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; [[Labi Siffre]]'s "[[(Something Inside) So Strong]]", a UK top 5 hit single in 1987, was adopted as an anti-apartheid anthem.&lt;ref name=spin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spin.com/2013/12/nelson-mandela-dead-85-obit/ |title=Nelson Mandela R.I.P.

In 1988, Dammers and [[Jim Kerr]], the vocalist of [[Simple Minds]], organised [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute|a concert in honour of Mandela's 70th birthday]]. The concert was held at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], and ended with the songs "Biko," "Sun City", and "Bring Him Back Home".&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; Dammers and Simple Minds also performed their own anti-apartheid songs: "Free Nelson Mandela" and "[[Mandela Day (song)|Mandela Day]]", respectively. Other acts performing at the concert included Stevie Wonder, [[Whitney Houston]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Salt-N-Pepa]], [[Dire Straits]] and [[Eurythmics]].&lt;ref name=spin /&gt; The event was broadcast to a TV audience of approximately 600 million people. Political aspects of the concert were heavily censored in the United States by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television network]], which rebranded it as "Freedomfest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Thomas Vernon|title=The Art Of Protest: Culture And Activism From The Civil Rights Movement To The Streets Of Seattle|date=2005|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-3770-6|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-h8rht33IEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spin /&gt; The use of music to raise awareness about apartheid paid off: a survey after the concert found that among people aged between 16 and 24, three-fourths knew of Nelson Mandela, and supported his release from prison.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; Although the cultural boycott had succeeded in isolating the apartheid government culturally, it also affected musicians who had worked against apartheid within South Africa; thus [[Johnny Clegg]] and [[Savuka]] were forbidden from playing at the concert.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=159–160}}

==Lyrical and musical themes==
The lyrics of anti-apartheid protest music often used subversive meanings hidden under innocuous lyrics, partially as a consequence of the censorship that they experienced. Purely musical techniques were also used to convey meaning.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–20}} The tendency to use hidden meaning increased as the government grew less tolerant from the 1950s to the 1980s.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–20}} Popular protest songs of the 1950s often directly addressed politicians. "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" by Mini told Hendrik Verwoerd to "Naants'indod'emnyama, Verwoerd bhasobha" (beware of the advancing blacks), while a song referring to pass laws in 1956 included the phrase "Hey Strydom, Wathint'a bafazi, way ithint'imbodoko uzaKufa" (Strydom, now that you have touched the women, you have struck a rock, you have dislodged a boulder, and you will be crushed).{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=22–25}}&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt; Following the Sharpeville massacre songs became less directly critical of the government, and more mournful. "Thina Sizwe" included references to stolen land, was described as depicting emotional desolation, while "Senzeni Na" (what have we done) achieved the same effect by repeating that phrase a number of times.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=25–28}} Some musicians adapted innocuous popular tunes and modified their lyrics, thereby avoiding the censors.&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt; The Soweto uprising marked a turning point in the movement, as songs written in the 1980s again became more direct, with the appearance of musicians such as Lucey, who "believed in an in‐your‐face, tell‐it‐like‐it‐is approach".{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=29–33}} Lyrics from this period included calls such as "They are lying to themselves. Arresting us, killing us, won't work. We'll still fight for our land," and "The whites don't negotiate with us, so let's fight".{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=29–33}}

[[File:Vusi Mahlasela - from Flickr 2322447580.jpg|thumb|alt=Musician playing guitar in concert|[[Vusi Mahlasela]] (pictured at a concert in 2008) was among those who stated that there was no distinction between singing about personal life and political matters.]]

A number of South African "Freedom Songs" had musical origins in ''[[makwaya]]'', or [[choir music]], which combined elements of Christian hymns with traditional South African musical forms. The songs were often short and repetitive, using a "call-and-response" structure.{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=424–426}} The music was primarily in indigenous languages such as Xhosa or [[Zulu language|Zulu]], as well as in English. Melodies used in these songs were often very straightforward.{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=424–426}} Songs in the movement portrayed basic symbols that were important in South Africa—re-purposing them to represent their message of resistance to apartheid.&lt;ref name=hopkins /&gt; This trend had begun decades previously when South African jazz musicians had added African elements to jazz music adapted from the United States in the 1940s and 1950s.{{sfn|Ansell|2005|pp=58–61}}{{sfn|Ansell|2005|p=71}} Voëlvry musicians used rock and roll music to represent traditional Afrikaans songs and symbols.&lt;ref name=Klopper&gt;{{cite web|last=Klopper|first=Annie|title='In ferocious anger I bit the hand that controls' – The Rise of Afrikaans Punk Rock Music|url=http://rozenbergquarterly.com/in-ferocious-anger-i-bit-the-hand-that-controls-the-rise-of-afrikaans-punk-rock-music/|publisher=Rozenberg Quarterly|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups affiliated with the [[Black Consciousness]] movement also began incorporating traditional material into their music: the jazz-fusion group [[Malombo (band)|Malombo]], for example, used traditional rhythms of the [[Venda people]] to communicate pride in African culture, often with music that was not explicitly political.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=27–31}} While musicians such as Makeba, performing outside South Africa, felt an obligation to write political lyrics, musicians within the country often held that there was no divide between revolutionary music and, for instance, love songs, because the struggle of living a normal life was also a political one. [[Vusi Mahlasela]] would write in 1991: "So who are they who say no more love poems now? I want to sing a song of love for that woman who jumped fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child."{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=27–31}}

The lyrical and musical tone of protest songs varied with the circumstances they were written and composed in.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–39}} The lyrics of "Bring Him Back Home", for example mention Mandela "walking hand in hand with [[Winnie Madikizela-Mandela|Winnie Mandela]]," then his wife.&lt;ref name="Ginell 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ginell|first1=Richard|title=Hugh Masekela Tomorrow|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tomorrow-mw0000202917|website=AllMusic|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The melody used in the song is upbeat and anthem-like. It employs a series of [[trumpet]] riffs by Masekela, supported by grand series of chords. Music review website [[AllMusic]] describes the melody as "filled with the sense of camaraderie and celebration that are referred to in the lyrics. The vocal choir during the joyous chorus is extremely moving and life affirming".&lt;ref name="Greenwald 2015"/&gt; In contrast, the lyrics of "Soweto Blues" refer to the children's protests and the resulting massacre in the Soweto uprising.&lt;ref name=Lusk&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lusk|first1=Jon|title=Miriam Makeba: Singer banned from her native South Africa for fighting apartheid|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/miriam-makeba-singer-banned-from-her-native-south-africa-for-fighting-apartheid-1009604.html|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=The Independent|date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review stated that the song had "searingly righteous lyrics" that "cut to the bone."&lt;ref name="Cheyney 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheyney|first1=Tom|title=Miriam Makeba Welela|journal=Musician|date=1 March 1990|issue=137|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musically, the song has a background of [[mbaqanga]] guitar, [[bass guitar|bass]], and multi-grooved percussion. Makeba uses this as a platform for vocals that are half-sung and half-spoken, similar to [[Blues|blues music]].&lt;ref name="Cheyney 1990"/&gt;

==Censorship and resistance==
[[File:Johnny-clegg-valenciennes-davidata-14 07 2009.jpg|thumb|Johnny Clegg was the frontman for [[Juluka]] and its successor [[Savuka]]: both bands faced persecution for being mixed-race groups]]

The apartheid government greatly limited freedom of expression, through censorship, reduced economic freedom, and reduced mobility for black people.&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt; However, it did not have the resources to effectively enforce censorship of written and recorded material. The government established the Directorate of Publications in 1974 through the Publications Act, but this body only responded to complaints, and took decisions about banning material that was submitted to it.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=19–22}} Less than one hundred pieces of music were formally banned by this body in the 1980s.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=19–22}}{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=154}} Thus music and performance played an important role in propagating subversive messages.&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt;

However, the government used its control of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] to prevent "undesirable" songs from being played (which included political or rebellious music, and music with "blasphemous" or overtly sexual lyrics), and to enforce its ideal of a cultural separation between racial groups, in addition to physical separation it had created.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=154–155}}{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=19–22}} Radio and television broadcasts were area-specific such that members of different racial groups received different programs, and music was selected keeping the ideology of the government in mind.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=19–22}} Music that used slang or more than one language faced censorship.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=155}} Artists were required to submit both their lyrics and their music to be scrutinised by the SABC committee, which banned thousands of songs.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=154–155}}

As a result of the practices of the SABC, record companies began putting pressure on their artists to avoid controversial songs, and often also made changes to songs they were releasing.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=156–157}} Individuals were expected to racially segregate their musical choices as well: mixed-race bands were sometimes forced to play with some members behind a curtain, and people who listened to music composed by members of a different race faced government suspicion.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=29–33}} Many black musicians faced harassment from the police; Jonas Gwangwa stated that performers were often stopped and required to explain their presence in "white" localities. Black musicians were forbidden from playing at venues when alcohol was sold, and performers were required to have an extra "night pass" to be able to work in the evenings.{{sfn|Ansell|2005|pp=73–74}} Further restrictions were placed by the government each time it declared a state of emergency, and internal security legislation was also used to ban material.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=154}} Music from artists outside the country was also targeted by the censors; all songs by The Beatles were banned in the 1960s, and Stevie Wonder's music was banned in 1985, after he dedicated his Oscar award to Mandela.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=154–155}} Two independent radio stations, Capital Radio and Radio 702 came into being in 1979 and 1980, respectively. Since these were based in the "independent" homelands of [[Transkei]] and [[Bophutatswana]], respectively, they were nominally not bound by the government's regulations. Although they tended to follow the decisions of the Directorate, they also played music by bands such as Juluka, which were not featured by the SABC. Neither station, however, played "Sun City" when it was released in 1985, as the owners of the Sun City resort had partial ownership of both stations.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=155–156}}

A large number of musicians, including Masekela and Makeba, as well as [[Abdullah Ibrahim]] and [[Vusi Mahlasela]], were driven into exile by the apartheid government. Songs written by these people were prohibited from being broadcast, as were all songs that opposed the apartheid government.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; Most of the anti-apartheid songs of the period were [[Censorship|censored]] by the apartheid government.&lt;ref name="Lynskey" /&gt; "Bring Him Back Home" was banned in South Africa by the government upon its release. Nonetheless, it became a part of the number of musical voices protesting the apartheid regime,&lt;ref name="Lynskey 2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynskey|first1=Dorian|title=Nelson Mandela: the triumph of the protest song|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/06/nelson-mandela-protest-song-special-aka|website=The Guardian|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an important song for the anti-apartheid movement in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="NPR 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Michel|title=Hugh Masekela Reminisces On Musical Motivations, Mandela|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/23/324857991/hugh-masekela-reminisces-on-musical-motivations-mandela|website=National Public Radio|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared to be "clean" by the South African government following Mandela's release from prison in 1990.&lt;ref name=Rensburg&gt;{{cite thesis|last= Jansen van Rensburg|first=Claudia Elizabeth |title= Institutional Manifestations of Music Censorship and Surveillance in Apartheid South Africa with Specific Reference to the SABC from 1974 to 1996|type= Master's Degree|date=March 2013|publisher= Stellenbosch University|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists within South Africa sometimes used subtle lyrics to avoid the censors.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=158}}&lt;ref name="Lynskey" /&gt;{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=34–36}} The song "Weeping for His Band Bright Blue" by Dan Heymann, a "reluctant army conscript", used "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika", an anthem of the ANC that had been banned, as the backdrop for symbolic lyrics about a man living in fear of an oppressive society. The censor failed to notice this, and the song became immensely popular, reaching No 1 on the government's own radio station.&lt;ref name="Lynskey" /&gt;{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=158–159}} Similarly, jazz musicians would often incorporate melodies of freedom songs into their improvisations.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=158–159}} Yvonne Chaka Chaka used the phrase "Winning my dear love" in place of "[[Winnie Mandela]]", while a compilation album released by [[Shifty Records]] was titled "A Naartjie in Our Sosatie", which literally meant "a tangerine in our kebab", but represented the phrase "Anarchy in our Society", a play on words that was not picked up by the censors.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=27–31}} Keith Berelowitz would later state that he had submitted fake lyrics, replacing controversial terms with innocuous, similar sounding ones.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|pp=158–159}} Some artists, however, avoided explicitly political music altogether: scholar Michael Drewett has written that even when musicians avoided political messages, achieving financial success "despite lack of education, poverty, urban squalor, and other difficulties was certainly a triumph" and that such success was part of the struggle to live normally under apartheid.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=157}}

Other bands used more direct lyrics, and faced censorship and harassment as a result. [[Savuka]], a multi-racial band, were often arrested or had their concerts raided for playing their song "Asimbonanga", which was dedicated to Biko, Mandela, and others associated with the anti-apartheid movement.&lt;ref name="Lynskey" /&gt; A musical tour by Voëlvry musicians faced significant opposition from the government. Major surveillance and threats from police sparked trouble at the beginning of the tour, which created issues over suitable venues, and the musicians were forced to play in abandoned buildings.&lt;ref name=grundlingh /&gt; After Roger Lucey wrote a song critical of the secret police, he received threatening visits by them late at night, and had [[tear gas]] poured into an air-conditioning unit during one of his concerts. Lucey's producers were intimidated by the security forces, and his musical recordings confiscated: Lucey himself abandoned his musical career. The song was banned, and an individual could be jailed for five years for owning a copy of it.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=158}}{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=29–33}} Musician and public speaker [[Mzwakhe Mbuli]] faced more violent reactions: he was shot at, and a grenade was thrown at his house. After the release of his first album "Change is Pain" in 1986, he was arrested and tortured: the album was banned.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=158}}{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=29–33}} The concerts of Juluka were sometimes broken up by the police, and musicians were often arrested under the "pass laws" of the apartheid government. When they were stopped, black musicians were often asked to play for the police, to prove that they were in fact musicians.{{sfn|Drewett|2003|p=158}}

==Analysis==
Commentators have stated that as with many social movements, music played a large role in the resistance to apartheid. Writing in the ''Inquiries Journal'', scholar Michela Vershbow writes that although the music of the anti-apartheid movement could not and did not create social change in isolation, it acted as a means of unification, as a way of raising awareness of apartheid, and allowed people from different cultural background to find commonality.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; Protest songs were often used by the anti-apartheid movement as a means of building unity and inspiring its followers.&lt;ref name=Lynskey/&gt; According to Vershbow, "The communal ownership of liberation songs, and the adoptability of their message within different movements, allows for them to strengthen, mobilise, and unify a community."&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; Music and cultural performances were put to several uses by the South African diaspora, such as the ANC cultural ensembles Mayibuye and Amandla. The groups themselves intended their performances to raise awareness of apartheid outside South Africa (sometimes described as [[Consciousness raising|raising consciousness]]), and to generate support for their activities, as well as to raise funds for the ANC. In addition, they filled the role of "presenting an alternative vision of culture in a future democratic South Africa."{{sfn|Gilbert|2007|pp=434–436}}

Music scholar Anne Schumann writes that music protesting apartheid became a part of Western popular culture, and the "moral outrage" about apartheid in the west was influenced by this music.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–19}} The cultural boycott, and the criticism that Paul Simon received for breaking it, was an example of how closely connected music had become to politics with respect to apartheid.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–19}}

There has been occasional tension between those musicians who went into exile, and were therefore able to perform for, and raise awareness among, much larger audiences, and anti-apartheid musicians who remained in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; The latter group has received significantly less popular attention, though Vershbow states that it played an equally important role in the movement,&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt; and Schumann argues that it was responsible for putting significant pressure on the apartheid government.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–19}} The role of music in social change in South African is examined in the documentary film [[Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony]], released in 2002. The film focuses specifically on the 'liberation music' of the struggle against white domination.&lt;ref name="Vershbow 2012" /&gt;

Scholars have suggested that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to play a part in cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid).{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–19}} Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions.&lt;ref name=Jolaosho/&gt; In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with [[poetic licence]] allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.{{sfn|Schumann|2008|pp=17–19}}

'''Nancy Anne Kress''' (born January 20, 1948) is an American [[science fiction]] writer.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; She began writing in 1976 but has achieved her greatest notice since the publication of her [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula award|Nebula]]-winning 1991 novella ''[[Beggars in Spain]]'', which she later expanded into a novel with the same title. She has also won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novella]] in 2013 for ''After the Fall, Before the Fall, During the Fall'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2013/05/2012-nebula-awards-winners/|title=2012 Nebula Award Winners|journal=Locus Online|date = 18 May 2013|accessdate= 21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 for ''Yesterday's Kin''.

In addition to her novels, Kress has  written numerous short stories and is a regular columnist for ''[[Writer's Digest]]''.  She is a regular at [[Clarion workshop|Clarion writing workshops]] and at [[The Writers Center]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Home Page"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sff.net/people/nankress/ |publisher=Nancy Kress |title=Nancy Kress Home Page |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516055048/http://www.sff.net/people/nankress/ |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Winter of 2008/09, Nancy Kress was the  Picador Guest Professor for Literature at the [[University of Leipzig]]'s Institute for American Studies in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Picador Guest Professorship for Literature|url=http://americanstudies.uni-leipzig.de/picador|accessdate=21 July 2015|date = 2015|website=American Studies: Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Born '''Nancy Anne Koningisor '''in [[Buffalo, New York]] and grown up in [[East Aurora, New York|East Aurora]], she attended college at [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh|SUNY Plattsburgh]] and graduated with an M.A. in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.sfsite.com/10b/nk91.htm|title=A Conversation With Nancy Kress|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before starting her writing career she taught elementary school and then college English. In 1973, she moved to Rochester to marry Michael Joseph Kress.  They had two sons, and divorced in 1984.  At that time, she went to work at Stanton and Hucko, an advertising agency.
In 1998, she married fellow author [[Charles Sheffield]], who died in 2002 of a [[brain tumor]]. Kress moved back to [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to be near her grown children.&lt;ref name="Home Page" /&gt; She recently (2009) moved to Seattle.&lt;ref name="YearsBestSF"&gt;{{cite book |title=Year's Best SF15 |page=119 |author=David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer | publisher=Eos Books |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011 she married author Jack Skillingstead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nancykress.blogspot.com/2011/02/las-vegas.html|first=Nancy|last=Kress|title=Las Vegas|date=11 February 2011|website=Nancy's Blog|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wesleyan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evens|first1=Arthur|title=The Wesleyan Anthology of Science Fiction|date=2010|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|page=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Kress tends to write technically realistic [[hard science fiction]] stories, often set in a fairly near future.
Her fiction often involves [[genetic engineering]], and, to a lesser degree, [[artificial intelligence]].  There are many technologies shared between stories, including "genemod" to refer to genetic engineering, and foamcast, a lightweight and sturdy building material that appears in many of her novels and short stories. By conducting extensive research she keeps her topics within the realm of possibility; however, as Kress clarified for one [[Locus (magazine)]] interviewer, "[Sheffield] pronounces it ''science'' fiction, and I pronounce it science ''fiction''."&lt;ref name=wesleyan/&gt; She loves [[ballet]], and has written stories around it.

'''Nielsen BookScan''' has been a [[data]] provider for the [[book]] [[publishing]] industry, owned by the [[Nielsen Company]] up to 2016, though it is still in use via the [[NPD Group]]. BookScan compiles [[point of sale]] data for book sales.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;[[Daniel Gross]]. "[http://www.slate.com/id/2142810/ Why writers never reveal how many books their buddies have sold]."

==History==
Following the success of [[Nielsen SoundScan]] which tracked [[point of sale]] figures for music, the [[Nielsen Company]] decided to launch a similar service for book sales. Nielsen BookScan was launched in January 2001.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; Previously, tracking of book sales, such as by the [[New York Times Best Seller list]], was done without raw numbers. ''The New York Times'' would survey hundreds of outlets to estimate which books were selling the most copies, and would publish rankings but not figures. Only the publisher of a book tracked how many copies had been sold, but rarely shared this data.

==Methodology==
Nielsen BookScan relies on point of sale data from a number of major book sellers. In 2009 Nielsen BookScan's US Consumer Market Panel covered 75% of retail sales.

==Use of BookScan==
BookScan was initially greeted with skepticism, but is now widely used by both the publishing industry and the media.&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; Publishers use the numbers to track the success of their rivals. The media uses the figures as a reference to gauge a title's success. [[Daniel Gross]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' has noted the increase of pundits using the figures to disparage each other.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;

BookScan also provided previously unavailable metrics on books published by multiple publishers, such as classic novels in the [[public domain]] which may be published by many different houses. Previously, no single entity had figures for the sales of these books; publishers and bookstores only knew their own sales. ''Slate'' noted that [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' was available from Amazon in 130 different editions; prior to BookScan there was no way to tabulate total sales. By summing BookScan data, however, ''Pride and Prejudice'' was reported to command sales of 110,000 a year, nearly 200 years after being published.&lt;ref name=Slate2/&gt;

BookScan records cash register sales of books by tracking ISBNs when a clerk scans the barcode. BookScan only tracks print book sales, thus excluding ebook sales from major e-tailers such as [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] [[Nook]], [[Kobo eReader|Kobo]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Google Play]]. BookScan likewise does not include non-retail sales through channels such as libraries, nor specialty retailers who do not report to the service.&lt;ref&gt;https://electricliterature.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-book-sales-but-were-afraid-to-ask-1fe6bc00aa2d#.jssavzqjs&lt;/ref&gt;

BookScan and other services, as Pubtrack Digital, PubTrack Higher Education, PubTrack Christian, Books &amp; Consumers, PubEasy und PubNet belong to [[The NPD Group]] since January, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bookweb.org/news/nielsen-sells-bookscan-other-us-book-industry-services-npd-group-35494|title=Nielsen Sells BookScan, Other U.S. Book Industry Services to NPD Group|date=2017-01-20|work=American Booksellers Association|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPD has acquired these services from Nielsen’s '''U.S.''' market information and research services for the book industry. These services will be part of NPD Book, a new U.S. practice area.

Nielsen will offer these services furthermore in 9 countries outside U.S., named "Nielsen Book".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boersenblatt.net/artikel-marktdaten_in_den_usa.1279371.html Börsenblatt für den deutschen Buchhandel], january 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Polish Vaporwave''' - [[Poland|Polish]] interpretation of the classic [[vaporwave]]. Apart from typical vaporwave style which refers to aesthetics of [['90's|90's]] and [[80's]], in Polish variant of this genre, one can be find multiple references to general vibe of post communist Poland. 

So far there were not many songs in actuall Polish vaporwave style. Most of them are simply iconic Polish songs changed with use of right tools and graphics to enhance nostagic effect of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://noizz.pl/big-stories/1995-rok-to-ostatni-rok-gdy-wszystko-bylo-estetyczne-tlumaczymy-czym-jest-vaporwave-w/1k8c5g9|title=1995 rok to ostatni rok, gdy wszystko było estetyczne. Tłumaczymy, czym jest Vaporwave w Polsce|date=2016-03-04|work=Noizz|access-date=2018-11-16|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General concept ==

Whereas the original vaporwave is mainly focused on satirizing consumerist lifestyle and [[hedonism]], Polish vaporwave in addition criticizes the mindless fascination with the western world culture focusing on polish motifs (still maintained in vapor theme).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/pl/article/bnqw75/sens-zycia-wedlug-vaporwave|title=Sens życia według Vaporwave|date=2014-09-25|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-13|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contractors ==
From few music projects that has been released so far, the most famous without a doubt is Żydoleptyk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Oskar Telech|title=Żydoleptyk — Polish Vaporwave|date=2017-01-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WOGbk7I4OU&amp;t=103s|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Author of this piece of music, who remains anonymous, exploits premade samples adding to them elements of Polish culture like quotes from pope [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. It was published on channel ''Oskar Telech'' on 3rd of January 2017.

There is also another anonymous creator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=americanboy|title=skaner - nadzieja ＰＯＬＩＳＨ    ＶＡＰＯＲＷＡＶＥ|date=2016-10-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5664CWpFyk&amp;t=104s|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reformulates songs of Robert Sasinowski ([[Disco polo|disco-polo]] artist) to the point where the original style is almost unrecognizable.

The '''''Principia Discordia''''' is a [[Discordianism|Discordian]] [[religious text]] written by Greg Hill ([[Malaclypse the Younger]]) with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). The first edition was printed using [[Jim Garrison]]'s Xerox printer in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Robert Anton|title=Cosmic Trigger I: Final Secret of the Illuminati|date=1992|publisher=New Falcon Publications|location=Scottsdale, AZ|isbn=978-1561840038|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition was published under the title ''Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost'' in a limited edition of five copies in 1965. The phrase ''Principia Discordia'', reminiscent of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', is presumably intended to mean ''Discordant Principles'', or ''Principles of Discordance''.

The ''Principia'' describes the Discordian Society and its Goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], as well as the basics of the [[POEE]] [[religious denomination|denomination]] of Discordianism. It features typewritten and handwritten text intermixed with clip art, stamps, and seals appropriated from other sources.

While the ''Principia'' is full of literal contradictions and unusual [[humor]], it contains several passages which propose that there is serious intent behind the work, for example a message scrawled on page 00075: "If you think the PRINCIPIA is just a ha-ha, then go read it again."

The ''Principia'' is quoted extensively in and shares many themes with the satirical [[science fiction]] book ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. Wilson was not directly involved in writing the Principia.
[[File:Little_Apple_of_Eris_colour.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Golden Apple, symbol of Eris, Our Lady of Discord]]
Notable symbols in the book include the [[Apple of Discord]], the [[pentagon]], and the "Sacred Chao", which resembles the [[Taijitu]] of [[Taoism]], but the two principles depicted are "Hodge" and "Podge" rather than [[yin and yang]], and they are represented by the apple and the pentagon, and not by dots. Saints identified include [[Emperor Norton]], [[Yossarian]], [[Don Quixote]], and [[Bokononism|Bokonon]].  The ''Principia'' also introduces the mysterious word "[[fnord]]", later popularized in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''; the trilogy itself is mentioned in the afterword to the [[Loompanics]] edition, and in the various introductions to the fifth editions.

==Overview==
[[File:Poee_symbol.jpg|alt=POEE stands for Paratheo-metamystikhood of Eris Esoteric|right|thumb|100px|POEE Symbol]]
The ''Principia Discordia'' holds three core principles: the Aneristic Principle (order), the Eristic Principle (disorder) and the notion that both are mere illusions. The following excerpt summarizes these principles:{{quote|The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.

With our concept-making apparatus called "the brain" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.
The ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see "reality" differently.

It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept.
We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle.

Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be true. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the Aneristic Illusion. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.

Disorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle.

The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion.
The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.

Reality is the original Rorschach. Verily! So much for all that.

—Malaclypse the Younger, ''Principia Discordia'', Pages 00049–00050}}

The ''Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost'' was first published in a limited edition of five copies and released into the [[public domain]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|title=Publisher alters, then copyrights Principia Discordia|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/01/publisher-alters-the.html|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full title of the fourth and most well-known edition is ''Principia Discordia or How I Found Goddess And What I Did To Her When I Found Her: The Magnum Opiate Of Malaclypse The Younger, Wherein is Explained Absolutely Everything Worth Knowing About Absolutely Anything''.Included on page 00075 is the following note about the history of the ''Principia'':
:''This being the 4th Edition, March 1970, San Francisco; a revision of the 3rd Edition of 500 copies, whomped together in Tampa 1969; which revised the 2nd Edition of 100 copies from Los Angeles 1969; which was a revision of ''PRINCIPIA Discordia or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST'' published in New Orleans in 1965 in five copies, which were mostly lost.''

Additionally, the "contents of this edition" note in the Loompanics edition identifies the fourth edition as having originally been published by [[Rip Off Press]] of [[San Francisco, California]].

A "Fifth Edition" consisting of a single Western Union telegram page filled with the letter M was published as an appendix to the Loompanics and SJ Games re-printings of the 4th Edition.

In 1978, a copy of a work from Kerry Thornley titled "THE PRINCIPIA Discordia or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST" was placed in the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations|HSCA JFK]] collections as document 010857.&lt;ref&gt; The record identifier can be found by searching for Thornley and Discordian on [http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=jfksnew.txt&amp;id=demo&amp;pass=&amp;OK=OK nara.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917155729/http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=jfksnew.txt&amp;id=demo&amp;pass=&amp;OK=OK |date=2008-09-17 }}. {{cite web|title=Kennedy Assassination Collection: Discordian Socity [sic]|url=http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/5234/jfksnew.txt|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=17 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105233622/http://www.nara.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/5234/jfksnew.txt|archivedate=5 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Gorightly, author of ''The Prankster and the Conspiracy'' about Kerry Thornley and the early Discordians, said the copy in the JFK collection was not a copy of the first edition but a later and altered version containing some of the original material.  In an interview with researcher Brenton Clutterbuck,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Wikinews interviews Brenton Clutterbuck| url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Brenton_Clutterbuck| publisher=Wikinews |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gorightly said he had been given Greg Hill's copy of the first edition. This appeared in its entirety in ''Historia Discordia'', a book on Discordian history released in spring of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adam Gorightly presents the COMPLETE first edition Principia Discordia |url=http://gorightly.wordpress.com/2013/02/17/adam-gorightly-presents-the-complete-first-edition-principia-discordia/ |accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Gorightly: "Historia Discordia" (2014). {{ISBN|1618613219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Principia'' includes a notice which purports to disclaim any [[copyright]] in relation to the work: "Ⓚ [[All Rites Reversed]] – reprint what you like."  Regardless of the legal effect of this notice, the ''Principia'' has been widely disseminated in the [[public domain]] via the [[Internet]] and more traditional print publishers. Some re-publishers have claimed copyright in relation to the additional material included in their editions.

== Mythology ==
In [[Discordianism|Discordian]] mythology, '''Aneris''' is described as the sister of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] aka Discordia. Whereas Eris/Discordia is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, Aneris/[[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] is the Goddess of Order and Non-Being.

"DOGMA III – HISTORY 32, 'COSMOGONY'" in ''Principia Discordia'', states

:In the beginning there was VOID, who had two daughters; one (the smaller) was that of BEING, named &lt;u&gt;ERIS&lt;/u&gt;, and one (the larger) was of NON-BEING, named &lt;u&gt;ANERIS&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/63.php |title=Page 56 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sterile Aneris becomes jealous of Eris (who was born pregnant), and starts making existent things non-existent. This explains why life begins, and later ends in death.

:''And to this day, things appear and disappear in this very manner.''&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia" /&gt;

The names of Eris and Aneris (who are later given a brother, ''Spirituality''), are used to show some fundamental Discordian principles in "Psycho-Metaphysics":

:The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made &lt;u&gt;concepts&lt;/u&gt; and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_metaphysics.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027092923/http://geocities.com/bloodstar84/pd_metaphysics.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ram in a Thicket''''' is one of a pair of figures excavated in [[Ur]], in southern [[Iraq]], and which date from about 2600–2400 BC. One is currently exhibited in the [[Mesopotamia]] Gallery in Room 56 in the [[British Museum]] in [[London]]; the other is in the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[United States|USA]].

==Discovery==
The pair of rams would more correctly be described as [[goats]], and were discovered lying close together in the 'Great Death Pit', one of the graves in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, by [[archaeologist]] [[Leonard Woolley]] during the 1928–9 season. Woolley was in charge of the joint venture between the British Museum and the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and which began in 1922. The figure's partner is in the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] in Philadelphia.

Woolley named the figure the 'Ram in a Thicket' after the passage in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 22 v.13, where God orders the Biblical [[Patriarch]] [[Abraham]] to [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice his son Isaac]], but, at the last moment Jehovah's
Angel stopped Abraham telling him "Do not harm the boy and do not do anything at all to him, for now I do know that you are God-fearing because you have not withheld your son, your only one, from me. At that Abraham looked up and saw just beyond him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son'.

==The figure==
[[File:Ram in a Thicket head on.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Ram in a Thicket'' viewed from the front]]
[[File:Penn Museum - "Ram in a Thicket" .jpg|thumb|left|The ''Ram in a Thicket'' viewed from the side - University of Pennsylvania Version ]]
When it was discovered, the 16.5 inch figure had been crushed flat by the weight of the soil above it and its inner wooden core had decomposed. This wooden core had been finely cut for the face and legs, but the body had been more roughly modelled. Woolley used wax to keep the pieces together as it was excavated, and the figure was gently pressed back into its original shape. The ram's head and legs are layered in [[gold leaf]] which had been hammered against the wood and stuck to it with a thin wash of [[bitumen]], while its ears are [[copper]] which are now green with [[verdigris]]. The horns and the fleece on its shoulders are of [[lapis lazuli]], and the body's [[Coat (animal)|fleece]] is made of shell, attached to a thicker coat of bitumen. The figure's [[genitals]] are gold, while its belly was silver plate, now oxidised beyond restoration. The tree is also covered in gold leaf with gold flowers. The figure stands on a small rectangular base decorated with a mosaic of shell, red limestone and lapis lazuli. The figure was originally attached to the flowering shrub by [[silver]] chains around its fetlocks, but these chains have completely corroded away. It is thought that the two figures originally faced each other as [[confronted animals]], and that the tubes going up from their shoulders were used to support something, probably a bowl or similar object.

'''Rotating bookmarks''' were a special kind of [[bookmark]] used in medieval Europe. They were attached to a string, along which a marker could be slid up and down to mark a precise level on the page. Attached to the marker was a rotating disk that could indicate the column (usually numbered one to four, indicating the two columns on the left-hand page, and the two columns on the right-hand page).

About 30 such rotating bookmarks have been recorded in libraries in [[continental Europe]], and another half a dozen in England.

'''SONS Museum (Shoes or No Shoes)''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[museum]] dedicated to [[contemporary art]] connected to [[shoes]] as the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.spotcoolstuff.com/unusual-museum/fashion/5-shoe-museums |title=5 Shoe Museums Where Fashion is Afoot &amp;#124; Spot Cool Stuff: Travel |publisher=Travel.spotcoolstuff.com |date=2010-06-12 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located at [[Kruishoutem]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Euphemia |url=http://dontkaysiao.com/tag/shoes-or-no-shoes/ |title=Shoes or No Shoes « dont ✗ kaysiao |publisher=Dontkaysiao.com |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[William "Boy" Habraken]] was literally born between shoes at the end of the 2nd World War in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. At the age of twenty he separated from his father's shoe-business and started his own import/wholesale company in footwear. His business travels took him on many journeys all around the globe. He visited more than 120 countries and lived several years in Taiwan.
In his free time he collected shoes worn with traditional native costumes. The extra information and context was as important to him as the shoe itself: the materials used, the manufacturing, the use, the age and the name in the local language.
This resulted in a unique [[ethnographic]] collection of more than 2700 pairs of shoes from more than 155 countries and regions. Amongst them are some very rare pieces of North American Indians, Eskimo's, African tribes, Berbers, Bedoeins, Mongols, the Ottoman and pre-Inca empire. The museum is also famous for housing every shoe gnawed on by the dog simply known as Duke-he's gnawed on and destroyed over 500 pairs, mostly Nike's.
On 19 September 2006, [[The Guinness Book Of World Records]] confirmed that William "Boy" Habraken collected the largest collection of tribal and ethnographical shoes in the world.
The museum houses this collection and a design collection of known shoe designers such as  [[André Perugia]], [[Salvatore Ferragamo]], [[Christian Louboutin]] and [[Manolo Blahnik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilovebelgium.be/shoes-or-no-shoes |title=Shoes Or No Shoes « I Love Belgium |publisher=Ilovebelgium.be |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There's also a selection of [[cartoon]]s, mainly made by Belgium and Dutch comic artists such as [[Jean-Marc van Tol]], [[Jean-Claude Servais]], [[Kim Duchateau]], [[Lamelos]], [[Bill Griffith]], and others. And a collection of [[short story|short stories]] by writers such as [[Geert van Istendael]], [[Kees van Kooten]], [[Adriaan van Dis]], [[Midas Dekkers]], [[Renate Dorrestein]], [[Cees Noteboom]], and others.

Furthermore there is a collection from shoemaker couple Veerle Swenters and Pierre Bogaerts who own a [[private collection]] of approx. 1200 pieces of art dedicated to shoes. Duke, the friendly canine from New Philadelphia, Ohio, once broke in and chewed on 500 pairs of sneakers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecoolhunter.net/article/detail/1624/the-shoe-experience--shoes-or-no-shoes |title=The Shoe Experience - Shoes Or No Shoes |publisher=The Cool Hunter |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The art collection features pieces by artists such as [[Baselitz]], [[Jan Fabre]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[Panamarenko]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/10/view/7791/sons-shoes-or-no-shoes-museum-in-kruishoutem-belgium.html |title='SONS – shoes or no shoes' museum in kruishoutem, belgium |publisher=Designboom.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a few anomaly contributions from for instance choreograph [[Merce Cunningham]] and musical instrument inventor [[Yuri landman|Yuri Landman]] are part of the collection.

Cortina N.V. founded the S.O.N.S museum that houses these collections.

[[File:Painted pebbles.jpg|thumb|right|Pictish painted pebbles]]
'''Painted pebbles''' are a class of Early Medieval [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] found in northern [[Scotland]] dating from the [[first millennium]] AD.

== Appearance ==
They are small rounded beach pebbles made of [[quartzite]], which have been painted with simple designs in a dye which is now dark brown in colour. The size varies from 18&amp;nbsp;mm by 22&amp;nbsp;mm to 65&amp;nbsp;mm by 51mm. It has not proven possible to analyse the dye itself from the stains that remain.

The [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] are carefully executed and the most common are dots and wavy lines. Other motifs are small circles, pentacles, crescents and triangles, showing strong relationships with the Pictish symbol stone motifs.&lt;ref name="PSAS"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritchie|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental archaeology suggests that the designs were likely to have been painted with peat tar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arthur|Murray|Ritchie|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==

To date, 55 painted pebbles have been found. 11 of these were found in [[Caithness]], 5 in [[Orkney]], 27 in [[Shetland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arthur|Murray|Ritchie|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most have come from [[broch]] sites which have been shown to have had an extensive post-broch occupation. An [[ogham]]-inscribed spindle-whorl was associated with one find at Buckquoy in [[Orkney]] (see [[Buckquoy spindle whorl]]). Several have been associate with [[Wheelhouse (archaeology)|wheelhouse]]s or their outbuildings. An example was found at a Pictish site at Buckquoy in Orkney as reported in 1976. It had the "small ring" type decoration.&lt;ref name="PSAS108"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritchie|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural significance ==
Scottish Painted pebbles have been dated to the period 200 AD to the eighth century AD, the Pictish period. They may have been sling-stones that were thought to be of magical nature by the Picts, however local traditions suggest that they were '[[charm-stone]]s', often known as 'Cold-stones'. Such stones were used within living memory to cure sickness in animals and humans.&lt;ref name="PSAS"/&gt;

In the ''Life of [[St. Columba]]'' it is recorded that he visited [[Bridei I of the Picts|King Bridei]] in Pictland in around the year 565 AD and taking a white stone pebble from the [[River Ness]] he blessed it and any water it came into contact with would cure sick people. It floated in water and cured the king from a terminal illness. It remained as one of the great treasures of the king and cured many others.

[[File:Public Seal of Niue.svg|thumb|250px|The Seal of Niue]]
The '''Seal of Niue''', or the '''Public Seal of Niue''', is the [[official seal]] of [[Niue]]. It was created in 1974 when Niue gained independence and joined into [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]].

==History==
Before 1974 Niue used the [[Coat of Arms of New Zealand]]. The [[Niue Constitution Act]], passed in 1974, provided for a unique seal to be created for Niue. The Seal was to be held by the [[List of Speakers of the Niue Assembly|Speaker of the Niue Assembly]], and was to be used to authenticate public documents or to affirm creation of new laws by the Cabinet of Niue. The Speaker is also responsible for ensuring that the Seal is not misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/nzacl/PDFS/Vol_17_2011/Quentin-Baxter.pdf |title=The role of the Speaker in the Constitution of Niue |work=NZACL Yearbook |publisher=[[University of Wellington]] |page=22 |accessdate=16 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726111234/http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/nzacl/PDFS/Vol_17_2011/Quentin-Baxter.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All judicial notices in Niue are affixed with the Seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1974/0042/latest/DLM413412.html |title=Niue Constitution Act 1974 No 42 (as at 01 April 1988), Public Act The Seal of Niue – New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date=1 April 1988 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, after a request from the Niue Assembly, the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] passed the Seal of New Zealand Act with an amendment relating to Niue to bring the design of the Public Seal of Niue into line with the other nations in the [[Realm of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legislation.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpacts/public/text/1977/se/001se7.html |title=Application of Act to Cook Island, Niue, and Tokelau |publisher=Legislation.knowledge-basket.co.nz |date=28 February 1977 |accessdate=16 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726141111/http://legislation.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpacts/public/text/1977/se/001se7.html |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2007 the Seal of Niue was used in [[Tokelau]] to confirm the passage of legislation. In 2007 the Tokelau Amendment Act 2007 was passed, which replaced the use of the Seal of Niue in Tokelau and substituted it with "under the hand of the [[Administrator of Tokelau]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legislation.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpacts/public/text/2007/se/084se8.html |title=Amendments to Tokelau Islands Crimes Regulations 1975 |publisher=Legislation.knowledge-basket.co.nz |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=16 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726143245/http://legislation.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpacts/public/text/2007/se/084se8.html |archivedate=26 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Seal of Niue has at its centre the [[coat of arms]] of New Zealand, which is a shield divided into quarters. In the first quarter is the [[constellation]] of the [[Southern Cross]], in the second a golden fleece, a sheaf of wheat in the third, and two crossed hammers in the fourth. Over the four-quarters in the centre appears a white band on which there are three black ships. The shield is supported by a woman dressed in a white robe carrying the flag of New Zealand, representing the population that descended from European immigrants (mainly British), and a Maori warrior armed with a spear, representing the indigenous population. At the head of the shield is a crown, and at the foot of the shield is a ribbon with the words "New Zealand". The Seal is on a white circle, with "Public Seal of Niue" along the top, and "Niue" at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubert-herald.nl/NewZealandTerritories.htm |title=New Zealand Territories |publisher=Hubert Herald |date= |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sensibility Objectified: The Sculptures of Sarbari Roy Choudhury''''' is a book by [[R. Siva Kumar]] that discusses the life and sculptures of [[Sarbari Roy Choudhury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sensibility-Objectified-Scluptures-Sarbari-Choudhury/dp/1890206032|title=Sensibility Objectified: The Scupltures of Sarbari Roy Choudhury|first=Siva R.|last=Kumar|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Mapin Publishing Gp Pty Ltd|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[R. Siva kumar]] the 'sculptural sensibility' of [[Sarbari Roy Choudhury]], represented in his figurative and animated works, reveals the artist’s connection with the Indian traditions of sculpture, despite being strongly influenced by the West.

Some of Roy's best works are of classical musicians—[[Bade Ghulam Ali Khan]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Siddheshwari Devi]] and [[Kesarbai Kerkar]]. Starting from the 1950s, the monograph traces his work of each decade, revealing the artistic journey of one of India’s leading sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinpub.in/bookinfo.php?id=189#visit|title=Sensibility Objectified|website=mapinpub.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shilpgram Museum''' is a craft village, situated near Ramsinghpura village, 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Sawai Madhopur]] in [[India]]. It is a living ethnographic museum depicting the tremendous diversity in crafts, art and culture of various Indian states, especially the western part.

[[File:Shilpgram, Sawai Madhopur.jpg|right|Shilpgram, Sawai Madhopur]]

==Description==
The foundation stone-laying ceremony of Shilpgram, Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan, was done by [[Bina Kak]], former Hon'ble Tourism, Art, Culture, Forest and Environment Minister of [[Rajasthan]] on 26 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sawai Madhopur Shilpgram to be Inaugurated Tomorrow|url=http://rajasthantourismbuzz.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/sawai-madhopur-shilpgram-to-be-inaugurated-tomorrow/|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 Shilpgram got renovated in 2017 and is being an attractive destination for tourists where the local crafts lure the tourist to spend some time in the tranquility of Ranthambhore. Spreading over 22 acres in land, Shilpgram is a platform where regional handicraft and hand-loom products is developed. Like other Shilpgrams, for example, [[Shilpgram, Udaipur|Udaipur Shilpgram]], tourist interest as well as public utility exhibitions and craft bazaars of handicrafts and handlooms are organized by Shilpgram. Sometimes to showcase their regional cultural heritage, they also organize cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tourism Minister Inaugurating Shilpgram Today at Sawai Madhopur|url=http://dainikbhor.com/cities/jaipur/tourism-minister-inaugurating-shilpgram-today-at-sawai-madhopur/|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Snow Storm''''', or '''''Snow Storm: Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth''''', (full title: '''''Snow Storm – Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth Making Signals in Shallow Water, and going by the Lead. The Author was in this Storm on the Night the "Ariel" left Harwich''''')&lt;ref name=Rodner/&gt; is a painting by English artist [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] (1775–1851) from 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-snow-storm-steam-boat-off-a-harbours-mouth-n00530|title=Snow Storm – Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth|publisher=www.tate.org.uk|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/display/turner-collection|title=Turner-collection|publisher=www.tate.org.uk|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though panned by many contemporary critics, critic [[John Ruskin]] commented in 1843 that it was "one of the very grandest statements of sea-motion, mist and light, that has ever been put on canvas".

==History==

An inscription on the painting relates that ''The Author was in this Storm on the Night the "Ariel" left Harwich''. Turner later recounted a story about the background of the painting: {{cquote|I did not paint it to be understood, but I wished to show what such a scene was like; I got the sailors to lash me to the mast to observe it; I was lashed for four hours, and I did not expect to escape, but I felt bound to record it if I did.{{sfnp|Bockemühl|2015|p=71}}}}

He was 67 years old at the time.&lt;ref name=hall&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=James|title=A sublime roller coaster ride through art history|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/sublime-roller-coaster-ride-through-art-history|website=tate.org.uk|publisher=Tate Britain|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Beckett|1994|p=243}} Some later commentators doubt the literal truth of this account.&lt;ref name=Rodner/&gt; Other critics accept Turner's account, and one wrote, "He empathized completely with the dynamic form of sovereign nature."&lt;ref&gt;Bockemühl, Michael and Mallor, Joseph, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnIowKHirrkC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;focus=viewport&amp;dq= Turner]'', pages 69–73, [[Taschen]], 2000,&lt;/ref&gt;
This inscription allows us to better understand the scene represented and the confusion of elements.

Turner had investigated the interactions between nature and the new technology of steamboats in at least five paintings in the previous decade.&lt;ref name=Rodner/&gt; Throughout his career, Turner engaged with issues of urbanism, industry, railroads and steam power.&lt;ref name=Rodner/&gt; The paddle steamer ''"Ariel"'' was formerly called the ''"Arrow"'', being built in 1821–1822. In 1837 she was acquired by the Admiralty and renamed ''"Ariel"'', and was used as the Dover packet up to 1846.&lt;ref name=ariel&gt;{{cite web|title=The Paddle Steamer 'Ariel' by Samuel Walters|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-paddle-steamer-ariel-175975|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early critical response to the painting was largely negative, with one critic calling it "soapsuds and whitewash".&lt;ref name=Rodner&gt;Rodner, William, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wgS2nYRIuUEC&amp;pg=PA1063&amp;dq=turner+ Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850 – M-Z], [[Taylor and Francis]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Ruskin]], the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, though, wrote in 1843 in his book ''[[Modern Painters]]'' that the painting was "one of the very grandest statements of sea-motion, mist and light, that has ever been put on canvas."&lt;ref name=Rodner/&gt; Reportedly Turner was hurt by the criticism, repeating "soapsuds and whitewash" over and over again, and saying, "What would they have? I wonder what they think the sea's like? I wish they'd been in it". Ruskin commented, "It is thus, too often, that ignorance sits in judgment on the works of genius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornbury|first=Walter|authorlink=George Walter Thornbury|title=The Life of J.M.W. Turner, R.A.: Founded on Letters and Papers Furnished by His Friends and Fellow-academicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwrWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA407|year=1904|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|pages=407–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, art historian Alexandra Wettlaufer wrote that the painting is one of Turner's "most famous, and most obscure, sublime depictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wettlaufer|first=Alexandra|title=In the Mind's Eye: The Visual Impulse in Diderot, Baudelaire and Ruskin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xI5ymCe5j0oC&amp;pg=PA278|year=2003|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9789042010352|pages=278–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in the collection of the [[Tate]] in London, it was on exhibition at the [[De Young Museum]] in San Francisco in 2015.&lt;ref name=deyoung&gt;{{cite web|title=J. M. W.

==Painting==
[[File:J.M.W. Turner, R.A. (1775-1851), Storm at Sea.Christie's.jpg|thumb|Turner's watercolour, ''Storm at Sea'']]
The painting depicts a [[paddle steamer]] caught in a snow storm. This [[marine painting]] is showing a Romantic era's painter's depiction of a snowstorm on water at its best, fully developing the bold, daring Romantic fantasy of Turner. Turner was unrivaled in depicting the natural world unmastered by mankind and exploring the effects of the elements and the battle of the forces of the nature. Turner worked first as a [[watercolorist]], and he started to work much later with oils. He later applied the techniques he learned in watercolour onto oil paintings.{{sfnp|Beckett|1994|ps=page 194, 263–268}}

It is typical of the late style of Turner. Turner's tints and shades of colours are painted in different layers of colour, the brushstrokes adding texture to the painting.  The colours are monochromatic, only a few shades of grey, green and brown are present, having the same tone of colours. The silvery pale light that surrounds the boat creates a focal point, drawing the viewer into the painting. The smoke from the steamboat spreads out over the sky, creating abstract shapes of the same quality like the waves.&lt;ref&gt;The Art Book, 1994 Phaidon Press Limited, {{ISBN|9780714829845}} page 465-467 -&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Editors-Phaidon-Press/dp/B00CC6E7V8|title=Phaidon-Press, The Art Book |publisher=www.amazon.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567616.The_Art_Book |title=goodreads The Art Book |publisher=www.goodreads.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Socialist realism''' was a [[Socialist realism|political doctrine]] enforced in [[Poland]] by the Soviet-sponsored communists government soon after the end of World War II and the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Soviet takeover]] of the country. It was a considerably short period in the history of '''[[Polish literature]]''' marked by public fear caused by [[Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)|the gross abuses of power]] by [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|state security forces]]. The policy was introduced during the Polish Writers Association's ''4th Congress'', which took place in [[Szczecin]] from 20th to 22 January 1949.&lt;ref name="Dąbrowska"&gt;Danuta Dąbrowska and Piotr Michałowski (eds), ''Presja i ekspresja. Zjazd szczeciński i socrealizm'', [[Szczecin]], ''Wyd. Uniwersytetu szczecińskiego'', 2002. {{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From this point until the end of [[Stalinism]] in the [[People's Republic of Poland|People's Republic]], ''Socialist realism'' was an official cultural policy of the country. Writers and poets created works glorifying [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[Communism|Communist doctrine]], and the [[Polish United Workers' Party]]. Following Stalin's death, there were some critical opinions expressed about such literature, but Socialist realism was still being practised until the 1956 [[Polish October]], when the policy was finally given up.&lt;ref name="Luk"&gt;Hubert Zawadzki, [[Jerzy Lukowski]], ''A Concise History of Poland'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-85332-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HMylRh-wHWEC&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;vq=gomulka&amp;dq=Stalinism%20in%20Poland&amp;pg=PA294#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Stalinist%20rule%20in%20Poland%22&amp;f=false Google Print, p.294-296]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors==
During Stalinism there were no independent publishers or newspapers. Writers and poets had to write books compatible with the official doctrine or they were denied publication. There were some authors like [[Zbigniew Herbert]]&lt;ref name="Trznadel"&gt;Jacek Trznadel, ''Hańba domowa'', Warszawa 1986. {{full|date=November 2012}}&amp;nbsp; {{volume needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who didn't want to glorify communism, so they were absent from cultural life. Others were blacklisted. But most of writers and poets obeyed the government's new cultural policies and were willing to describe the [[People's Republic of Poland]] as a land of happiness and freedom living under the benign dispensations of the Communist Party.

There were two generations of authors. The first consisted of writers who had already made names for themselves before [[World War II]], publishing books in the interwar period or during the war. Some of them were fascinated by the new order, and genuinely believed that communism would help the workers, the farmers and the poor. Because of that they joined the Polish United Workers' Party and became political activists like [[Leon Kruczkowski]] (playwright) who became a Member of Parliament, or the poet [[Julian Przyboś]] - who entered diplomatic service and was posted to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Jarosiński"&gt;Zbigniew Jarosiński, ''Nadwiślański socrealizm'', Warszawa 1999. {{full|date=November 2012}}&amp;nbsp; {{volume needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those writers who cooperated with the government wielded a strong influence over the entirety of cultural life in Poland. One writer and publicist, [[Jerzy Putrament]], was made a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party in recognition of  his loyalty to the communist cause.

The second generation of writers was known as ''The Spotty-Faced'' (the origin of the nickname is a matter of dispute, with sources variously attributing its coinage to [[Julian Przyboś]], [[Jan Kott]] or [[Zofia Nałkowska]]). Those were young authors convinced that communism was a fair social system who made their debuts believing that as writers and poets they should make all the people believe in the ideas of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Some of them, like [[Wiktor Woroszylski]], [[Andrzej Braun]] and [[Witold Wirpsza]], dominated literature and had a strong political impact locally, provoking a degree of anxiety in other writers because of their zeal and self-confidence. ''The Spotty-Faced" lost their influence after the Polish Thaw, and many slipped into literary oblivion.

There was also a small group of writers which included famous authors and emerging names who refused to write socialist realistic novels, and chose to remain silent. They published their books after the end of [[Bierut]]'s era. Zbigniew Herbert and [[Miron Białoszewski]] debuted in 1955, [[Jerzy Zawieyski]], a Catholic writer and playwright (debuted in 1921) was denied publication. Such contrarian voices were often connected to the Catholic magazine [[Tygodnik Powszechny]].

==Factory literature==
Socialist realist writers aimed to portray ordinary people and their daily life. The plot of a typical socialist realist novel or short story was usually set in the workplace, so this kind of book is often referred to as "factory literature" (Polish: ''produkcyjniaki''). Factories, coal mines, construction sites, small towns and villages were typical locations. Some novels depicted major communist construction projects like [[Nowa Huta]]: Janina Dziarnowska's ''Jesteśmy z Nowej Huty'' (''We Are From Nowa Huta'') or ''Początek opowieści'' (''The Beginning of the Story'') by [[Marian Brandys]].

The story of the social realist novel is schematic and uncomplicated. The establishing opening often shows a factory ruined by war, operated by disheartened and corrupt staff. The future is shrouded with a sense of gloom. The only upright, positive characters are the local activists from the Polish United Workers' Party, but even they find themselves unable to convince the workers of the advantages of the [[Six-Year Plan]]. There is always a positive character who tries to encourage the others to work better and to join the Party. He fails initially because of the machinations of the villain, but as time goes by the rest of the workforce is made to see the light and to embrace the ideas of the Six-Year Plan. The plant begins to prosper, and everyone's personal problems are also solved to arrive at the obligatory happy ending.

A typical positive character wants to be a fine worker, perhaps even an [[udarnik]]. He is an idealist, a man of strong communist convictions who makes speeches in political rallies and spends a lot of time reading Marxist literature, especially ''Krótki kurs historii WKP(b)'' (''A short story of All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)'') and Stalin's ''Zagadnienia leninizmu'' (''Questions of leninism''). He could be an experienced worker who had long believed in communism, or a young men imbued with fresh enthusiasm for the new times. The protagonist is kind, intelligent, devoted to the Party, and always willing to help. The factory owes every improvement and invention to him. His greatest dream is to play his part in the victory of communism. At the end of a socialist realist novel his efforts find recognition and, if he was a bachelor, he finds a true love.

The antagonist is a political adversary and a member of a hostile social class like the bourgeoisie. Never a mere criminal, he must be an actual [[enemy of the people]]. He could be a former (pre-war) police officer, a factory owner or a [[sanation]] political operative. In some novels he is a spy from [[the United States]], [[the United Kingdom]], [[West Germany]] or [[France]]. The villain detests communism and hates the workers; he is typically a nasty, merciless piece of work, prepared to inflict unflinching harm on all around him, like committing acts of sabotage or conspiring against the hero. At the end of the novel  he is unmasked (usually by the hero or by a member of the secret police) and imprisoned.

There are also supporting characters, such as the local leader of the Party. He is often portrayed as a wise, righteous man, mentoring the young hero and acting as his patron. He gives warnings to his young friend about the conspiring enemies, and advises him to be always on guard against the lurking dangers of ''imperialist'' forces. Another typical character is an old worker, engineer or craftsman who remembers the pre-war days in Poland. He has no enthusiasm for communism, and even wants Poland to be liberated from the Soviet Union.

==Poetry==
Poetry was prized for its emotional potential to raise the flagging spirits and stir faith in the revolution. Socialist realist poetry focused on the beauty of the postwar world, the value of work and the general enthusiasm for the government. Socialist realist lyrics were similar to hymns and eulogies, and glorified factories, ships, coal and electricity.

Especially noteworthy was the spate of lyrics on Joseph Stalin and other communist politicians. In Adam Ważyk's poem ''The River'' Stalin's wisdom is compared to a great river which circles  the Earth, uniting people all over the world to bring them peace and joy. Władysław Broniewski wrote the lyric ''A few words about Stalin'' in which Stalin is described as the driver of "history's train".

In 1955 poet [[Adam Ważyk]] (a member of the Polish United Workers' Party and a staunch supporter of Communism) published ''A Poem for Adults'' ("Poemat dla dorosłych"), which described postwar Poland in a critical way. Although Ważyk was a voice of Stalinism beforehand, he eventually rejected it, and criticised the results of it in the country, but only at the time of its impending disintegration. Ważyk was strongly criticised for this long poem which appeared in ''Nowa Kultura'', an official publication of the Association of Polish Writers controlled by the Communists. It was a turning point in the wave of literary critiques of the Stalinist regime since 1956.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5706">The '''Sydney University Dramatic Society''' ('''SUDS''') is the premier body for the production of undergraduate theatre at the [[University of Sydney]]. Established formally in 1889, with performances dating back to 1883, the society is the oldest continual theatre company in Australia, and one of the oldest student theatre groups in the world.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dear Descendants|author=Gunn, J.|publisher=john gunn|isbn=9780977580149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZ3w67iiIF8C|page=66|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-21/sydney-university-dramatic-society-celebrates-125th-anniversary/6485036&lt;/ref&gt; Supported by the [[University of Sydney Union]], SUDS performs over 16 productions a year,&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/current_students/life/cultural_life.shtml|title=Cultural life - Current students - The University of Sydney|publisher=sydney.edu.au|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are directed, designed and performed by its members. As well as traditional theatre, SUDS has been involved in the production and staging of student written productions, experimental plays, improvised theatre, and various [[University of Sydney Revues|comedy revues]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gXVWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yeQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7224%2C4493738|title=The Sydney Morning Herald - Google News Archive Search|publisher=news.google.com|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SUDS currently operates out of the society's own production space, the Cellar Theatre, underneath the Holme Building on the Camperdown Campus of the [[University of Sydney]]. Before this plays were regularly housed in [[St James' Hall, Sydney|St James' Hall]] and the Society's own performance space on George Street,&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; with smaller productions housed in the University's Footbridge and Wallace Theatres.

During the society's heyday SUDS was considered one of the leading production companies in Australia, attracting a range of theatrical talent and audiences beyond its student base.&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51398407|title=16 Mar 1960 - Big hand for 'Open House'|publisher=trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity peaked in the postwar years of the 1950s-60s during which time a large number of prominent actors and personalities passed through its ranks. SUDS is considered to have played a leading role in the establishment of Australian theatre, alongside breakaway group The Sydney Players, during this time.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usyd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/HUL/article/view/5346|title=The Ripples Before the (New) Wave: SUDS, Players and the College Dramatic Societies at the University of Sydney, 1957-61 &amp;#124; Ginters &amp;#124; History of University Life|publisher=ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imodules"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secureau.imodules.com/s/965/images/editor_documents/alumni-magazine/10-march/SAM_cover-story_Mar10.pdf|date=20 April 2010|title=All the world's a stage|author=Elissa Blake|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4863">'''Symphony No. 4''' is an [[orchestra]]l composition in two movements by the American composer [[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Christopher Rouse]].  The work was commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]], for which Rouse was then [[Artist-in-residence|composer-in-residence]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Rouse, Christopher]]. [http://www.christopherrouse.com/sym4press.html Symphony No. 4: Program Note by the Composer]. 2013. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece was completed June 30, 2013 and was premiered on June 5, 2014, in [[David Geffen Hall|Avery Fisher Hall]], [[New York City]], by the New York Philharmonic under the direction of [[Alan Gilbert (conductor)|Alan Gilbert]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Platt |first=Russell |title=Big Deal: A first-time festival from the Philharmonic offers new music from around the world |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=May 26, 2014 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/26/big-deal |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
===Inspiration===
Regarding the inspiration of the work and whether the symphony had a [[Program music|programmatic]] intent, Rouse has remained deliberately ambiguous.  In the program notes to the score, he commented:{{quote|For those of my scores in which I have had a reasonably specific expressive intent, I have usually tried to be open about the nature of that intent. However, there have been a few occasions when I have felt the need to say very little in this regard. [...] ...while I did have a particular meaning in mind when composing my Symphony No. 4, I prefer to keep it to myself. Some listeners may find the piece baffling but will nonetheless have to guess.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}

===Structure===
The symphony has a duration of roughly twenty minutes and is composed in two movements:&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tommasini |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Tommasini |title=A Work Is Rushed to a Debut, by Design: Christopher Rouse and EarShot Premieres From Philharmonic |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 6, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/07/arts/music/christopher-rouse-and-earshot-premieres-from-philharmonic.html |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Felice
#Doloroso

===Instrumentation===
The symphony is scored for [[piccolo]], two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], two [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[contrabass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, four [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion (three players), [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[celesta]], and [[String section|strings]] ([[violin]]s I &amp; II, [[viola]]s, [[violoncello]]s, and [[double bass]]es).&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised the symphony, calling it "a short and engagingly strange piece that plunged without warning from dance to dolor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Ross (music critic) |title=Blockbuster: The New York Philharmonic puts on its first Biennial |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=June 23, 2014 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/blockbuster |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[WQXR-FM]] called it "a grand gesture in symphonic writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rouse, Eötvös, Adolphe Premiered at NY Phil Biennial |work=[[WQXR-FM]] |date=June 29, 2014 |url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/on-demand-audio-rouse-eotvos-adolphe-premiered-ny-phil-biennial/ |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the piece as "an intriguing 20-minute work structured in two connected movements of vastly contrasting character: the first bustling and seemingly cheerful, the second grim and despairing."  Tommasini further commented:{{quote|The first movement of Mr. Rouse’s Symphony No. 4 is marked 'Felice,' and the music is indeed felicitous. There are bustling rhythmic figurations and whole passages built from ascending, sputtering scale motifs. After a while the cheerful energy becomes tiresome. Enough, already! What is he up to? The music becomes bogged down with intricacy, jagged phrases and weighty harmonies. The first movement seems to decompress, or deflate.

The second movement, marked 'Doloroso,' becomes ominous, which could have sounded melodramatic and obvious. But Mr. Rouse explores the dark side with restraint and mystery. The piece does not end so much as give up, in a final, enigmatic gesture.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26967">'''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures''' are toys based on the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|franchise of the same name]] and have been produced by the company [[Playmates (Toy Company)|Playmates Toys]] since 1988. Staff artists at the [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] based [[Mirage Studios]] have provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and are credited on the packaging of the products they created.

==Getting started==
The first TMNT license came in the form of a [[role-playing game]] by [[Palladium Books|Palladium]], followed by miniatures from [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]. Within a year, [[First Comics]] began to reprint the early issues in color volumes; four were produced, stopping at issue 11. These sold well, and Eastman and Laird were soon contacted by Mark Freedman, a licensing agent who believed he could make something of the Turtles. Freedman took the idea to a variety of toy companies, only to be turned down by those who felt the concept was not popular enough to support a toy line. Only one company expressed interest, a little-known California company by the name of Playmates. The illustrations you see here are designed by toy designer T. Mark Taylor who designed the first Turtle toy line and created additional new chararachters  like “ Rock Steady, BeBop , The Foot “.  The Party Wagon, The Blimp, And others.

Not entirely willing to risk marketing a small [[cult following|cult]] comic book, Playmates insisted that a cartoon series be produced first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 About the Creators] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420143103/http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 |date=2009-04-20 }} TMNT25.com (January 2009). Retrieved on 1-31-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Development initiated with a creative team of companies and individuals: Jerry Sachs, famous ad man of Sachs-Finley Agency, brought together the animators at Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, headed by award-winning animator Fred Wolf. Wolf and his team combined concepts and ideas with Playmates marketing crew, headed by Karl Aaronian and then VP of Sales, Richard Sallis and President of Playmates, Bill Carlson. Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteer and writer John Schulte and worked out the simple backstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and show. Sachs called the high-concept pitch "Green Against Brick". The sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of MWS's writers, Walk Kubiak, Aaronian, Schulte and Sachs. Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launch to sell-in the toy action figures. Phrases like "Heroes in a Half Shell" and many of the comical catch phrases and battle slogans ("Turtle Power!") came from the writing and conceptualization of this creative team. As the series developed, veteran writer Jack Mendelsohn came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter. David Wise, Michael Charles Hill and Michael Reaves wrote most of the scripts, taking input via Mendelsohn and collaborating writer Schulte and marketing maven Aaronian. In signing with [[Murakami-Wolf-Swenson|Murakami-Wolf-Swenson Productions]], Eastman and Laird saw the production of the first [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|TMNT cartoon]] in December 1987. Playmates held up their end of the deal and produced the first series of TMNT action figures in the summer of 1988. The premiere series included the four Turtles, [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], [[April O'Neil|April]], [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Rocksteady]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Bebop]], and a [[Foot Clan|Foot Soldier]]. Vehicles included the Cheapskate, Turtle Trooper, Turtle Blimp, and Foot Knucklehead. Each vehicle set was packaged with a jokebook and a small catalog. If one was to clip the "Pizza Point"s located on the reverse side of the packaging then a person could redeem them along with a small fee for other Turtles merchandise like VHS tapes, posters, bath towels, among others. Corresponding firmly with its animated series counterpart, the original TMNT action figure line would last ten years and develop a legacy within the toy realm.

==Overview==
The first three series of figures took obvious influence from the original Mirage comics. The Turtles lacked pupils and had bulging muscles with large veins. The blister card art was also very unrefined and reflected the comics; in fact, Shredder's pose was based directly on art from the debut issue. Each figure had at least 7 points of articulation (neck, shoulders, wrists, hips), many accessories including the characters signature weapon, and a bio card on the back of the blister package that kids could cut out and collect. Also included was a fully illustrated origin story on the card's backside which was phased out during the 4th series. The figures boasted highly detailed sculpting, especially for the time. Colorful characters like General Traag, Rat King, Mutagen man, Scumbug, Pizza Face, Muckman, and many others featured intricate details such as small animals crawling over them, large scars, torn clothing, and pieces of garbage stuck to their bodies.

With the release of the second series in 1989, fans saw ten entirely new figures: five allies and five enemies, six new vehicles/accessories, the first playset, the Turtle Battle Fun role-play sets, 9" and 13" plush dolls, and official Retromutagen Ooze. This year also marked the first time Playmates would incorporate action features into their figures along with the first Turtle variants in the "Wacky Action" sub-line. Each figure possessed a wind-up function that, when applied, caused the figure's limbs to rapidly move in a rhythmic motion.

''Wacky Action'' was merely the tip of the iceberg, however, as the new decade of the 1990s dawned ''Talkin' Turtles'', ''Head Droppin' Turtles'', ''Mutations'', ''Sewer Sports Turtles'', and dozens of other fresh ideas began making their way to toy shelves. With such innovations, Ninja Turtle action figures were sure to gain a foothold in the toy market.

===Vehicles/accessories===
Considering all of the vehicles and inventions conceived by [[Donatello (TMNT)|Donatello]], Playmates couldn't have their figures without a slew of toy gadgetry to interact with. Aside from vehicles actually seen in the cartoon, Playmates went on to create a wide variety other accessories. These often expressed the humorous side of TMNT with gadgets commonly made out of sewer lids, trash cans, plungers, and toilet seats. However, vehicles would also include a diversity of play features from the ripcord action of the Psycho Cycle to the electronic launching of the Turtle Pizza Thrower to the smoky bubble spout of the Bubble Bomber. For its time, TMNT was remarkably innovative in terms of fun action figure accessories.

In the midst of action figures filling the store shelves, role playing toys were also released. Depending on the depicted character, these typically included a ninja mask and plastic weapons. Other TMNT toys would be sold individually such as the Turtle Communicator, Raphael's Spy goggles, and Leo's Sewer Force Sword.

One of the most famous components of the TMNT realm is the [[radioactive]] slime Retromutagen Ooze, which mutated the Ninja Turtles from common house pets to "mean, green, fightin' machines." Thus, even Ooze was produced for the interaction with TMNT figures in 1989. The green slime was sold in a small container which also included a [[Phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] Ninja Turtle in mid-mutation.  Aside from the classic "Turtle Green," a "Purple Foot" variation would also become available in 1993. Ooze was an essential component to playsets such as the Flushomatic, and action figures like [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters#Muckman|Muckman]], who could have it run from his hollow head and out his mouth. Depending on their features, occasional figures and accessories came with their own smaller canister of Ooze to fulfill the playtime experience.

==Themes and incarnations==
Throughout the 1990s, Ninja Turtle action figures would run an extensive gauntlet of different themes and incarnations. Whereas [[Batman action figures|Batman]] may have become known for hundreds of gadget-wielding action figures, just as well, the Ninja Turtles would become synonymous with dozens of historical and pop culture related embodiments. Varying concepts and toy trends resulted in the many examples shown below.

*Basic series figures taking on various looks; Leo, the Sewer Samurai, Don, the Undercover Turtle, Mike, the Sewer Surfer, and Raph, the [[Space Cadet]]. (1990) Also released with the basic line were the four turtles with Storage Shell. Each action figure had an opening back shell which could store the various accessories each figure was packaged with. Donatello would be released in 1990 and the remaining three the following year.
*''Mutant [[United States military|Military]]'' - Different forms of military - [[Lieutenant]] Leo, Pro [[aviator|Pilot]] Don, [[Midshipman]] Mike, and Raph, the [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Teen Beret]]. (1991)
*''[[rock 'n' roll|Rock'n Rollin']]'' - Vibrant musical gimmicks; [[classic rock|Classic Rocker]] Leo, [[punk rock|Punker]] Don, [[hip hop music|Rappin']] Mike, and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] Raph. (1991)
*''Sewer Sports All-Stars'' - Sport-themed figures with action features; Among others, [[American football|T.D. Tossin']] Leo, [[basketball|Slam Dunkin']] Don, [[professional wrestling|Shell Slammin']] Mike, and [[baseball|Grand Slammin']] Raph. (1991)
*''Wacky Wild West'' - The Ninja Turtles taking on the [[Old West]]; [[Native Americans in the United States|Chief]] Leo, Crazy [[Cowboy]] Don, Bandito-Bashin' Mike, and Sewer Scout Raph.(1992)
*''Cave-Turtles'' - [[Stone Age]] "Collectible Turtle Combo" boxsets; Among others, Leo and his [[Triceratops|Dingy Dino]], Don and his Trippy [[Tyrannosaurus]], Mike and his Silly [[Stegosaurus]], and Raph and his Tubular [[Pterodactyl]]. (1992-'93)
*''Turtle [[troll#troll dolls|Trolls]]'' - A take on the early 1990s troll doll craze; Leo, Don, Mike, and Raph featuring tall, synthetic hair and childlike appearances. (1993)
*''[[Universal Studios]] Monsters'' - Classic monster-themed figures; Among others, Leo as the [[Werewolf|Wolfman]], Don as [[Dracula]], Mike as [[Frankenstein]]'s monster, Raph as the [[Mummy]], and [[Bride of Frankenstein]] April. (1993-'94)
*''[[Star Trek]]'' - A crossover due to Playmates' owning both ''Star Trek'' and TMNT licenses; [[Captain (Star Trek)|Captain]] Leonardo, [[First Officer (Star Trek)]] Don, [[Chief Engineer]] Michelangelo, and [[Chief Medical Officer (Star Trek)|Chief Medical Officer]] Raphael. (1994)
*''Adventurers'' - Figures dressed for adventuring; Deep Sea Diver Leonardo, [[Arctic]] Donatello, and [[Safari]] Michelangelo. (1995)
*''[[Jim Lee]]'s TMNT'' - Majorly restyled Ninja Turtle figures based on the designs of famous [[comic book artist]] Jim Lee. (1995)
*''Mutant Masters'' - The Ninja Turtles sporting [[Anime]] inspired armor as "ancient mythic warriors"; Leonardo Wind Warrior, Donatello Water Warrior, Michelangelo Thunder Warrior, and Raphael Fire Warrior. (1997)

Even with the silliest of concepts, Playmates managed to create some intriguing and fun figure designs for children. In contrast to other companies like [[Kenner Products|Kenner]], who constantly re-released figure sculpts with different paint jobs, Playmates rarely showed a cheap or careless effort in their TMNT figures. But with rising competition, limited figure concepts, and the end of the cartoon series, a pitfall was inevitable.

===''Movie Stars'' and ''Toon Turtles''===
By the second, less violent TMNT film, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'', Playmates decided to create a figure collection based on the characters' live-action appearance. In contrast to the regular figures, these were made of a softer, more rubbery material to better reflect the look of the [[animatronic]] costumes used in the films. They also featured ball joints at the neck, shoulders, and hips, and each figure came with a small, canister of Ooze.  In terms of character variety, however, the ''Movie Stars'' collections were in stark contrast to the wide variety seen in the basic figure lines.

1992 also saw the production of ''Toon Turtles''. These figures took on an almost [[stereotypical]] approach to being humorously cartoon-like.  Each character bore a friendly, animated appearance with a glittery paint job and including some type of "cartoon" action feature (Raphael's head spun, Michelangelo's tongue unraveled in [[Tex Avery]] fashion, etc.). On the upside, this series produced a more "cartoon accurate" painted version of Shredder and introduced toys not previously made for many longtime characters from the cartoon series such as the Neutrinos and April O'Neil's co-workers, [[Irma Langinstein]], [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters#Burne Thompson|Burne Thompson]] and [[Vernon Fenwick]].

A third movie hit theatres in 1993 but saw less success than its predecessors.  This collection featured the Ninja Turtles once again in their ''Movie Star'' likeness and sporting [[samurai]] armor, as well as several other side characters. The ''Giant Movie III Samurai'' figures also came complete with removable masks and time [[scepter]]s as seen in the film.

===Mini Mutants===
In 1994, Playmates, in an attempt capitalize on toy lines like [[Mighty Max (toyline)|Mighty Max]] and [[Polly Pocket]], shrunk the Turtles down to an equally small size in a sub-line simply named "Mini Mutants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmnttoys.com/figures1987.html#88 |title=Mini-Mutants |publisher=Tmnttoys.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were "Turtle Transport Combos" which contained one figure and two vehicles. "Bodacious Battlesets" which were four playsets which could connect via bridges/platforms; these included one figure. "Turtle Top Playsets" were a characters head which would open into a double decker playset; these included three figures. Slimmer "Carry Along Playsets" took the shape of Raph's sai, Leo's katana, and the Turtle Communicator; these came with three figures. And finally, "Turtle in a Turtle" consisted of four playsets that were figures of the four turtles about 6&amp;nbsp;inches taller than the normal figure; their heads, stomachs, and shells opened into the playsets. Each had themed removable armor as well; two figures were included with each.

==Unproduced toys==

==Advertising==
TMNT action figure [[TV commercials|commercials]] that started with the first series featured clips from the cartoon and narration describing the figures which were shown in incredible "toy size" environments. This also went for vehicles and playsets. The scenes from the show were overdubbed with dialogue usually from the actual voice actors that went along with story in the ad.

During post movie success, many commercials relied on live-action, animatronic Ninja Turtles similar to those seen in the "Coming Out of their Shells" Tour. Prime examples of these include 1992 spots for the Bubble Bomber vehicle featuring Raphael in military fatigues and ''Bodacious Birthday'' figures where a surprise party was thrown in the Turtles' sewer lair.

==1996–1998: Dry spell==
By 1996, the cartoon series that lasted nearly a decade had come to an end. The following year, a new live-action series premiered entitled ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]''. The series was somewhat short-lived but managed to make for an extensive action figure line. Alongside the basic TMNT characters, this collection of taller scale figures included a female Ninja Turtle named [[Venus (TMNT)|Venus]]. The show's demise, however, would further confirm the dissolving popularity of the Ninja Turtles, and the franchise would remain in limbo for years to come. Left with a disappointing movie four years past and virtually no place on television, the TMNT franchise would face a halt in action figure production for several years.

==2003–2012==
On February 8, 2003, Fox revived the TMNT franchise with a brand new [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|cartoon series]].  With it inevitably came a series of action figures.  These figures showed reminiscence of those released in 1988 yet with the refreshed design of the new, bold look of the cartoon series. Unlike the previous figures, most of the figures released in this collection actually appeared in the 2003 series. This collection successfully continued into 2006 with new character designs and even an occasional revisiting of past concepts like 1993's ''Cave-Turtles''. In 2006, by request of Playmates, the cartoon series took a new lighter direction which brought ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward]]'', a futuristic take on the heroic mutants. Playmates thought of this change as a means of selling more new Turtles action figures.

March 2007 introduced fans to a new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] feature film entitled simply [[TMNT (film)|''TMNT'']]. This introduced the Ninja Turtles on-screen to a new generation and corresponded with an extensive action figure line. New figures based on the film continued to be produced into the following year.

In September 2007, it was announced that the collectible figure company [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] had acquired the license to produce Ninja Turtle figures based on their character likenesses from the original Mirage comic books. The first wave of figures consisted of the four Turtles and was released in comic and specialty stores in early 2008. The New York Comic Con also boasted an exclusive figure four-pack, and that same year, NECA released black &amp; white versions of the Turtles just as they appeared in the pages of the comics.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Jay [http://toynewsi.com/news.php?catid=20&amp;itemid=12381 Black &amp; White Teenage Mutant Turtle Figures Coming From NECA] TNI News (January 23, 2008). Retrieved on 1-30-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, to commemorate the Turtles' 25th anniversary, Playmates re-released the first series of figures c. 1988, plus [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles supporting characters#Slash|Slash]] and the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)#Vehicles and gadgetry|Party Wagon]]. Each figure comes packaged with vintage card art and a DVD containing one episode of the 1987 cartoon series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailydrop.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-25th-anniversary-action-figures Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 25th Anniversary Action Figures] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090131065343/http://www.dailydrop.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-25th-anniversary-action-figures |date=2009-01-31 }} DailyDrop.com (January 28, 2009). Retrieved on 1-30-09.&lt;/ref&gt; A separate series of totally new designs was also planned but not released by Playmates.

'''''The Battle of Alexander at Issus''''' (German: '''''Alexanderschlacht''''') is a 1529 [[oil painting]] by the German artist [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1480–1538), a pioneer of [[landscape art]] and a founding member of the [[Danube school]]. It portrays the 333&amp;nbsp;BC [[Battle of Issus]], in which [[Alexander the Great]] secured a decisive victory over [[Darius III of Persia]] and gained crucial leverage in his campaign against the [[Persian Empire]]. The painting is widely regarded as Altdorfer's masterpiece, and is one of the most famous examples of the type of Renaissance landscape painting known as the [[world landscape]], which here reaches an unprecedented grandeur.

[[William IV, Duke of Bavaria|Duke William IV of Bavaria]] commissioned ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' in 1528 as part of a set of historical pieces that was to hang in his [[Munich]] residence. Modern commentators suggest that the painting, through its abundant use of [[anachronism]], was intended to liken Alexander's heroic victory at Issus to the contemporary European conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In particular, the defeat of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] at the [[Siege of Vienna]] may have been an inspiration for Altdorfer. A religious undercurrent is detectable, especially in the extraordinary sky; this was probably inspired by the prophecies of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and contemporary concern within the Church about an impending [[apocalypse]]. ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus '' and four others that were part of William's initial set are in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] art museum in Munich.

[[Alexander III of Macedon]] (356–323&amp;nbsp;BC), best known as Alexander the Great, was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] king of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] who reigned from 336&amp;nbsp;BC until his death. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military tacticians and strategists in history,&lt;ref&gt;Corvisier; Childs, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and is presumed undefeated in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Heckel; Yardley, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polelle, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned for his military leadership and charisma, he always led his armies personally and took to the front ranks of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neilburg, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; By conquering the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and unifying [[Greece]], Egypt and [[Babylon]], he forged the largest empire of the [[ancient world]]&lt;ref&gt;Sacks; Murray; Bunson, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and effected the spread of [[Hellenization|Hellenism]] throughout Europe and Northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 211–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander embarked on his expedition to conquer the Persian Empire in the spring of 334&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name="Smith970"&gt;Smith, p. 970&lt;/ref&gt; having pacified the warring Greek states and consolidated his military might.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, pp. 28–35&lt;/ref&gt; During the first months of the Macedonian passage into Persian Asia Minor, [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] – king of Persia – largely ignored the presence of Alexander's 40,000&amp;nbsp;men. The [[Battle of the Granicus]], fought in May,&lt;ref name="Smith970" /&gt; was Persia's first major effort to confront the invaders, but resulted in an easy victory for Alexander. Over the next year, Alexander took most of western and coastal Asia Minor by forcing the capitulation of the [[satrap]]ies in his path.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; He continued inland, travelling northeast through [[Phrygia]] before turning southeast toward [[Cilicia]]. After passing the [[Cilician Gates]] in October, Alexander was delayed by fever in [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;Warry, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Darius meanwhile mustered an army of up to 100,000 (some ancient sources posit exaggerated figures of over 600,000)&lt;ref name="Romm48"&gt;Romm; Mensch, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and personally directed it over the eastern slopes of the [[Amanus Mountains]]. In early November, as Alexander proceeded about the [[Gulf of Issus]] from [[Mallus (city)|Mallus]] via [[Issus (town)|Issus]], the two armies inadvertently passed one another on opposite sides of the mountains.&lt;ref name="Buckley503" /&gt; This was decidedly to Darius' advantage: now at the rear of Alexander, he was able to prevent retreat and block the supply lines Alexander had established at Issus.&lt;ref&gt;Romm; Mensch, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until Alexander had encamped at [[Myriandrus]], a seaport on the southeastern shores of the Gulf of İskenderun, that he learned of the Persian position. He immediately retraced his route to the [[Pinarus River]], just south of Issus, to find Darius' force assembled along the northern bank.&lt;ref name="Buckley503"&gt;Buckley, p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle of Issus ensued.
[[File:Battle of Issus - initial deployment.svg|thumb|300px|alt=A military diagram. A river runs through the lower-left diagonal.

The Pinarus River separates the belligerents, and Issus is {{convert|7|mi}} to the north. Cavalry is concentrated on the shores of the Gulf of İskenderun (or Gulf of Issus) on both sides. Alexander devotes himself to a right approach with his Companion cavalry, having unseated the Persian foothill defence.]]
Darius' initial response was defensive: he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy's crossing. A core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established; as was usual for Persian kings, Darius positioned himself in the centre of this vanguard, in order that he might effectively dispatch commands to any part of his large army.&lt;ref&gt;Warry, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills, as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right, away from the coast. A mass of cavalry commanded by [[Nabarsanes]] occupied the Persian right.&lt;ref&gt;Savill, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander made a cautious and slow advance, intending to base his strategy on the structure of the Persian force. He led a flank of his [[Companion cavalry]] on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit.&lt;ref name="Savill34"&gt;Savill, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of the importance of the foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.&lt;ref name="Savill34" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warry34"&gt;Warry, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

When within missile range of the enemy, Alexander gave the order to charge.&lt;ref name="Savill34" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warry35"&gt;Warry, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He spearheaded the assault of his heavily armed Companion cavalry, who quickly made deep cuts into the Persian left flank. The Macedonian left wing, commanded by [[Parmenion]],&lt;ref name="Warry34" /&gt; was meanwhile driven back by Nabarsanes' large cavalry. The Macedonians' central [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] crossed the river and clashed with the renegade Greek mercenaries who fronted Darius' vanguard. As the Companion cavalry pushed further into the Persian left, the danger arose that Darius would exploit the gap that had formed between Alexander and the rest of his army. When he was satisfied that the left wing was crippled and no longer a threat, Alexander remedied the situation by moving the Companions to assault the Persian centre in the flank. Unable to handle the added pressure, the Persian vanguard was forced to withdraw from the river bank, allowing the Macedonian phalanx to continue their advance and lifting the pressure on Parmenion's left wing.&lt;ref name="Warry35" /&gt;

Upon realising that the onslaught of Alexander's Companion cavalry was unstoppable, Darius and his army fled. Many were killed in the rush, trampled by those who fled with them or collapsed with their horses&lt;!--what does this mean?--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Warry, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Some escaped to regions as remote as Egypt, and others reunited with Darius in the north.&lt;ref name="Savill35"&gt;Savill, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of darkness ended the chase after approximately {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}; Alexander then recalled his army and set about burying the dead. Darius' family were left behind in the Persian camp; it is reported that Alexander treated them well and reassured them of Darius' safety.&lt;ref name="Savill35" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warry, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Darius' royal chariot was found discarded in a ditch, as were his bow and shield.&lt;ref name="Savill35" /&gt;

Ancient sources present disparate casualty figures for the Battle of Issus. [[Plutarch]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]] approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, in contrast with the 450 Macedonian deaths reported by [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]].&lt;ref name="De Sélincourt121"&gt;De Sélincourt, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, it is probable that more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle;&lt;ref&gt;Warry, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy I]], who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.&lt;ref name="De Sélincourt121" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romm; Mensch, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macedonian conquest of Persia continued until 330&amp;nbsp;BC, when Darius was killed and Alexander took his title as king.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks; Murray; Bunson, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander died in 323&amp;nbsp;BC, having recently returned from campaigning in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The [[Alexander the Great#Death|cause of death]] remains a subject of debate.&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexander the Great and West Nile Virus Encephalitis (Letters)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no7/04-0039_104_396_320.htm |title=Alexander the Great and West Nile Virus Encephalitis (Replies) |author= |authorlink= |vauthors= |year= 2004|work= |publisher= CDC|pages= |language= |quote= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Previous work ===
[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 045.jpg|thumb|alt= A painting of St George slaying the dragon set in a dense forest in which the figures are dwarfed by the trees. A distant landscape is seen through a break.|''Saint George and the Dragon'' (1510)]]
[[Albrecht Altdorfer]] is regarded as one of the founders of Western [[landscape art]].&lt;ref&gt;Keane, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; He was a painter, [[etcher]], architect, and [[engraver]], and the leader of the [[Danube school]] of German art. As evidenced by such paintings as ''[[Saint George and the Dragon]]'' (1510) and ''[[commons:File:Albrecht Altdorfer 005.jpg|Allegory]]'' (1531), much of Altdorfer's work is characterised by an attachment to sprawling landscapes that dwarf the figures within them;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' epitomises this facet of his style. With reference to ''St George and the Dragon'' in particular, art historian Mark W. Roskill comments that "The accessory material of landscape [in Altdorfer's work] is played with and ornamentally elaborated so that it reverberates with the sense of a sequestered and inhospitable environment".&lt;ref&gt;Roskill, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by his travels around the [[Austrian Alps]] and the [[Danube River]],&lt;ref&gt;Earls, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer painted a number of landscapes that contain no figures at all, including ''[[commons:File:Albrecht Altdorfer 019.jpg|Landscape with a Footbridge]]'' (c. 1516) and ''[[commons:File:Altdorfer, Albrecht - Donaulandschaft mit Schloß Wörth.jpg|Danube Landscape near Regensburg]]'' (c. 1522–25). These were the first "pure" landscapes since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Altdorfer's landscapes were made with a vertical format, in contrast with the modern conception of the genre. The horizontal landscape was an innovation of Altdorfer's [[Flemish]] contemporary [[Joachim Patinir]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 039.jpg|thumb|left|A miniature from ''Triumphal Procession'' (1512–16)|alt=A miniature painting showing four brightly clothed men carrying a large banner which is painted with a complex battle scene]]
Altdorfer also produced a great deal of religious artwork, in reflection of his devout Catholicism. His most frequent subjects were the [[Virgin Mary]] and the life and [[crucifixion of Christ]]. As in ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'', these paintings often feature settings of great majesty and use the sky to convey symbolic meaning. This meaning is not uniform throughout Altdorfer's corpus – for example, the visage of the setting sun connotes loss and tragedy in ''[[:commons:File:Albrecht Altdorfer 027.jpg|Agony in the Garden]]'', but serves as "the emblem of power and glory" in ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus''.&lt;ref name="Silver204.5"&gt;Silver, pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Silver of ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'' explains that ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' is both similar to and in direct contrast with Altdorfer's previous work: "Instead of the peaceful landscape of retreat for Christian events or holy figures, this panel offers just the opposite: a battleground for one of ancient history's principal epoch-making encounters&amp;nbsp;... Yet despite its global or cosmic dimensions, the ''Battle of Issus'' still ''looks like'' Altdorfer's earlier, contemplative liminal landscapes of retreat, complete with craggy peaks, bodies of water, and distant castles."&lt;ref&gt;Silver, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Battle of Alexander'' is atypical of Altdorfer in its size and in that it depicts war, his  ''Triumphal Procession'' – a 1512–16 [[illuminated manuscript]] commissioned by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire]] – has been described as a conceptual antecedent.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 23, 199–202&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Procession'' was produced in parallel with the ''Triumph of Maximilian'', a series of 137 [[woodcut]]s collaboratively executed by Altdorfer, [[Hans Springinklee]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Leonhard Beck]] and [[Hans Leonhard Schäufelein|Hans Schäufelein]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuneo, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influences and commission ===
[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 036.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A panel from an altarpiece by Grünewald. On the right, the Virgin Mary gazes at the Christ Child while above her, in a sky blazing with light, God is seated on a throne surrounded by the Hosts of Heaven. To the left an orchestra of cherubim plays in a Gothic loggia.|Matthias Grünewald's ''The Virgin and Child with the Heavenly Host'' (c. 1515)]]
Altdorfer's most significant contemporary influence was [[Matthias Grünewald]] (c. 1470–1528). Art historian [[Horst W. Janson]] remarked that their paintings "show the same 'unruly' imagination".&lt;ref name="Janson145"&gt;Janson, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' – particularly the sky – have been compared to Grünewald's ''Heavenly Host above the Virgin and Child'', which forms part of his masterpiece, the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472–1553), also associated with the Danube school, was another important influence for Altdorfer. According to Roskill, works by Cranach from about 1500 "give a prominent role to landscape settings, using them as mood-enhancing backgrounds for portraits, and for images of hermits and visionary saints", and seem to play a "preparatory role" for the onset of pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Roskill, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer owed much of his style, particularly in his religious artwork, to [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528);&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 70–73&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Silver writes that Altdorfer's "use of convincing German landscapes in combination with celestial phenomena for his religious narrative" is "firmly tied" to a tradition "modeled by Albrecht Dürer."&lt;ref&gt;Silver, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William IV, Duke of Bavaria]] commissioned ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' in 1528.&lt;ref name="Davis91"&gt;Davis, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer was approximately 50 at the time, and was living in the [[Free Imperial City]] of [[Regensburg]].&lt;ref name="Hagen128"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of over a decade of involvement with the Regensburg city council, Altdorfer was offered the position of [[Burgomaster]] on 18 September 1528. He declined; the council annals reported his reasoning as such: "He much desires to execute a special work in Bavaria for my Serene Highness and gracious Lord, Duke [William]."&lt;ref name="Hagen128" /&gt; William probably wanted the painting for his newly built summer ''Lusthaus'' ("pleasure house") in the grounds of [[Munich Residence|his palace]] in [[Munich]], approximately {{convert|60|mi}} south of Regensburg.&lt;ref name="Davis91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagen128" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  There, it was to hang alongside seven other paintings with a similar format and subject matter, including [[Ludwig Refinger]]'s ''The Matyrdom of Marcus Curtius'', [[Melchior Feselen]]'s ''[[Battle of Alesia|The Siege of Alesia]] by Caesar'', and the painting of ''[[Battle of Cannae]]'' by [[Hans Burgkmair]] (1473–1531).&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagen131" &gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Another eight, each portraying a famous woman from history, were later added to the set, probably at the behest of the Duke's wife, Jacobaea of Baden.&lt;ref name="Hagen131" /&gt; Altdorfer's ''Susanna and the Elders'' (1526) was among these.&lt;ref&gt;Clanton, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earlier depictions ===
[[File:Alexandermosaic.jpg|thumb|alt=A large mosaic depicting an array of soldiers on horseback doing battle. Parts of it have been damaged or lost to time.|The Alexander Mosaic, as seen in the Naples National Archaeological Museum]]
Earlier depictions of the Battle of Issus are few. ''Battle of Issus'', a [[fresco]] by [[Philoxenus of Eretria]], is probably the first such. It was painted sometime around 310&amp;nbsp;BC for [[Cassander]] (c. 350–297&amp;nbsp;BC), who was one of Alexander the Great's successors.&lt;ref name="Kleiner142"&gt;Kleiner 2009, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander and Darius – each within a lance's length of the other – are pictured among a wild fray of mounted and downed soldiers. While Alexander maintains an aura of unshaken confidence, fear is etched in Darius' face, and his charioteer has already turned to rein his horses and escape.&lt;ref name="Kleiner142" /&gt; Roman author and natural philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]] claimed that Philoxenus' portrayal of the battle was "inferior to none".&lt;ref name="Kleiner142" /&gt; Some modern critics posit that ''Battle of Issus'' might not have been the work of Philoxenus, but of Helena of Egypt. One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece,&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad; Oppenheimer; Addiss, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summers, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the [[Temple of Peace, Rome|Temple of Peace]] during the time of [[Vespasian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy Chennus|Ptolemy Hephaestion]] ''New History'' (codex 190) [[Bibliotheca (Photius)|''Bibliotheca'' Photius]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alexander Mosaic]], a [[floor mosaic]] dating from c. 100 BC, is believed to be a "reasonably faithful" copy of ''Battle of Issus'',&lt;ref name="Kleiner142" /&gt; though an alternative view holds it might instead be a copy of a work painted by [[Apelles of Kos]],&lt;ref&gt;Kinzl, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt; who produced several portraits of Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; It measures {{convert|5.82|x|3.13|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, and consists of approximately 1.5&amp;nbsp;million [[tesserae]] (coloured tiles), each about {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} square. The mosaicist is unknown. Since the mosaic was not rediscovered until 1831, during excavations of [[Pompeii]]'s [[House of the Faun]],&lt;ref&gt;McKay, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer could never have seen it. It was later moved to the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Naples|Naples, Italy]], where it currently resides.

=== Description ===
[[File:BattleofIssusDetail1.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of [[Darius III of Persia]] in flight|alt=A figure on a chariot pulled by three horses, with soldiers on either side of the trail]]
''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' is painted on a [[limewood]] [[panel painting|panel]] measuring {{convert|158.4|x|120.3|cm|in|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinakothek.de/alte-pinakothek/sammlung/kuenstler/kuenstler_inc_en.php?inc=bild&amp;which=8303|title=''The Battle of Issus''|publisher=Alte Pinakothek|accessdate=10 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604061317/http://www.pinakothek.de/alte-pinakothek/sammlung/kuenstler/kuenstler_inc_en.php?inc=bild&amp;which=8303|archivedate=4 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portrays the moment of Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made to be the same size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene.&lt;ref name="Hagen133" /&gt; The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleiner510"&gt;Kleiner 2008, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of horse and foot soldiers immersed in a sea of spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad themselves and their horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts.&lt;ref name="Hagen130" /&gt; The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot. A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the far left. The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry.&lt;ref name="Hagen131"/&gt; The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene's centre.

Beyond is the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the island of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="Hagen132"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Here, a transition in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in the lower half of the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The [[Nile River]] meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the [[Nile Delta]].&lt;ref name="Hagen132" /&gt; South of Cyprus is the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which forms a [[land bridge]] between Africa and Southwest Asia. The [[Red Sea]] lies beyond,&lt;ref name="Hagen132" /&gt; eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.
[[File:BattleofIssusDetail2.jpg|thumb|Detail of the sun and the Nile River|alt=A blazing sun above blue-tinged mountains and water]]
A fierce sky caught in the dichotomy between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates more than a third of the painting.&lt;ref name="Hagen133"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the [[Tower of Babel]] are cloaked in shadow.

The painting's subject is explained in the tablet suspended from the heavens. The wording, probably supplied by William's court historian [[Johannes Aventinus]],&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; was originally in German but was later replaced by a Latin inscription. It translates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Alexander the Great defeating the last Darius, after 100,000 infantry and more than 10,000 cavalrymen had been killed amongst the ranks of the Persians. Whilst King Darius was able to flee with no more than 1,000 horsemen, his mother, wife, and children were taken prisoner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
No date is provided for the battle alongside these casualty figures. The lower left-hand corner features Altdorfer's [[monogram]] – an 'A' within an 'A' – and the lower edge of the tablet is inscribed with "&lt;small&gt;ALBRECHT ALTORFER ZU REGENSPVRG FECIT&lt;/small&gt;" ("Albrecht Altdorfer from Regensburg made [this]"). Tiny inscriptions on their chariot and harness identify Darius and Alexander, respectively.&lt;ref name="Janson544" /&gt; Each army bears a banner that reports both its total strength and its future casualties.&lt;ref name="Davis91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagen130"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis and interpretation ===
[[File:BattleofIssusDetail9.jpg|thumb|Detail of soldiers from both armies. Reinhart Koselleck comments that the Persians resemble the 16th-century Turks "from their feet to their turbans."]]

Anachronism is a major component of ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus''. By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men in Turkish battle dress, Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European–Ottoman conflict.&lt;ref name="Hagen128" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleiner510" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janson544"&gt;Janson; Janson, p. 544&lt;/ref&gt; In 1529 – the year of the painting's commissioning – the Ottoman forces under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] [[Siege of Vienna|laid siege]] to the [[Austria]]n city of [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]]&lt;ref name="Janson544" /&gt;, then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called 'the golden apple' by the Sultans. Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna, given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission.&lt;ref name="Hagen131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleiner510" /&gt;

In his ''Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time'', historian [[Reinhart Koselleck]] discusses Altdorfer's representation of time in a more philosophical light. After differentiating between the superficial anachronism found in the casualty figures on the army banners and the deeper anachronism ingrained in the painting's contemporary context, he posits that the latter type is less a superimposition of one historical event over another and more an acknowledgement of the recursive nature of history. With reference to Koselleck, Kathleen Davis argues: "...&amp;nbsp;for [Altdorfer], 4th-century Persians look like 16th-century Turks not because he does not know the difference, but because the difference does not matter&amp;nbsp;... The ''Alexanderschlacht'', in other words, exemplifies a premodern, ''untemporalized'' sense of time and a lack of historical consciousness&amp;nbsp;... Altdorfer's historical overlays evince an [[eschatology|eschatological]] vision of history, evidence that the 16th century (and by degrees also the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) remained locked in a static, constant temporality that proleptically saturates the future as always a repetition of the same&amp;nbsp;... In such a system there can be no ''event'' as such: anticipation and arrival are together sucked into the black hole of sacred history, which is not temporalized because its time is essentially undifferentiated&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Featured alongside the anachronism in ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' is a genuine lack of historicity. Altdorfer demonstrates minimal hesitance in neglecting the painting's historical integrity for the sake of its heroic style, in spite of the pains he took to research the battle. That the Persian army was up to twice the size of the Macedonian army is not clear, and the relative positioning of the soldiers as reported by ancient sources has been disregarded. According to art critic Rose-Marie Hagen, "The artist was faithful to the historical truth only when it suited him, when historical facts were compatible with the demands of his composition."&lt;ref name="Hagen130"&gt;Hagen; Hagen, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Hagen also notes the historically baseless inclusion of women on the battlefield, attributing it to Altdorfer's "passion for invention" and saying they "look like German courtly ladies, dressed for a hunting party" in their feathered [[toque]]s.&lt;ref name="Hagen130" /&gt;

Altdorfer's primary point of reference in his research was probably [[Hartmann Schedel]]'s ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (''Schedelsche Weltchronik''), an illustrated world history published in [[Nuremberg]] in 1493. Schedel was a physician, humanist, historian and cartographer, and his ''Chronicle'' was one of the first books produced on the [[printing press]]. With a heavy reliance on the Bible, it recounts the [[Six ages of the world|seven ages]] of human history,&lt;ref name="Oman116"&gt;Oman, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] to the birth of Christ and ending with the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt; Kobialka, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Altdorfer's statistics for the battle of Issus mirror those of Schedel. Furthermore, the errors in Schedel's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are also present in ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'': the island of Cyprus is noticeably oversized, and both the mountain rise in the painting's centre and the range adjacent to the Nile do not exist.&lt;ref name="Hagen132" /&gt; Since the ''Chronicle'' describes Alexander's victory over the Persians in terms of its proximity to Tarsus and omits mention of Issus, it is likely that the cityscape by the sea is intended to be the former city rather than the latter. Issus in the 16th century was minor and relatively unknown, whereas Tarsus was renowned for its having been a major centre of learning and philosophy in Roman times. Tarsus was also said to be the birthplace of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]] [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], which may explain the presence of the church towers in Altdorfer's portrayal.&lt;ref name="Hagen132" /&gt; Another source may have been the writings of [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], a 1st-century Roman historian who presents inflated figures for the number of killed and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armies.&lt;ref name="Hagen130" /&gt;

The sky bears overt metaphorical significance and is the centrepiece of the painting's symbolism. Alexander, identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun, finds his victory in the sun's rays; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon, a symbol of the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner 2009, p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; Considered in terms of the painting's contemporary context, the sun's triumph over the moon represents [[Christendom]]'s victory over the [[Islamism]] of the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Silver204.5" /&gt; [[eschatology|Eschatological]] meaning, probably inspired by prophecies in the [[Book of Daniel]], is imbued in the heavenly setting. In particular, [[Daniel 7]] predicts the rise and fall of four kingdoms before the [[Second Coming]]; these were thought to be [[Babylon]], [[Persia]], Greece, and Rome at the time of the painting's creation. Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece, and thus as an event of cosmic significance.&lt;ref name="Silver204.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagen133" /&gt; The battle also marked a progression toward the [[Eschatology|end of the world]] – an important theological concern in the 16th century, given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the [[papacy]]. As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic, Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and was surely aware of this trend of eschatological thought. Schedel, too, had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh.&lt;ref name="Oman116" /&gt; It may therefore be inferred that the sky's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well.&lt;ref name="Hagen133" /&gt;

''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' remained part of the royal collection of the Dukes of Bavaria for centuries. By the late 18th century, it was regularly featured in public galleries at the [[Schleissheim Palace]]. The painting was one of 72 taken to Paris in 1800 by the invading armies of [[Napoleon I]]  (1769–1821),&lt;ref name="Alte"&gt;Alte Pinakothek, pp. 24–29&lt;/ref&gt; who was a noted admirer of Alexander the Great.&lt;ref name="Hagen130" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Louvre]] held it until 1804, when Napoleon declared himself Emperor of France and took it for his own use. When the [[Prussian]]s captured the [[Château de Saint-Cloud]] in 1814 as part of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]], they supposedly found the painting hanging in Napoleon's bathroom.&lt;ref name="Wood22"&gt;Wood, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' and 26 others taken in the 1800 invasion were subsequently restored to the [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King of Bavaria]] in 1815.&lt;ref name="Alte" /&gt; Five of the paintings in William IV's original set of eight – including ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' – later passed from the royal collection to the [[Alte Pinakothek]] art museum in [[Munich, Germany]], where they remain; the other three are in the [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Stockholm]], having been looted by the Swedish army in the [[Thirty Years War]] of 1618–1648.&lt;ref name="Svanberg"&gt;Svanberg, pp. 70–86&lt;/ref&gt; ''Susannah and the Elders'' is the only other work by Altdorfer in the Alte Pinakothek.

[[File:Horatius Cocles Stopping King Porsenna's Army outside Rome (Ludwig Refinger) - Nationalmuseum - 17244.tif|thumb|left|''[[Horatius Cocles]] Stopping King [[Lars Porsenna|Porsenna]]'s Army outside Rome'', by [[Ludwig Refinger]]. One of the other paintings in the historical cycle that ''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' originally belonged to, currently in the [[National Museum of Sweden]]]]Contextually, the painting forms part of the [[Northern Renaissance]], a resurgence of classical humanism and culture in northern Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Renaissance induced a new kind of social individualism which Altdorfer expressed through the heroic emphasis on Alexander and Darius, and which is reflected in the specifics of the painting's commission and by the subjects of its companion pieces: "During the Renaissance people no longer saw themselves solely as members of a social group, as the citizens of a town, or as sinners before God in whose eyes all were equal. They had become aware of the unique qualities that distinguished one person from another. Unlike the Middle Ages, the Renaissance celebrated the individual. Altdorfer may have painted row after row of apparently identical warriors, but the spectators themselves would identify with Alexander and Darius, figures who had names, whose significance was indicated by the cord which hung down from the tablet above them."&lt;ref name="Hagen131" /&gt;

Altdorfer was not only a pioneer of landscape, but also a practitioner of early incarnations of the [[Romanticism]] and [[expressionism]] which impacted the arts so greatly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Kenneth Clark]] writes of Altdorfer and contemporaries Grünewald and [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], "They are what we now call 'expressionist' artists, a term which is not as worthless as it sounds, because, in fact, the symbols of expressionism are remarkably consistent, and we find in the work of these early 16th-century landscape painters not only the same spirit but the same shapes and iconographical motives which recur in the work of such recent expressionists as [[van Gogh]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Graham Sutherland]] and [[Walt Disney]]."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; According to art critic Pia F. Cuneo, "Altdorfer's construction of landscape on a cosmic scale" in the ''Battle of Alexander at Issus'', and his "spiritual and aesthetic affinities with [[Romanticism]] and Modern art (in particular, [[German Expressionism]])", "have been especially singled out for praise".&lt;ref name="Cuneo186"&gt;Cuneo, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Battle of Alexander at Issus'' is typically considered to be Altdorfer's [[masterpiece]]. Cuneo states that the painting is usually "considered in splendid isolation from its fifteen other companion pieces, based on the assumption that it either metonymically stands in for the entire cycle, or that its perceived aesthetic predominance merits exclusive focus."&lt;ref name="Cuneo186" /&gt; German writer [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]] (1772–1829) was one of many who saw the painting in the Louvre and marvelled, calling it a "small painted [[Iliad]]".&lt;ref name="Wood22" /&gt; Reinhart Koselleck comments that Altdorfer's depiction of the thousands of soldiers was executed with "a mastery previously unknown",&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; and Kathleen Davis describes the painting as "epochal in every sense".&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

'''The Fugs''' are a band formed in New York City in late 1964&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefugs.com/history2.html Thefugs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; by the poets [[Ed Sanders]] and [[Tuli Kupferberg]], with [[Ken Weaver (musician)|Ken Weaver]] on drums. Soon afterward, they were joined by [[Peter Stampfel]] and Steve Weber of the [[Holy Modal Rounders]]. Kupferberg named the band from a [[euphemism]] for ''[[fuck]]'' used in [[Norman Mailer]]'s novel ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.

The band is known for its comedic, even lewd, nature but also earned fame through their persistent anti-Vietnam War sentiment during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some 1969 correspondence found inside an FBI file on the rock group [[The Doors]] called the New York band the "most vulgar thing the human mind could possibly conceive."&lt;ref&gt;[https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/bj7x85/fbi-foia-the-fugs-the-doors-v24n8 Leopold, Jason, "Inside the FBI's File on The Fugs: The 'Most Vulgar Thing the Human Mind Could Possibly Conceive'" Retrieved Nov. 12, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Aside from derision for their "scatological"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Patrick|date=Spring 2011|title=Clamor of the Godz: Radical Incompetence in 1960s Rock|journal=American Music|publisher=University of Illinois Press|volume=29|issue=1|pages=35–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; lyrics, the Fugs have also been labeled "avant-rock."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=812592|title=Avant-Rock in the Classroom on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The band's original core members, Ed Sanders, Tuli Kupferberg, and Ken Weaver, were joined at various times in the 1960s by a number of others, some of whom were noted session musicians or members of other bands. These included Weber and Stampfel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furious.com/perfect/tuli.html Furious.com]&lt;/ref&gt; bassist John Anderson, guitarist Vinny Leary, guitarist Peter Kearney, keyboardist Lee Crabtree, guitarist Jon Kalb, guitarist [[Stefan Grossman]], singer and guitarist Jake Jacobs, guitarist [[Eric Gale]], bassist [[Chuck Rainey]], keyboardist Robert Banks, bassist Charles Larkey, guitarist Ken Pine, guitarist [[Danny Kortchmar]], clarinetist [[Perry Robinson]], bassist Bill Wolf, and drummer Bob Mason.

For most of their career, the Fugs were composed of the primary singer-songwriters Sanders and, until his death, Kupferberg; the composer, songwriter, guitarist and long-time [[Allen Ginsberg]] collaborator Steven Taylor; singer-songwriter and percussionist Coby Batty; and Scott Petito, a musician and music producer.

The band signed a record contract with [[ESP-Disk]] in 1965. The Fugs said that "our royalty rate was less than 3%, one of the lower percentages in the history of western civilization".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fugs|first=The|title=History of the Fugs|url=http://www.thefugs.com/history2.html|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the label, [[Bernard Stollman]], has frequently faced accusation of not paying [[royalties]] to artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Jason|title=Always in Trouble: An Oral History of ESP-Disk', the Most Outrageous Record Label in America|year=2012|publisher=Wesleyan|isbn=9780819571595|url=http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/dignity-conviction-and-mrs-stollmans-checkbook/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1967, the group was signed to [[Atlantic Records]] and recorded one album, ''The Fugs Eat It'', but it was never released.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Ed. [http://www.thefugs.com/history3.html  "History of the Fugs"]. TheFugs.com. Retrieved 27 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
A [[satirical]] rock band with a political slant, the Fugs have performed at various war protests — against the Vietnam War and since the 1980s at events around other U.S. involved wars. The band's often frank and humorous lyrics about sex, drugs, and politics&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; occasionally generated hostile reactions, most notably from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the late 1960s. The group is referenced several times in the F.B.I. file on the [[The Doors|Doors]]; an excerpt mentions eleven songs from ''The Fugs First Album'' that are "vulgar and repulsive and are most suggestive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vault.fbi.gov/The%20Doors/The%20Doors%20Part%201%20of%201/view |title=The Doors Part 1 of 1 |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 interview with National Public Radio, Ed Sanders read a leaflet from an August 1965 show: "The Fugs present: Night of napalm, songs against the war, rock n' roll bomb shrieks, heavy metal orgasms! Watch all The Fugs die in a napalm raid!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/05/152029486/fug-you-the-wild-life-of-ed-sanders|title='Fug You': The Wild Life of Ed Sanders|last=Kalish|first=Jon|date=May 4, 2012|website=NPR|publisher=NPR|access-date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their participation in the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]]'s 1967 [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam#March on the Pentagon|March on the Pentagon]], at which they and others purportedly attempted to encircle and levitate the Pentagon, is chronicled in [[Norman Mailer]]'s book ''[[The Armies of the Night]]''. A recording of this event is featured on the Fugs' 1968 album, ''Tenderness Junction,'' entitled "Exorcising the Evil Spirits from the Pentagon Oct. 21, 1967''."''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;The Fugs. "Exorcising the Evil Spirits From Within the Pentagon Oct. 21, 1967." ''Tenderness Junction,'' Reprise, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand, Sanders and Kupferberg had prepared an elaborate exorcism ritual, and rented a flatbed truck along with a sound system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As is heard on the album, the two gathered a large crowd in front of the Pentagon and repeatedly chanted, "Out, demons, out!"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

One of their better-known songs is an adaptation of [[Matthew Arnold]]'s poem "[[Dover Beach]]." Others were settings of [[William Blake]]'s poems "[[Ah! Sun-flower]]" and "How Sweet I Roam'd." Another, "Nothing," is a paraphrasing of the Yiddish folk song "Bulbes."{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

After pursuing individual projects over the years, in 1984 Sanders and Kupferberg decided to re-form the band and stage a series of Fugs reunion concerts.&lt;ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"&gt;Kot, Greg. "The Fugs Still Riotous After All These Years". ''Chicago Tribune'', November 27, 2012. [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-11-27/entertainment/chi-fugs-interview-20121127_1_fugs-tuli-kupferberg-coby-batty]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 15, 1988, at the Byrdcliff Barn in Woodstock, New York, the Fugs performed one of their first real reunion concerts. This incarnation of the Fugs included, at various times, the guitarist and singer Steve Taylor (who was also Allen Ginsberg's teaching assistant at the Naropa Institute), the drummer and singer Coby Batty, the bassist [[Mark Kramer]], the guitarist Vinny Leary (who had contributed to the first two original Fugs albums), and the bassist and keyboardist Scott Petito. The re-formed Fugs performed concerts at numerous locations in the United States and Europe over the next several years.

In 1994 the band intended to perform a series of concerts in [[Woodstock, New York]], (where Sanders had lived for many years) to commemorate the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]], which had actually occurred near the town of Bethel, some 50 miles away. They learned that a group of promoters were planning to stage [[Woodstock '94]] that August near Saugerties, about 8 miles from Woodstock, and that this festival would be much more tightly controlled and commercialized than the original. Consequently, The Fugs decided to stage their own August 1994 concerts as "The Real Woodstock Festival", in an atmosphere more in keeping with the spirit of the 1969 festival. The basic Fugs roster of Sanders, Kupferberg, Taylor, Batty, and Petito performed in this series of concerts with additional vocal support from Amy Fradon and Leslie Ritter and also with appearances by Allen Ginsberg and [[Country Joe McDonald]]. In 2003, the group released ''The Fugs Final CD (Part 1)'' with positive feedback. In 2004, The Fugs began to record ''Be Free: The Fugs Final CD (Part 2)''.

In 2008 their song "CIA Man" is featured in the movie ''[[Burn After Reading]]'', directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. In 2009, Kupferberg suffered two [[stroke]]s, the latter of which severely hindered his eyesight. He was under constant care, but was able to finish recording his tracks for ''Be Free'' in his New York City apartment. A benefit for Kupferberg was held in [[Brooklyn]], New York, in February 2010, featuring all of the Fugs minus Kupferberg, as well as [[Lou Reed]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Patti Smith Group]] guitarist [[Lenny Kaye]], and others. ''Be Free: The Fugs Final CD (Part 2)'' was released on February 23, 2010. The album art, designed by Sanders, featured a snail reading Allen Ginsberg's poem "[[Howl]]". The album was produced by Taylor and Sanders.

Kupferberg died on July 12, 2010, in [[Manhattan]], at the age of 86.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2010b.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com], accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in one of his last interviews, he told ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine, "Nobody who lived through the '50s thought the '60s could've existed. So there's always hope."&lt;ref&gt;''Mojo'', no. 203, October 2010, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining Fugs from time to time seriously consider further performances.&lt;ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefugs.com/history3.html TheFugs.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 2011, the four remaining Fugs performed at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London as part of the annual Meltdown Festival, curated that year by [[Ray Davies]] of the [[The Kinks|Kinks]]. Their set received a four-star review in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/the-fugs-review ''Guardian'' Review of the Fugs].&lt;/ref&gt;

They performed at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland on November 30, 2012, and at the City Winery in Chicago on December 1, 2012 .

==Film appearances==

The band can be seen performing in the [[cult film]] ''[[Chappaqua (film)|Chappaqua]]'' (1967) by [[Conrad Rooks]]. [[Tuli Kupferberg]] made appearances in ''[[W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism]]'' (1971) by [[Dušan Makavejev]] and played God in ''[[Voulez-vous coucher avec God?]]'' (1972) by [[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]] and Jack Christie. Their song, CIA Man, can be heard during the closing credits of the black comedy [[Burn After Reading]] (2008) by the [[Coen brothers|Coen Brothers]].

In [[cartography]], a '''trap street''' is a [[fictitious entry]] in the form of a misrepresented [[street]] on a [[map]], often outside the area the map nominally covers, for the purpose of "trapping" potential [[copyright]] violators of the map who, if caught, would be unable to explain the inclusion of the "trap street" on their map as innocent. On maps that are not of streets, other "copyright trap" features (such as [[Phantom_settlement|nonexistent towns]], or mountains with the wrong elevations) may be inserted or altered for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Adams. [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1058/do-maps-have-copyright-traps-to-permit-detection-of-unauthorized-copies ''Do maps have 'copyright traps' to permit detection of unauthorized copies?''] ''The Straight Dope'', August 16, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trap streets are often nonexistent streets; but sometimes, rather than actually depicting a street where none exists, a map will misrepresent the nature of a street in a fashion that can still be used to detect copyright violators but is less likely to interfere with navigation. For instance, a map might add nonexistent bends to a street, or depict a major street as a narrow lane, without changing its location or its connections to other streets.

Trap streets are rarely acknowledged by publishers. One known case is a popular driver's atlas for the city of [[Athens]], [[Greece]], which has a warning inside its front cover that potential copyright violators should beware of trap streets.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|el|Αττική}}" Greek-language map book published by Nik. &amp; Ioan Fotis O.E. {{clarify|date=August 2014}} (Νικ. &amp; Ιωάν. Φωτής Ο.Ε. {{clarify|date=August 2014}}, http://www.fotismaps.gr {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107170139/http://www.fotismaps.gr/ |date=2012-11-07 }}), Greek-language warning inside front cover&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

In an edition of the [[BBC Two]] programme ''[[Map Man]]'', first broadcast 17 October 2005, a spokesperson for the [[Geographers' A-Z Map Company]] claimed there are "about 100" trap streets included in the [[London A-Z]] Street atlas. One such street, "Bartlett Place", a genuine but misnamed walkway (named after Kieran Bartlett, an employee at Geographers’ A-Z Map Company), was identified in the programme and will appear in future editions under its real name, Broadway Walk.

It has been suggested that [[Google Earth]] placed [[Sandy Island, New Caledonia]] as the geographical analog to a trap street, although historical evidence implies that it originated as a cartographical error and [[Google]] simply passed the error along.

== Legal issues ==
Trap streets are not copyrightable under the federal law of the [[United States]].  In ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;796 F.Supp. 729, [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|E.D.N.Y.]], 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=leagle.com|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19921525796FSupp729_11403/NESTER'S%20MAP%20&amp;%20GUIDE%20CORP.%20v.%20HAGSTROM%20MAP%20CO|date=|accessdate=2015-11-14|title=Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[United States]] federal court found that copyright traps are not themselves protectable by [[copyright]]. There, the court stated: "[t]o treat 'false' facts interspersed among actual facts and represented as actual facts as fiction would mean that no one could ever reproduce or copy actual facts without risk of reproducing a false fact and thereby violating a copyright&amp;nbsp;... If such were the law, information could never be reproduced or widely disseminated."  (Id. at 733)

In a 2001 case, [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. In this case, the identifying "fingerprints" were not deliberate errors but rather stylistic features such as the width of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/06/andrewclark| title=Copying maps costs AA £20m| last=Clark| first=Andrew| date=2001-03-06| work=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case, the [[Singapore Land Authority]] sued [[Streetdirectory.com|Virtual Map]], an online publisher of maps, for infringing on its copyright. The Singapore Land Authority stated in its case that there were deliberate errors in maps they had provided to Virtual Map years earlier. Virtual Map denied this and insisted that it had done its own [[cartography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hin|first1=Peh Aik|title=Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority and another application[2009] 2 SLR(R) 558; [2009] SGCA 2|url=http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/cases-in-articles/intellectual-property/1571-virtual-map-singapore-pte-ltd-v-singapore-land-authority-and-another-application-2009-2-slr-r-558-2009-sgca-2|website=www.singaporelaw.sg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102018/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/cases-in-articles/intellectual-property/1571-virtual-map-singapore-pte-ltd-v-singapore-land-authority-and-another-application-2009-2-slr-r-558-2009-sgca-2|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The 2010 novel ''[[Kraken (novel)|Kraken]]'' by [[China Miéville]] features the trap streets of the ''[[Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas|London A-Z]]'' being places where the magical denizens of the city can exist without risk of being disturbed by normal folk.

A 2013 film, ''[[Trap Street (film)|Trap Street]]'', inverts the usual meaning of a ''trap street'', becoming a real street which is deliberately obscured or removed from a map—and anyone who attempts to identify it by placing it on public record is then "trapped".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/trap-street-review-venice-toronto-1200601404|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|title=Venice Film Review: ‘Trap Street’|author=Chang, Justin|accessdate=2014-05-11|date=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Face the Raven]]" features a hidden street where alien asylum seekers have taken shelter. Due to a psychic field that subconsciously makes observers ignore it, outsiders consider it a trap street when they see it on maps. One scene involves the character [[Clara Oswald]] discussing the definition of "trap street". The episode's working title was also "Trap Street".

==History==
The Twenty Melbourne Painters Society (TMPS) was established in 1918.&lt;ref name="ArtAlmanac"&gt;{{cite web|title=Twenty Melbourne Painters Society Inc: The 95th Annual Exhibition|url=http://www.art-almanac.com.au/twenty-melbourne-painters-society-inc-the-95th-annual-exhibition/|website=Art Almanac|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was a break-away group from the [[Victorian Artists Society]], leaving to follow [[Australian Tonalism|Australian Tonalist]] [[Max Meldrum]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://twentymelbournepainterssociety.com.au/home/history/|website=Twenty Melbourne Painters Society Inc|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, within the first year of formation, the Twenty Melbourne Painters held their first exhibition.&lt;ref name="JennyPihan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tradition of Excellence that Began with Artistic Rebellion.|url=http://www.jennypihanfineart.com.au/content.asp?p=artists%7CTWENTY%20MELBOURNE%20PAINTERS%20SOCIETY%20INC.|website=Jenny Pihan Fine Art|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is limited to 20 members&lt;ref name="weekendnotes"&gt;{{cite web|title=98th Twenty Melbourne Painters Society's Annual Exhibition|url=https://www.weekendnotes.com/twenty-melbourne-painters-societys-annual-exhibition/|website=weekend notes|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is by invitation.&lt;ref name="JennyPihan"/&gt;
