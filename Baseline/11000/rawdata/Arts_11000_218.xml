[[File:Adrian-Ross-1904.jpg|thumb|right|Ross in 1904]]
'''Arthur Reed Ropes''' (23 December 1859 – 11 September 1933), better known under the pseudonym '''Adrian Ross''', was a prolific writer of lyrics, contributing songs to more than sixty British [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedies]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  He was the most important lyricist of the British stage during a career that spanned five decades.  At a time when few shows had long runs, nineteen of his [[West End theatre|West End]] shows ran for over 400 performances.

Starting out in the late 1880s, Ross wrote the lyrics for the earliest British musical theatre hits, including ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894) and ''[[The Circus Girl]]'' (1896).  Ross next wrote the lyrics for a string of hit musicals, beginning with ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898), ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899), ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900) and ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901) and continuing without a break through [[World War I]].  He also wrote the English lyrics for a series of hit adaptations of European operettas beginning with ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' in 1907.

During World War I, Ross was one of the founders of the [[Performing Rights Society]].  He continued writing until 1930, producing several more successes after the war.  He also wrote the popular novel ''The Hole of the Pit'' and a number of short stories.

==Life and career==
Ross was born in [[Lewisham]], London.  He was the youngest son and fourth child of Ellen Harriet Ropes née Hall, of [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], and William Hooper Ropes, a Russia merchant.  Ross's parents lived in [[Normandy]], France, but sent him to school in London at Priory House School in [[Clapton, London|Clapton]], [[Mill Hill School]], and the [[City of London School]].  He later attended [[King's College, Cambridge]], where, in 1881, he won the Chancellor's Medal for English verse for his poem "Temple Bar", and also won the Members' Prize for the English essay.  In 1883 he graduated with a first-class degree, winning the Lightfoot scholarship for history and a Whewell scholarship for international law.  He was elected a fellow of the College.&lt;ref name=Venn&gt;{{acad|id=RPS878AR|name=Ropes, Arthur Reed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Parker, J., rev. Katharine Chubbuck. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35826 "Ropes, Arthur Reed (1859–1933)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 14 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[Cambridge University]] graduate and [[academia|don]], teaching history and poetry from 1884 to 1890 and writing serious and comic verse of his own, the first volume of which was published in 1884. In 1889, he published "A Sketch of the History of Europe". He was also a translator of French and German literature under his own name.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He created the fictitious name "Adrian Ross" due to a concern that writing musicals would compromise his academic career.&lt;ref name=Kenrick&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/who7c.htm "Who's Who in Musicals: Ross, Adrian"], Musicals101.com: The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[Image:Moroccobound1.jpg|left|thumb|A. C. Seymour and [[Letty Lind]] in ''[[Morocco Bound]]'']]
During a brief illness in 1883 after catching cold at the University Boat Race, Ross used the lonely time in bed to write the libretto of an entertainment entitled ''A Double Event''. This was produced at [[St. George's Hall, London]] in 1884 with music by [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]], and Ross used the name "Arthur Reed". His next work for the stage, also as Arthur Reed, was the book and lyrics for a [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesque]], ''Faddimir'' (1889 at the [[Opera Comique]]), with music by fellow Cambridge graduate, [[F. Osmond Carr]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

The piece earned enough praise so that the impresario [[George Edwardes]] commissioned the two to write another burlesque, together with the comic actor John Lloyd Shine, called ''Joan of Arc''.  Songs from the piece included "I Went to Find Emin", "Round the Town", and "Jack the Dandy-O".  ''Joan of Arc'' opened in 1891 at the Opera Comique starring [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]] and [[Marion Hood]]; he wrote under the pseudonym Adrian Ross, which he used for the rest of his career. The piece was a hit, lasting for almost eight hundred performances, and Ross resigned from Cambridge.  To supplement his income from theatre writing, Ross became a contributor to such journals as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', ''Sketch'', ''Sphere'' and ''The World'', and he joined the staff of ''Ariel'' in 1891–1892.  He wrote in ''[[Tatler (1901)|The Tatler]]'' under the pseudonym Bran Pie and in 1893 published an edition of [[Lady Mary Wortley Montague]]'s Letters. He also published numerous French texts for the Pitt Press series.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Ross and Carr's next work, in collaboration with [[James T. Tanner]], was ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892), a smart, contemporary tale of backstage and society goings-on.  This left behind the earlier Gaiety burlesques and helped set the new fashion for the series of modern-dress [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] shows that quickly spread to other theatres and dominated British musical theatre.  For his next piece, ''[[Morocco Bound]]'' (1893, with the song "Marguerite from Monte Carlo"), Ross concentrated on writing lyrics, leaving the "book" mostly to Arthur Branscombe.  This proved to be his most successful model through most of his career.&lt;ref name=Archive&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/british/authors/ross.html "Adrian Ross" profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906072755/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/british/authors/ross.html |date=6 September 2006 }} at the British Musical Theatre site of The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 7 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The position of "lyricist" was relatively new, as previously the writers of libretti would invariably write the lyrics themselves.  As the new Edwardes-produced [[Edwardian Musical Comedy|"musical comedies"]] took the place of burlesque, [[comic opera]] and [[operetta]] on the stage, Ross and [[Harry Greenbank]] established the usefulness of a separate lyricist.

[[Image:Shopgirl1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Souvenir – 1st anniversary of the opening]]

===Gaiety and Daly Theatre musicals===
Ross contributed lyrics to almost all of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]'s shows, beginning with ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894, with his song "Brown of Colorado") and ''[[Go-Bang]]'' in 1895.  He wrote over two thousand lyrics and produced lyrics for over sixty musicals thereafter, including most of the hit musicals through [[World War I]].  In 1896, he contributed to the Gaiety Theatre hit, ''[[The Circus Girl]]''.  He also wrote lyrics for the one-act [[comic opera]], ''[[Weather or No]]'' (1896), which played as a companion piece to ''[[The Mikado]]'' at the [[Savoy Theatre]], as well as several other [[Savoy operas]], such as ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'' (1894), ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]], or The Court of Vignolia'' (1897), ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein|The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[Image:Dollarprincess.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lily Elsie]] in ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'']]
Ross also wrote lyrics for the shows at [[Daly's Theatre]].  His lyrics to additional numbers for ''[[An Artist's Model]]'' (1895) and ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896) were successful enough so that Edwardes asked him for major contributions to the rest, beginning with ''[[A Greek Slave]]'' (1898), especially after the death of the theatre's early chief lyricist, Harry Greenbank.  These included a series of enormous successes, including ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899), ''[[The Messenger Boy]]'' (1900), ''Kitty Grey'' (1901), ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901), ''[[A Country Girl]]'' (1902), ''[[The Girl from Kays]]'' (1903), ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1903), ''[[The Cingalee]]'' (1904), ''[[The Spring Chicken]]'' (1905) and ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907).  In 1901, Ross married Ethel Wood, an actress, and the couple produced a son and two daughters. The family resided in Church Street, [[Kensington]].&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt; Also in 1901, he collaborated with his sister Mary Emily Ropes on the children's story, ''On Peter's Island''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Adrian|contributor-last=Dalby|contributor-first=Richard|contribution=Preface|title=The Hole of the Pit: And by One, by Two and by Three|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5i68QO9hh0C&amp;pg=PA10|date=2013|publisher=The Oleander Press|isbn=978-0-900891-86-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Edwardes found success, beginning in 1907, in mounting English-language versions of the new generation of continental European [[operettas]] to the London stage, Ross wrote the English lyrics for the adaptations, often with libretti by [[Basil Hood]].  His words to the songs in ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1907) became the standard English version of that piece, performed throughout the world for many decades.  Other Continental musicals that Ross anglicised included ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' (1908), ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1909), ''[[The Girl in the Train]]'' (1910), ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911), ''[[The Girl on the Film]]'' (1913) and ''[[The Marriage Market]]'' (1913), most of which had enduring success throughout the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt; Other successes from this period were the musicals ''[[King of Cadonia]]'' (1908), ''[[Havana (Edwardian musical)|Havana]]'' (1908), ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909), ''[[The Quaker Girl]]'' (1911), and ''[[Betty (musical)|Betty]]'' in 1915.  In addition, many of Ross's most successful pieces had additional successes on tour in Britain, in America and elsewhere.  His biggest hits on Broadway included ''The Girl from Kays'' (1903), ''The Merry Widow'' (1907 and many revivals), ''Havana'' (1909), ''Madame Sherry'' (1911) and ''The Quaker Girl'' (1911).

===Later career===

In 1914, Ross was one of the founders of the Performing Rights Society.&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt; Ross continued, after Edwardes's death, to write lyrics for numerous shows at the Gaiety, Daly's, the [[Adelphi Theatre]], and other London theatres.  During [[World War I]], he continued to produce hits, writing the lyrics for the musical adaptation of a French comedy, ''[[Theodore &amp; Co]]'' (1916), the musical ''[[The Boy (musical)|The Boy]]'' (1917), [[André Messager]]'s adaptation of [[Booth Tarkington]]'s ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (operetta)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' (1919, "Philomel") and contributed to ''[[A Southern Maid]]'' (1920).  He also worked on the [[revue]]s ''Three Cheers'' (1917) with [[Herman Darewski]], ''Airs and Graces'' with [[Lionel Monckton]], and, years later, ''Sky High'' for the [[London Palladium|Palladium Theatre]], but these were only diversions from his chief focus of writing lyrics for musicals and operetta adaptations.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt; In 1922, he wrote both the book and the lyrics for the popular English version of ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus]]'', the international hit based on [[Franz Schubert]]'s music and life, produced in Britain as ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus|Lilac Time]]''.  In 1927, Ross and Dudley Glass, an Australian composer, collaborated on a musical based on ''The Beloved Vagabond'' by [[W. J. Locke]].  His last works were produced in 1930: the English adaptation of the operetta ''Friederike'' for the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodanw.com/shows_f/frederica.htm "Frederica"], The Guide to Musical Theatre (NODA)&lt;/ref&gt; and a musical based on ''The Toymaker of Nuremberg'' by Austin Strong, which was produced as a Kingsway Theatre Christmas entertainment.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;

Ross collaborated extensively with the foremost British-based composers of musical theatre active during his productive period, including Carr, [[Ivan Caryll]], Monckton, [[Leslie Stuart]] and [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]], and later [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]], [[Harold Fraser-Simson]], [[Howard Talbot]] and Messager.  Sixteen of his musicals ran for more than 400 performances.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt; Ross tailored each song to fit the style required by the producer – songs for the Gaiety were different from those for Daly's. Many of his most popular shows, songs (both for the theatre and beyond it) and adaptations are still performed today.&lt;ref name=Archive/&gt;

===Fiction and last years===
Ross also wrote the popular horror novel ''The Hole of the Pit'' and a number of short stories. Set in 1645 during the [[English Civil War]], the novel tells of a loathsome entity that inhabits a flooded pit amid the marshes surrounding a castle. The book is notable for its depth of characterisation – especially of the compassionate young narrator, a [[Puritan]] scholar who has refused to join [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army because of his objections to religious violence and who sees the good in everyone – and for its subtle depiction of the creature in the hole, which is never completely seen even as it overwhelms the castle. The novel was published in 1914 and never reprinted until [[Ramsey Campbell]] collected it in his 1992 anthology ''[[Uncanny Banquet]]''. [[Brian Stableford]] called it "a minor classic of the genre".&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stableford|Stableford, Brian]]. "Ross, Adrian", in [[David Pringle]] (ed.), ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost &amp; Gothic Writers''. London: St. James Press, 1998, p. 486, {{ISBN|978-1-55862-206-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross also wrote ''Short History of Europe'', edited ''Lady Mary Wortley-Montagu's Letters'' (Selection and Life), and was a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=Venn/&gt;

Ross died of heart failure at his home in [[Kensington, London|Kensington]], London on 11 September 1933 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arthur R.

Over the series' successive seasons, Anderson has attempted to address a number of social issues through the series soap operatic lens, including realistic takes on mental illness, incest, male-male rape, and the real-life gentrification of the iconic D.C. neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2017 Interview"/&gt;

'''Animal style''' art is an approach to decoration found from [[China]] to [[Northern Europe]] in the early [[Iron Age]], and the [[barbarian art]] of the [[Migration Period]], characterized by its emphasis on animal motifs. The [[zoomorphic]] style of decoration was used to decorate small objects by warrior-herdsmen, whose economy was based on breeding and herding animals, supplemented by trade and plunder.&lt;ref&gt;Emma C.Bunker, ''Animal Style Art from East to West'', Asia Society. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Animal art]] is a more general term for all art depicting animals.

==Eastern styles==

{{Main article|Scythian art}}

[[Scythian art]] makes great use of animal motifs, one component of the "[[Scythian]] triad" of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild [[animal art]]. The cultures referred to as Scythian-style included the [[Cimmerian]] and [[Sarmatian]] cultures in European [[Sarmatia]] and stretched across the [[Eurasian steppe]] north of the [[Near East]] to the [[Ordos culture]] of [[China]]. These cultures were extremely influential in spreading many local versions of the style.&lt;!--See Ptolemy's European Sarmatia [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Claudius_Ptolemy-_The_World.jpg]]--&gt;

[[Steppe]] jewellery features various animals including stags, cats, birds, horses, bears, wolves and mythical beasts. The gold figures of stags in a crouching position with legs tucked beneath its body, head upright and muscles tight to give the impression of speed, are particularly impressive. The "looped" antlers of most figures are a distinctive feature, not found in Chinese images of deer. The species represented has seemed to many scholars to be the [[reindeer]], which was not found in the regions inhabited by the steppes peoples at this period.  The largest of these were the central ornaments for shields, while others were smaller plaques probably attached to clothing.  The stag appears to have had a special significance for the steppes peoples, perhaps as a clan [[totem]]. The most notable of these figures include the examples from:
*the burial site of [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]] in the [[Kuban]] dating from the 6th century BC (Hermitage)
*[[Tápiószentmárton]] in [[Hungary]] dating from the 5th century BC, now [[National Museum of Hungary]], [[Budapest]]
*[[Kul Oba]] in the [[Crimea]] dating from the 4th century BC (Hermitage).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Loehr|Loehr, Max]], "The Stag Image in Scythia and the Far East", ''Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America'', Vol. 9, (1955), pp. 63-76, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20066973 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic form is the [[openwork]] plaque including a stylized tree over the scene at one side, of which two examples are illustrated here. Later large Greek-made pieces often include a zone showing Scythian men apparently going about their daily business, in scenes more typical of Greek art than nomad-made pieces. Some scholars have attempted to attach narrative meanings to such scenes, but this remains speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, Ann, "Interpreting Scythian Art: East vs. West",
''Artibus Asiae'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (1977), pp. 124-138, {{DOI|10.2307/3250196}}, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3250196 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although gold was widely used by the ruling elite of the various Scythian tribes, the predominant material for the various animal forms was bronze. The bulk of these items were used to decorate horse harness, leather belts &amp; personal clothing. In some cases these bronze animal figures when sewn onto stiff leather jerkins &amp; belts, helped to act as armour.
[[Image:Permic bear.jpg|thumb|150px|Bronze idol of a [[bear]] found in the [[Perm Krai]], 6th or 7th century.]]

The use of the animal form went further than just ornament, these seemingly imbuing the owner of the item with similar prowess and powers of the animal which was depicted. Thus the use of these forms extended onto the accoutrements of warfare, be they swords, daggers, scabbards, or axes.

The study of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] zoomorphic decoration was pioneered by [[Bernhard Salin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Bernhard Salin|Biography on swedish Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; in a work published in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''Die altgermanische Thierornamentik'', Stockholm 1904, [https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4889930W/Die_altgermanische_Thierornamentik The Open Library online text], written in German and heavily illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; Salin classified animal art from roughly 400 to 900 AD into three phases. The origins of these different phases remain the subject of debate; developing trends in late-Roman popular provincial art was an element, as were proceeding traditions of the nomadic Asiatic steppe peoples. Styles I and II are found widely across Europe in the art of the "barbarian" peoples during the [[Migration Period]].

'''Style I'''. First appearing in northwest Europe, first expressed with the introduction of the [[chip carving]] technique applied to bronze and silver in the 5th century. It is characterized by animals whose bodies are divided into sections, and typically appear at the fringes of designs whose main emphasis is on abstract patterns.

'''Style II'''. After about 560–570 Style I, declining, began to be supplanted. The animals of Style II are whole beasts, their bodies elongated into "ribbons" which intertwined into symmetrical shapes with no pretense of naturalism—rarely with legs—tending to be described as serpents, though heads often have characteristics of other animals. The animals become subsumed into ornamental patterns, typically [[interlace (art)|interlace]]. Examples of Style II can be found on the gold purse lid ([[:Image:Sutton.Hoo.PurseLid.RobRoy.jpg|picture]]) from [[Sutton Hoo]] (c. 625).

After about 700 localised styles develop, and it is no longer very useful to talk of a general Germanic style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yZVeZnUXMiAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Salin+animal+style&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Dj2KTNGGEY_KjAfQp4GKBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Salin%20animal%20style&amp;f=false Rituals of power: from late antiquity to the early Middle Ages],  By Frans Theuws, Janet L. Nelson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Salin '''Style III''' is found mainly in Scandinavia, and may also be called [[Viking art]].  Interlace, where it occurs, becomes less regular and more complex, and if not three-dimensional animals are usually seen in profile but twisted, exaggerated, surreal, with fragmented body parts filling every available space, creating an intense detailed energetic feel. Animals' bodies become hard for the unpractised viewer to read, and there is a very common motif of the "gripping beast" where an animal's mouth grips onto another element of the composition to connect two parts. Animal style was one component, along with [[Celtic art]] and late classical elements, in the formation of style of [[Insular art]] and [[Anglo-Saxon art]] in the British Isles, and through these routes and others on the Continent, left a considerable legacy in later Medieval art.

Other names are sometimes used: in [[Anglo-Saxon art]] Kendrick preferred "Helmet" and "Ribbon" for Styles I and II.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3cU4kkROdekC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;dq=Salin+animal+style&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Dj2KTNGGEY_KjAfQp4GKBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Salin%20animal%20style&amp;f=false Hills]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artists and repertoire''' ('''A&amp;R''') is the division of a [[record label]] or music publishing company that is responsible for talent scouting and overseeing the artistic development of [[recording artist]]s and songwriters.&lt;ref name="RCJE"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also acts as a liaison between artists and the record label or publishing company; every activity involving artists to the point of album release is generally considered under the purview, and responsibility, of A&amp;R.

==Responsibilities==

===Finding talent===
The A&amp;R division of a record label is responsible for finding new [[recording artist]]s and bringing those artists to the record company. Personnel in the A&amp;R division are expected to understand the current tastes of the market and to be able to find artists that will be commercially successful. For this reason, A&amp;R people are often young and many are musicians, [[music journalists]] or [[record producers]].{{sfn|Albini|1993}}

An A&amp;R executive is authorized to offer a [[record contract]], often in the form of a "deal memo": a short informal document that establishes a business relationship between the recording artist and the record company.{{sfn|Albini|1993}} The actual contract negotiations will typically be carried out by rival [[entertainment lawyer]]s hired by the musician's [[artist manager|manager]] and the record company.{{sfn|Krasilovsky|Shemel|Gross|Feinstein|2007}}

A&amp;R executives rely mostly on the [[word of mouth]] of trusted associates, critics and business contacts, rather than on unsolicited demo tapes.{{sfn|Weissman|2003|p=25}} They also tend to favor the bands that play in the same city as the record label's offices.{{sfn|Weissman|2003|p=25}}

===Overseeing the recording process===
The A&amp;R division of a record label oversees the [[sound recording|recording]] and format process. This includes helping the artist to find the right record producer, scheduling time in a recording studio and advising the artist on all aspects of making a high-quality recording. They work with the artist to choose the best songs (i.e.[[Wiktionary:repertoire|repertoire]]) to record. For artists who do not write their own music, the A&amp;R person will assist in finding songs and songwriters. A&amp;R executives maintain contact with their counterparts at [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing companies]] to get new songs and material from songwriters and producers.

As the record nears completion, the A&amp;R department works closely with the artist to determine whether the record is acceptable to the record company. This process may include suggesting that new songs need to be written or that some album tracks need to be re-recorded. A key issue is whether the album has a single: a particular track which can be used to [[marketing|market]] the record on radio.

===Assisting with marketing and promotion===
Once the record is completed, the A&amp;R department consults with marketing, [[radio promotion|promotion]], the [[recording artist|artist]] and their management to choose one or more singles to help promote the record.

==History and influence==
The tastes of particular A&amp;R executives have influenced the course of music history. A&amp;R man [[John H. Hammond]] discovered [[Billie Holiday]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Hammond's colleagues were initially skeptical of these artists because none of them appeared to be creating "commercial" music. Hammond's instincts proved to be correct, and these artists went on to sell hundreds of millions of records.{{sfn|Prial|2006}} [[George Daly (music executive)|George Daly]], Hammond's colleague at Columbia Records, proved the same instinct with bands as varied as outliers as [[The Tubes]] and [[Tool (band)|Tool]] during his career. [[David Geffen Company|Geffen Records]]' Gary Gersh signed the band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] at a time when [[alternative rock]] music was not considered commercial.{{sfn|Shoemer|1992}} Gersh was able to convince his co-workers to push the record in spite of their misgivings.{{sfn|Goldberg|2009|p=179-180}} In cases like these, A&amp;R people have radically changed the direction of popular musical tastes and introduced large numbers of people to new sounds.

This kind of prescience is, however, the exception rather than the rule. Historically, A&amp;R executives have tended to sign new artists that fit into recent trends and who resemble acts that are currently successful. For example, [[Columbia Records]]' A&amp;R man in the 1950s, [[Mitch Miller]], favored traditional pop singers like [[Guy Mitchell]] and [[Patti Page]], and rejected early rock-'n'-rollers [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Buddy Holly]].

This "trend following" mindset has generated several waves of narrowly defined genres, leading to a perception of triteness, including [[teen pop]] (1998–2001), [[alternative rock]] (1993–1996), [[glam metal]] (1986–1991) and [[disco]] (1976–1978). Trend following can be counter-productive, since it has often led to a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. Towards the end of the life of each wave, record companies have found themselves faced with enormous losses, as consumers' tastes changed. For example, at the end of the disco boom in 1978, millions of records were returned by record retailers, causing a deep recession in the music business that lasted until 1982, when [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' finally brought the public back into record stores in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Disco boom: {{Harvtxt|Knopper|2009|pp=15–35}}. Teen pop boom: {{Harvtxt|Knopper|2009|pp=}}. Knopper discusses the way the industry has overreacted to these waves throughout his book.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general move towards more conservative and business-minded signings from the 1980s onwards is seen to be symptomatic of an industry where the most powerful figures are no longer music fans or people with musical backgrounds, but business people. Traditionally A&amp;R executives were composers, arrangers and producers – [[Atlantic Records]]'s heads [[Jerry Wexler]] and [[Ahmet Ertegun]] were producers and composers respectively – but an A&amp;R with musical ability and knowledge has become a rarity, with [[Ron Fair]] and [[Martin Kierszenbaum]] being notable recent exceptions.&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Richard_Niles_Interview.html |title=Interview with Richard Niles |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=23 Apr 2007 |accessdate=17 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composer and arranger [[Richard Niles]] has said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;What you've got now is huge multinational companies where most of their A&amp;R staff are businessmen. They’re people who look at music from the standpoint of marketing, not from the standpoint of music and talent. They will say, "Go out and get me anything that's popular now."&lt;ref name="hitquarters"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hip hop group [[Wu-Tang Clan]] referenced this stereotype of the business-minded A&amp;R executive in their single "[[Protect Ya Neck]]", metaphorically likening them to "mountain climbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Wu-Tang Clan: 10 of the best|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/26/wu-tang-clan-10-of-the-best|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Wu-Tang Clan Still Sting|url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/wu-tang-clan-still-sting-2151230|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
According to [[Rhythm King Records]] and [[Lizard King Records]] founder Martin Heath, the A&amp;R community in the UK is more integrated than it is in the US, being very London-centric and encompassing a relatively small number of people.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_MartinHeath.html |title=Interview With Martin Heath |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=12 December 2005 |accessdate=20 Jun 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If scouts are chasing a band, you’ll see the same thirty people in one room. You get a herd mentality in the UK, but also some very diverse signings as well," he said in an interview with [[HitQuarters]].&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; Heath believes that in the USA it is more typical for A&amp;R to wait until a band is established – having attracted other offers or achieved a level of sales – before taking action, a technique which often works out as being more expensive.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt;

==Recent changes==
{{See also|2000s in the music industry}}

New forms of digital distribution have changed the relationship between consumers and the music they choose. Gerd Leonhard and others argue that the wide selection of music on digital services has allowed music consumers to bypass the traditional role of A&amp;R.{{sfn|Kusek|Leonhard|2005}} In the wake of [[Music industry in the 21st century|declining record sales]], a large number of A&amp;R staffers have been terminated.{{sfn|Knopper|2009|pp=220–221}} It is unclear whether A&amp;R executives will shape the future of musical tastes as they have in the past.

It was found in a field near [[Mirpur-Khas]] as first reported by [[Henry Cousens]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;The Antiquities of Sind: With Historical Outline, Henry Cousens, Bhartiya Publishing House, 1929 - Sindh (Pakistan)

Bhattacharya, in Studies in Hindu and Buddhist Art edited by P. K. Mishra, p. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The four-headed Brahma bronze statue has a height over 3 feet. Lord Brahma is shown standing with two hands, wearing a [[dhoti]] and a [[yajnopavita]] but without any ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Costume, Govind Sadashiv Ghurye, Popular Prakashan, 1966, Figure 100.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala]] calls it "an exceptionally good specimen of the art of metal-casting in this period".&lt;ref&gt;Indian Art - Volume 2, Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala, Prithivi Prakashan, 1977, Page 43&lt;/ref&gt; Śrīrāma and Śaṅkara Goyala term is "true memorial of Gupta metalsmith's artistic genius".&lt;ref&gt;Indian Art of the Gupta Age: From Pre-classical Roots to the Emergence of Medieval Trends, Editors Śrīrāma Goyala, Śaṅkara Goyala, Kusumanjali Book World, 2000, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to the best example of Gupta art in Sindh.&lt;ref&gt;Vakataka - Gupta Age Circa 200-550 A.D., Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, Anant Sadashiv Altekar, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1967, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

The object suggests that Sindh was a major center of metalworking.&lt;ref&gt;Objects of Translation: Material Culture and Medieval "Hindu-Muslim" Encounter, Finbarr Barry Flood, Princeton University Press, 2009,  p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

It used to be at the Karachi Museum, but it is reported that it is no longer there.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Bronzes in the Salar Jung Museum, Salar Jung Museum, D. N. Varma, 1996, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sec_construction_with_set_designer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Theatre carpenters work to construct sets for [[theatrical production]]s.]]
In [[theatre]], a '''carpenter''' is a [[stagehand]] who builds [[Set construction|sets]] and stage elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parker | first = W. Oren | title = Scene Design and Stage Lighting | isbn = 0-03-028777-4 | publisher = [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] | year = 1990 | page = 263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They usually are hired by the [[Production_management_(theater)|production manager]], crew chief or [[technical director]] and in some less common cases they may be hired by [[theatre director|director]] or [[theatrical producer|producer]]. They are usually paid by the hour.

Carpenters receive [[Technical drawing|drafting]] from the technical director who uses the designers' renderings, models, and/or drafting of the set  to create the technical drawings for the production. Working mainly with [[wood]]s and [[metal]]s, they use techniques that include [[woodworking]] and [[welding]]. They build set pieces, including some standard elements&amp;mdash;[[Flats (theatre)|flats]], [[Platform (theatre)|platforms]] and columns&amp;mdash;as well as pieces of the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]]. For example, a carpenter may be responsible for building stairs and ramps on and off of the performance area and for leveling the stage floor itself.

Only carpenters trained as riggers are trusted to do [[rigging (theatre)|rigging]] (see [[fly crew]]). Often union houses and some larger theatres make distinctions between carpenters and riggers, but most smaller theatres do not, due to staffing limitations.  

Professional carpenters do not work on anything with an electrical component (see [[electrician (theatre)|electrician]]).  They also do not paint the set, as this is the job of a [[Charge_scenic_artist|scenic artist]].

Often, stage carpentry for a large production is organized with one "master carpenter" or "shop foreman" and many subordinate carpenters.

The '''Cathedral Basilica of Salvador''' (''Catedral Basílica de Salvador''), officially dedicated to the Transfiguration of Christ and named '''''Primatial Cathedral Basilica of the Transfiguration of the Lord''''' is the seat of the [[Archbishop]] of the city of [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], in the [[Bahia, Brazil|State of Bahia]], in [[Brazil]]. The Archbishop of Salvador is also ''ex officio'' '''Primate of Brazil'''.

The [[Diocese of São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos]], the first in the Portuguese [[Colonial Brazil|colony of Brazil]], was created in 1551, only two years after the foundation of Salvador by nobleman [[Tomé de Sousa]]. The first bishop, [[Pero Fernandes Sardinha]], arrived in 1552. A cathedral was built in the centre of Salvador around this time.

In 1676 the city became the seat of an [[Archbishop|archdiocese]]. After 1758, when the [[Jesuit Order]] was [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expelled from Brazil]], the former Jesuit church of Salvador became the [[cathedral]] of the city. The building of the [[Old Cathedral of Salvador|former cathedral]]  was demolished in 1933. A scheme of its foundations can be seen on the pavement of the ''Praça da Sé'' (Se Square) in Salvador.

==Art and architecture==
In its origins the present cathedral building was the church of the [[Jesuit Order]] of Salvador. The Jesuits arrived in the city still in the 16th century and built a first church and college. In the second half of the 17th century the Jesuits built a new church - the one that exists today - in the [[Renaissance architecture|Mannerist style]] then fashionable in Portugal. The façade is very similar to contemporary Portuguese churches like the [[New Cathedral of Coimbra|Jesuit Church of Coimbra]].

The façade is made in light ''Lioz'' stone brought from Portugal and is flanked by two short bell towers. It has three portals with statues of Jesuit saints, [[Ignatius of Loyola]], [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Francis Borgia]]. The [[gable]] on the upper storey of the façade is flanked by typical Mannerist [[volute]]s.

[[Image:Salvador-JesuitChurch3-CCBY.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Interior of Cathedral of Salvador towards the main chapel.]]
Inside, the cathedral is a one-[[aisle]]d church of rectangular shape, without [[transept]] and with a very shallow main [[chapel]]. The side walls of the church have a series of lateral chapels decorated with altarpieces. This [[floorplan]] scheme is based on the [[Igreja de São Roque (Lisbon)|Church of São Roque in Lisbon]], the Jesuit church of the Portuguese capital, built a century earlier.

The chapels of the cathedral offer an interesting showcase of [[altarpiece]] art from the late 16th through the mid-18th centuries, all decorated with sculptures and paintings. Very rare are two 16th century [[Renaissance]] altarpieces that belonged to the previous Jesuit church and were reused in the new building. The altarpiece of the main chapel is a fine example of 17th century Mannerist art. Other chapels have [[Baroque]] altarpieces from the mid-18th century. The [[barrel vault]] covering the [[nave]] of the church is decorated with wooden panels dating from the 18th century and displays the Jesuit emblem "[[Christogram|IHS]]".

The [[sacristy]] of the church is richly decorated with Baroque furniture, 17th-century Portuguese tiles ([[azulejo]]s) and ceiling wooden panels painted with Mannerist motifs and portraits of important Jesuits.

The façade and floorplan of the Jesuit church of Salvador influenced several other colonial churches in [[Northeast Brazil]], including the [[São Francisco Church and Convent (Salvador)|São Francisco Church of Salvador]].

==Protected status==

The Cathedral of Salvador was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1938. The structure was registered under the Book of Historical Works, Inscription 77 and Book of Fine Arts, fls. 14. The directive is dated May 25, 1938.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

'''Chicago Dance Crash''' is an American [[hip hop]]/[[contemporary dance]] company based in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The company  tours year round while sustaining a calendar year ‘season’ of local premiers and commercial work as well as a spring/fall educational outreach program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petlicki|first1=Myrna|title=Chicago Dance Crash performs ballet to breakdancing|work=Lake Zurich Courier|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has received widespread critical acclaim while being considered one of the most notable American dance companies to emerge during the first decade of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Zeroes End: Dance in Chicago, 2000-2009|url=http://newcitystage.com/at-zeroes-end-dance-in-chicago-2000-2009/|publisher=NewCity Stage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2002, the organization has commissioned well over 100 original works from choreographers including [[Harrison McEldowney]], [[James Morrow (dance)|James Morrow]], [[Davis Robertson]], Amirah Sackett and Nicholas Leichter. Crash is led by artistic director [[Jessica Deahr]], executive director Mark Hackman and is a resident company of Visceral Dance Center in Chicago, IL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nevin|first1=Johnny|title=Lizzie MacKenzie and Chicago Dance Crash make some Connections|work=The Huffington Post|date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visceraldance.com/ Visceral Dance Center official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Chicago Dance Crash was founded by [[Illinois State University]] graduates Marissa Moritz, Charlie Cutler and Mark Hackman as a professional outlet for works the trio had created as students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolden|first=Dominique|title=Chicago Dance Crashes into Center for Performing Arts|journal=Daily Vidette|date=4 May 2005|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admittedly to satisfy the individual talents of the three (Cutler an actor, Hackman a martial artist and Moritz a modern dancer), early productions utilized dance and acrobatics while forwarding a linear, conflict-driven story. The company's first performances took place at the 60-seat, historical Mary-Arrchie Theater in Chicago's Northeast neighborhood of Buena Park. Crash's first production, titled ''The Mercutio Story'', soon after extended to several performances across the city including the [[Chicago Shakespeare Theatre]] at [[Navy Pier]] and ultimately performing at “The Space” storefront theater in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/115537858 "History of Crash: 2001-2015" staff interviews]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crash incorporated on December 23, 2003, employed its first artistic director in 2003 and established its current local season structure in 2005. Adopting a company dancer formation in 2007, the organization began touring nationally and internationally in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warnecke|first1=Lauren|title=Crash Captures "all the feels" for its DC Debut|work=Arts Intercepts|date=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adamsick|first1=Arline|title=Chicago Dance Crash Makes GSU First New National Tour Stop|work=The Vedette|date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic directors===

* Christopher M. McCray (2003-2006) – Crash's first contracted artistic director, McCray's award-winning production ''Ghost Play'' cemented the company's local significance while establishing its consistent season of premieres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Hedy|title=Crash brings "Dummy" to life|work=The Chicago Sun-Times|date=December 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCray has gone on to direct Corpo Dance Company and now choreographs and performs internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mauro|first1=Lucia|title=An Intimate, Surreal Start for Corpo|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Kyle Vincent Terry (2006-2010) – Terry had performed with Crash since 2003 and was promoted from a senior company position. Notably founding Crash's signature production, ''The Keeper of The Floor'', Terry established the organization's current eight-member formation with works including an interpretation of ''[[Faust]]'' and the [[kung fu]]-inspired production ''Tiger Prawn: The Mountain Mover''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaiani|first=Victoria|title=Step in the Spotlight|journal=Chicago Tribune|date=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry has gone on to direct the arts organization TheMASSIVE and since 2013 has enjoyed a stage and film career in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Kyle-Vincent-Terry/ BroadwayWorld: Kyle Vincent Terry Broadway and Theatre Credits]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7778236/ Kyle Vincent Terry IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Jessica Deahr]] (2012–present) – Deahr had performed with Crash since 2007. Originally hired by Terry, Deahr's most poignant accomplishments include choreographing and directing the organization's 10th anniversary production of ''Gotham City''&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagotheaterbeat.com/2012/06/09/review-gotham-city-chicago-dance-crash/ "Review: Gotham City" TheaterBeat June 9, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its 15-year anniversary production of ''The Bricklayers of Oz'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/repaving-the-yellow-brick-road-in-ingenious-bricklayers-of-oz/ Hedy Weiss ''Repaving the Yellow Brick Road in Ingenious Bricklayers of Oz'' The Chicago Sun-Times August 6, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; both of which have led to national notoriety and have aided in Deahr's restructuring Crash's business model to include a steady touring program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nevin|first=Johnny|title=Dance Crash, Deahr &amp; the Art of Connection|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnny-nevin/dance-crash-deahr-art_b_2564568.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and Notoriety==
===Fusion-style===
[[File:Bricklayers of Oz.jpg|thumb|
Chicago Dance Crash performing "The Bricklayers of Oz"
]]
The prevailing aesthetic of Chicago Dance Crash has been cited as “fusion-style,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Cassie|title=Dance: Topsy-Turvy|work=Chicago Magazine|date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally referred to as the blending of unalike dance forms but more culturally recognized as the specific combination of hip hop dance aspects (including [[breakdancing]], [[popping]], [[krump]], among others) with the influence of “concert dance” vocabulary and direction ([[modern dance]], [[jazz dance]], [[ballet]]). The term “fusion-style” was originally coined by Chicago-raised dancer and choreographer [[James Morrow (dance)|James Morrow]] whose company “Instruments of Movement” championed the style regionally from 2001-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinrebe|first1=Susan|title=Instruments of Movement at Ruth Page Center for the Arts|url=https://www.exploredance.com/article.htm?id=705|website=ExploreDance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyofmovementandmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Academy-Intensive-17-HipHop-3.pdf "Hip Hop Fusion with James Morrow" The Academy of Music and Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; 
As two of Crash's founders (Moritz and Hackman) as well as all three of Crash's artistic directors had previously danced under Morrow, it's been publicly stated that Crash's aesthetic is attributed to his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molzahn|first1=Laura|title=Chicago Dance Crash gets experimental for Dance Center show|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/dance/ct-ent-0211-dance-crash-dance-card-20150210-column.html|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement Play=== 
Although not historically an unknown concept to live dance performance, Crash gained early support among critics and fans due largely to their creation of evening-length, linear plot-based works which they dubbed "movement plays"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Hedy|title=Charisma and Combat blaze in Dance Crash's 'Tribulation'|work=Dance Magazine|date=June 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;… a format less utilized in Chicago during the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagoguide.cpsarts.org/chicago-pages/dance/innovators ''Modern Innovators:Pushing Boundaries'' The Chicago Guide for Teaching and Learning in the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; A device still used by the organization today, the shows often compliment larger-spanning concepts with [[popular culture]] façades; commenting on morality, religion and politics with comic book settings, video game references and onstage spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warnecke|first1=Lauren|title=Crash flirts with the worlds of concert dance and commercial entertainment.|url=http://seechicagodance.com/headline/chicago-dance-crash-transcends-time-and-realities-%E2%80%98tron-end-line%E2%80%99|website=SeeChicagoDance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KTF===
Second to the [[Neo-Futurists]] show [[Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind]], Chicago Dance Crash locally operates the longest-running live show in the history of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shapiro|first1=Lynn Colburn|title=A Merry Month of May for Dance|work=Choose Chicago|date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opening on March 9, 2007 at the Lakeshore Theater,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Sid|title=Battling Dancers Break Boundaries|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company premiered an interactive dance battle titled ''The Keeper of The Floor'' (KTF for short) with dancers of differing styles competing in comical rounds towards a single champion of the night. Now performing at The Den Theater in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood, the show's original late-night host was [[Reggie Watts]] and has been headlined by host Matthew Hollis, nicknamed “Mattrick Swayze,” since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYFPV71rIhc "The KTF Experience" Youtube documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Frederik Carl Holm''' (18 February 1804, [[Copenhagen]] – 24 July 1846, [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]]) was a Danish painter; known primarily for his animal and hunting scenes.

==Biography==
His father was a [[goldsmith]]. As an only son, he was expected to follow his father's profession, but after arriving at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]], decided to become an artist instead. He began by studying engraving with [[Johan Frederik Clemens]], then did modeling, but eventually settled on being a painter.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=545 Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, he exhibited copies of paintings by [[Frans Pourbus the Younger]], which he had seen at the [[Rijksmuseum]].

Two years later, he won a silver medal and was studying with [[Christian David Gebauer]]. At first, he wanted to become a [[battle painter]] but, owing to a long period of peace, had no opportunity to observe a battle in person. Gebauer then encouraged him to become an animal painter, but he persisted with his plans and presented his interpretations of historical events, such as the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]] and the [[Battle of Colberger Heide]]. The latter was purchased for the [[National Gallery of Denmark|Royal Collection]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; 
[[File:Holm Sendlinger Tor 1840.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Sendlinger Tor]]]]
In 1829, he was granted money from the "{{ill|Fonden ad usus publicos|da}}", a fund devoted to supporting the arts and sciences.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; This was meant to support him for two years but, in 1830, the second half was withheld due to lack of productivity. Nevertheless, he went to Dresden and Munich (apparently at his own expense) and took Gebauer's advice; producing his first serious animal paintings. In 1832, he married Rosalie Petit, the daughter of an accountant, and settled in Munich.

It was there that his career took hold; beginning with the sale of a large painting depicting a reindeer hunt to the prominent [[:de:Jenisch (Familie)|Jenisch]] family of Hamburg. He made several visits to Rome, beginning in 1838, and moved his family there in 1845. Shortly after, King [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian VIII]] ordered several paintings from him; some of which were not exhibited until after his death.

He apparently overworked himself in the hot summer sun and developed a fever. He died several days later, watched over by his wife and his friend, [[Albert Küchler]], a painter who later became a Catholic [[friar]]. After the burial, Rosalie returned to Copenhagen with their children and took up engraving, which Christian had taught her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=7591 Rosalie Holm] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''control(human, data, sound)''''' is a technology [[performance art|performance]] created by [[Bob van Luijt]] and performed in December 2014. During the performance a dancer wears a "[[Wearable technology|Brain Sense Wearable]]" that sends it's [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] data to a [[Node.js]] application that contains a music composition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/kubrickology/Brain-Music  Github, ''control(human, data, sound) source'', November 20, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2015 the work was selected as an awards Finalist for [[Three_Rivers_Arts_Festival|CREATE]] 2015 in Pittsburgh, USA, in the category art+technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nextpittsburgh.com/events/create-2015-pittsburghs-art-technology-festival/|title=Create 2015|date=2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://renateroze.com/films/my-latest-co-produced-project-controlhuman-data-sound/|title=Weblog about CHDS|date=2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==
The project is an abstraction of the interaction between a human and his/her data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio6.nl/mijkeencolive/uitzending/324932 'interview about control(human, data, sound) with Bob van Luijt at NTR (Dutch)'', December 26, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnr.nl/radio/bnr-digitaal/409079-1501/uitzending-21-januari-gevaren-van-ai-en-muziek-downloaden-uit-het-brein  'interview about control(human, data, sound) with Bob van Luijt at BNR News Radio (Dutch)'', January 21, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; As Bob van Luijt states on chds.io:&lt;ref&gt;[http://chds.io  ''CHDS.io'', December, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; "A human being is able to contextualize data, and it’s the context that gives data its value. But a computer merely observes my data, based on algorithms that try to give context. That context makes sense sometimes, but often it doesn’t make sense at all. In the meantime, the data just sits there as a source of information, without any meaning."

==Reception==
''control(human, data, sound)'' was selected by a jury for exhibition at the following international art and design events:
Venice Art Week - Borders &amp; Disorders, March 13–20, 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lucacurci.com/artexpo/opening-borders-disorders-venice.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lucacurci.com/artexpo/liquid-rooms-venice-feedback.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Berlin DMY International Design Festival, June 11–14, 2015 &lt;ref&gt;http://dmy2015.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Muhammad}}
The permissibility of '''depictions of Muhammad''' in [[Islam]] has been a contentious issue. Oral and written descriptions of [[Muhammad]] are readily accepted by all traditions of Islam, but there is disagreement about visual depictions.&lt;ref name=best&gt;{{cite journal
|jstor=860736

Esposito - 2011 p. 14; for hadith see [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Hadith: 7.834, 7.838, 7.840, 7.844,  7.846&lt;/ref&gt; It is agreed on all sides that there is no authentic visual tradition as to the appearance of Muhammad, although there are early legends of portraits of him, and written physical descriptions whose authenticity is often accepted.

The question of whether images in [[Islamic art]], including those depicting Muhammad, can be considered as [[religious art]] remains a matter of contention among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; They appear in illustrated books that are normally works of history or poetry, including those with religious subjects; the Quran is never illustrated: "context and intent are essential to understanding Islamic pictorial art. The Muslim artists creating images of Muhammad, and the public who beheld them, understood that the images were not objects of worship. Nor were the objects so decorated used as part of religious worship".&lt;ref&gt;Cosman, Pelner and Jones, Linda Gale. ''Handbook to life in the medieval world'', p. 623, Infobase Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8160-4887-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-4887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scholars concede that such images have "a spiritual element", and were also sometimes used in informal religious devotions celebrating the day of the [[Mi'raj]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27 (quote) and 43&lt;/ref&gt; Many visual depictions only show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame; other images, notably from before about 1500, show his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), pp. 239, 247–253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="January2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan January|title=The Arab Conquests of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9XGWkkFy0sC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=1 February 2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-8744-6|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Safi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Omid Safi|title=Memories of Muhammad: Why the Prophet Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s63i21E9dr8C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=2 November 2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-123135-3|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the notable exception of modern-day Iran,&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt; depictions of Muhammad were rare, never numerous in any community or era throughout Islamic history,&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Gorgias Press LLC|isbn = 978-1-931956-91-8|last = Arnold|first = Thomas W.|title = Painting in Islam, a Study of the Place of Pictorial Art in Muslim Culture|orig-year = First published in 1928 |date = 2002–2011|pages = 91–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plas1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk van der Plas|title=Effigies dei: essays on the history of religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ops3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=1987|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-08655-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared almost exclusively in the private medium of Persian and other [[Persian miniature|miniature]] book illustration.&lt;ref name="Ernst2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Carl W.|authorlink1=Carl W.

Visual images of Muhammad in the non-Islamic West have always been infrequent. In the Middle Ages they were mostly hostile, and most often appear in illustrations of [[Dante]]'s poetry.  In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, Muhammad was sometimes depicted, typically in a more neutral or heroic light. These depictions began to encounter protests from Muslims, and in the age of the internet, a handful of caricature depictions printed in the European press have caused global protests and controversy, and been associated with violence.

==Background==
{{main|Aniconism in Islam}}
In Islam, although nothing in the [[Quran]] explicitly bans images, some supplemental [[hadith]] explicitly ban the drawing of images of any living creature; other hadith tolerate images, but never encourage them. Hence, most Muslims avoid visual depictions of Muhammad or [[Prophets of Islam|any other prophet]] such as [[Moses]] or [[Abraham]].&lt;ref name=best/&gt;&lt;ref name=USSC&gt;{{cite web|url={{SCOTUS URL|about/north&amp;southwalls.pdf}} |format=PDF|title=Courtroom Friezes: North and South Walls|author=Office of the Curator|date=2003-05-08|accessdate=2007-07-08|work=Information Sheet, Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=explaining&gt;{{cite news|title=Explaining the outrage|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-02-08/news/0602080383_1_prophet-muhammad-cartoons-muslims|date=2006-02-08|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Sunni]] Muslims believe that visual depictions of all the [[prophets of Islam]] should be prohibited&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsson|first=Göran|title=Muslims and the New Media|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-1-4094-2750-6|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are particularly averse to visual representations of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=BergenMuhammad&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/63BsneOUJ?url=http://www.hf.uib.no/religion/popularikonografi/devotion04.html Devotion in pictures: Muslim popular iconography – The prophet Muhammad], [[University of Bergen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The key concern is that the use of images can encourage [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name=Eaton&gt;{{cite book|last=Eaton|first=Charles Le Gai|title=Islam and the destiny of man|year=1985|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-161-5|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, however, images of Muhammad are quite common nowadays, even though Shia scholars historically were against such depictions.&lt;ref name=BergenMuhammad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Walker Arnold]] says "It was not merely Sunni schools of law but Shia jurists also who fulminated against this figured art. Because the Persians are Shiites, many Europeans writers have assumed that the Shia sect had not the same objection to representing living being as the rival set of the Sunni; but such an opinion ignores the fact that Shiisum did not become the state church in Persia until the rise of the Safivid dynasty at the beginning of the 16th century."&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many Muslims who take a stricter view of the supplemental traditions will sometimes challenge any depiction of Muhammad, including those created and published by non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/things/depictions-of-muhammad-in-islamic-art.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06|title=Islamic Figurative Art and Depictions of Muhammad|publisher=religionfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major religions have experienced times during their history when [[aniconism|images of their religious figures were forbidden]]. In Judaism, one of the [[Ten Commandments]] forbids "graven images".  In [[Byzantine]] Christianity during the periods of [[byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] in the 8th century, and again during the 9th century, visual representations of sacred figures were forbidden, and only the [[Christian cross|Cross]] could be depicted in churches. The visual representation of Jesus and other religious figures remains a concern in parts of [[Protestant Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Halicks&gt;{{cite news|title=Images of Muhammad: Three ways to see a cartoon|author=Richard Halicks|date=2006-02-12|work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture of Muhammad in Islamic literature==

A number of ''hadith'' and other writings of the early Islamic period include stories in which portraits of Muhammad appear. [[Abu Hanifa Dinawari]], [[Ibn al-Faqih]], [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] and [[Abu Nu`aym]] tell versions of a story in which the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] is visited by two Meccans. He shows them a cabinet, handed down to him from [[Alexander the Great]] and originally created by God for Adam, each of whose drawers contains a portrait of a prophet. They are astonished to see a portrait of Muhammad in the final drawer. [[Sadid al-Din al-Kazaruni]] tells a similar story in which the Meccans are visiting the king of China. [[Kisa'i]] tells that God did indeed give portraits of the prophets to Adam.&lt;ref name=Grabar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grabar|first=Oleg|title=The Story of Portraits of the Prophet Muhammad|journal=Studia Islamica|year=2003|issue=96|pages=19–38|jstor=1596240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu'ayn tell a second story in which a Meccan merchant visiting Syria is invited to a Christian monastery where a number of sculptures and paintings depict prophets and saints. There he sees the images of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, as yet unidentified by the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asani|first=Ali|title=Celebrating Muhammad: Images of the Prophet in Popular Muslim Piety|year=1995|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, SC|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 11th-century story, Muhammad is said so have sat for a portrait by an artist retained by [[Sassanid]] king [[Kavadh II]]. The king liked the portrait so much that he placed it on his pillow.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

Later, [[Al-Maqrizi]] tells a story in which [[Muqawqis]], ruler of Egypt, meets with Muhammad's envoy. He asks the envoy to describe Muhammad and checks the description against a portrait of an unknown prophet which he has on a piece of cloth. The description matches the portrait.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

In a 17th-century [[Islam in China|Chinese]] story, the king of China asks to see Muhammad, but Muhammad instead sends his portrait. The king is so enamoured of the portrait that he is converted to Islam, at which point the portrait, having done its job, disappears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Donald|title=Islam in Traditional China|year=1986|publisher=Canberra College of Advanced Education|location=Canberra|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal descriptions===
{{main|Shama'il Muhammadiyah|Hilya}}
[[File:Hilye-i serif 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[hilya|Hilye]]'' by [[Hâfiz Osman]] (1642–1698)]]
In one of the earliest sources, [[Ibn Sa'd]]'s ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', there are numerous verbal descriptions of Muhammad. One description sourced to [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] is as follows:

: ''The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, is neither too short nor too tall. His hair are neither curly nor straight, but a mixture of the two. He is a man of black hair and large skull. His complexion has a tinge of redness. His shoulder bones are broad and his palms and feet are fleshy. He has long ''al-masrubah'' which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eyebrows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders. When he walks he walks inclining as if coming down from a height. [...] I never saw a man like him before him or after him.''&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sa'd – ''Kitabh al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', as translated by S. Moinul and H.K. Ghazanfar, Kitab Bhavan, New Delhi, n.d.{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period onwards such texts have been presented on calligraphic ''[[hilya]]'' panels (Turkish: ''hilye'', pl. ''hilyeler''), commonly surrounded by an elaborate frame of [[Ottoman illumination|illuminated decoration]] and either included in books or, more often, [[muraqqa]]s or albums, or sometimes placed in wooden frames so that they can hang on a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), p.231-232&lt;/ref&gt;  The elaborated form of the calligraphic tradition was founded in the 17th century by the Ottoman calligrapher [[Hâfiz Osman]]. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Muhammad's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of Muhammad, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination.  Several parts of the complex design were named after parts of the body, from the head downwards, indicating the explicit intention of the hilya as a substitute for a figurative depiction.&lt;ref name="Peters2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. E. Peters|title=Jesus and Muhammad: Parallel Tracks, Parallel Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olEi-1LZYYQC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=5 November 2011|date=10 November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974746-7|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan E.

The Ottoman ''hilye'' format customarily starts with a [[basmala]], shown on top, and is separated in the middle by {{cite quran|21|107|style=ref}}: "And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds".&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010" /&gt; Four compartments set around the central one often contain the names of the [[Rashidun|Rightly-Guided Caliphs]], [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman]], and [[Ali]], each followed by "radhi Allahu anhu" ("may God be pleased with him").

&lt;/div&gt;

===Calligraphic representations===
The most common visual representation of the Muhammad in Islamic art, especially in Arabic-speaking areas, is by a calligraphic representation of his name, a sort of [[monogram]] in roughly circular form, often given a decorated frame. Such inscriptions are normally in Arabic, and may rearrange or repeat forms, or add a blessing or honorific, or for example the word "messenger" or a contraction of it.  The range of ways of representing Muhammad's name is considerable, including [[ambigram]]s; he is also frequently symbolised by a rose.

The more elaborate versions relate to other Islamic traditions of special forms of calligraphy such as those writing the [[Names of God in Islam|names of God]], and the secular [[tughra]] or elaborate monogram of Ottoman rulers.

===Figurative visual depictions===
[[File:Medieval Persian manuscript Muhammad leads Abraham Moses Jesus.jpg|thumb|Muhammad leads [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and others in prayer. Persian miniature]]
Throughout Islamic history, depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art were rare.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Even so, there exists a "notable corpus of images of Muhammad produced, mostly in the form of manuscript illustrations, in various regions of the Islamic world from the thirteenth century through modern times".&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"&gt;Gruber (2005), p. 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of Muhammad date back to the start of the tradition of [[Persian miniature]]s as illustrations in books. The illustrated book from the [[Persianate]] world (''Warka and Gulshah'', [[Topkapi Palace]] Library H. 841, attributed to [[Konya]] 1200–1250) contains the two earliest known Islamic depictions of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, p. 19; Gruber (2005), p. 235 (from where the date range), Blair, Sheila S., ''The Development of the Illustrated Book in Iran'', ''Muqarnas'', Vol. 10, Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar (1993), p. 266, BRILL, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523191 JSTOR] says "c. 1250"&lt;/ref&gt;

This book dates to before or just around the time of the [[Mongol invasion]] of [[Anatolia]] in the 1240s, and before the campaigns against Persia and Iraq of the 1250s, which destroyed great numbers of books in libraries. Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, generally human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands (such as in literature, science, and history); as early as the 8th century, such art flourished during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749 - 1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom  |author2=S. Blair |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiane Gruber traces a development from "veristic" images showing the whole body and face, in the 13th to 15th centuries, to more "abstract" representations in the 16th to 19th centuries, the latter including the representation of Muhammad by a special type of [[calligraphic]] representation, with the older types also remaining in use.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229, and throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  An intermediate type, first found from about 1400, is the "inscribed portrait" where the face of Muhammad is blank, with "Ya Muhammad" ("O Muhammad") or a similar phrase written in the space instead; these may be related to [[Sufi]] thought.  In some cases the inscription appears to have been an underpainting that would later be covered by a face or veil, so a pious act by the painter, for his eyes alone, but in others it was intended to be seen.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"/&gt; According to Gruber, a good number of these paintings later underwent [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] mutilations, in which the facial features of Muhammad were scratched or smeared, as Muslim views on the acceptability of veristic images changed.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of extant Persian manuscripts representing Muhammad date from the [[Ilkhanid]] period under the new [[Mongol]] rulers, including a ''[[Marzubannama]]'' dating to 1299. The Ilkhanid [[MS Arab 161]] of 1307/8 contains 25 illustrations found in an illustrated version of [[Al-Biruni]]'s ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', of which five include depictions Muhammad, including the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which emphasize the relation of Muhammad and [[`Ali]] according to [[Shi`ite]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), pp.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christiane Gruber, other works use images to promote [[Sunni]] Islam, such as a set of Mi'raj illustrations (MS H 2154) in the early 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), quote p. 43; generally pp.29-45&lt;/ref&gt; although other historians have dated the same illustrations to the [[Jalayrid]] period of Shia rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Tauris Academic Studies| isbn = 1-84511-499-X| last = Gruber| first = Christiane| title = The Ilkhanid Book of Ascension| date = 2010-03-15| page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siyer-i Nebi 158b.jpg|thumb|upright|Muhammad, shown with a veiled face and halo, at [[Mount Hira]] (16th-century Ottoman illustration of the [[Siyer-i Nebi]])]]
Depictions of Muhammad are also found in Persian manuscripts in the following [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] dynasties, and Turkish [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art in the 14th to 17th centuries, and beyond. Perhaps the most elaborate cycle of illustrations of Muhammad's life is the copy, completed in 1595, of the 14th-century biography ''[[Siyer-i Nebi]]'' commissioned by the Ottoman sultan [[Murat III]] for his son, the future [[Mehmed III]], containing over 800 illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hürriyet Vakfı Yayınları| last = Tanındı| first = Zeren| title = Siyer-i nebî: İslam tasvir sanatında Hz. Muhammedʹin hayatı| year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the commonest narrative scene represented is the [[Mi'raj]]; according to Gruber, "There exist countless single-page paintings of the meʿrāj included in the beginnings of Persian and Turkish romances and epic stories produced from the beginning of the 15th century to the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (Iranica)&lt;/ref&gt;  These images were also used in celebrations of the anniversary of the Mi'raj on 27 [[Rajab]], when the accounts were recited aloud to male groups: "Didactic and engaging, oral stories of the ascension seem to have had the religious goal of inducing attitudes of praise among their audiences".  Such practices are most easily documented in the 18th and 19th centuries, but manuscripts from much earlier appear to have fulfilled the same function.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise a large number of different scenes may be represented at times, from Muhammad's birth to the end of his life, and his existence in Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;The birth is rare, but appears in an early manuscript in Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Halo ====
In the earliest depictions Muhammad may be shown with or without a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the earliest halos being round in the style of Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 95&lt;/ref&gt; but before long a flaming halo or [[aureole]] in the [[Buddhist]] or Chinese tradition becomes more common than the circular form found in the West, when a halo is used.  A halo or flame may surround only his head, but often his whole body, and in some images the body itself cannot be seen for the halo.  This "luminous" form of representation avoided the issues caused by "veristic" images, and could be taken to convey qualities of Muhammad's person described in texts.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, 230, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  If the body is visible, the face may be covered with a veil (see gallery for examples of both types). This form of representation, which began at the start of the [[Safavid]] period in Persia,&lt;ref&gt;Brend, Barbara. ''Islamic Art'', p. 161, British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was done out of reverence and respect.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Other [[prophets of Islam]], and Muhammad's wives and relations, may be treated in similar ways if they also appear.

[[Thomas Walker Arnold|T. W. Arnold]] (1864–1930), an early historian of Islamic art, stated that "Islam has never welcomed painting as a handmaid of religion as both Buddhism and Christianity have done. Mosques have never been decorated with religious pictures, nor has a pictorial art been employed for the instruction of the heathen or for the edification of the faithful."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Comparing Islam to Christianity, he also writes: "Accordingly, there has never been any historical tradition in the religious painting of Islam – no artistic development in the representation of accepted types – no schools of painters of religious subjects; least of all has there been any guidance on the part of leaders of religious thought corresponding to that of ecclesiastical authorities in the Christian Church."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

Images of Muhammad remain controversial to the present day, and are not considered acceptable in many countries in the Middle East.  For example, in 1963 an account by a Turkish author of a [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] was banned in [[Pakistan]] because it contained reproductions of miniatures showing Muhammad unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie, ''Deciphering the signs of God: a phenomenological approach to Islam'', p.45, n. 86, SUNY Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7914-1982-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1982-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:760 - Jeune arabe.jpg|thumb|upright|A colourised version of the original photograph by [[Lehnert &amp; Landrock (disambiguation)|Lehnert &amp; Landrock]], which later became the base of an Iranian depiction of a young Muhammad.]]
Despite the ban on the representation of Muhammad, images of Muhammed are not uncommon in Iran. The Iranian Shi'ism seems more tolerant on this point than Sunnite orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; In Iran, depictions have considerable acceptance to the present day, and may be found in the modern forms of the poster and [[postcard]].&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.253, illustrates a postcard bought in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, experts in Islamic iconography discovered images, printed on paper in Iran, portraying Mohammed as a teenager wearing a turban.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; There are several variants, all show the same juvenile face, identified by an inscription such as "Muhammad, the Messenger of God", or a more detailed legend referring to an episode in the life of Muhammad and the supposed origin of the image.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; Some Iranian versions of these posters attributed the original depiction to a [[Bahira]], a Christian monk who met the young Muhammad in Syria. By crediting the image to a Christian and predating it to the time before Muhammad became a prophet, the manufacturers of the image exonerate themselves from any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="iconic"/&gt;

The motif was taken from a photograph of a young Tunisian taken by the Germans [[Rudolf Franz Lehnert]] and [[Ernst Heinrich Landrock]] in 1905 or 1906, which had been printed in high editions on picture post cards till 1921.&lt;ref name="etudes"&gt;Pierre Centlivres, Micheline Centlivres-Demont: [http://etudesphotographiques.revues.org/index747.html Une étrange rencontre.

===Cinema===
{{main|List of films about Muhammad|Depictions of Muhammad in film}}
Very few films have been made about Muhammad.  The 1976 film ''The Message'', also known as ''[[Mohammad, Messenger of God]]'', focused on other persons and never directly showed Muhammad or most members of his family.  A devotional cartoon called ''[[Muhammad: The Last Prophet]]'' was released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finemediagroup.com/user/finemedia/press.cfm|title=Fine Media Group|accessdate=2006-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Iranian film directed by Majid Majidi was released in 2015 named ''[[Muhammad (2015 film)|Muhammad]]''.

==Depiction by non-Muslims==
{{Commons category|Western depictions of Muhammad}}
Western representations of Muhammad were very rare until the explosion of images following the invention of the [[printing press]]; he is shown in a few medieval images, normally in an unflattering manner, often influenced by his brief mention in [[Dante|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.  Muhammad sometimes figures in Western depictions of groups of influential people in world history. Such depictions tend to be favourable or neutral in intent; one example can be found at the [[United States Supreme Court building#Sculptural program|United States Supreme Court building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Created in 1935, the frieze includes major historical lawgivers, and places Muhammad alongside [[Hammurabi]], [[Moses]], [[Confucius]], and others. In 1997, a controversy erupted surrounding the frieze, and tourist materials have since been edited to describe the depiction as "a well-intentioned attempt by the sculptor to honor Muhammad" that "bears no resemblance to Muhammad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrepublican.com/sup_crt_frieze.html|title=The Daily Republican: Supreme Court Frieze|accessdate=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, a statue of Muhammad was removed from a courthouse in New York City after the ambassadors of [[Indonesia]], Pakistan, and [[Egypt]] requested its removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210055800/http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-10|accessdate=2006-03-10|date=2006-02-12|title=Archive "Montreal News Network": Images of Muhammad, Gone for Good}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely rare representations of Muhammad in [[monumental sculpture]] are especially likely to be offensive to Muslims, as the statue is the classic form for idols, and a fear of any hint of idolatry is the basis of Islamic prohibitions. Islamic art has almost always avoided large sculptures of any subject, especially free-standing ones; only a few animals are known, mostly fountain-heads, like those in the Lion Court of the [[Alhambra]]; the [[Pisa Griffin]] is perhaps the largest.

In 1997, the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]], a Muslim advocacy group in the United States, wrote to United States Supreme Court Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] requesting that the sculpted representation of [[Muhammad]] on the north frieze inside the Supreme Court building be removed or sanded down. The court rejected CAIR's request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%e2%80%9cban%e2%80%9d-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 MSN : "How the “Ban” on Images of Muhammad Came to Be" by Jackie Bischof]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045614/http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%E2%80%9Cban%E2%80%9D-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 |date=May 26, 2015 }} January 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been numerous book illustrations showing Muhammad.

[[Dante]], in ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|The Divine Comedy: Inferno]]'', placed Muhammad in Hell, with his entrails hanging out (Canto 28):

:No barrel, not even one where the hoops and staves go every which way, was ever split open like one frayed Sinner I saw, ripped from chin to where we fart&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove--&gt; below.
:His guts hung between his legs and displayed His vital organs, including that wretched sack Which converts to shit&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove --&gt; whatever gets conveyed down the gullet.
:As I stared at him he looked back And with his hands pulled his chest open, Saying, ''"See how I split open the crack in myself! See how twisted and broken Mohammed is! Before me walks [[Ali]], his face Cleft from chin to crown, grief–stricken."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seth Zimmerman|title=The Inferno of Dante Alighieri |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3hWDEjN7JcC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-28090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene was sometimes shown in illustrations of the ''[[The Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'' before modern times. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century [[fresco]] ''[[Last Judgement]]'' by [[Giovanni da Modena]] and drawing on Dante, in the [[Church of San Petronio]], [[Bologna, Italy]].&lt;ref name=fresco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,742914,00.html|title=Al-Qaida plot to blow up Bologna church fresco|date=2002-06-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Philip Willan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artwork by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[William Blake]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/11/MNGRCH6UQK1.DTL|title=What's behind Muslim cartoon outrage|date=2006-02-11|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ayesha Akram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies in the 21st century==
The start of the 21st century has been marked by controversies over depictions of Muhammad, not only for recent caricatures or cartoons, but also regarding the display of historical artwork.

[[File:Mohammeds Berufung, Hosemann 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Die Berufung Mohammeds durch den Engel Gabriel'' by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1847, published by ''Spiegel'' in 1999]]
In a story on morals at the end of the millennium in December 1999, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, [[Jesus]], [[Confucius]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. In the subsequent weeks, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing the picture of Muhammad. The Turkish TV-station [[Show TV]] broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613871.html Terror am Telefon], ''Spiegel'', February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadeem Elyas, leader of the [[Central Council of Muslims in Germany]] said that the picture should not be printed again in order to avoid hurting the feelings of Muslims intentionally. Elyas recommended to whiten the face of Muhammad instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carolin Emcke]]: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613870.html Fanatiker sind leicht verführbar], Interview with Nadeem Elyas, February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001, the ''Spiegel'' with consideration of Islamic laws published a picture of Muhammed with a whitened face on its title page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45774322.html, 6. Februar 2006 Betr.: Titel], ''Spiegel'', 6 February 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The same picture of Muhammad by Hosemann had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, but then without evoking similar protests.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiegel Special'' 1, 1998, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Italian police reported that they had disrupted a terrorist plot to destroy a church in [[Bologna]], which contains a 15th-century [[fresco]] depicting an image of Muhammad (see above).&lt;ref name=fresco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D9163CF931A1575BC0A9649C8B63|title=Italy frees Fresco Suspects|date=2002-08-22|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of depictions of Muhammad being altered include a 1940 mural at the [[University of Utah]] having the name of Muhammad removed from beneath the painting in 2000 at the request of Muslim students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad depiction controversy lurks in U’s past|url=http://archive.dailyutahchronicle.com/2006/02/22/muhammad-depiction-controversy-lurks-in-us-past/|work=Daily Utah Chronicle|agency=University of Utah|date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' published a set of [[editorial cartoons]], many of which depicted Muhammad. In late 2005 and early 2006, Danish Muslim organizations ignited a [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|controversy]] through public protests and by spreading knowledge of the publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref name=Halicks/&gt; According to John Woods, Islamic history professor at the University of Chicago, it was not simply the depiction of Muhammad that was offensive, but the implication that Muhammad was somehow a supporter of terrorism.&lt;ref name=explaining/&gt; In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of ''Jyllands-Posten'', but Foreign Affairs Minister [[Laila Freivalds]] and the [[Swedish Security Service]] pressured the [[internet service provider]] to shut the page down.

[[File:South park muhammad.jpg|thumb|Muhammad appeared in the 2001 ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Super Best Friends]]". The image was later removed from the 2006 episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]" and the 2010 episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" due to controversies regarding Muhammad cartoons in European newspapers.]]
In 2006, the controversial American [[animated]] television comedy program ''[[South Park]]'', which had previously depicted Muhammad as a [[superhero]] character in the July 4, 2001 episode "[[Super Best Friends]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Super Best Friends | episodelink = Super Best Friends | series = South Park | serieslink = South Park | airdate = 2001-07-04 | season = 5 | number = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since that episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/15/south-parks-been-showing-muhammad-all-season/ |title=Ryan j Budke.

In the episode, "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", they intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to [[Peter Griffin]], a character from the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated series ''[[Family Guy]]''. However, [[Comedy Central]], who airs ''South Park'', rejected the scene, citing concerns of violent protests in the [[Islamic world]]. The creators of ''South Park'' reacted by instead satirizing Comedy Central's [[double standard]] for broadcast acceptability by including a segment of "Cartoon Wars Part II" in which [[President of the United States|American president]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Jesus]] defecate on the [[flag of the United States]].

The [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy]] began in July 2007 with a series of drawings by [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist [[Lars Vilks]] which depicted Muhammad as a [[roundabout dog]]. Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of the drawings on August 18 to illustrate an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy emerged in September 2007 when [[Bangladesh]]i cartoonist [[Arifur Rahman]] was detained on suspicion of showing disrespect to Muhammad.  The interim government confiscated copies of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]]-language ''[[Prothom Alo]]'' in which the drawings appeared. The cartoon consisted of a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man.  The man asks the boy his name, and he replies "Babu". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name.

He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies "Muhammad the cat". The cartoon caused a firestorm in Bangladesh, with militant [[Islamists]] demanding that Rahman be executed for [[blasphemy]]. A group of people [[book burning|torched copies of the paper]] and several Islamic groups protested, saying the drawings ridiculed Mohammad and his companions. They demanded "exemplary punishment" for the paper's editor and the cartoonist. Bangladesh does not have a [[blasphemy law]], although one had been demanded by the same extremist Islamic groups.

On November 2, 2010, the office of the French satirical weekly newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' at Paris was attacked with a firebomb and its website hacked, after it had announced plans to publish a special edition with Muhammad as its “chief editor”, and the title page with a cartoon of Muhammad had been pre-issued on social media.

Everybody Draw Mohammed Day was a protest against those who threatened violence against artists who drew representations of Muhammad. It began as a protest against the action of [[Comedy Central]] in forbidding the broadcast of the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" in response to [[death threat]]s against some of those responsible for the segment. Observance of the day began with a drawing posted on the [[Internet]] on April 20, 2010, accompanied by text suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing representing Muhammad, on May 20, 2010, as a protest against efforts to limit [[freedom of speech]].

A May 3, 2015, event held in Garland, Texas, held by American activists [[Pamela Geller]] and [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], was the scene of a shooting by two individuals who were later themselves shot and killed outside the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/03/us/mohammed-drawing-contest-shooting|title=Two shot dead after they open fire at Mohammed cartoon event in Texas|author=Kevin Conlon and Kristina Sgueglia, CNN|date=4 May 2015|work=CNN|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers assisting in security at the event returned fire and killed the two gunmen. The event offered a $10,000 prize and was said to be in response to the January 2015 attacks on the French magazine ''Charlie Hebdo''.

'''Folklore of Indonesia''' is known in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as ''dongeng'' (lit. "tale") or ''cerita rakyat'' (literally "people's story" or "folklore"), refer to any [[folklore]] found in [[Indonesia]]. Its origins are probably an [[oral culture]], with a range of stories of heroes associated with [[wayang]] and other forms of theatre, transmitted outside of a written culture. Folklore in Indonesia are closely connected with [[Mythology of Indonesia|mythology]].

== Themes ==
Indonesian folklore reflects the diverse [[culture of Indonesia]] as well as the diversity of [[ethnic groups in Indonesia]]. Many ethnic groups have their own collection of tales and folklores that have been told for generations. The stories are usually told to children as bedtime stories, and have [[pedagogical]] values such as kindness, benevolence, modesty, honesty, bravery, patience, persistence, virtue, and [[morality]]. For example, one popular theme is "the truth will always prevail, and evil will always be defeated."

While most Indonesian folkloric stories have happy endings and 'happily ever after' themes, some employ [[tragedy]] and have sad endings.

== Forms ==
Most Indonesian folklore started as oral tradition told by storytellers and parents for generations within Indonesian villages. The stories were often sung or chanted in several oral traditions such as [[pantun]], [[tembang]], or children's chants. Some were performed in performing arts such as [[wayang]] and sendratari ([[Indonesian dance|dance drama]]). In Malay tradition, some of them are written in scripture as [[hikayat]], while in Javanese tradition, several stories are connected with historical figures and historical records such as [[babad]] or older [[kakawin]] scriptures such as [[Pararaton]]. Indian Hindu-Buddhist epics also influenced Indonesian folklore, especially through wayang and dance drama in Java and Bali. The Hindu epics the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] have become their own separate versions with Indonesian twists and interpretations that often differ from the Indian versions. The Buddhist [[Jataka tales]] also has made its way into Indonesian fables and animal folklores. Jataka stories are found carved as narrative bas-reliefs on ancient Javanese [[Candi of Indonesia|candis]], such as the [[Mendut]], [[Borobudur]] and [[Sajiwan]] temples; telling animal fables about the virtues of Buddha, who performed exceptional acts of kindness in his animal incarnations before being reborn as a Boddhisattva and the future Buddha.

These stories have been collected and used in the [[education in Indonesia|Indonesian education system]], in small cheap books, usually tied in with a district or region of Indonesia. Many stories explain events or establish moral allegories using iconic or symbolic characters of the past. They also seek to explain the origins of names of people and places from [[Folk etymology]].

During the [[Suharto]] era, there were sections of the Indonesian Department of Education and Culture that researched and wrote reports on collected ''cerita rakyat''.

[[File:Freitag der 13. im Kalender.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Friday the 13th in a [[calendar]]]]
'''Friday the 13th''' is considered an unlucky day in [[Western culture|Western]] [[superstition]]. It occurs when the 13th day of the month in the [[Gregorian calendar]] falls on a [[Friday]], which happens at least once every year but can occur up to three times in the same year,&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/weekday-friday-13|title=Months and Years having Friday the 13th|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;for example in 2015, on 13 Feb, 13 March and 13 October. In 2017, it occurred twice, on 13 January and 13 October. In 2018, it also occurred twice, on 13 April and 13 July.&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com2" /&gt; There will be two Friday the 13ths every year until 2020; 2021 and 2022 will have just one occurrence each.

A Friday the 13th occurs during any month that begins on a Sunday.

==History==
The fear of the number 13 has been given a scientific name: "[[triskaidekaphobia]]"; and on analogy to this the fear of Friday the 13th is called  ''paraskevidekatriaphobia'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''Paraskeví'' (Παρασκευή, meaning "Friday"), and ''dekatreís'' (δεκατρείς, meaning "thirteen").&lt;ref name=mathworld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Triskaidekaphobia.html |title=Triskaidekaphobia on MathWorld |accessdate=14 August 2010 |author=Weisstein, Eric W |publisher=[[MathWorld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Última Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|thumb|350px|right|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' by Leonardo da Vinci]]

The superstition surrounding this day may have arisen in the [[Middle Ages]], "originating from the story of Jesus' [[last supper]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]" in which there were 13 individuals present in the [[Upper Room]] on the 13th of Nisan [[Maundy Thursday]], the night before his death on [[Good Friday]].&lt;ref name=DellaContrada&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2004/02/6576.html |title=Fear of "Friday the 13th may likely have originated from Jesus' Last Supper and Crucifixion", Says UB Anthropologist |last=DellaContrada |first=John |date=9 February 2004 |publisher=[[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] |accessdate=13 July 2014 |quote=There were 13 people at the [[upper room|table]] (at the [[Last Supper]]) and the 13th was [[Jesus]]. The Last Supper was on a [[Maundy Thursday|Thursday]], and the next day was [[Good Friday|Friday]], the day of [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. When '13' and Friday come together, it is a double whammy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartston2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hartston| first=Willam |title=Encyclopedia of Useless Information |date=1 June 2007 |publisher=Sourcebooks, Incorporated |isbn=9781402248382 |page=365 |quote=In Christian tradition, fear of Friday the 13th stems from the day of the Crucifixion (Friday) and the number at the Last Supper (13). Despite these origins, the Friday the 13th superstition dates back only to the Middle Ages.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 July 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While there is evidence of both [[Friday]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[Friday]] has been considered an unlucky day to undertake journeys or begin new projects at least since the 14th century, as witnessed by Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the number 13 being considered unlucky, there is no record of the two items being referred to as especially unlucky in conjunction before the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Lachenmeyer&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/13.html?id=sDXJ1s0YNAgC Nathaniel Lachenmeyer, ''13: The Story of the World's Most Popular Superstition''] ch. 5 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt;&lt;ref name=western&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clar, Mimi |journal=Western Folklore |year=1957 |title=Friday the 13th |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early documented reference in English occurs in [[Henry Sutherland Edwards]]' 1869 biography of [[Gioachino Rossini]], who died on a Friday 13th:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Rossini] was surrounded to the last by admiring friends; and if it be true that, like so many Italians, he regarded Fridays as an unlucky day and thirteen as an unlucky number, it is remarkable that on Friday 13th of November he passed away.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sutherland Edwards, ''The Life of Rossini'', Blackett, 1869, p.340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Rossini by Grevedon.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] by Henri Grevedon]]
It is  possible that the publication in 1907 of [[Thomas W. Lawson (businessman)|Thomas W. Lawson]]'s popular novel ''Friday, the Thirteenth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas W. Lawson |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12345/12345-h/12345-h.htm |title=Thomas W. Lawson, '&amp;#39;Friday, the Thirteenth'&amp;#39; (1907) |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to disseminating the superstition. In the novel, an unscrupulous [[broker]] takes advantage of the superstition to create a [[Wall Street]] panic on a Friday the 13th.&lt;ref name=Lachenmeyer/&gt;

A suggested origin of the superstition—Friday, 13 October 1307, the date [[Philip IV of France]]  [[Knights Templar#Arrests, charges and dissolution|arrested]] hundreds of the [[Knights Templar]]—may not have been formulated until the [[20th century]]. It is mentioned in the 1955 [[Maurice Druon]] historical novel ''[[The Iron King]]'' (''Le Roi de fer''), [[John J. Robinson]]'s 1989 work ''Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry'',  [[Dan Brown]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and [[Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry]]'s ''[[The Templar Legacy]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name=mathworld/&gt;&lt;ref name=Snopes&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.snopes.com/luck/friday13.asp |title=Friday the 13th |accessdate=26 March 2007 |work=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=why&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/friday_the_13th_4.htm |title=Why Friday the 13th Is Unlucky |publisher=Urbanlegends.about.com |date= |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuesday the 13th in Hispanic and Greek culture==
In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking countries]], instead of Friday, Tuesday the 13th (''martes trece'') is considered a day of bad luck.&lt;ref name="Falcón"&gt;Rafael Falcón, Christine Yoder Falcón [https://books.google.com/books?id=os7DMzXq1rcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Tuesday+the+13th+is+considered+bad+luck&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Tuesday%20the%2013th%20is%20considered%20bad%20luck&amp;f=false ''Salsa: a taste of Hispanic culture''], p. 64, Praeger (1998), {{ISBN|0-275-96121-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greece|Greeks]] also consider Tuesday (and especially the 13th) an unlucky day.&lt;ref name=GR&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chrysopoulos |first1=Philip |title=Why Superstitious Greeks Fear Tuesday the 13th |url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/10/13/why-superstitious-greeks-fear-tuesday-the-13th/ |publisher=Greek Reporter |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuesday is considered dominated by the influence of Ares, the god of war ([[Mars_(mythology)|''Mars'']] in Roman mythology). The fall of Constantinople to the [[Fourth Crusade]] occurred on [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|Tuesday, April 13, 1204]], and the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] happened on Tuesday, 29 May 1453, events that strengthen the superstition about Tuesday. In addition, in [[Greek language|Greek]] the name of the day is '''Triti''' (''Τρίτη'') meaning the third (day of the week), adding weight to the superstition, since bad luck is said to "come in threes".&lt;ref name=GR/&gt;

Tuesday the 13th occurs in a month that begins on a Thursday.

==Friday the 17th in Italy==
In [[Italy|Italian]] popular culture, Friday the 17th (and not the 13th) is considered a day of bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.lastampa.it/domande-risposte/articolo/lstp/442871/|title=Venerdì 17 porta davvero sfortuna?|publisher=La Stampa|date=17 February 2012|author=Carlo Grande|accessdate=31 March 2012|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this belief could be traced in the writing of number 17, in [[Roman numerals]]: XVII. By shuffling the digits of the number one can easily get the word VIXI ("I have lived", implying death in the present), an omen of bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/bad-omen-for-italy-as-their-unlucky-number-comes-up-400380.html |title=Bad omen for Italy as their unlucky number comes up |author=Nick Harris |date=15 November 2007 |website=[[The Independent]] |access-date=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in Italy, 13 is generally considered a lucky number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafebabel.it/article/24987/venerdi-13-17-fortuna-sfortuna-italia.html|title=Venerdì 13 porta (s)fortuna? Non in Italia|publisher=cafebabel.com|accessdate=31 March 2012|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to [[Americanization]], young people consider Friday the 13th unlucky as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corrieredelmezzogiorno.corriere.it/napoli/notizie/politica/2011/1-febbraio-2011/venerdi-13-giorno-che-porta-sfortunamara-rimanda-nozze-mezzaroma-181375178964.shtml|title=Venerdì 13 è un giorno che porta sfortuna – Mara rimanda le nozze con Mezzaroma|publisher=Corriere del Mezzogiorno|date=1 February 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000 parody film ''[[Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth]]'' was released in Italy with the title ''Shriek – Hai impegni per venerdì 17?'' ("''Shriek – Do You Have Something to Do on Friday the 17th?''").

Friday the 17th occurs on a month starting on Wednesday.

==Social impact==
According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], an estimated 17 to 21 million people in the [[United States]] are affected by a fear of this day, making it the most feared day and date in history. Some people are so paralyzed by fear that they avoid their normal routines in doing business, taking flights or even getting out of bed. "It's been estimated that [[United States dollar|[US]$]]800 or $900 million is lost in business on this day".&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/02/0212_040212_friday13.html |title=Friday the 13th Phobia Rooted in Ancient History |accessdate=29 October 2008|date=12 August 2004|author=Roach, John |work=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, representatives for both [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[Continental Airlines]] (the latter now merged into United Airlines) have stated that their airlines do not suffer from any noticeable drop in travel on those Fridays.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Sens, "[http://www.viamagazine.com/travel-tips/friday-13th-lucky-or-unlucky Some Don't Count on lucky]", ''Via Magazine'', January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, a consortium of governmental and nongovernmental organizations led by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health promotes the [[National Accident Day (Finland)|National Accident Day]] (''kansallinen tapaturmapäivä'') to raise awareness about automotive safety, which always falls on a Friday the 13th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyosuojelu.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/5757 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045702/http://www.tyosuojelu.fi/fi/ajankohtaista/5757 |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is coordinated by the Finnish Red Cross and has been held since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kotitapaturma.fi/mika-on-tapaturmapaiva/|title=Mikä on Tapaturmapäivä?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kotitapaturma.fi|language=fi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers analyzed the traffic flow and number of injuries from car accidents on the southern section of London's M25 motorway during the five months that the 13th fell on a Friday between 1990 and 1992. They compared these numbers to data collected on Friday the 6th of the same months, and found that although there are consistently fewer vehicles on the road during the 13th — possibly as a result of superstitious people choosing not to drive that day, the researchers proposed — "the risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 percent" on the 13th.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/1998/03/er_and_the_triple_hex.html|title=When a full moon and a lunar eclipse collide with Friday the 13th, do more accidents really happen?|date=20 March 1998|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|language=English|accessdate=13 April 2018|author=[[Atul Gawande]]|quote=The 1993 study, published in the British Medical Journal, compared hospital admissions for traffic accidents on a Friday the 13th with those on a Friday the 6th in a community outside London.

On the contrary, the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics on 12 June 2008 stated that "fewer accidents and reports of fire and theft occur when the 13th of the month falls on a Friday than on other Fridays, because people are preventatively more careful or just stay home. Statistically speaking, driving is slightly safer on Friday the 13th, at least in the [[Netherlands]]; in the last two years, Dutch insurers received reports of an average 7,800 traffic accidents each Friday; but the average figure when the 13th fell on a Friday was just 7,500."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/friday-13th-is-no-longer-unlucky-313210 Mirror.co.uk], "Friday 13th is no longer unlucky".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUKL1268660720080613|title=Friday 13th not more unlucky, Dutch study shows|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
In years which begin on the same day of the week and are of the same type (that is, whether they are a [[common year]] or [[leap year]]), Friday the 13th occurs in the same months.

This sequence, given here for 1900–2099, follows a 28-year cycle from 1 March 1900 to 28 February 2100. The months with a Friday the 13th are determined by the [[Dominical letter]] (G, F, GF, etc.) of the year. Any month that starts on a Sunday contains a Friday the 13th, and there is at least one Friday the 13th in every calendar year. There can be as many as three Friday the 13ths in a single calendar year; either in February, March and November in a [[common year starting on Thursday]] (such as 2009, 2015 or 2026) [[Dominical letter|(D)]], or January, April and July in a [[leap year starting on Sunday]] (such as 2012) [[Dominical letter|(AG)]].

The longest period that occurs without a Friday the 13th is 14 months, either from July to September the following year being a [[common year starting on Tuesday]] [[Dominical letter|(F)]] (e.g. 2001/02, 2012/13 and 2018/19), or from August to October the following year being a [[leap year starting on Saturday]] [[Dominical letter|(BA)]] (e.g. 1999/2000 and 2027/28).

The shortest period that occurs with a Friday the 13th is just one month, from February to March in a [[common year starting on Thursday]] [[Dominical letter|(D)]] (e.g. 2009, 2015 and 2026).

Each [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] 400-year cycle contains 146,097 days (with 97 [[leap year|leap days]]) or exactly 20,871 weeks. Therefore, each cycle contains the same pattern of days of the week and thus the same pattern of Fridays that are on the 13th. The 13th day of the month is slightly more likely to be a Friday than any other day of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://x42.com/datelab/daydist.shtml|title=About the date+day-distribution along the epoch |date=13 November 1998 |author=Bodin, Magnus |work=x42 |access-date=30 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.H.

In Finland one F13 is chosen as [[National Accident Day (Finland)|National Accident Day]] to raise awareness about automotive safety, this is possible because there is at least one F13 each year.&lt;ref name="timeanddate.com1" /&gt;

The '''''Funeral of St. Jerome'''''   is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Filippo Lippi]] of [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]]'s funeral. It is housed in the [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Prato)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]] next to the [[Cathedral of Prato]], central Italy.

==History==
The large altarpiece was commissioned by the [[provost (religion)|provost]] of [[Prato]],  [[Geminiano Inghirami]], a patron of the arts who also called [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] to work in the cathedral. The panel is dated 1440, but this has been always considered a false due to the large stylistic  differences with other Lippi's works of the period. It is generally recognized to be from between 1452, when Lippi arrived in Prato (or a few years before), and Inghirami's death in 1460.

It is housed in the cathedral's museum since the 20th century.

==Description==
The work features numerous characters, painted in different attitudes. In the center, lying on a [[catafalque]] with a precious cloth decorated with [[pomegranate]]s, is the body of St. Jerome. He is surrounded by a group of monks, whose faces show their mourning and despair for the saint's death. The pomegranate cloth is also visible in the funerary monument of  Geminiano Inghirami, once in the church of [[San Francesco, Prato|San Francesco]], attributed to  [[Pasquino da Montepulciano]] (1460).

The mourner's faces show that Lippi had studied [[Giotto]]'s work in the [[Bardi Chapel]], as some gestures are very similar, such as that of the monks kissing the saint's feet or the one raising his hands. Also the saint's position is similar to Giotto's, as well as the presence of ancient numismatic, a widespread theme at the time.

In the foreground is Inghirami kneeling, with a crippled youth in front of him who points at Jerome's body (a trick to avoid that the donor's red garments could distract the observer). The crippled figure is inspired by the frescoes by [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino da Panicale]] in the [[Brancacci Chapel]], which Lippi knew well as he had a been a monk in the convent housing the chapel in his youth.

The upper part of the panel, aside from rocky mountains with three secondary scenes (Adoration of the Child and two episodes of the saint's life), is occupied by angels, perhaps executed by [[Fra' Diamante]] or another collaborator. Among them circles which allude to the Heaven's Circles, the Redeemer (with a book with Alpha and Omega), the Holy Spirit dove and the Jesus opening his arms.

At the bottom is the coat of arms of the  Inghirami family.

In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman Mythology]],  the '''[[Giant]]s''', also called '''Gigantes''' (''jye-GAHN-tees'' or ''gee-GAHN-tees''; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Γίγαντες, ''Gígantes'', {{small|singular:}} Γίγας, ''Gígas'') were a race of great strength and aggression, though not necessarily of great size, known for the '''Gigantomachy''' ('''Gigantomachia'''), their battle with the [[Olympian gods]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, pp. 177&amp;ndash;179; Gantz, pp. 445&amp;ndash;454.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hesiod]], the Giants were the offspring of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth), born from the blood that fell when [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] (Sky) was castrated by his [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] son [[Cronus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+185 185]. [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]''  [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html Preface] gives [[Tartarus]] as the father of the Giants. A parallel to the Giants' birth is the birth of [[Aphrodite]] from the similarly fertilized sea.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaic and Classical representations show Gigantes as man-sized [[hoplites]] (heavily armed ancient Greek foot soldiers) fully human in form.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 446, 447.&lt;/ref&gt; Later representations (after c. 380 BC) show Gigantes with snakes for legs.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 453; Hanfmann 1992, ''[[The Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' s.v. "Giants"; Frazer 1898b, note to Pausanias 8.29.3 "That the giants have serpents instead of feet" [https://archive.org/stream/pausaniassdescr01pausgoog#page/n336/mode/2up pp. 315&amp;ndash;316].&lt;/ref&gt; In later traditions, the Giants were often confused with other opponents of the Olympians, particularly the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], an earlier generation of large and powerful children of Gaia and Uranus.

The vanquished Giants were said to be buried under volcanoes and to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

==Origins==

The name "Gigantes" is usually taken to imply "earth-born",&lt;ref&gt;Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA86  p. 86]; Gantz, p. 16; Merry, ''Homer's Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0055%3Abook%3D7%3Acommline%3D59 7.59]; Douglas Harper mentions that a [[Pre-Greek]] origin has also been proposed ([http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=giant "giant"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' makes this explicit by having the Giants be the offspring of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth). According to Hesiod, Gaia, mating with Uranus, bore many children: the first generation of [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], the [[Cyclops]] and the [[Hundred-Handers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+132 132&amp;ndash;153]&lt;/ref&gt; But Uranus hated his children and, as soon as they were born, he imprisoned them inside of Gaia, causing her much distress. And so Gaia made a sickle of adamant which she gave to [[Cronus]], the youngest of her Titan sons, and hid him (presumably still inside Gaia's body) to wait in ambush.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+154 154&amp;ndash;175]; Gantz, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; And when Uranus came to lie with Gaia, Cronus castrated his father, and "the bloody drops that gushed forth [Gaia] received, and as the seasons moved round she bore ... the great Giants."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+176 176 ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; From these same drops of blood also came the [[Erinyes]] (Furies) and the [[Meliai]] (ash tree nymphs), while the severed genitals of Uranus falling into the sea resulted in a white foam from which [[Aphrodite]] grew. The mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] also has the Giants being the offspring of Gaia and Uranus, though he makes no connection with Uranus' castration, saying simply that Gaia "vexed on account of the Titans, brought forth the Giants".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1]; Hansen, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three brief references to the ''Gigantes'' in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', though it's not entirely clear that Homer and Hesiod understood the term to mean the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 446. Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82 n. 74] says that the "''Odyssey''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Giants stand a little outside the remainder of the tradition, in so far as they are ethnologized into a wild, arrogant, and doomed race, formerly presided over by a king Eurymedon." Hanfmann 1937, p. 175, sees in the "conflicting" descriptions of Homer and Hesiod, "two different local traditions".&lt;/ref&gt; Homer has Giants among the ancestors of the [[Phaiakian]]s, a race of men encountered by [[Odysseus]], their ruler [[Alcinous]] being the son of [[Nausithous]], who was the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Periboea]], the daughter of the Giant king Eurymedon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7.59&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 7.56&amp;ndash;63]. [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Acusilaus]] make the Phaiakians, like the Giants, offspring of the castration of Uranus, Gantz, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the ''Odyssey'', Alcinous says that the Phaiakians, like the Cyclopes and the Giants, are "near kin" to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7.199&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 7.199&amp;ndash;207].&lt;/ref&gt; Odysseus describes the [[Laestrygonians]] (another race encountered by Odysseus in his travels) as more like Giants than men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+10.120&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.119&amp;ndash;120].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the 2nd century AD geographer, read these lines of the ''Odyssey'' to mean that, for Homer, the Giants were a race of mortal men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.29.1 8.29.1&amp;ndash;4]. Smith, William, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DG%3Aentry+group%3D7%3Aentry%3Dgigantes-bio-1 "Gigantes"] and Hanfmann 1992, ''[[The Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' s.v. "Giants", following Pausanias, both assert that, for Homer, the Giants were a "savage race of men". For the mythographer [[Diodorus Siculus]], the Giants were also a race of men, see [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.21.5], Gantz, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th&amp;ndash;5th century BC lyric poet [[Bacchylides]] calls the Giants "sons of the Earth".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bacchylides]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0064%3Abook%3DDith 15.63]; Castriota, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;pg=PA233 pp. 233&amp;ndash;234].&lt;/ref&gt; Later the term "gegeneis" ("earthborn") became a common epithet of the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encquran.brill.nl/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/gegeneis-e420500?s.num=10 "Gegeneis"], ''Brills New Pauly''; Crusius, [https://books.google.com/books?id=f35J6nfeZe0C&amp;pg=PA93 p.93]; ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/hesiodhomerichym1914hesi#page/542/mode/2up 7 (pp. 542&amp;ndash;543)]; [[Sophocles]], ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Soph.+Trach.+1058 1058]; [[Euripides]], ''[[The Phoenician Women]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=432E6B38906EB97E3B6E0D6EDADF1CB8?doc=Eur.+Phoen.+1131 1131]; [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/504/mode/2up 127 (pp. 504&amp;ndash;505)], [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/610/mode/2up 1408 (pp. 610&amp;ndash;611)].&lt;/ref&gt; The first century Latin writer [[Hyginus]] has the Giants being the offspring of Gaia and [[Tartarus]], another primordial Greek deity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]''  [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html Preface]. [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Genealogiarum_liber_-_Praefatio Latin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confusion with Titans and others==
Though distinct in early traditions,&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; Hellenistic and later writers often confused or conflated the Giants and their Gigantomachy, with an earlier set of offspring of Gaia and Uranus, the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] and their war with the Olympian gods, the [[Titanomachy]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DG%3Aentry+group%3D7%3Aentry%3Dgigantes-bio-1 "Gigantes"]; Gantz, p. 447; Hansen p. 178, Grimal, p. 171; Tripp, p. 250; Morford, pp. 82&amp;ndash;83. A probable early confusion, (or at least a possible cause of later confusion) can be seen in [[Euripides]]' ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0112%3Acard%3D203 221&amp;ndash;224] and ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9E598FCE225CCCB46AC844AFDB838A04?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0098%3Acard%3D466 466&amp;ndash;474], see Torrance, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1x3HlgTPlrkC&amp;pg=PA155 p. 155 n. 74]. Later examples include [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn 4 (to Delos)'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/98/mode/2up 173 ff. (pp. 98&amp;ndash;99)] (see Vian and Moore 1988 p. 193; Mineur, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mZU3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170 p. 170]).&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion extended to other opponents of the Olympians, including the huge monster [[Typhon]],&lt;ref&gt;Rose, ''[[The Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' s.v. "Typhon, Typhoeus"; Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&amp;pg=PA80 p. 80].&lt;/ref&gt; the offspring of [[Gaia]] and [[Tartarus]], whom [[Zeus]] finally defeated with his thunderbolt, and the [[Aloadae]], the large, strong and aggressive brothers Otus and Ephialtes, who piled [[Pelion]] on top of [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Ossa]] in order to scale the heavens and attack the Olympians (though in the case of Ephialtes there was probably a Giant with the same name).&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 450&amp;ndash;451.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Hyginus]] includes the names of three Titans: [[Coeus]], [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], and [[Astraeus]], along with Typhon and the Aloadae, in his list of Giants,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]''  [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html Preface]. For other examples of Typhon as a Giant, see [[Horace]], ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0025%3Abook%3D3%3Apoem%3D4 3.4.53], (which has Typhon  battling Athena, alongside the Giants Mimas, Porphyrion, and Enceladus); [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], ''[[Astronomica (Manilius)|Astronomica]]'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/manilius-astronomica/1977/pb_LCL469.151.xml 2.874&amp;ndash;880 (pp. 150&amp;ndash;151)]; [[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/16/mode/2up 1.176 (I pp. 16&amp;ndash;17)], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/18/mode/2up 1.220 (I pp. 18&amp;ndash;19)], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/20/mode/2up 1.244 (I pp. 20&amp;ndash;21)], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/22/mode/2up 1.263 (I pp. 22&amp;ndash;23)], [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/24/mode/2up 1.291 (I pp. 24&amp;ndash;25)].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ovid]], seems to conflate the Gigantomachy with the later siege of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] by the Aloadae.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, p. 178; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D89 1.151–162]. See also [[Horace]], ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]''  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0025%3Abook%3D3%3Apoem%3D4 3.4.42 ff.], with Lyne [https://books.google.com/books?id=SEZARFIJqPwC&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51]. [[Plato]] had already associated the Aloadae with the Giants, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DSym.%3Asection%3D190b 190b&amp;ndash;c].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions==
Homer describes the Giant king Eurymedon as "great-hearted" (''μεγαλήτορος''), and his people as "insolent" (''ὑπερθύμοισι'') and "froward" (''ἀτάσθαλος'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D37 7.58&amp;ndash;60]. The translations given are A.T. Murray's. [[Richard Lattimore]] translates ''ὑπερθύμοισι'' as "high-hearted" and ''ἀτάσθαλος'' as "recklessly daring". See also Liddell and Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmegalh%2Ftwr ''μεγαλήτωρ''] ("greathearted"), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Du(pe%2Frqumos ''ὑπέρθυμος''] ("overweening"), and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da)ta%2Fsqalos ''ἀτάσθαλος''] ("reckless, presumptuous, wicked").&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod calls the Giants "strong" (''κρατερῶν'') and "great" (''μεγάλους'') which may or may not be a reference to their size.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+50&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0129 50], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+185&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0129 185]; Liddell and Scott [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkratero%2Fs ''κρατερός], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Fgas ''μέγας'']; Hansen, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Though a possible later addition, the ''Theogony'' also has the Giants born "with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands".&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early sources characterize the Giants by their excesses. [[Pindar]] describes the excessive violence of the Giant Porphyrion as having provoked "beyond all measure".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D8 8.12&amp;ndash;18].&lt;/ref&gt; Bacchylides calls the Giants arrogant, saying that they were destroyed by "Hybris" (the Greek word hubris personified).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bacchylides]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0064%3Abook%3DDith 15.50 ff.]; Castriota, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;pg=PA139  p. 139], [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;pg=PA233 pp. 233&amp;ndash;234].&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier seventh century BC poet [[Alcman]] perhaps had already used the Giants as an example of hubris, with the phrases "vengeance of the gods" and "they suffered unforgettable punishments for the evil they did" being possible references to the Gigantomachy.&lt;ref&gt;Alcman fragment 1 ''Poetarum melicorum Graecorum fragmenta'', see Cairns, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9--TlDdWfdsC&amp;pg=PA310 p. 310]; Wilkinson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSp0mnpkE_QC&amp;pg=PA142 p. 142]; Ferrari, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXbG_4TRs8QC&amp;pg=PA28 28], [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXbG_4TRs8QC&amp;pg=PA109 109], [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXbG_4TRs8QC&amp;pg=PA151 151 ff.]; Hanfmann 1937, pp. 475&amp;ndash;476.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer's comparison of the Giants to the [[Laestrygonians]] is suggestive of similarities between the two races. The Laestrygonians, who "hurled ... rocks huge as a man could lift", certainly possessed great strength, and possibly great size, as their king's wife is described as being as big as a mountain.&lt;ref&gt;According to Gantz, p 446: "In all, the account rather suggests that the huge bulk of  Antiphates' wife is not typical of the Laistrygones as a whole. But they  are clearly thought of as good-sized, although whether it is in this respect that they are like the Gigantes and unlike men we cannot say; the ''Odyssey''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s emphasis might be thought to fall more on their uncivilized behjavior"&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, descriptions of the Giants make them less human, more monstrous and more "gigantic". According to [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] the Giants had great size and strength, a frightening appearance, with long hair and beards and scaly feet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] makes them "serpent-footed" with a "hundred arms",&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D163 1.182 ff.]; Newlands, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U99CAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81 p. 81]. Here Ovid has apparently conflated the Giants with the [[Hundred-Handers]]: Anderson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t12AuG0q144C&amp;pg=PA170 p. 170, note to line 184 "''centum'' with ''bracchia''"]. Compare with ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/262/mode/2up 5.35&amp;ndash;42], where Ovid says "Earth brought forth the Giants, a fierce brood, enormous monsters, who durst assault Jove's mansion; she gave them a thousand hands, and snakes for legs".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nonnus]] has them  "serpent-haired".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/dionysiaca01nonnuoft#page/n61/mode/2up 1.18 (I, pp. 4&amp;ndash;5)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Gigantomachy==

The most important divine struggle in Greek mythology was the Gigantomachy, the battle fought between the Giants and the Olympian gods for supremacy of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21].&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily for this battle that the Giants are known, and its importance to Greek culture is attested by the frequent depiction of the Gigantomachy in Greek art.

===Early sources===

[[File:Athena Enkelados Louvre CA3662.jpg|thumb|[[Athena]] (left) fighting the Giant [[Enceladus (giant)|Enceladus]] (inscribed retrograde) on an [[Attica|Attic]] [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] dish, c. 550&amp;ndash;500 BC ([[Louvre]] CA3662).&lt;ref&gt;Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/3572A177-0DAE-4EED-8140-BEA13D762135 200059], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+342%22 Gigantes 342].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The references to the Gigantomachy in archaic sources are sparse.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 15. For a survey of literary sources see Gantz, pp. 445&amp;ndash;450,  Vian and Moore 1988, pp. 191&amp;ndash;196.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Homer nor Hesiod mention anything about the Giants battling the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;
Homer's remark that Eurymedon "brought destruction on his froward people" might possibly be a reference to the Gigantomachy&lt;ref&gt;A scholion to ''Odyssey'' 7.59 asserts that Homer does not know that the Giants fought against the gods, Gantz, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hesiod's remark that [[Heracles]] performed a "great work among the immortals"&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+954 954]; for the translation used here see Most 2006, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; is probably a reference to Heracles' crucial role in the gods' victory over the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hesiodic ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' (or the ''Ehoia'') following mentions of his sacks of [[Troy]] and of [[Kos]], refers to Heracles having slain "presumptious Giants".&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod fragment 43a.65 MW, see Most 2007, p. 143. Gantz, p. 446, says that this line "with no link to what precedes or follows, might easily be an interpolation".&lt;/ref&gt; Another probable reference to the Gigantomachy in the ''Catalogue'' has Zeus produce Heracles to be "a protector against ruin for gods and men".&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod fragment 195.28&amp;ndash;29 MW, Most 2007, p. 5; Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are indications that there might have been a lost epic poem, a ''Gigantomachia'', which gave an account of the war: Hesiod's ''Theogony'' says that the [[Muses]] sing of the Giants,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+50 50&amp;ndash;52].&lt;/ref&gt; and the sixth century BC poet [[Xenophanes]] mentions the Gigantomachy as a subject to be avoided at table.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophanes]], 1.21 (Lesher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LxxJXTviacgC&amp;pg=PA12 pp. 12, 13]); Gantz, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]] scholia refers to a "''Gigantomachia''" in which the Titan [[Cronus]] (as a horse) sires the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] by mating with [[Philyra (mythology)|Philyra]] (the daughter of two Titans), but the scholiast may be confusing the Titans and Giants.&lt;ref&gt;Since Chiron did apparently figure in a lost poem about the Titanomachy, and there is no obvious role for the centaur in a poem about the Gigantomachy, see Gantz, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible archaic sources include the lyric poets Alcman (mentioned above) and the sixth-century [[Ibycus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson [https://books.google.com/books?id=iSp0mnpkE_QC&amp;pg=PA141 pp. 141&amp;ndash;142]; Gantz p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The late sixth early fifth century BC lyric poet [[Pindar]] provides some of the earliest details of the battle between the Giants and the Olympians. He locates it "on the plain of [[Phlegra (mythology)|Phlegra]]" and has [[Teiresias]] foretell Heracles killing Giants "beneath [his] rushing arrows".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D1 1.67&amp;ndash;69].&lt;/ref&gt; He calls Heracles "you who subdued the Giants",&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D7 7.90].&lt;/ref&gt; and has [[Porphyrion]], who he calls "the king of the Giants", being overcome by the bow of [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Pythian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D8 8.12&amp;ndash;18].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euripides]]' ''[[Herakles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' has its hero shooting Giants with arrows,&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''[[Herakles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=779AD6C623207413812A728B409D9381?doc=Eur.+Her.+177&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0102 177&amp;ndash;180]; Gantz, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' has the chorus describe seeing a depiction of the Gigantomachy on the late sixth century [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo at Delphi]], with [[Athena]] fighting the Giant [[Enceladus (giant)|Enceladus]] with her "gorgon shield", [[Zeus]] burning the Giant [[Mimas (Giant)|Mimas]] with his "mighty thunderbolt, blazing at both ends", and [[Dionysus]] killing an unnamed Giant with his "ivy staff".&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Ion+206&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0110 205&amp;ndash;218].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apollodorus===
[[File:Dionysos Giant Louvre G434.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dionysus]] (left) with ivy crown, and [[thyrsus]] attacking a Giant, [[Attica|Attic]] [[red-figure]] ''[[pelike]]'', c. 475&amp;ndash;425 BC ([[Louvre]] G434).&lt;ref&gt;Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/4DA73FC2-375D-420B-92C9-32C252B34D82 207774].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most detailed account of the Gigantomachy&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; is that of the (first century or second century AD) mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1&amp;ndash;2].&lt;/ref&gt; None of the early sources give any reasons for the war. Scholia to the ''[[Iliad]]'' mention the rape of [[Hera]] by the Giant Eurymedon&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 16, 57, 448&amp;ndash;449; Hard [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA88 p.88]. According to Gantz, p. 449, it is possible but unlikely, that this is the incident being referred to in Odyssey 7, noting that the story of the rape of Hera by Eurymedon may be a later invention to explain Homer's remark.&lt;/ref&gt; and according to scholia to [[Pindar]]'s ''Isthmian'' 6, it was the theft of the cattle of [[Helios]] by the Giant [[Alcyoneus]] that started the war.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 419, 448&amp;ndash;449.&lt;/ref&gt;  Apollodorus, who also mentions the theft of Helios' cattle by Alcyoneus,&lt;ref&gt;According to Apollodorus, Alcyoneus stole Helios' cattle from [[Erytheia]], where the cattle of [[Geryon]] are usually found.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a mother's revenge as the motive for the war, saying that Gaia bore the Giants because of her anger over the Titans (who had been vanquished and imprisoned by the Olympians).&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 449; Grimal, p. 171; Tripp, p. 251. The  late 4th century AD Latin poet [[Claudian]] expands on this notion in his ''Gigantomachia'' [https://archive.org/stream/claudia02clau#page/280/mode/2up 1&amp;ndash;35 (pp. 280&amp;ndash;283)] with Gaia, "jealous of the heavenly kingdoms and in pity for the ceasless woes of the Titans" (1&amp;ndash;2), gave birth to the Giants,  urging them to war saying "Up, army of avengers, the hour is come at last, free the Titans from their chains; defend your mother." (27&amp;ndash;28)&lt;/ref&gt; Seemingly, as soon as the Giants are born they begin hurling "rocks and burning oaks at the sky".&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+185 185&amp;ndash;186] which seems to have the Giants born, like [[Athena]] and the [[Spartoi]], fully grown and armed for battle (Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.3.6 1.3.6], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.3.6 1.3.6]). Also compare with [[Plato]], ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=6EA8185321C1F13AC8EBBFB34B9BDAA7?doc=Plat.+Soph.+246a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172 246a], where comparing materialist philosophers with the Giants, says they "drag down everything from heaven and the invisible to earth, actually grasping rocks and trees with their hands".&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a prophecy that the Giants could not be killed by the gods alone, but they could be killed with the help of a mortal.&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [[Pindar]],  ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D1 1.67&amp;ndash;69] (mentioned above) where [[Teiresias]] prophesies that Heracles will aid the gods in their battle with the Giants.&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing this, Gaia sought for a certain plant (''pharmakon'') that would protect the Giants. Before Gaia or anyone else could find this plant, Zeus forbade [[Eos]] (Dawn), [[Selene]] (Moon) and [[Helios]] (Sun) to shine, harvested all of the plant himself and then he had [[Athena]] summon Heracles.

According to Apollodorus, Alcyoneus and [[Porphyrion]] were the two strongest Giants. Heracles shot Alcyoneus, who fell to the ground but then revived, for Alcyoneus was immortal within his native land. So Heracles, with [[Athena]]'s advice, dragged him beyond the borders of that land, where Alcyoneus then died (compare with [[Antaeus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Antaeus, another offspring of Gaia who was an opponent of Heracles, was immortal as long as he was in contact with the earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by crushing him while holding him off the ground. For [[Pindar]], Hearacles' battle with Alcyoneus (whom he calls a herdsman) and the Gigantomachy were separate events, see: ''Isthmian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DI.%3Apoem%3D6 6.30&amp;ndash;35], ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D4 4.24&amp;ndash;30].&lt;/ref&gt; Porphyrion attacked Heracles and [[Hera]], but Zeus caused Porphyrion to become enamoured of Hera, whom Porphyrion then tried to rape, but Zeus struck Porphyrion with his thunderbolt and Heracles killed him with an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;As noted above Pindar has Apollo kill Porphyrion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Giants and their fates are mentioned by Apollodorus. Ephialtes was blinded by an arrow from Apollo in his left eye, and another arrow from Heracles in his right. [[Eurytus]] was killed by [[Dionysus]] with his [[thyrsus]], [[Clytius]] by [[Hecate]] with her torches and [[Mimas (Giant)|Mimas]] by [[Hephaestus]] with "missiles of red-hot metal" from his forge.&lt;ref&gt;As noted above, Euripides has Zeus kill Mimas; other accounts have Mimas killed by [[Ares]]: [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/argonautica00apoluoft#page/276/mode/2up 3.1225&amp;ndash;7 (pp. 276&amp;ndash;277)]; [[Claudian]], ''Gigantomachia'' [https://archive.org/stream/claudia02clau#page/286/mode/2up 85&amp;ndash;91 (pp. 286&amp;ndash;287)].&lt;/ref&gt; Athena crushed Enceladus under the Island of Sicily and flayed [[Pallas (Giant)|Pallas]], using his skin as a shield. [[Poseidon]] broke off a piece of the island of [[Kos]] called [[Nisyros]], and threw it on top of [[Polybotes]] ([[Strabo]] also relates the story of Polybotes buried under Nisyros but adds that some say Polybotes lies under Kos instead).&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Strab.+10.5.16 10.5.16]. The mention of a millstone, in the poem fragment by Alcman (mentioned above) may be an early reference to the island of Nisyros, see Hanfmann 1937, pp. 476; Vian and Moore 1988, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermes]], wearing [[Hades]]' helmet, killed Hippolytus, [[Artemis]] killed Gration, and the [[Moirai]] (Fates) killed [[Agrius]] and Thoas with bronze clubs. The rest of the giants were "destroyed" by thunderbolts thrown by Zeus, with each Giant being shot with arrows by Heracles (as the prophecy seemingly required).

===Ovid===
The Latin poet [[Ovid]] gives a brief account of the Gigantomachy in his poem ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D89 1.151–162].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ovid, apparently including the [[Aloadae]]'s attack upon Olympus as part of the Gigantomachy, has the Giants attempt to seize "the throne of Heaven" by piling "mountain on mountain to the lofty stars" but Jove (i.e. [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the Roman Zeus) overwhelms the Giants with his thunderbolts, overturning "from [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Ossa]] huge, enormous [[Pelion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ovid also refers to Giants piling up Pelion on top of Ossa elsewhere, see ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ov.+Am.+2.1 2.1.11&amp;ndash;18], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/22/mode/2up 1.307&amp;ndash;308], [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/152/mode/2up 3.437&amp;ndash;442]; Green, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yPUDE65WEMoC&amp;&amp;pg=PA143 p. 143].&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid tells that (as "fame reports") from the blood of the Giants came a new race of beings in human form.&lt;ref&gt;Compare with  [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/606/mode/2up 1356&amp;ndash;1358 (pp. 606&amp;ndash;607]), who has the Pelasgian race born from the "blood of the [[Sithonia]]n giants", Sithonia being the middle spur of [[Chalcidice]] just north of the southern spur of [[Pallene, Chalcidice|Pallene]], the traditional home of the Giants.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ovid, Earth [Gaia] did not want the Giants to perish without a trace, so "reeking with the copious blood of her gigantic sons", she gave life to the "steaming gore" of the blood soaked battleground.  These new offspring, like their fathers the Giants, also hated the gods and possessed a bloodthirsty desire for "savage slaughter".

Later in the ''Metamorphoses'', Ovid refers to the Gigantomachy as "the time when serpent footed giants strove / to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D163 1.182 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt; Here Ovid apparently conflates the Giants with the [[Hundred-Handers]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t12AuG0q144C&amp;pg=PA170 p. 170, note to line 184 "''centum'' with ''bracchia''"]. Ovid's  ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]''  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ov.+Am.+2.1 2.1.11&amp;ndash;18] (Knox, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MtNSM3gHnvEC&amp;pg=PT239 p. 209]), likewise associates the Gigantomachy with the Hundred-Hander Gyas, while in ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/ovidsfasti00oviduoft#page/262/mode/2up 5.35&amp;ndash;42], Ovid has the Giants have a "thousand hands". This same conflation may already occur in [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]], fragment 169 (Lightfoot) (Lightfoot, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ScXvWB0Es0C&amp;pg=PA394 pp. 394&amp;ndash;395]), see Vian and Moore 1988, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; who, though in Hesiod fought alongside Zeus and the Olympians, in some traditions fought against them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+617 617&amp;ndash;736], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+815 815&amp;ndash;819]. For the Hundred-Handers as opponents of Zeus, see for example [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0054%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D543 10.565&amp;ndash;568]; O'Hara, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nhAFo12lV7IC&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
Various places have been associated with the Giants and the Gigantomachy. As noted above Pindar has the battle occur at Phlegra ("the place of burning"),&lt;ref&gt;Singleton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xbB5PE9O9KEC&amp;pg=PA235 p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt; as do other early sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''[[Oresteia|Eumenides]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0006%3Acard%3D276 294]; [[Euripides]], ''[[Herakles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=779AD6C623207413812A728B409D9381?doc=Eur.+Her.+1192 1192&amp;ndash;1194]; ''Ion'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Ion+987 987&amp;ndash;997]; [[Aristophanes]], ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0019,006:824&amp;lang=original 824]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/argonautica00apoluoft#page/210/mode/2up 3.232&amp;ndash;234 (pp. 210&amp;ndash;211)], [https://archive.org/stream/argonautica00apoluoft#page/276/mode/2up 3.1225&amp;ndash;7 (pp. 276&amp;ndash;277)].

According to the geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the [[Arcadia]]ns claimed that battle took place "not at Pellene in Thrace" but in  the plain of [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] where "rises up fire".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.29.1 8.29.1].&lt;/ref&gt; Another tradition apparently placed the battle at [[Tartessus]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast A on ''Iliad'' 8.479 (Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SSljjU2xlecC&amp;pg=PA125 p. 125]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]] presents a war with multiple battles, with one at Pallene, one on the Phlegraean Fields, and one on [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.15.1], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.21.5&amp;ndash;7], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5D*.html 5.71.2&amp;ndash;6].&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo mentions an account of Heracles battling Giants at [[Phanagoria]], a Greek colony on the shores of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Strab.+11.2.10 11.2.10].&lt;/ref&gt; Even when, as in Apollodorus, the battle starts at one place. Individual battles between a Giant and a god might range farther afield, with Enceladus buried beneath Sicily, and Polybotes under the island of [[Nisyros]] (or [[Kos]]). Other locales associated with Giants include [[Attica]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Cyzicus]], [[Lipari|Lipara]], [[Lycia]], [[Lydia]], [[Miletus]], and [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanfmann 1937, p. 475 n. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of volcanic phenomena, and the frequent unearthing of the fossilized bones of large prehistoric animals throughout these locations may explain why such sites became associated with the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9TwhfvU08UcC&amp;pg=PA197 p. 197 ff.]; Apollodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.%201.6.1 1.6.1 n. 3]; Frazer 1898b, note to Pausanias 8.29.1 "the legendary battle of the gods and the giants" [https://archive.org/stream/pausaniassdescr01pausgoog#page/n336/mode/2up pp. 314&amp;ndash;315]; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.32.5 8.32.5]; [[Philostratus]], ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofapollonius01phil#page/498/mode/2up 5.16 (pp. 498&amp;ndash;501)], ''On Heroes'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=R8nMVkv_lZ4C&amp;pg=PA14 8.15&amp;ndash;16 (p. 14)].&lt;/ref&gt;

From the sixth century BC onwards, the Gigantomachy was a popular and important theme in Greek art, with over six hundred representations cataloged in the ''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae]]'' (''LIMC'').&lt;ref&gt;Vian and Moore 1988; Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA51 p. 51], [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA64 p. 64]; Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; See also Vian 1951; 1952; Morford, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gigantomachy was depicted on the new ''[[peplos]]'' (robe) presented to [[Athena]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens]] as part of the [[Panathenaea|Panathenaic festival]] celebrating her victory over the Giants, a practice dating from perhaps as early as the second millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Barber 1992, pp. 103&amp;ndash;104, 112, 117; Barber 1991, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HnSlynSfeEIC&amp;pg=PA361 361&amp;ndash;362], [https://books.google.com/books?id=HnSlynSfeEIC&amp;pg=PA380 380&amp;ndash;381]; Simon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AMTNIZ_LQjoC&amp;pg=PA23 p. 23]; Euripides, ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Hec.+466 466&amp;ndash;474], ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0112%3Acard%3D203 222&amp;ndash;224]; [[Aristophanes]], ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0019,006:824&amp;lang=original 823&amp;ndash;831], ''[[The Knights]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=EBE89320150BA26C965AD689D8DABDF1?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0034%3Acard%3D565 565]; [[Plato]], ''[[Euthyphro]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DEuthyph.%3Asection%3D6b 6b&amp;ndash;c]; ''[[Republic]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=6E0C79B2440716402D4400CF905F4A85?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D2%3Asection%3D378c 2.378c]; Vian and Moore 1988, p. 210 no. 32.

Arafat, p. 14 n. 12, in addition to British Museum B208, also gives as examples Vatican 422 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/6882EE32-BAEE-447D-AE53-B7B62EC55CAF 302040], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+123%22 Gigantes 123] and Vatican 365 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/2DA7C493-0544-4EFB-9A35-C1717118E76F 301601], however Moore says that Zeus is not present in Vatican 365. For British Museum B208, see also Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA56 p. 56]. [[Euripides]], perhaps referring to archaic vase paintings or to Athena's ''peplos'', locates Heracles and Athena fighting near Zeus in the Gigantomachy, see ''[[Herakles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=779AD6C623207413812A728B409D9381?doc=Eur.+Her.+177 177&amp;ndash;179]; ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Ion+1528 1528&amp;ndash;1529]; Vian and Moore 1988, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus, Heracles and Athena are attacking Giants to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Rightward was conventionally the "direction of victory", see Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]; Stewart, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeus mounts a chariot brandishing his thunderbolt in his right hand, Heracles, in the chariot, bends forward with drawn bow and left foot on the chariot pole, Athena, beside the chariot, strides forward toward one or two Giants, and the four chariot horses trample a fallen Giant. When present, Gaia is shielded behind Herakles, apparently pleading with Zeus to spare her children.

On either side of the central group are the rest of the gods engaged in combat with particular Giants. While the gods can be identified by characteristic features, for example [[Hermes]] with his hat (''[[petasos]]'') and [[Dionysus]] his ivy crown, the Giants are not individually characterized and can only be identified by inscriptions which sometimes name the Giant.&lt;ref&gt;Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA56 pp. 56&amp;ndash;57]; Gantz p. 451; Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt; The fragments of one vase from this same period (Getty 81.AE.211)&lt;ref&gt;Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/XDB/ASP/recordDetails.asp?id=79B9C21C-CF52-40F6-85C1-E00C4BBC5D60 10047], ''LIMC''  [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+171%22 Gigantes 171].&lt;/ref&gt; name five Giants: Pankrates against Heracles,&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 p. 28].&lt;/ref&gt; Polybotes against Zeus,&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 pp. 30&amp;ndash;31].&lt;/ref&gt; Oranion against Dionysus,&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; Euboios and Euphorbos fallen&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 pp. 34&amp;ndash;36].&lt;/ref&gt; and Ephialtes.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 pp. 34&amp;ndash;35].&lt;/ref&gt; Also named, on two other of these early vases, are Aristaeus battling [[Hephaestus]] (Akropolis 607), Eurymedon and (again) Ephialtes (Akropolis 2134). An [[amphora]] from [[Caere]] from later in the sixth century, gives the names of more Giants: Hyperbios and Agasthenes (along with Ephialtes) fighting Zeus, Harpolykos against [[Hera]], Enceladus against Athena and (again) Polybotes, who in this case battles Poseidon with his trident holding the island of Nisyros on his shoulder (Louvre E732).&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 451; Arafat, p. 16; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/55A90360-6C37-47D9-A4DA-8A81196212C5 14590], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+170%22 Gigantes 170].&lt;/ref&gt; This motif of Poseidon holding the island of Nisyros, ready to hurl it at his opponent, is another frequent feature of these early Gigantomachies.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 453; Moore 1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd81AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32]; Cook, [https://archive.org/stream/zeusstudyinancie03cook#page/14/mode/2up pp. 14&amp;ndash;18]; Frazer 1898a, note to Pausanias 1.2.4 "Poseidon on horseback hurling a spear at the giant Polybotes" [https://archive.org/stream/pausaniassdescr04pausgoog#page/n68/mode/2up pp. 48&amp;ndash;49].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gigantomachy was also a popular theme in late sixth century sculpture.

According to Schefold, p. 62, Themis "appears here in the guise of [[Kybele]]".&lt;/ref&gt; in a chariot drawn by a team of lions which are attacking a fleeing Giant; the archers Apollo and Artemis; another fleeing Giant (Tharos or possibly Kantharos);&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N5 p. 92, reads only Tharos.&lt;/ref&gt; the Giant Ephialtes lying on the ground;&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N7 p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of three Giants, which include Hyperphas&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N6 p. 92, others have read Hypertas.&lt;/ref&gt; and Alektos,&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N8 p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; opposing Apollo and Artemis.

To the right of this comes a female stabbing her spear&lt;ref&gt;Possibly Aphrodite, has been identified as Hera, but Brinkmann, p. 94 finds no trace of that name.&lt;/ref&gt; at a fallen Giant (probably Porphyrion);&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N22 p. 103, only the last four letters: ''ριον'' can be read.&lt;/ref&gt; Athena fighting Eriktypos&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N10 p. 96; others have read Berektas.&lt;/ref&gt; and a second Giant; a male stepping over the fallen Astarias&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N12 p. 103; others have read Astartas.&lt;/ref&gt; to attack Biatas&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N11 p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and another Giant; and Hermes against two Giants. Then follows a gap which probably contained Poseidon and finally, on the far right, a male fighting two Giants, one fallen, the other the Giant Mimon (possibly the same as the Giant Mimas mentioned by Apollodorus).&lt;ref&gt;Brinkmann, N14 pp. 98, 124&amp;ndash;125. The fallen Giant Mimon against Ares is also named on a late fifth century BC cup from [[Vulci]] (Berlin F2531): Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/46E5041B-1D5E-482A-8D61-D896ECDDF3DA 220533]: [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/XDB/ASP/recordDetailsLarge.asp?recordCount=1&amp;id={46E5041B-1D5E-482A-8D61-D896ECDDF3DA}&amp;fileName=IMAGES200%2FGER22%2FCVA%2EGER22%2E1048%2E1%2F&amp;returnPage=&amp;start= detail showing Mimon and Ares]; Cook, [https://archive.org/stream/zeusstudyinancie03cook#page/n102/mode/2up p. 56], [https://archive.org/stream/zeusstudyinancie03cook#page/n103/mode/2up Plate VI].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gigantomachy also appeared on several other late sixth century buildings, including the west pediment of the Alkmeonid [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, the pediment of the Megarian Treasury at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the east pediment of the [[Old Temple of Athena]] on the Acropolis of Athens, and the metopes of [[Temple F (Selinus)|Temple F]] at [[Selinunte|Selinous]].&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 452.

====Fifth century BC====
The theme continued to be popular in the fifth century BC. A particularly fine example is found on a [[red-figure]] cup (c. 490&amp;ndash;485 BC) by the [[Brygos Painter]] (Berlin F2293). On one side of the cup is the same central group of gods (minus Gaia) as described above: Zeus wielding his thunderbolt, stepping into a quadriga, Heracles with lion skin (behind the chariot rather than on it) drawing his (unseen) bow and, ahead, Athena thrusting her spear into a fallen Giant. On the other side are Hephaestus flinging flaming missiles of red-hot metal from two pairs of tongs, Poseidon, with Nisyros on his shoulder, stabbing a fallen Giant with his trident and Hermes with his ''petasos'' hanging in back of his head, attacking another fallen Giant. None of the Giants are named.&lt;ref&gt;Arafat, pp 12&amp;ndash;15; Cohen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YyufPUA_S74C&amp;pg=PA177 pp. 177&amp;ndash;178]; Gantz p. 452; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/FF922369-A326-4645-870F-1DEBDFEB9D0C 203909]; ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+303%22 Gigantes 303].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phidias]] used the theme for the [[Metopes of the Parthenon|metopes]] of the east façade of the [[Parthenon]] (c. 445 BC) and for the interior of the shield of [[Athena Parthenos]].&lt;ref&gt;For the Parthenon Gigantomachy metopes see Schwab, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TADtR0uRhkC&amp;pg=PA168 pp. 168&amp;ndash;173], for the statue of Athena see Lapatin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TADtR0uRhkC&amp;pg=PA262 pp. 262&amp;ndash;263], for both see Kleiner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 pp. 136&amp;mdash;137].&lt;/ref&gt; Phidias' work perhaps marks the beginning of a change in the way the Giants are presented. While previously the Giants had been portrayed as typical [[hoplite]] warriors armed with the usual helmets, shields, spears and swords, in the fifth century the Giants begin to be depicted as less handsome in appearance, primitive and wild, clothed in animal skins or naked, often without armor and using boulders as weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rMeJDwmr_hcC&amp;pg=PA295 p. 295]; Gantz, pp. 446, 447, 452&amp;ndash;453; Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA90 p. 90]. For an example of a particularly "handsome" Giant see Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA67 p. 67]: [[British Museum]] E 8 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/8F58F440-D701-45DF-9D42-9F05021E88A4 302261], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/imageview.php?source=139&amp;image_id=13776&amp;term=%22Gigantes+365%22 Gigantes 365 image 1/2]), for Giants with animal skins fighting with boulders see a [[calyx krater]] from Ruvo, c. 400: Naples 81521 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/DD4BCEF5-28C4-42CF-9DAD-E464C47D5011 217517], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/imageview.php?source=144&amp;image_id=12534&amp;term=%22Gigantes+316%22 Gigantes 316 image 3/5]).&lt;/ref&gt; A series of red-figure pots from c. 400 BC, which may have used Phidas' shield of Athena Parthenos as their model, show the Olympians fighting from above and the Giants fighting with large stones from below.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Martin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BoUsvD1_VNQC&amp;pg=PA106 pp. 106&amp;ndash;107]; Dwyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rMeJDwmr_hcC&amp;pg=PA295 p. 295]; Cook, [https://archive.org/stream/zeusstudyinancie03cook#page/n101/mode/2up p. 56]; Arafat, p. 25; Lourve [http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/attic-red-figure-neck-amphora MNB810] (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/XDB/ASP/recordDetails.asp?id=1EFF3531-45A0-4643-8823-26F3DB9C0692 217568], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+322%22 Gigantes 322]); Naples 81521 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/DD4BCEF5-28C4-42CF-9DAD-E464C47D5011 217517], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+316%22 Gigantes 316])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fourth century BC and later====

With the beginning of the fourth century BC probably comes the first portrayal of the Giants in Greek art as anything other than fully human in form, with legs that become coiled serpents having snake heads at the ends in place of feet.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA82 pp. 82&amp;ndash;83], Gantz, p. 453; Berlin V.I. 3375 (Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/526CE240-23D4-484D-98DD-C14B1FD5AFE1 6987], ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+389%22 Gigantes 389]). Snake-legged Giants may exist in earlier Etruscan art, for example a winged and snake-footed monster depicted on a late sixth century Etruscan hydria (British Museum B62, ''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Typhon+30%22 Typhon 30]), might be a Giant, see de Grummond, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sKT6M2rdN9gC&amp;pg=PA259 p. 259], compare with Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA71, p. 71]. For more on snake-legged Giants see Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA82 pp. 82&amp;ndash;86], and Vian and Moore 1988, pp. 253&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions were perhaps borrowed from Typhon, the monstrous son of Gaia and [[Tartarus]], described by Hesiod as having a hundred snake heads growing from his shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9JwsNcKzwC&amp;pg=PA109 p. 109]; Ogden, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA83 p. 83]; [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+820 820 ff.]. The similarities between Typhon and the Giants are several, both "monstrous children produced by Earth in a spirit of revenge, with the mission to attack and overthrow the gods in heaven, and whose fate they share, blasted by thunderbolts and, in Enceladus' case buried under Sicily." (Ogden, p. 83).&lt;/ref&gt; This snake-legged motif becomes the standard for the rest of antiquity, culminating in the monumental Gigantomachy frieze of the second century BC [[Pergamon Altar]]. Measuring nearly 400 feet long and over seven feet high, here the Gigantomachy receives its most extensive treatment, with over one hundred figures.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155 pp. 155&amp;ndash;156]; Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA33 p. 33]; Smith, R. R. R. 1991, p. 159; Queyrel, p. 49; Pergamon Altar (''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Gigantes+24%22 Gigantes 24]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fragmentary, much of the Gigantomachy frieze has been restored. The general sequence of the figures and the identifications of most of the approximately sixty gods and goddesses have been more or less established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-39.html Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2005]. The names of the gods and goddesses were inscribed on the upper molding of the frieze, with the exception of Gaia whose name was inscribed on the background next to her head, see Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32]. For the total number of gods and goddesses, see Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54 n. 35].&lt;/ref&gt; The names and positions of most Giants remain uncertain. Some of the names of the Giants have been determined by inscription,&lt;ref&gt;The names of the Giants were inscribed on the lower molding or, for the walls flanking the stairs where the moulding was omitted, on the background of the frieze between the figures, see Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54 n. 34]. Queyrel, p. 52, lists the names of 27 Giants fully or partly preserved in the inscriptions which have so far been found. For Queyrel's identification of the various figures, see Fig. 33, pp. 50&amp;ndash;51.&lt;/ref&gt; while their positions are often conjectured on the basis of which gods fought which Giants in [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]]' account.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9JwsNcKzwC&amp;pg=PA109 p. 109].&lt;/ref&gt;

The same central group of Zeus, Athena, Heracles and Gaia, found on many early Attic vases, also featured prominently on the Pergamon Altar. On the right side of the East frieze, the first encountered by a visitor, a winged Giant, usually identified as [[Alcyoneus]], fights [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G8GiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 p. 113]; Kleiner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 p. 156 FIG. 5-79]; Queyrel, pp. 52&amp;ndash;53; Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA39, p. 39],  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA59 pp. 59&amp;ndash;60 n. 59]. Supporting the identification of this Giant as Alcyoneus, is the fragmentary inscription "neus", that may belong to this scene, for doubts concerning this identification, see Ridgway.&lt;/ref&gt; Below and to the right of Athena, Gaia rises from the ground, touching Athena's robe in supplication. Flying above Gaia, a winged [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] crowns the victorious Athena. To the left of this grouping a snake-legged Porphyrion battles Zeus&lt;ref&gt;Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA54 p. 54 n. 35]; Queyrel, pp. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the left of Zeus is Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-39.html Ridgway, Brunilde Sismondo 2005]. Though virtually nothing of Heracles remains, only part of a linonskin, and a left hand holding a bow, the location of the hero is identified by inscription, see Queyrel, pp. 54&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the far left side of the East frieze, a triple [[Hecate]] with torch battles a snake-legged Giant usually identified (following Apollodorus) as Clytius.&lt;ref&gt;Queyrel, pp. 56&amp;ndash;58; Ling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4HwfcdfLvCUC&amp;pg=PA50 p. 50]; Apollodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.2 1.6.2].&lt;/ref&gt; To the right lays the fallen Udaeus, shot in his left eye by an arrow from Apollo,&lt;ref&gt;Queyrel, pp. 55&amp;ndash;56. This figure, now identified by inscription as Udaeus, was previously supposed to be Ephialtes, who Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.2 1.6.2] has Apollo shoot in the left eye. Udaeus (earthy)  was also the name of one of the [[Spartoi]], who were sometimes called Gegeneis or Gigantes, see Fontenrose, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wqeVv09Y6hIC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=Udaios&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5m88VPDqCrfGsQTU7oLoCw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Udaios&amp;f=false p. 316]; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.4.1 3.4.1];  [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.5.3 9.5.3]; [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html#178 178]. Pelorus (monstrous), the name of another Spartoi, is a possible restoration of the fragmentary inscription "oreus" listed by Queyrel, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; along with Demeter who wields a pair of torches against Erysichthon.&lt;ref&gt;Queyrel, p. 55; Moore 1977, p. 324 n. 70; McKay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SsEeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93 p. 93]; [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn 6 (to Demeter)'' [https://archive.org/stream/callimachuslycop00calluoft#page/126/mode/2up 25 ff. (pp. 126 ff.)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Giants are depicted in a variety of ways. Some Giants are fully human in form, while others are a combination of human and animal forms. Some are snake-legged, some have wings, one has bird claws, one is lion-headed, and another is bull-headed. Some Giants wear helmets, carry shields and fight with swords. Others are naked or clothed in animal skins and fight with clubs or rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9JwsNcKzwC&amp;pg=PA109 p. 109]; Smith, R. R. R. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The large size of the frieze probably necessitated the addition of many more Giants than had been previously known. Some, like Typhon and Tityus, who were not strictly speaking Giants, were perhaps included. Others were probably invented.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9JwsNcKzwC&amp;pg=PA109 p. 109].&lt;/ref&gt; The partial inscription "Mim" may mean that the Giant Mimas was also depicted. Other less familiar or otherwise unknown Giant names include Allektos, Chthonophylos, Eurybias, Molodros, Obrimos, Ochthaios and Olyktor.&lt;ref&gt;Queyrel, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In post-classical art====

[[File:Giulio Romano - Fresco on the north wall (detail) - WGA09554.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the ''Sala dei Giganti'' in the [[Palazzo del Te]], [[Mantua]], c. 1530,  [[Giulio Romano]]]]

The subject was revived in the Renaissance, most famously in the frescos of the ''Sala dei Giganti'' in the [[Palazzo del Te]], [[Mantua]].  These were painted around 1530 by [[Giulio Romano]] and his workshop, and aimed to give the viewer the unsettling idea that the large hall was in the process of collapsing. The subject was also popular in [[Northern Mannerism]] around 1600, especially among the [[Haarlem Mannerists]], and continued to be painted into the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', p. 140, 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism, meaning and interpretations==

Historically, the myth of the Gigantomachy (as well as the Titanomachy) may reflect the "triumph" of the new imported gods of the invading Greek speaking peoples from the north (c. 2000 BC) over the old gods of the existing peoples of the Greek peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Morford, pp. 82&amp;ndash;83.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Greeks, the Gigantomachy represented a victory for order over chaos&amp;mdash;the victory of the divine order and rationalism of the Olympian gods over the discord and excessive violence of the earth-born [[chthonic]] Giants. More specifically, for sixth and fifth century BC Greeks, it represented a victory for civilization over barbarism, and as such was used by [[Phidias]] on the metopes of the [[Parthenon]] and the shield of ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' to symbolize the victory of the Athenians over the Persians. Later the [[Attalids]] similarly used the Gigantomachy on the [[Pergamon Altar]] to symbolize their victory over the [[Galatia]]ns of [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Morford, p. 72; Schefold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA50 p. 50]; Kleiner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 p. 118], [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 p. 136], [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgiuAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 p. 156]; Lyne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SEZARFIJqPwC&amp;pg=PA50 p. 50]; Castriota, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnMWWeZwt8EC&amp;pg=PA139 p. 139]; Dwyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rMeJDwmr_hcC&amp;pg=PA295 p. 295].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latin literature]], in which the Giants, the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], [[Typhon]] and the [[Aloadae]] are all often conflated, Gigantomachy imagery is a frequent occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;Lovatt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6bgGIG1ZSkC&amp;pg=PA115 pp. 115 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]], while urging the acceptance of aging and death as natural and inevitable, allegorizes the Gigantomachy as "fighting against Nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De Senectute'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0039%3Asection%3D5 5]; Powell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gbnz0bljUhoC&amp;pg=PA110 p. 110 "Gigantum modo bellare"]; Chaudhuri, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CHfqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 p. 7 n. 22].&lt;/ref&gt; The rationalist [[Epicurean]] poet [[Lucretius]], for whom such things as lightning, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions had natural rather than divine causes, used the Gigantomachy to celebrate the victory of philosophy over mythology and superstition.  In the triumph of science and reason over traditional religious belief, the Gigantomachy symbolized for him [[Epicurus]] storming heaven. In a reversal of their usual meaning, he represents the Giants as heroic rebels against the tyranny of Olympus.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CHfqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58 pp. 58&amp;ndash;63]; Hardie 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HwblQVvCav8C&amp;pg=PA116 p. 116]; Gale, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3tBmgI-zesC&amp;pg=PA120 pp. 120&amp;ndash;121], [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3tBmgI-zesC&amp;pg=PA140 p. 140]; [[Lucretius]], ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Lucr.+1.62 1.62&amp;ndash;79], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Lucr.+5.110 5.110&amp;ndash;125].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgil]]&amp;mdash;reversing Lucretius' reversal&amp;mdash;restores the conventional meaning, making the Giants once again enemies of order and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Gale, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3tBmgI-zesC&amp;pg=PA140 pp. 140&amp;ndash;141]; Gee, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NPsh5CsJprYC&amp;pg=PA56, pp. 56&amp;ndash;57].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace]] makes use of this same meaning to symbolize the victory of [[Augustus]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] as a victory for the civilized West over the barbaric East.&lt;ref&gt;Lyne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SEZARFIJqPwC&amp;pg=PA52 pp. 52&amp;ndash;54], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SEZARFIJqPwC&amp;pg=PA167 pp. 167&amp;ndash;168]; Commager, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv1znLxFKDQC&amp;pg=PA199 p. 199]; [[Horace]], ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]''  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0025%3Abook%3D3%3Apoem%3D4 3.4.42 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]], in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', describes mankind's moral decline through the ages of gold, silver, bronze and iron, and  presents the Gigantomachy as a part of that same descent from natural order into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uS4UYhh7_X8C&amp;pg=PA23 pp. 23&amp;ndash;26]; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D1%3Acard%3D89 1.151–162].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucan]], in his ''[[Pharsalia]]'', which contains many Gigantomachy references,&lt;ref&gt;Hardie 2014, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kewKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101].&lt;/ref&gt; makes the [[Gorgon]]'s gaze turn the Giants into mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Dinter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZCe_zOWousC&amp;pg=PA296 p. 296]; [[Lucan]], ''[[Pharsalia]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0134%3Abook%3D9%3Acard%3D619 9.654&amp;ndash;658].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], in his ''Argonautica'', makes frequent use of Gigantomachy imagery, with the [[Argo]] (the world's first ship) constituting a Gigantomachy-like offense against natural law, and example of hubristic excess.&lt;ref&gt;Zissos, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86ChnuaNV50C&amp;pg=PA79 pp. 79 ff.]; For more on the use of Gigantomachy imagery in the ''Argonautica'' see Stover, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=z4ltLjx_2woC&amp;pg=PA5 5&amp;ndash;6], [https://books.google.com/books?id=z4ltLjx_2woC&amp;pg=PA71 71&amp;ndash;73], [https://books.google.com/books?id=z4ltLjx_2woC&amp;pg=PA79 79&amp;ndash;150].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claudian]], the fourth-century AD court poet of emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], composed a ''Gigantomachia'' that viewed the battle as a metaphor for vast geomorphic change: "The puissant company of the giants confounds all differences between things; islands abandon the deep; mountains lie hidden in the sea. Many a river is left dry or has altered its ancient course....robbed of her mountains Earth sank into level plains, parted among her own sons."&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, p. 195;  [[Claudian]], ''Gigantomachia'' [https://archive.org/stream/claudia02clau#page/284/mode/2up 62&amp;ndash;73 (pp. 284&amp;ndash;287)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with volcanoes and earthquakes==

Various locations associated with the Giants and the Gigantomachy were areas of volcanic and seismic activity (e.g. the [[Phlegraean Fields]] west of [[Naples]]), and the vanquished Gigantes (along with other "giants") were said to be buried under volcanos. Their subterranean movements were said to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;It has been common for cultures (including the ancient Greeks) to attribute earthquakes and volcanoes to the movements of buried "giants", see Andrews, "Earthquakes" [https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA62 pp. 62&amp;ndash;63], "Giants" [https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA81 p. 81], "Volcanoes" [https://books.google.com/books?id=7jS65aClvFEC&amp;pg=PA218 pp. 218&amp;ndash;219]; Cook, [https://archive.org/stream/zeusstudyinancie03cook#page/2/mode/2up n. 5 pp. 2&amp;ndash;3]; Frazer 1914, [https://archive.org/stream/goldenboughstudy05frazuoft#page/196/mode/2up p. 197]: "The people of Timor, in the East Indies, think that the earth rests on the shoulders of a mighty giant, and that when he is weary of bearing it on one shoulder he shifts it to the other and so causes the ground to quake"; [https://archive.org/stream/goldenboughstudy05frazuoft#page/200/mode/2up pp. 200&amp;ndash;201]: "The Tongans think that the earth is supported on the prostrate form of the god Móooi.

==Named Giants==

Names for the Giants can be found in ancient literary sources and inscriptions. Vian and Moore provide a list with over seventy entries, some of which are based upon inscriptions which are only partially preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Vian and Moore 1988, pp. 268&amp;ndash;269.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Giants identified by name are:

*'''Agrius''': According to Apollodorus, he was killed by the [[Moirai]] (Fates) with bronze clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.2 1.6.2].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Alcyoneus]]''': According to Apollodorus, he was (along with Porphyrion), the greatest of the Giants. Immortal while fighting in his native land, he was dragged from his homeland and killed by Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pindar, he was a herdsman and, in a separate battle from the Gigantomachy, he was killed by Heracles and [[Telamon]], while they were traveling through [[Phlegra (mythology)|Phlegra]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Isthmian'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DI.%3Apoem%3D6 6.30&amp;ndash;35], ''Nemean'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DN.%3Apoem%3D4 4.24&amp;ndash;30].&lt;/ref&gt; Representations of Heracles fighting Alcyoneus are found on many sixth century BC and later works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Grön eld''''' (''Fire in Green'') is a glass sculpture by [[Vicke Lindstrand]] at [[Järnvägstorget, Umeå|Järnvägstorget]], which is located in front of [[Umeå Central Station]], in [[Umeå]], Sweden. It was, at nine meters, the tallest glass sculpture in the world at the time of its inauguration in 1970.&lt;ref name="Vicke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skulptören Vicke Lindstrand |url=http://www.vickelindstrand.com/skulptor.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525145518/http://www.vickelindstrand.com/skulptor.html |archivedate=25 May 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Sven Wallander]], the head of [[HSB (Sweden)|HSB]], commissioned the sculpture after he had seen the glass sculpture ''Prisma'' by Vicke Lindstrand in [[Norrköping]]. HSB donated ''Grön eld'' to [[Umeå Municipality]], which paid for the foundation.&lt;ref name="Vicke"/&gt; 

Lennart Johansson, who assembled the sculpture in 1970, told the press in December 2013 that he had hidden an image of [[Mao Zedong]] in one of the glass flames of the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mao Zedong gömd i svenskt konstverk |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/mao-zedong-gomd-i-svenskt-konstverk |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sindra Grahn |title=Mao gömd i känd Umeå-skulptur |url=http://www.svt.se/kultur/mao-gomd-i-svenskt-konstverk |newspaper=[[SVT]] |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sculpture ==
''Grön eld'' consists of three twisted glass pillars that grow thinner at the top. The glass pillars are constructed of three thousand, nine millimeter thin, plates of glass made by [[Emmaboda glasverk]] in Sweden. The glass pieces are glued together with [[epoxy glue]] in order to cope with the harsh climate. The nine meter high sculpture weighs 45 [[ton]]s and is standing on a heavy concrete [[pedestal]] with a [[piled foundation]].&lt;ref name="Vicke"/&gt;

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
{{Islam}}
'''Sin''' is an important concept in [[Islamic ethics]]. [[Muslim]]s see [[sin]] as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2211|work=Sin|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]] teaches that sin is an act and not a state of being. It is believed that Allah weighs an individual’s good deeds and against his or her sins on the Day of Judgement and punishes those individuals whose evil deeds outweigh their good deeds. These individuals are thought to be sentenced to afterlife in the fires of جهنم [[jahannam]] (Hell).

The Quran describes these sins throughout the text and demonstrates that some sins are more punishable than others. A clear distinction is made between major and minor sins (53:31–32), indicating that if an individual stays away from the major sins, then he/she will be forgiven of the minor sins.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies" /&gt;{{Notinsource|date=January 2017}} Regardless, Islam teaches that God is merciful and individuals can be forgiven of their sins if they repent.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies" /&gt;{{Notinsource|date=January 2017}}

Sources differ on the exact meanings of the different terms for sin used in the Islamic tradition.

== Terminology ==

A number of different words for sin are used in the Islamic tradition.

According to A.J. Wensinck's entry in the [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], Islamic terms for sin include ''dhanb'' and ''khaṭīʾa'', which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; ''khiṭʾ'', which means simply a sin; and ''ithm'', which is used for grave sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Wensinck, A. J. | year= 2012 | title=K̲h̲aṭīʾa |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2214-871X_ei1_SIM_4141|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cyril Glasse, Islam recognizes two kinds of sin (''khati'ah''): ''dhanb'', a fault or shortcoming which is to be sanctioned; and ''ithm'', a willful transgression which is to be punished.&lt;ref name=glasse-431&gt;{{cite book|last=Glasse|first=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=Altamira|page=431|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA431 |quote=In Islam sin is divided into two categories. The first is that of ''dhanb'', which is a fault or shortcoming, a limitation, an inadvertencies, the consequence of which is a sanction rather than a punishment. Sin as ''dhanb'' is distinguished from willful transgression (''ithm''), which is more serious and clearly incurs punishment rather than sanction. ... The term ''khati'ah'' is used in practice indiscriminately for both concepts of sin. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic analysis of terminology in the Qur'an==

Several different words are used in the Quran to describe sin—1) ''Dhanb'' 2) ''Ithm'' 3) ''Khati’ah'' 4) ''Jurm'' 5) ''Junah/Haraj''. By examining the choice of words in Quranic verses used in connection with these terms, scholars have attempted to determine which sins are associated with which terms.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ituzsu|first=Toshiko|title=Ethico-Religious Concepts in the Qur'an|year=1966|publisher=McGill University Press|location=Montreal|pages=193–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dhanb===

''Dhanb'' (plural ''dhunub'') is frequently applied to heinous sins committed against God. One of the main examples of ''Dhanb'' in the Quran is of “crying lies of God’s signs”, or having excessive pride that prevents an individual from believing the signs of God.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko"/&gt;

{{quote|For in God's sight are (all) his servants, (namely), those who say: 'Our Lord, we have indeed believed: forgive us, then, our sins ("dhunub"), and save us from the agony of the Fire.' | Quran 3: 15–16&lt;ref name="AliAdbullah"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Adbullah Yusuf|title=The Holy Qur'an|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This use of ''dhanb'' in the Quran exemplifies that this type of sin is punishable in the afterlife. In fact, ''dhanb'' is considered a ‘great’ sin and is often used in the Quran to contrast with ''sayyi’a'', which denotes a ‘smaller’ sin.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; The Quran states that if you avoid these great sins, your lesser evil deeds or sayyi’at will be forgiven.

{{quote| If you avoid great sins (kaba’ir or dhanb) which are forbidden you, We will remit from you your evil deeds (sayyi’a). | Quran 4: 31 &lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; }}

=== Ithm===

Some scholars believe the basic meaning of ''ithm'' to be an unlawful deed that is committed intentionally. This contrasts to ''dhanb'' in that ''dhanb'' can be both intentional and unintentional. However, this definition is somewhat nebulous and the best description of the word is based on the contextual situations.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; In the Quran, i''thm'' is found quite frequently in legislative descriptions. For example, falsely accusing your own wife in order to gain money is constituted as an ''ithm'' (Quran 4: 24/20). However, ''ithm'' is also used in connection with ''haram'', or committing an unlawful deed, a taboo, such as consuming food or drink that is forbidden by God:

{{quote|They will ask thee about wine and [[maisir|maysir]]. Say, ‘In both of them there is great sin (ithm) and also some uses for men, but their sin is greater than their usefulness.’| Quran 2: 168/173&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; }}

''Ithm'' is also associated with what is considered the worst sin of all, ''shirk''.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; ''Shirk'' signifies the accepting of a presence of other divinities at the side of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brill Encyclopedia of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Leiden Brill|pages=484–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran states that:

{{quote|He who associates with God has surely forged a great sin (''ithm'').| Quran 4: 53/50 &lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

This association with ''shirk'' is noteworthy for ''shirk'' is considered unforgivable if not repented of.

{{quote|God forgiveth not (the sin of) joining other gods to Him; but He forgiveth whom He pleaseth other sins that this: one who joins other gods with God hath strayed far, far away. | Quran 4:116&lt;ref name="AliAdbullah" /&gt;}}

=== Khati’ah===

''Khati’ah'' is considered by many scholars to be a “moral lapse” or a “mistake” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brill Encyclopedia of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Leiden Brill|pages=1106–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|need volume or entry to verify|date=July 2017}} This interpretation has led some scholars to believe that ''Khati’ah'' is a lesser sin than ithm; however, the word ''Khati’ah'' is frequently used in conjunction with ''ithm'' in the Quran.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko"/&gt;

{{quote| Whoso, having committed a ''khati’ah'' or an ''ithm'', throws it upon the innocent, has burdened himself with calumny and an obvious sin (''ithm''). | Quran 4:112&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

This Quranic verse indicates that ''khati’ah'' is considered an ''ithm'', a grave sin. In fact, the word ''khati’ah'' is associated with some of the most heinous religious sins in the Quran.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; In one Quranic verse this word is used to describe the sin of slaying one’s own children for fear of poverty. (Quran 17:33/31). Scholars believe that ''dhanb'' or ''ithm'' could be used in place of ''khati’ah'' in this instance;&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; however, the word choice indicates that ''khati’ah'' is more than just a moral lapse or mistake and is punishable.

=== Jurm===

The word ''Jurum'' is often considered to be a synonym of '''''dhanb''''' for it is used to describe some of the same sins: crying lies of God and not believing the signs of God.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; In the Quran, the word mostly appears in the form of ''mujrim'', one who commits a ''jurm''. These individuals are described in the Quran as having arrogance towards the believers.

{{quote| Behold, those who commit jurm used to laugh at those who believed, winking one at another when they passed them by, and when they went back to their own fold, they returned jesting, and when they saw them they used to say, ‘Lo, these have indeed gone astray! | Quran 83: 29–32&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

=== Junah/Haraj===

''Junah'' and ''Haraj'' have a similar meaning to that of ''ithm'', a sin that warrants a punishment. In fact, these words are used almost interchangeably with ''ithm'' in the same chapters in the Quran. Like ''ithm'', these words are found frequently in legislative portions of the Quran, particularly relating to regulations regarding marriage and divorce.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;

{{quote|It is no sin (''junah'') for you that you offer proposal of marriage to women or keep it secret. | Quran 2:235&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

==Definition in Hadith==
Sin is discussed extensively in the [[hadith]], (the collection of [[Muhammad]]'s sayings). It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an: 
{{quote|"The Prophet (Muhammad) said, "Piety is good manner,and sin is that which creates doubt and you do not like people to know it.""|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6195}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6196}}}}

Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported: 
{{quote|“I went to Messenger of Allah (SAWS) and he asked me: “Have you come to inquire about piety?” I replied in the affirmative. Then he said: “Ask your heart regarding it. Piety is that which contents the soul and comforts the heart, and sin is that which causes doubts and perturbs the heart, even if people pronounce it lawful and give you verdicts on such matters again and again.”|Ahmad and Ad-Darmi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sunnah.com/nawawi40/27 | title=40 Hadith: Nawawi: 27, English translation: Hadith 27 | publisher=sunnah.com | accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]], a Hadith is narrated:
{{Quote|Allah's apostle said, "Every son of Adam sins, the best of the sinners are those who repent."|Sunan al-Tirmidhi,Hadith no. 2499}}

In [[Sahih Muslim]], [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]] and [[Abu Huraira]] narrated:
{{Quote|Allah's apostle said," By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them."|{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|37|6621}}}}

*Qur'an refers to the sinners as "the greatest loser". {Qur'an, 18:103-105}
*It brings about displeasure of God and his messenger, as quoted by Imam as-Sadiq when he addressed a group of people and inquired why they annoyed the Messenger of Allah. Someone asked Imam (‘a) how they did so, and he (‘a) said: "Do you not know that your deeds are reported to him (S)? When he (S) observes a sin against Allah among them, he becomes displeased. Therefore do not hurt the Messenger of Allah but do please him." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thiqatul Al-Islam Abu Ja'far Al-Kulayni|title=Al-Kafi,vol2 of 8; English translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=2015 |publisher=Islamic Seminary Incorporated|isbn=9780991430888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of some sins==
{{List|section|date=January 2018}}
There are some sins which its ill-consequences were stated in the Qur'an and hadith, we shall quote some of them here: 
*Imam al-Baqir, quoted the Holy Prophet been stated seven consequences for different sins as thus:  
#"When adultery appears (abundantly in a society) the (number of) sudden deaths increases; 
#when there is fraud, Allah takes them in expensiveness and loss. When people stop giving alms tax, the earth holds back its blessings from plants (crops), fruits, mines, and all such things. 
#When they act unjustly according to (divine) ordinances, they have helped injustice and aggression. 
#When they breach (their) promises, the Lord will set their enemies as absolute masters over them.
#When they break off connections with their kindred, possession of properties will be put in the hands of the wicked. And, 
#When they do not perform enjoining right and forbidding wrong and, also, do not follow the chosen ones of my Ahlul Bayt, Allah will set their vicious ones over them and, in this condition, their good doers utter invocations but they are not responded to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Laleh Bakhtiar|title= A Glance at the life of the holy Prophet of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=1983|publisher= Islamic Propagation Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The holy Qur'an,chapter 4 verse 10 said in this regard as thus: “(As for) those who swallow the property of the orphans unjustly, surely they only swallow fire into their bellies and they shall enter burning fire.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Khwajah Kamal al-Din |title= The Islamic review,vol.17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=1929|publisher= The University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Concealing part of the holy book is among the sin which its consequences were stated in the Qur'an;as it was said in Qur'an 2:174-175:“Surely those who conceal any part of the Book that Allah has revealed and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire into their bellies, and Allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement.

*Imam Zaynol Aabideen stated some sins ant their consequences as thus:
#“The sins that remove blessings are: oppressing people, giving up doing good and favor, being ungrateful for blessings and giving up thanking Allah.
#The sins that cause regret are: killing innocent ones, breaking off relations with the kin until they feel in no need of each other, not offering prayer until its time elapses, being inadvertent to wills and to wronged people, not giving zakat until death comes. 
#The sins that bring calamities are: disobedience of a knowing one by oppressing people, being rude to them and mocking them.
#The sins that keep blessings away are: pretending poverty, sleeping until after dawn and until the time of Fajr Prayer elapses, scorning blessings and complaining against Allah the Almighty." &lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|author=Allama Hussayn Ansariyan|title= Repentance; The Cradle of mercy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=|publisher= Ansariyan, Qom|isbn=9789644385858}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Also he stated: 
#"The sins that disgrace honors are: drinking wine, gambling, joking and talking nonsense, mentioning the defects of people and accompanying sinful and bad people.
#The sins that bring calamities are: refraining from helping needy people, refraining from supporting oppressed people, not enjoining what is right and not forbidding what is wrong.  
#The sins that cause the enemies to prevail are: doing injustice openly, spreading debauchery, violating prohibited matters, disobeying good people and submitting to evil people. 
#The sins that hasten perishment are: cutting communications with one’s kin, false oath, lying, adultery, blocking the ways of the Muslims and pretending to be an Imam falsely.
#The sins that dispel hope are: being desperate of the mercy of Allah, relying on other than Allah and disbelieving in the Promise of Allah. 
#The sins that darken the space are: magic, divination, believing in stars, disbelieving in fate and being undutiful to one’s parents. #The sins that uncover the curtain (of the unseen) are: borrowing with no intention of repaying, exceeding in spending on impermissible things, being stingy with one’s family, children and relatives, impoliteness, impatience, laziness and making little of religious people." &lt;ref name= "book" /&gt; 
*The follows are some other sins with their consequences : 
#"The sins that reject supplication are: malevolence, ill-intention, hypocrisy with brothers, disbelieving in responding to supplication, delaying obligatory prayers until their prescribed times elapse, giving up approaching Allah via doing good and paying charities, and using bad and obscene sayings. 
#The sins that prevent the rain of the heaven are: the injustice of rulers in judgments, perjury, concealing true witnesses, preventing zakat, preventing loan and helping the needy, hard-Heartedness towards the poor and the needy, being unjust to orphans and widows, chiding the beggars them.”  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= (Edited by) John Andrew Morrrow |title= Islamic Images and Ideas,Essays on Sacred Symbolism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=2013|publisher= Amazon|isbn=1476612889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repentance of sin==
{{See also|Repentance in Islam}} 
According to Islam, one can be forgiven of sins through genuine ''[[tawbah]]'' (repentance) which literally means "to return."

{{quote|Ask your Lord for forgiveness, then turn back to Him.| Qur'an, sura 11, ayat 3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|11|3|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike the Catholic concept of atonement, ''[[tawbah]]'' does not entail formal, [[ecclesiastical|eccelesiastica]]l confession to a religious leader.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/|work=Repentance|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Protestantism, Islam allows followers to repent directly to God. In addition, while Christianity and Islam considers humans as prone to sin, Islam ultimately views them as responsible for their actions and refutes the Christian concept of original sin.

{{quote|For man's very soul incites him to evil unless my Lord shows mercy.| Qur'an, sura 12, ayat 53&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|12|53|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More so, in Islam Muslims are discouraged from confessing their sins and sharing the wrongdoings of others.
&lt;ref name="hidesins_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sins: to hide or to make public|url=http://islamicetiquette.wordpress.com/category/hide-your-sins|work=Islamic Etiquette|publisher=Islamic Etiquette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, according to Islam, [[Blood sacrifice]] cannot add to [[Divine Grace]] nor replace the necessity of repentance. However, sacrifice is done to help the poor and to remember [[Abraham]]’s willingness to sacrifice his son at [[Islamic concept of God|God]]'s command.
{{quote|It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah. it is your piety that reaches Him..."| Qur'an, sura 22, ayat 37&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|22|37|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When a human has violated another human’s rights, ḥuqūq al-ʿibād, compensation is necessary in order to show that one has made amends.

When a human has offended or disobeyed God, ḥuqūq Allāh, penitence, remorse, and resolution are necessary in order to show that one is sincere, and will not repeat the wrongdoing in the future.

According to Shaddad ibn Aws:
{{quote|Shall I not how to seek forgiveness? O Allah, You are my Lord, there is no God but You; for You created me and I am Your servant; and I am upon Your covenant and Your promise as much as I am able; I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done; I acknowledge Your favors upon me and I recognize my sins, so forgive my sins; verily, none can forgive sins but You.| Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Book of Supplications, Number 3393, Hasan&lt;ref&gt;Hadith, Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Book of Supplications, Number 3393&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From a traditionalist perspective, sin is applied to an individual’s actions. Through belief and good works, an individual can remove his/her sin and attain God’s good favor. 
Classical legal scholar Muhammad al-Shafi'i (767 – 820) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a" /&gt;

{{quote|But He will overlook the bad deeds of those who have faith, do good deeds, and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad —the truth from their Lord —and He will put them into a good state.| Qur'an, sura 47, ayat 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|47|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From a modernist perspective, sin has also been applied to a group or community’s collective behavior. Through public acknowledgement of wrongdoing, people can take responsibility for the lack of morality within their society and enact social reform. Egyptian reformer Muḥammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905) and his disciple Muḥammad Rashīd Ridā (1865–1935) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a" /&gt;

{{quote|Unless they repent, make amends, and declare the truth. I will certainly accept their repentance.| Qur'an, sura 2, ayat 160&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|160|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other modern reformers, such as [[Sayyid Qutb]], held that repentance involved a renewed, holistic commitment to Islam, rather than admission of sin for the sake of being pardoned of punishment. This understanding draws from classical Sufi thought, whereby one experiences a personality transformation and his/her sinful impulses are replaced by virtue.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a" /&gt; Qutb derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:

{{quote|Those who repent, believe, and do good deeds: God will change the evil deeds of such people into good ones.| Qur'an, sura 25 ayat 70&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|25|70|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Repentance for sin can be accomplished through acts such as, “fasting, giving charity, sacrificing an animal, and freeing a slave.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mir|first=Mustansir|title=Dictionary of Quranic Terms and Concepts|year=1987|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, going on the [[hajj]] can serve as a form of repentance.

According to Shaddad ibn Aws:
{{quote|The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, “The lesser pilgrimage unto the lesser pilgrimage will expiate whatever sins were committed between them; and the accepted pilgrimage has no reward other than Paradise.| Sahih Bukhari, Book 27, Number 1 &lt;ref&gt;Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Book 27, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, regardless of one's outward deeds, God does not accept the forgiveness of those who are insincere in their repentance and only do so in order to avoid [[jahannam]].

{{quote|It is not true repentance when people continue to do evil until death confronts them and then say, ‘Now I repent.| 
Qur'an, sura 4 [[ayat]] 18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Major sins: Al-Kabirah==

The most heinous sins in Islam are known as Al-Kabirah ({{lang-fa|گناه کبیره}}) which translates to the great or major one. Some authors use the term enormity. While every sin is seen as an offense to Allah, the al-Kaba'ir are the gravest of the offenses.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies" /&gt; Allah’s power is thought to be only eclipsed by his mercy and thus small sins are tacitly understood to be forgiven after repentance. Not every sin is equal however and some are thought to be more spiritually damning than others. The greatest of the sins described as al-Kaba'ir is the association of others with Allah or [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar differ as to how many major sins there are.
In contrasting major sins with minor sins (''al-sagha'ir''), the eighth-century [[Shafi'i]] scholar [[Al-Dhahabi]] found the [[hadith]] collections of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]] listed seven major sins, while the tradition from [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]] stated that there were closer to seventy major sins.
&lt;ref name=Siddiqui&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siddiqui|first1=Mona|title=The Good Muslim: Reflections on Classical Islamic Law and Theology|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2012|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgmjUI9s0f8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22difference+between+hadith+collections%22+major+sin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-1msU836HYOCqgaF4YGwAw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22difference%20between%20hadith%20collections%22%20major%20sin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the major or al-Kaba'ir sins in Islam are as follows:&lt;ref name = "Al-Kabair-Sins"&gt;{{ISBN|1-56744-489-X}} The Major Sins Al-Kabirah By Muhammad bin 'Uthman Adh-Dhahabi, rendered into English by Mohammad Moinuddin Siddiqui&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]] (associating anything with Allah)
#Despair of Allah's mercy
#Disobeying parents
#[[Zina]] (adultery)
#[[Sodomy]]
#[[Theft]]
#Consumption of alcohol % other intoxicants
#[[Gambling]]
#[[Backbiting]] (saying bad things about a person who is not there)
#Leaving daily prayer
#[[Zakat]] evasion
#[[Witchcraft]]
#[[murder|Killing]] one whom Allah has declared inviolate without a just case
#Consuming the property of an orphan
#Devouring [[usury]]
#[[desertion|Turning back]] when the army advances
#[[False accusation]] of chaste women who are believers but indiscreet

It should be noted that these are only the opinion of particular scholars and do not wholly represent Islam.

Although many of the ideas for what is unacceptable overlap, the seven major sins of Islam differs from the seven deadly sins of Christianity. The Islamic sins refer more to specific undesirable behavior rather than to the general negative characteristics or actions of the cardinal Christian sins. Despite the similar names, the seven main sins in Islam are more comparable to the Ten Commandments rather than the seven deadly sins. They both provide the bottom line for believers in terms of what is acceptable behavior in the faith. The actions themselves differ most of the major crimes in Islam relate to subservience to Allah. Any form of polytheism is seen to be the most severe offense in the religion and all of the other transgressions are in some form of association with Allah. Witchcraft, for example, is the taking on of supernatural powers in order to make the practitioner a being above the normal human. This challenges the power of Allah as the person in question has superseded their mortal position to become something greater and akin to a god. The same can be said of murder, as ultimately the power to decide who shall live and die is believed to belong solely to Allah. Life is thought to be a gift from Allah and the unjust taking of life is a severe spiritual offense, as it is not only seen as morally wrong but also as an affront to God.

In addition to what Muslim scholars agree are the principal seven sins, the idea exists that the major sins extend far past the seven. These additional transgressions, potentially up to seventy, are not universally settled upon nor are they explicitly stated in the Qur'an, however they are thought to be implied by the text.&lt;ref name="Al-Kabair-Sins" /&gt; The supplementary sins as a whole lack the spiritual gravity of the original seven and include things such as drinking alcohol and eavesdropping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">'''Leicester Symphony Orchestra''' is based in [[Leicester, England]]. The orchestra was founded by [[Malcolm Sargent]] in 1922 along with [[Grace Burrows]] as orchestra leader. Sargent continued to conduct the orchestra until 1939. In these early years, the orchestra's prestige grew until it was able to obtain such top-flight soloists as [[Alfred Cortot]], [[Artur Schnabel]], [[Solomon (pianist)|Solomon]], [[Guilhermina Suggia]] and [[Benno Moiseiwitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldous p. 28 and Reid p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; 

The orchestra normally features about 80 musicians. Other conductors of the orchestra have included Arthur Thornley, Alfred de Reyghere, Harry Shaw, Simeon Iliffe, Keith Smith, Roland Melia, Nicholas Daniel, [[Pavel Kotla]] and John Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.leicesterso.plus.com/history.htm |title=Leicester Symphony Orchestra: History|author=Crutchley, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual orchestra season includes three performances at [[De Montfort Hall]] in Leicester, and the orchestra also performs other engagements and goes on tour.

[[Image:Lib ru.jpg|80px|thumb|Screenshot of main page of Maksim Moshkow's Library]]
'''Lib.ru''', also known as '''Maksim Moshkow's Library''' ({{lang-ru|Библиоте́ка Макси́ма Мошко́ва}}, started to operate in November 1994) is the oldest [[electronic library]] in the [[Internet in Russia|Russian Internet segment]].

Founded and supported by [[Maksim Moshkow]], it receives contributions mainly from users who send texts they scanned and processed ([[Optical character recognition|OCR]], [[proofreading]]). This method of acquisition provides the library a broad and efficient augmentability, though sometimes it adversely affects the quality (errors, omissions).

The structure of the library includes a section where one can publish his own literary texts ("[[Samizdat]]" journal), a project for music publishing ("Music hosting"), a travel notes project ("Foreign countries") and some other sections (See ''Maksim Moshkow's projects collection'' section).

''Maksim Moshkow's Library'' received several Ru-net Awards, including the National Internet Award (2003).

The headline on the site Lib.ru says "With support from the [[Rospechat|Federal Press and Mass Communications Agency]]". According to Moshkow, his project received $35,000 from that organization in September 2005, which indicates some level of government support for the online publishing of in-copyright works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=4005 |title=Maksim Moshkow and lib.ru: Russia's own 'Gutenberg' {{!}} TeleRead: Bring the E-Books Home |last1=Carey |first1=Quinn Anya |date=20 December 2005 |website={{URL|teleread.org}} |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030404/http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=4005 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maksim Moshkow's project could be compared to some [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects and is sometimes referred to as [[Russia]]'s [[Project Gutenberg]].

== KM Online vs. Maksim Moshkow's Library ==
{{Main|Gevorkyan v. Moshkov}}
[[Image:Maxim moshkov.jpg|left|thumb|Maxim Moshkow]]
On April 1, 2004 the "KM Online" media company, which is known for forming its own library by copying texts from the other electronic libraries, issued a [[lawsuit]] against Maksim Moshkow's Library in the name of [[Eduard Gevorkian]], Marina Alekseyeva (pen-name "[[Alexandra Marinina]]"), [[Vasili Golovachov]] and [[Elena Katasonova]]. It was later discovered that only Gevorkian had had real claims against Moshkow. Moshkow's lawyer was Andrey Mironov from the [[Art. Lebedev Studio|Artemi Lebedev Studio]], while KM's interests were presented by the so-called "National association on Digital Technologies (NOCIT)".

This case became a precedent in the Russian legal practice which illustrated pressure on an electronic library caused by a [[copyright violation]] lawsuit.

On March 30, 2005, [[Moscow]]'s [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] city district court imposed a penalty on Maksim Moshkow to pay Eduard Gevorkian a total of 3000 [[Russian ruble]]s (around 120 USD) as compensation for [[moral damage]]. The ruling did not mention any compensation for copyright violation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

On May 30, 2006, another court order ruled that Moshkow had no right to publish online the works of [[William Shakespeare]], Harrison and Zinoviev and ordered him to pay 10,000 rubles in each case. Moshkow's lawyer said he would appeal the decision.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

This is a selected '''list of authors and works listed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'''''. The ''Index'' was discontinued on June 14, 1966 by [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/galbooks.html "Galileo and Books"], Department of History and Philosophy of Science of the University of Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2017|reason=The source says 'abolished' and does not provide the exact date; what does abolished/discontinued mean here, and how was this action reasoned, communicated?}}

A complete list of the authors and writings present in the subsequent editions of the index are listed in J. Martinez de Bujanda, ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum, 1600–1966'', Geneva, 2002.

The Index includes entries for single or multiple works by an author, all works by an author in a given genre or dealing with a given topic.  The scope of the prohibition is defined by a Latin phrase in the Index:
* ''Omnia opera dramatica'': all plays
* ''Omnes fabulae amatoriae'': all novels, or romances
* ''Opera omnia theologica'': all theological works
* ''Opera omnia'': all works (see note below)

The Index includes entries banning ''all'' works of a particular writer.  Most of these were inserted in the Index at a time when the Index itself stated that the prohibition of someone's "opera omnia" (all his works) did not cover works whose contents did not concern religion and were not forbidden by the general rules of the Index, but this explanation was omitted in the 1929 edition, an omission that was officially interpreted in 1940 as meaning that thenceforth "opera omnia" covered all the author's works without exception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tie0hkcrpg4C&amp;pg=PA36 Jesús Martínez de Bujanda, ''Index librorum prohibitorum: 1600-1966''] (Droz 2002 {{ISBN|2-600-00818-7}}), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned ''Dialogue'') in Florence.&lt;ref name="incomplete works"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, p. 299)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1741 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works&lt;ref name="complete works 1"&gt;Two of his non-scientific works, the letters to Castelli and the Grand Duchess Christina, were explicitly not allowed to be included [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|(Coyne 2005, p. 347)]].&lt;/ref&gt; which included a mildly censored version of the ''Dialogue''.&lt;ref name="complete works 2"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, pp. 303–04)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|Coyne (2005, p. 347)]]. The uncensored version of the ''Dialogue'' remained on the Index of prohibited books, however [[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|(Heilbron 2005, p. 279)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1758 the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of prohibited books]], although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the ''Dialogue'' and Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' remained.&lt;ref name="ban not lifted"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, p. 307)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|Coyne (2005, p. 347)]] The practical effect of the ban in its later years seems to have been that clergy could publish discussions of heliocentric physics with a formal disclaimer assuring its hypothetical character and their obedience to the church decrees against motion of the earth: see for example the commented edition (1742) of Newton's 'Principia' by Fathers Le Seur and Jacquier, which contains such a disclaimer ('Declaratio') before the third book (Propositions 25 onwards) dealing with the lunar theory.&lt;/ref&gt; All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.&lt;ref name="ban lifted"&gt;[[#Reference-McMullin-2005|McMullin (2005, p. 6)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|Coyne (2005, p. 346)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Not on the Index were [[Aristophanes]], [[Juvenal]], [[John Cleland]], [[James Joyce]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. According to Wallace et al., this was because the primary criterion for banning the work was [[anticlericalism]], [[blasphemy]] and [[heresy]].

Some authors whose views are generally unacceptable to the Church (e.g. [[Karl Marx]]) were never put on the ''Index''; nor was [[Charles Darwin]] (see [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/de/news/local_news/vatican-opens-up-secrets-of-forbidden-books-list-26424.html Vatican opens up secrets of Index of Forbidden Books].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heneghan, Tom, [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3998 "Secrets Behind The Forbidden Books"], America, ''The National Catholic Weekly'', February 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Works that were included in the Index, and later removed, include:

'''Malay folklore'''  refers to a series of knowledge, traditions and taboos that have been passed down through many generations in oral, written and symbolic forms among the indigenous populations of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] ([[Nusantara]]). They include among others, themes and subject matter related to the indigenous knowledge of the [[ethnic Malays]] and related ethnic groups within the region.

The stories within this system of lore often incorporate supernatural entities and magical creatures which form parts of the Malay mythology. Others relate to creation myths and place naming legends that are often inter-twined with historical figures and events. Ancient rituals for healing and traditional medicine as well as complex philosophies regarding health and disease can also be found.

== Oral tradition ==
The oral forms of this lore are transmitted primarily through nursery rhymes, folksongs, theatrical exhibitions, and stories that are commonly told from parent to child. Nomadic storytellers that would roam the temples, marketplaces and palace courts also play a large part in the insemination of the oral traditions throughout the populace, often accompanied by music as well through forms of composed poetry and prose. The oral traditions are often integrated with moral values and some may also include stories of talking animals.

===Folk music (''lagu rakyat'')===
Of all the types of oral transmission, those in the form of music appear to be most pervasive in Malay society. Songs and melodies from times of old are sung and resung on a regular basis during festivities such as weddings, celebrations of motherhood and childbirth, rites of passage and  at cultural or religious celebrations. They are also utilized in the occasional ceremonial functions in royal weddings, in rites of ascension (or [[coronation]]) and royal birthday celebrations; in the form of the more refined court music.

Every region or each of the states may employ different versions of oral transmission but the most popular is in the form of folk-singing or ''lagu rakyat''. The Middle Eastern-influenced ''ghazal'' can be heard in the southern Malaysian state of [[Johor]] especially is the district of [[Muar (district)|Muar]]. Poets and singers consisting of often females and sometimes males vocalize popular love poems and riddles in the form of [[pantun]] to the accompaniment of a composition and  of music made for a six-stringed Arabian lute (see [[oud]]), Indian [[tabla]]s, Western [[violins]], accordion and [[marracas]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Wendy. 1995. This is Malaysia. New Holland Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of nursery rhymes and lullabies are also sung at weddings and cultural festivals in the state of [[Melaka]] by Malays and the Malay-speaking [[Peranakan]] communities. The contents of the songs are mostly to do with advise on love, life and marriage and are affectionately known in Malay as ''dondang sayang'' meaning "song of love".

Within each of these folk-songs, messages and stories are told, a kind of informal handing down of wisdom from the old to the young in the form of poetry which may include any of these:
* [[Pantun]] - a poem with four stanzas, two of each rhymes with each other
* [[Syair]] - a poem also with four stanzas, with all ends rhyming together
* Seloka - a poem, similar to ''pantun''
* Madah - a kind of rhyming speech, a discourse through poetry
* [[Gurindam]] - poetry, set to music

===Folksongs===
The Malay oral tradition includes a large collection of folksongs. Many of these songs are in the form of stories weaved into poetry or simple rhyme. These folksongs continue to be sung and a sizable number of them are included in the albums of modern-day singers, often with improvisations in terms of melody and more complex musical arrangements to suit a larger accompaniment of musicians as well as singers.

[[File:UlekMayangdance.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A dancer performing the ''Ulek Mayang''. Manifested in a dance and healing ceremony, it narrates a mystical tale about the sea spirits in a forbidden love with a fisherman.]]
Among the more well known Malay folksongs include:
* ''Anak Itek Tok Wi''
* ''Apo Kono Eh Jang''
* ''Bunga Hutan''
* ''Can Mali Can''
* ''Damak''
* ''Di Tanjong Katong''
* ''Ewah Bule''
* ''Ikan Kekek''
* ''Istana Bunian''
* ''Itek Gembo-gembo''
* ''Jong Inai''
* ''Kenek-kenek Udang''
* ''Ketipang Payong''
* ''Lanchang Kuneng''
* ''Londeh Mak Londeh''
* ''Nak Dara Rindu''
* ''Nenek Si Bongkok Tiga''
* ''Suriram''
* ''Sri Mersing''
* ''Tanjong Puteri''
* ''Tudong Periok''
* ''Tumbok Kalang''
* ''[[Ulek mayang]]''
* ''Wau Bulan''

A number of these folksongs originally belong to a certain region within Southeast Asia and are sung by the populations within the area. However, due to the nature of inter-mingling and mutual co-migrations within these areas the folksongs may also be heard in places far from their original geographic origins.

===Bardic tales (''cerita penglipur lara'')===
[[File:Malaysia 250.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A view of [[Tasik Chini]] in [[Pahang]], where a dragon known as [[Naga Seri Gumum]] is believed to dwell.]]
Stories of love and romance of princes and princesses, kings and queens, and heroes and their damsels in distress (and often, damsels and their heroes in distress) have long filled the imaginations of ethnic Malays. The fact that numerous royal courts existed and still exist in Southeast Asia supplied the basis of the stories. Although many of these tales are replete with additions (or reductions) and may contain a certain measure of exaggeration as well as the expected variations that existed from one story teller to another, the value and the wisdom behind each story cannot be ignored.

These stories are often told by professional story tellers called ''penglipur lara'', which roughly translates to ''reliever of sorrows''. The few ''penglipur lara'' that exist today are often farmers or at least rural villagers. In the past, travelling ''penglipur lara'' would carry the stories from one ''[[kampung]]'' (village) to another, making the occasional stops at marketplaces, village squares as well as royal courts. The essence of the stories remain the same but sometimes, adjustments are made according to the individual story-teller's preference. For example, the ''penglipur lara'' version of the [[Ramayana]] changes many of the names and settings and casts [[Laksmana]] as a ''pawang'' or Malay shaman, as opposed to the literary [[Hikayat Seri Rama]] or the theatrical Hikayat Maharaja Wana which remained closer to the original [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]].

Among the well known stories that may fall into this category includes the following:
* ''Anak Buloh Betong''
* ''Batu Belah Batu Bertangkop''
* ''Bayagong''
* ''Lebai Malang''
* ''Mat Jenin''
* ''Naga Tasik Chini''
* ''Nenek Kebayan''
* ''Nujum Pak Belalang''
* ''Pak Kadok''
* ''Pak Pandir''
* ''Puteri Santubong Puteri Sejinjang''
* ''Raja Bersiong''
* ''Sang Kelembai''
* ''Si Bongkok''
* ''Si Luncai''
* ''[[Si Tanggang]]''
* ''Singapura Dilanggar Todak''

Many of these stories are also condensed and made into poetic songs. A fixed melody is set for each story to the extent that if a melody is played or sung in the absence of its wordings, a Malay would be able to instantly recall the title of the story or at least the name of the characters in the story.

===Animal fables (''cerita binatang'')===
Animal fables are often used to explain certain natural phenomena. Other times, they are simple moral tales. In almost all instances, the animals in these stories possess the ability to speak, reason and think like humans, similar to [[Aesop's Fables]].

The ''kancil'' or [[mouse-deer]] serves as the main character in a number of the stories. The Malays regard this humble animal in the highest esteem due to its ability to overcome obstacles and defeat adversaries despite of its rather small and benign appearance. The mouse-deer appears in the state herald of [[Melaka]] and even plays a part in the legend of Malacca's founding.

Below are listed some of the common fables as well as their approximate title translations. (Note that the word ''sang'', an [[Old Malay]] honorific meaning "revered", appears in all instances preceding the name ''kancil'' to indicate respect)
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Buaya'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the crocodile
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Monyet'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the monkey
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Harimau'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the tiger
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Sang Sempoh'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the bison
* ''Kisah Anjing dengan Bayang-bayang'' - The dog and the shadow
* ''Kisah Burung Gagak dan Merak'' - The crow and the peacock
* ''Kisah Burung Gagak yang Haus'' - The thirsty crow
* ''Kisah Labah-labah Emas'' - The golden spider
* ''Kisah Labah-labah dengan Burung Merpati'' - The spider and the pigeon
* ''Kisah Kerengga dengan Pemburu'' - The fire-ant and the hunter
* ''Kisah Burung Murai'' - The mockingbird
* ''Kisah Burung Kakak Tua'' - The cockatoo

===Ghost stories (''cerita hantu'')===
{{Main|Malay ghost myths}}
Malays, as with other Southeast Asians, have always taken great interest in stories of ghosts and spirits. It must be stressed that due to the animistic root of Malay folklore, these ghosts are seen as sharing the plane of existence with humans and are not always considered evil. However, when the delicate line that separates the boundaries of existence is crossed, or a transgression of living spaces occurs, a conflict ensues that may result in disturbances such as [[Spirit possession|possession]]s.

The Malay word for ghost is ''hantu''. However, this word also covers all sorts of demons, goblins and undead creatures and are thought to have real physical bodies, instead of just apparitions or spectres. The most famous of these is the ''[[Pontianak (folklore)|pontianak]]'' or ''matianak'', the ghost of a female stillborn child which lures men in the form of a beautiful woman.

Below are listed other popular supernatural beings and ghosts as well as their descriptions.
* ''Bajang'': the spirit of a stillborn child in the form of a [[civet]] cat (''musang'').
* ''Bota'': a type of evil spirit, usually a giant
* ''Hantu galah'': a ghost with legs and arms as long and slender as bamboo poles.
* ''Hantu kopek'': a female ghost with large bosoms who lures men who cheat on their wives
* ''Hantu kum-kum'': the ghost of an old woman who sucks the blood of virgin girls to regain her youth.
* ''Hantu lilin'': a wandering spirit that carries a torch or a lit candle at night
* ''Hantu Pemburu'': the Spectral Huntsman whose head is always looking upwards with a shoot growing from his neck
* ''Hantu punjut'': a ghost that takes children who wander into the forest late at night
* ''Hantu tinggi'': lit. "tall ghost", a type of giant that will flee at the sight of a naked body
* ''Jembalang'': a demon or evil spirit that usually brings disease
* ''Lang suir'': the mother of a [[pontianak (folklore)|pontianak]]. Able to take the form of an owl with long talons, and attacks pregnant women out of jealousy
* ''Mambang'': animistic spirits of various natural phenomena
* ''[[Orang minyak]]'': a cursed man covered in oil, who rapes women at night
* ''[[Pelesit]]'': a type of grasshopper that precedes the polong's arrival.
* ''[[Penanggal]]'': a flying head with its disembodied stomach sac dangling below. Sucks the blood of infants.
* ''Penunggu'': tutelary spirits of particular places such as caves, forests and mountains.
* ''[[Pocong]]'': a ghost wrapped in white burial shroud

* ''Toyol'': the spirit of a stillborn child, appears as a naked baby or toddler

== Written forms ==
{{Main|Malay literature}}
Malay folklore that appear as written traditions are often called ''[[hikayat]]'', ''kisah'' or ''dongeng''. The oldest of them were written in [[Old Malay]] using the prevailing scripts of the time, such as [[Sanskrit]], [[Pallava]] or [[Kawi language|Kawi]]. From around the 14th century onward, they were written in [[Classical Malay]] using [[Jawi script]] which prevailed ever since the arrival of Islam until the colonial era. During this time, the Malay royal courts became the centre for learning where scribes record the genealogy of kings and queens as well as historical events.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Wendy. 1995. This is Malaysia. New Holland Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epics (''hikayat'')===
The ''[[hikayat]]'' or epics are collections of stories and legends of heroism that often involve mythological and historical figures in a setting usually engaging the role of protagonists and antagonists. The [[Hikayat Hang Tuah]] and the story of [[Hang Jebat]] are among the most well known ''hikayat'' which are often told and retold in various forms such children's books, films, theatre plays and musical productions. The choice of who were to be portrayed as the protagonists and who were to be portrayed as the antagonists usually lies with the alignment of the storyteller, although most commonly, bards tend to maintain a stance of neutrality and dispassion in their story telling. In the stories of Hang Tuah and Hang Jebat for example, the lawful Hang Tuah may be portrayed as the hero, while sometimes, the non-lawful Hang Jebat may assume that role.
[[File:AbdullahbinAbdulKadir-HikayatAbdullah-1849.jpg|thumb|A page from the first edition of ''Hikayat Abdullah'' in the [[Jawi script]]. Published in 1849, it is a personal autobiography of [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]], a [[Malacca]]-born [[munshi]] of [[Singapore]].]]

Other notable ''hikayat'' include:
* ''[[Hikayat Seri Rama]]'' or ''Hikayat Megat Seri Rama''
* ''[[Mahabharata|Hikayat Pandawa Lima]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Patani]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Inderaputera]]''
* ''Hikayat Inderajaya''
* ''[[Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai]]''
* ''Hikayat Malim Deman''
* ''Hikayat Andaken Penurat''
* ''Hikayat Iskandar''
* ''[[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]'' or ''Hikayat Hamzah''
* ''Hikayat Isma Yatim''
* ''Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah''
* ''[[Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Abdullah]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Panca Tanderan]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Bayan Budiman]]''
* ''Hikayat Cekel Waneng Pati''

===Fairy tales (''kisah dongeng'')===
''Kisah dongeng'' are a loose collection of bedtime stories, fables and myths that involves human or non-human characters, often with superhuman powers along with talking animals, and an unearthly setting.

In this category, the story of ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'', ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'' and ''Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup'' is well known by the Malays. All three have been made into movies, albeit with differing interpretations and settings.

====Humanoid beings====

Characters with human-likeness abound in these stories. They are collectively referred to as ''orang halus'' meaning the "refined folk" or "soft folk" (often erroneously translated as "elves"). Most are invisible to the average human.

* '''[[Orang Bunian]]''': "hidden people" or "whistling people"; a race of exceptional beauty and grace.
* '''Orang ketot''': humans with short stature, similar to [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]]
* '''Orang kenit''': small humans, often possessing magic powers
* '''Gergasi''': giants or ogres
* '''Gedembai''' or '''Kelembai''': an ogre who has the power to turn things to stone.
* '''Duyong''': [[mermaid]]s, having the lower body of a fish and a woman's upper body
* '''Bidadari''': beautiful heavenly nymphs

====Lycanthropic beings====

* '''Harimau jadian''' or '''harimau akuan''': [[Werecat|were-tiger]], were-leopard or were-panther
* '''Ular tedung jadian''': were-cobra
* '''Lembu jadian''': were-bull

====Mythical birds====

* '''[[Garuda|Geroda]]''': a bird made of fire
* '''Jentayu''': a bird made of water
* '''Cenderawasih''': also known as the Bird of Paradise, considered to be king of the birds; Guardian of a sacred jewel in '''[[Hyang|Kahyangan]]''', lit. ''the Abode of the Gods''.

====Beasts====

* '''[[Nāga|Naga]]''': a dragon said to inhabit caves and watery areas
* '''Raja udang''' ''lit. King of Prawns'': a very large prawn or lobster-like creature
* '''Hantu Belangkas''': a gigantic king-crab that attacks people at sea.

====Middle Eastern and Persian additions====

Later folk stories adopted elements from the Islamic world, of Middle Eastern and Persian origin but having arrived by way of Muslims from [[India]]. They differ somewhat from their Arabian counterparts due to the fact that what Malays now refer to as angels or demons were originally animistic spirits and deities.

* '''Jin''': [[Djinn]]
* '''Syaitan''': Satan
* '''Pari-pari''' or '''[[peri]]''': Faries
* '''Malaikat''': [[Angel]] (Religion-related)
* '''Bidadari/Bidadara''': Woman/Man Angel

== Symbolic lore ==
Apart from the stories and songs, Malay folklore also includes traditions, rituals and taboos related to the physical as well as the more metaphysical realms of the Malay world view. Such knowledge are usually presented in the forms of symbols and signs inscribed or built into temple walls, palaces, houses and often appear on stone inscriptions as well as grave markers. Natural symbolism are also important such as flowers, trees, animals, the sea as well as celestial objects such as the moon and stars. Malays also have knowledge of a series of constellations that are markedly different from the Indian system upon which it is based. Object symbolism such as wood carvings of animals, ancestral images, mythical beings and masks are also common in Malay society.

Symbolic forms of folklore are usually the domains of the spirits and are therefore sometimes employed by the traditional healers and shamans. The Malays have been known to employ supernatural forces for healing as well as in the aiding of child-birth, the curing of poisons and in the warding off of spirits. Due to the [[Islamic revival|Islamization movement]] of recent decades, these practices are not very well-documented in Malay, but have been recorded in some Western sources.

'''Marks &amp; Spencer Group plc''' (also known as '''M&amp;S''') is a major British multinational retailer headquartered in the [[City of Westminster]], London. It is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]].

It specialises in the selling of clothing, home products and [[Luxury good|luxury]] food products. M&amp;S was founded in 1884 by [[Michael Marks]] and [[Thomas Spencer (Marks and Spencer)|Thomas Spencer]] in [[Leeds]].&lt;ref name="BBC2000October23"&gt;{{cite news|title=M&amp;S launches underwear boutiques|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/986292.stm|accessdate=15 March 2017|agency=BBC|issue=Business|publisher=BBC|date=23 October 2000|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also began to sell branded goods like [[Kellogg's Corn Flakes]] in November 2008.&lt;ref name="top brands"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hiscott, Graham |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/city-news/2009/11/04/marks-and-spencer-to-start-selling-top-brands-115875-21796883/ |title=Marks and Spencer to start selling top brands |work=Daily Mirror |location=London |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; M&amp;S currently has 979 stores across the U.K. including 615 that only sell food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39743611|title=M&amp;S online food delivery service will be no piece of cake|last=Plummer|first=Robert|date=28 April 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Establishment===
[[File:Marks &amp; Spencer, Briggate, Leeds.jpg|thumb|Marks and Spencer on [[Briggate, Leeds|Briggate]] not far from their original branch in [[Leeds]].]]
The company was founded by a partnership between [[Michael Marks]], a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jew]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/facilitiesandresources/diversity/events/documents/multiculturalism_poster_m_s.pdf |title=Marks and Spencer – a Great British institution. |publisher=[[Bournemouth University]] |accessdate=4 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509144611/http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/facilitiesandresources/diversity/events/documents/multiculturalism_poster_m_s.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Paul Burns|2008|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; from [[Słonim]] (Marks was born into a Polish-Jewish family, a Polish refugee living in the Russian Empire, now in [[Belarus]]), and [[Thomas Spencer (Marks and Spencer)|Thomas Spencer]], a cashier from the English market town of [[Skipton]] in [[North Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A43825629 |title=The History of Marks and Spencer |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theskiptonpress.co.uk/skiptons-illustrious-citizen-thomas-spencer-co-founder-marks-spencer/|title=Skipton’s Most Illustrious Citizen: Thomas Spencer, Co-Founder Of Marks &amp; Spencer|publisher=Skipton Press|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his arrival in England, Marks worked for a company in Leeds, called Barran, which employed refugees (see [[Sir John Barran, 1st Baronet]]). In 1884 he met Isaac Jowitt Dewhirst while looking for work. Dewhirst lent Marks £5 which he used to establish his Penny Bazaar on [[Leeds Kirkgate Market|Kirkgate Market]], in Leeds.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Dewhirst also taught him a little English. Dewhirst's cashier was Tom Spencer, a bookkeeper, whose second wife, Agnes, helped improve Marks' English. In 1894, when Marks acquired a permanent stall in Leeds' covered market, he invited Spencer to become his partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2008/jul/09/marksandspencer.history|title=The history of Marks and Spencer|date=9 July 2008|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 Marks moved to the [[Birkenhead]] open market where he amalgamated with Spencer. The pair were allocated stall numbers 11 &amp; 12 in the centre aisle in 1903, and there they opened the famous Penny Bazaar.  The company left Birkenhead Market on 24 February 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upton-wirral.co.uk/wir3.php |title=Birkenhead Market Fire |work=upton-wirral.co.uk |accessdate=20 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427143731/http://www.upton-wirral.co.uk/wir3.php |archivedate=27 April 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next few years saw Michael Marks and Tom Spencer open market stalls in many locations around the North West of England and move the original Leeds Penny Bazaar to 20, Cheetham Hill Road, [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/BUmarks.htm |title=Spartacus: Michael Marks |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=31 December 1907 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081542/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/BUmarks.htm |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic growth===
[[File:Marks and Spencer shop, Bekonscot.JPG|thumb|Representation of historic store from the 1930s, [[Bekonscot]] model village, UK]]
Marks and Spencer, known colloquially as "Marks and Sparks",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' – [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919169,00.html "Business: Marks &amp; Sparks Trades Up"], 28 November 1977&lt;/ref&gt; or "M&amp;S", made its reputation in the early 20th century with a policy of only selling British-made goods (it started to back down from this policy in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/mampss-uturns-will-the-latest-plans-last-2133453.html |title=M&amp;amp;S's U-turns: Will the latest plans last? |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It entered into long-term relationships with British manufacturers, and sold clothes and food under the "[[St Michael (brand)|St Michael]]" brand, which was introduced in 1928. The brand honours [[Michael Marks]]. It also accepted the return of unwanted items, giving a full cash refund if the receipt was shown, no matter how long ago the product was purchased, which was unusual for the time.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

M&amp;S staff raised £5,000 to pay for a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter aircraft called ''The Marksman'' in 1941.&lt;ref name="marksintime"&gt;{{cite book | title = Marks in Time: 125 Years of Marks &amp; Spencer | date = 3 September 2009 | last = Chislett | first = Helen | publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson | isbn = 978-0-297-85873-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1950, virtually all goods were sold under the "St Michael" label. M&amp;S lingerie, women's clothes and girls' school uniform were branded under the "St Margaret" label until the whole range of general merchandise became "St Michael". [[Simon Marks]], son of Michael Marks, died in 1964, after fifty-six years' service. [[Israel Sieff]], the son-in-law of Michael Marks, took over as chairman and in 1968, [[John Salisse]] became the company Director. A cautious international expansion began with the introduction of Asian food in 1974. M&amp;S opened stores in continental Europe in 1975 and in Ireland four years later.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

The company put its main emphasis on quality, including a 1957 stocking size measuring system.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; For most of its history, it also had a reputation for offering fair value for money. When this reputation began to waver, it encountered serious difficulties. Arguably, M&amp;S has historically been an iconic retailer of 'British Quality Goods'.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

The uncompromising attitude towards customer relations was summarised by the 1953 slogan: "The customer ''is'' always and completely right!"&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

Energy efficiency was improved by the addition of thermostatically controlled refrigerators in 1963.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

M&amp;S began selling [[Christmas cake]]s and [[Christmas pudding]]s in 1958. In an effort to improve the quality of their [[Swiss roll]]s, they hired the food expert Nat Goldberg, who made a major improvement across their entire cake range, which had lost the public's favour a few years earlier. As a later measure to improve food quality, food labelling was improved and "sell by dates" were phased in between 1970 and 1972.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

Smoking was banned from all M&amp;S shops in 1959 because of the fire hazards it posed.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

In 1972, [[Marcus Sieff, Baron Sieff of Brimpton|Marcus Sieff]] became chairman, remaining in place until 1984, and emphasising the importance of good staff relations to the tradition of the store,  while extending staff benefits to areas such as restaurants and chiropody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1323890/Lord-Sieff-of-Brimpton.html |title=Obituary - Marcus sieff |date=26 February 2001 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International expansion===

[[File:Marks &amp; Spencer in Times Square HK 201507.jpg|thumb|A Marks &amp; Spencer store in [[Times Square (Hong Kong)|Times Square]], Causeway Bay, Hong Kong.]]
M&amp;S opened its first Asian store in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitlock |first=Monica |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24165743 |title=When Duke Ellington played Kabul - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company expanded into Canada in 1973, and at one point had forty-seven stores across Canada. Despite various efforts to improve its image, the chain was never able to move beyond its reputation there as a stodgy retailer, one that catered primarily to senior citizens and expatriate Britons. The shops in Canada were smaller than British outlets, and did not carry the same selection. In the late 1990s, further efforts were made to modernise them and also expand the customer base. Unprofitable locations were closed. Nonetheless, the Canadian operations continued to lose money, and the last 38 shops in Canada were closed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/1999/07/14/marks990714.html |title=Marks and Spencer close ahead of schedule |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 November 2000 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826234315/http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/1999/07/14/marks990714.html |archivedate=26 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion into France began with shops opening in Paris at [[Boulevard Haussmann]] and [[Lyon]] in 1975, followed by a second Paris shop at Rosny 2 in 1977. Further expansion into other French and Belgian cities followed into the 1980s. Although the Paris shops remained popular and profitable, the Western European operation as a whole did not fare as well and eighteen shops were sold in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfanner |first=Eric |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2001/10/18/t15_14.php |title=Galeries Lafayette buying 18 stores |work=International Herald Tribune |date=18 October 2001 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2011, M&amp;S changed directions again with an announcement to reopen a store that will not only sell clothing but food as well. In addition the group will also open several food outlets throughout the French capital. The first branch opened on 24 November 2011 at the [[Champs-Élysées]] in a ceremony attended by the company's CEO [[Marc Bolland]], the model [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]] and the British Ambassador to France, Sir [[Peter Westmacott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8917910/Paris-has-a-Marks-and-Spencer-again-but-its-the-wrong-size-and-in-the-wrong-place.html|title=Paris has a Marks and Spencer again, but it's the wrong size and in the wrong place|publisher=The Telegraph|date=27 November 2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the company acquired [[Brooks Brothers]], an American clothing company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksbrothers.com/aboutus/heritage3.tem |title=Brooks Brothers Heritage |publisher=Brooksbrothers.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kings Super Markets]], a US food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/sector-44-45-retail-trade/clothing-clothing/1181357-1.html |title=Kings Supermarkets |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date=1 May 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 M&amp;S expanded to sell through European marketplace [[Zalando]] on their German, French, Dutch, Belgian and Austrian sites with a range of kidswear and lingerie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zalando.de/ms-london/|title=Marks &amp; Spencer London Online-Shop {{!}} Marks &amp; Spencer London versandkostenfrei bei Zalando|website=www.zalando.de|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial decline===
[[File:M &amp; S, Inverness (1998).png|thumb|M&amp;S shop in [[Inverness]] in 1998]]

M&amp;S's profits peaked in the financial year 1997/1998.&lt;ref name="profit"/&gt; At the time it was seen as a continuing success story, but with hindsight it is considered that during Sir [[Richard Greenbury]]'s tenure as head of the company, profit margins were pushed to untenable levels, and the loyalty of its customers was seriously eroded. The rising cost of using British suppliers was also a burden, as rival retailers increasingly imported their goods from low-cost countries, but M&amp;S's belated switch to overseas suppliers undermined a core part of its appeal to the public. Another factor was the company's refusal until 2001 to accept any credit cards except its own chargecard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciao.co.uk/Marks_Spencer_Chargecard__Review_5001590 |title=Marks &amp; Spencer storecard fading value |publisher=Ciao.co.uk |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724031156/http://www.ciao.co.uk/Marks_Spencer_Chargecard__Review_5001590 |archive-date=24 July 2010 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These factors combined to plunge M&amp;S into a sudden slump, which took the company, its shareholders, who included hundreds of thousands of small investors, and nearly all retail analysts and business journalists, by surprise. The company's share price fell by more than two thirds, and its profits fell from more than a billion pounds in 1997 and 1998 to £145&amp;nbsp;million in the year ended 31 March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/07/02/bcnmshist102.xml Marks &amp; Spencer: A Recent History] ''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, with changes in its business focus such as accepting credit cards, the introduction of the "Per Una" clothing range designed by [[George Davies (retailer)|George Davies]], and a redesign of its underlying business model, profits recovered somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/2794432/Marks-and-Spencer-loses-Per-Una-design-director.html|title=Marks &amp; Spencer loses Per Una design director|publisher=The Telegraph|date=7 August 2008|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, M&amp;S was in the throes of an attempted takeover by [[Arcadia Group]] and [[British Home Stores|BHS]] boss, [[Philip Green]].&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DQA/is_2000_Feb_17/ai_59870857 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016211356/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DQA/is_2000_Feb_17/ai_59870857 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=16 October 2015 |title=Green drops Marks &amp; Spencer bid |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=18 April 2011 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July a recovery plan was announced which would involve selling off its financial services business [[M&amp;S Bank|M&amp;S Money]] to [[HSBC Bank (Europe)|HSBC Bank plc]], buying control of the ''Per Una'' range, closing the [[Gateshead]] Lifestore and stopping the expansion of its Simply Food line of shops. [[Philip Green]] withdrew his takeover bid after failing to get sufficient backing from shareholders.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The book- "Marks in time" by Orionbooks.co.uk (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, M&amp;S announced the opening of the world's largest M&amp;S shop outside the UK at [[Dubai Festival City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dubai.mconet.biz/index.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=282535&amp;category=884&amp;category_name= |title=Dubai Online |publisher=Dubai.mconet.biz |accessdate=7 November 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2008, M&amp;S opened its first mainland China shop in [[Shanghai]]. Problems with the supply chain for the first few months of opening led Stuart Rose, M&amp;S chairman, to describe failures in "basic shopkeeping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2bac61ae-f6e2-11dd-8a1f-0000779fd2ac.html |title=M&amp;S admits Shanghai errors |first = Patti | last = Waldmeir |work=Financial Times |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restructuring===
Twenty-two unprofitable and minor food stores, such as the ones at [[Ripon]] and [[Balham]], were closed in early 2009 as part of a cost cutting measure.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; In August 2010, it was confirmed that the [[Grantham]] branch of M&amp;S would close, along with two other [[Lincolnshire]] branches in [[Skegness]] and [[Scunthorpe]] due to low sales in these older format stores. The closures were met with protests from the local communities and petitions were signed in support of retaining the stores, although they went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;BBC New Lincolnshire 25 August 2010 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-11076135 'M&amp;S confirms three store closures in Lincolnshire'] Retrieved 25 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Retail Knowledge Bank conducted an audit of the company's brands in August 2010, and revealed that sales of womenswear were at a 10-year low. The audit covered both the Limited Collection, Autograph, Autograph Weekend, Classic Collection, Per Una, Portfolio and Indigo.&lt;ref name="thisismoney.co.uk 512068"/&gt; ''Draper'' magazine claimed that Per Una was the only clothing brand not at risk of being axed while Marc Bolland considered which brands would be retained.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Per Una was planned to stay due to its successful and distinctive flair, but Portfolio and Indigo were planned to go due to poor sales.&lt;ref name="thisismoney.co.uk 512068"/&gt; Both the Limited Collection, Autograph, Autograph Weekend, Classic Collection brands were being considered for the cull during mid-2010, but were later given a reprieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Isak Halfon, expansion director, Mango |url=http://www.just-style.com/news/bolland-review-to-streamline-ms-clothing-brands_id108648.aspx |title=UK: Bolland review to streamline M&amp;S clothing brands?: Apparel and textile news &amp; analysis |publisher=Just-style.com |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 November 2010, chief executive Marc Bolland revealed plans to strengthen the company’s overall brand image and targeting sales of between £800m and £1bn for which company will increase capital expenditure to £850m to £900m over the next three years to fund the plans.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6A70V420101109 |agency=Reuters   | first=Mark | last=Potter | title=UPDATE 5-Marks &amp; Spencer's new CEO lifts investment | date=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan also involved the discontinuation of its 'Portfolio' fashion brand and the sale of electrical products. The company also announced a new marketing strapline, 'Only at M&amp;S', and that it would revamp its website.&lt;ref name="htanna"&gt;{{cite web|title=M&amp;S plans £900m capital expenditure to boost sales|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2010/11/sales-plans-1bn-operations|work=2010 plans for expansion|accessdate=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolland ordered a new store design in May 2011, and it was announced that the company would spend around £600 million between 2011 and 2014 on its UK stores, involving the launch of a range of different store formats based on the age, affluence and demographics of people in those areas. The design also included the trial of a new in-store "navigation scheme", which followed research showing that shoppers found M&amp;S store layouts confusing and "difficult to shop [in]". It also confirmed that the amount of money-off promotions and deals offered would be increased, and that it would replace the Marks &amp; Spencer label on clothing with "M&amp;S Woman" and "M&amp;S Man".&lt;ref name="telegraph2"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8534666/2bn-Marks-and-Spencer-makeover-less-than-inspiring.html | title=£2bn Marks &amp; Spencer makeover 'less than inspiring'|date=25 May 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=25 March 2012|first=James|last=Hall|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, it was revealed that Bill Adderley, founder of homeware chain [[Dunelm Group]], had amassed a £250m stake in M&amp;S over the past 18 months.

===Social and environmental policy===

===="Look Behind the Label"====
In 2006, the ''Look Behind the Label'' marketing campaign was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/timeforpaddington/ti_news_detail.asp?newsID=63 M&amp;S launches new ‘Look behind the label' campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928024224/http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/timeforpaddington/ti_news_detail.asp?newsID=63 |date=28 September 2007 }}". Paddington Waterside Partnership – 21 February 2006 &lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this campaign was to highlight to customers the various ethical and environmentally friendly aspects of the production and sourcing methods engaged in by M&amp;S including: [[Fairtrade]] products, [[sustainable fishing]] and environmentally friendly textile dyes. All coffee and tea sold in M&amp;S stores is now Fairtrade.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/ng.asp?id=66333-marks-spencer-fairtrade-coffee Marks &amp; Spencer dives into ethical consumer market]" Fletcher, Anthony – 10 March 2006 – Food Navigator.com (Europe)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the company offers clothing lines made from Fairtrade cotton in selected departments.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4660410.stm M&amp;S set to launch Fairtrade range]". BBC News Online – 30 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

At Christmas, the company introduces a range of food products to support the housing charity [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://england.shelter.org.uk/howtohelp/howtohelp-682.cfm Marks &amp; Spencer raises money for Shelter this Christmas]" (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MarksAndSpencerBirmingham.jpg|thumb|M&amp;S store on [[Birmingham]] High Street]]

On 15 January 2007, M&amp;S launched an initiative, known as "Plan A",&lt;ref name=PlanA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plana.marksandspencer.com/ |title=Plan A |publisher=Plana.marksandspencer.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to dramatically increase the environmental [[sustainability]] of the business within 5 years and expected to cost £200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6261939.stm |title=Business &amp;#124; M&amp;S unveils carbon-neutral target |publisher=BBC News  |date=15 January 2007 |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan covers "100 commitments over 5 years to address the key social and environmental challenges facing M&amp;S today and in the future" with the tag-line "Because there is no Plan B". The commitments span five themes: [[climate change]], [[waste]], sustainable raw materials, 'fair partnership' and health,&lt;ref name=PlanA/&gt; with the aim that, by 2012, it will:&lt;ref&gt;[http://plana.marksandspencer.com/index.php?action=PublicPillarDisplay Marks &amp; Spencer: Plan A – The Five Pillars], Marks &amp; Spencer&lt;/ref&gt;
* Become carbon neutral
* Send no waste to landfill
* Extend sustainable sourcing
* Help improve the lives of people in their supply chain
* Help customers and employees live a healthier life-style

Despite an 18% fall in the share price in January 2008, following publication of their latest [[trading statement]], the company confirmed that they would be continuing with the plan, saying that there were 'compelling commercial&amp;nbsp;— as well as moral&amp;nbsp;— reasons to do so'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206094008/http://www.hbrgreen.org/2008/03/the_hard_economics_of_green.html?cm_mmc=npv-_-listserv-_-MAR_2008-_-HBRGreen0305 The hard economics of green], [[Harvard Business Review]], [[Stuart Rose|Sir Stuart Rose]], published 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

M&amp;S introduced a reusable [[Hessian (cloth)|hessian]] bag in 2007 as part of the plan, aiming to reduce the number of plastic bags used within five years. This was followed in May 2008 by the introduction of a 5p charge for standard sized carrier bags used for food purchases (before this charge became compulsory).&lt;ref name=PlanA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7268283.stm |title=M&amp;S to charge 5p for plastic bags |publisher=BBC News  |date=28 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All profits from the sale of food bags originally went to the charity [[Groundwork UK]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/02/28/eaplastic128.xml "Marks and Spencer to charge for plastic bags"], By Bonnie Malkin and agencies, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (online), 28 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; M&amp;S launched the "Forever Fish" campaign in June 2011 and switched funding to that campaign to promote protection of marine wildlife in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/page.aspx?pointerid=7337418c9e6a4eb2a97b7016192e0ee4 "Marks &amp; Spencer launches Forever Fish"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322220938/http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/page.aspx?pointerid=7337418c9e6a4eb2a97b7016192e0ee4 |date=22 March 2012 }}, Marks and Spencer Press Release, 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK and Ireland===
[[File:A picture of M&amp;S White City branch in Westfield London 2014-01-17 17-26.jpg|thumb|M&amp;S White City in [[Westfield London]] is one of the company's largest stores.]]
The largest shop is at [[Marble Arch]], on [[Oxford Street]] in London, which has around {{convert|16000|m2}} of [[shop floor]]. The second largest is in Cheshire Oaks, [[Ellesmere Port]], which is the largest outside London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=36&amp;storycode=3103910&amp;c=1 |title=M&amp;S megastore for Leeds&amp;nbsp;— Property Week |publisher=Property Week|accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third largest shop is at the Gemini Retail Park in [[Warrington]]. In 1999 M&amp;S opened its shop in [[Manchester]]'s [[Exchange Square (Manchester)|Exchange Square]], which was destroyed in the [[1996 Manchester bombing]] and rebuilt. At re-opening, it was the largest M&amp;S shop with {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of retail space, but half was subsequently sold to [[Selfridges]], the company's second site in Manchester.  The smallest branch is an outlet located in the [[Grainger Market]] in Newcastle upon Tyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastlegateshead.com/things-to-do/grainger-market-p433811|title=Grainger Market|publisher=Newcastle Gateshead|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M&amp;S has opened a number of stores at out of town locations since the trend to build shopping centres away from town centres became popular in the 1980s. The first was at the [[MetroCentre (shopping centre)|MetroCentre]], [[Gateshead]], [[Tyne and Wear]], which opened in 1986. Another notable example is the store at the [[Merry Hill Shopping Centre]] at [[Brierley Hill]], West Midlands. This store opened on 23 October 1990 shortly after the closure of stores in the nearby town centres of [[Dudley]] and [[West Bromwich]]; the Merry Hill store was not originally intended to replace these two town centre stores, but both the Dudley and West Bromwich stores had experienced a downturn in trade as the opening of the Merry Hill store loomed, and both stores were closed on 25 August 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120106032922/http://www.sthelens.oxon.sch.uk/Geography/Downloads/Geopress%20Factsheets/Geo%20factsheets/11%20out%20of%20town%20shopping%20centres.pdf Out Of Town Shopping Centres] Geofactsheet No. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson, Molly&amp;nbsp;— icWales.co.uk – 20 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's website has received criticism for having its prices in [[Pound sterling]] and not in euro, and for providing a search for its Irish stores through a "UK Store Finder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=COMPUTERS+IN+BUSINESS-qqqs=computersinbusiness-qqqid=37099-qqqx=1.asp |title=Sunday Business Post &amp;#124; Irish Business News |publisher=Sbpost.ie |date=2 November 2008 |accessdate=7 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625190709/http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=COMPUTERS+IN+BUSINESS-qqqs=computersinbusiness-qqqid=37099-qqqx=1.asp |archivedate=25 June 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' pointed out that M&amp;S failed to explain why the company is in a position to deliver goods ordered from its website to Brazil, Argentina, Iraq and Afghanistan but not to Ireland. M&amp;S did not comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/pricewatch/2010/0111/1224262050906.html |title=M&amp;S Vouchers |work=The Irish TImes  |date=1 January 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===

The company reopened its store in Paris on 24 November 2011, following the launch of a new French website on 11 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, Chloe [http://www.internetretailing.net/2011/10/ms-launches-new-french-website/ ''M&amp;S launches new French website''] 11 October 2011, internetretailing.net&lt;/ref&gt; In the Philippines there are 18 M&amp;S shops, the largest of which is located in [[Greenbelt (Ayala Center)|Greenbelt Mall]]. A new store opened on 17 April 2013 in [[Kalverstraat]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]], more than 10 years after closure of the previous store.

==Store formats==

===Core shops===
[[File:Marks and Spencer.Kirkcaldy.JPG|thumb|A typical example of an un-modernised 'core' M&amp;S store, located in [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]]. However, as of 2012 the store has now been fully refurbished with the so-called "Light Touch" re-fit.]]
M&amp;S core shops typically feature a selection of the company's clothing ranges and an M&amp;S [[food hall]]. The range of clothing sold and the space given to it depends on the location and customer demographic (an example would be that some London shops do not stock the Classic Collection, but stock Limited Collection and a full Autograph range). Most core shops feature a Food hall. The current store format was designed by Urban Salon Architects in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2586665.ece |title=Marks and sparks: Shopping in the 21st century |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=27 May 2007 |accessdate=7 November 2009 |first=Paul |last=Rodgers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118145633/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2586665.ece |archivedate=18 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===M&amp;S Foodhall===
[[File:M&amp;S Food Hall, SUTTON, Surrey, Greater London.jpg|thumb|An M&amp;S Food Hall in the [[Sutton, London]] branch]]
All the '''St Michael Food hall''' supermarkets were renamed ''M&amp;S Food hall'' when Marks &amp; Spencer dropped the ''St Michael'' brand in 2000. Each M&amp;S Foodhall sells groceries, which are all under the Marks &amp; Spencer brand. However, in 2009 the company began selling a limited range of other brands, such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Stella Artois]], without reducing the number of M&amp;S goods they sold. This marked the first time in its 125-year history that Marks &amp; Spencer had sold any brands other than its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/950570/M-S-sell-brands-first-time-125-years/|title= M&amp;S to sell other brands for the first time in 125 years|publisher=Brand Republic|first= James|last= Quilfer|date= 4 November 2009|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M&amp;S introduced [[self check-out]] tills in the food-halls of a small number of trial stores in 2002. Self check-out was implemented in the general merchandise sections in three trial stores in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5245/is_200209/ai_n19869452 M&amp;S to test self-scan tills]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hospitality===
Many large shops, such as Lisburn Sprucefield, [[Westfield London|Westfield, White City]], Cribbs Causeway and [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], also offer other hospitality outlets, such as a modern ''Deli Bar'' (champagne, canapés, seafood), ''Restaurant'' (table service—the first of which was opened in Newcastle) ''M&amp;S Kitchen'' (traditional home cooking &amp; lunches) or ''Hot Food To Go'' (burgers, chips, soups). Many of these outlets are run in conjunction with [[Compass Group]] under franchise arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catererandhotelkeeper.co.uk/articles/19/4/2013/348189/compass-group-signs-m-s-franchise-agreement.htm|title=Compass Group signs M&amp;S franchise agreement|publisher=Caterer and Hotelkeeper|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home stores===
In 2007, M&amp;S announced that new, dedicated shops for home furnishings were to be launched. Shops have now been opened in [[Cheltenham]] in Gloucestershire, [[Tunbridge Wells]] in Kent, [[Lisburn]] Sprucefield in Northern Ireland&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retail-week.com/Stores/theres_no_place_like_home.html There is no place like home] Retail Week&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Barton Square section of [[Trafford Centre|The Trafford Centre]], Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shopping-centre.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/2591/Trafford_extends_Barton_Square_homewares_offer.html |title=Trafford extends Barton Square homewares offer |publisher=Shopping-centre.co.uk |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092414/http://www.shopping-centre.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/2591/Trafford_extends_Barton_Square_homewares_offer.html |archivedate=25 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlet stores===
As of 2010, M&amp;S have 50 outlet stores and growth expansion plans for future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annualreport.marksandspencer.com/about/uk-international.aspx |title=Annual Report 2009 |year=2009 |publisher=Marks &amp; Spencer |accessdate=25 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723122137/http://annualreport.marksandspencer.com/about/uk-international.aspx |archivedate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Outlet division offers M&amp;S products with the majority of them discounting at least 30% from the original selling price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.marksandspencer.com/thecompany/our_stores/outlet.shtml |title=Outlet |publisher=Marks and Spencer |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714041208/http://www2.marksandspencer.com/thecompany/our_stores/outlet.shtml |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these stores opened at [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] in Kent in 2000. Many of the Outlet shops are in locations such as retail parks and outlet centres, though some, including the shop in [[Woolwich]], South London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misterwhat.co.uk/company/146221-marks-spencer-outlet-london |title=Woolwich outlet from |publisher=MisterWhat |date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Newton Abbot]], Devon were previously main M&amp;S shops which converted to the Outlet format. Meadow Bank Outlet Store in Edinburgh became the model for all the Marks and Spencer Outlet shop in the early months of 2010.
There are now also stores which combine a mainline M&amp;S store and an Outlet store to create a store which offers both the main current full-price M&amp;S ranges and the discounted Outlet ranges: one such store is at the [[Lewisham Shopping Centre]], where the previously closed upper level of the M&amp;S store was reopened in January 2009 as an Outlet format sub-store;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishamcentre.co.uk/stores/atozofstores/20314.aspx |title=M&amp;S Outlet on Lewisham Shopping Centre website |publisher=Lewishamcentre.co.uk |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===M&amp;S Simply Food===
[[File:Marks and Spencer, Banstead, Surrey - geograph.org.uk - 339773.jpg|thumb|M&amp;S Simply Food in [[Banstead]], Surrey]]
[[File:M&amp;S Food to Go, SUTTON, Surrey, Greater London.jpg|thumb|An M&amp;S Food to Go store in Sutton station, [[Sutton, London]]]]
M&amp;S launched a convenience format, branded ''Simply Food'' in 2001, with the first stores opening in [[Twickenham]] and [[Surbiton]]. The stores predominantly sell food but also carry a small selection of general merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finch|first1=Julia|title=Simply Food to triple in size with restaurant plan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/nov/08/marksspencer.supermarkets|accessdate=20 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=8 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of these are run under [[franchising|franchise]] agreements:
* [[SSP Group]] runs the stores at mainline railway stations and airports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssp-intl.com/SSPInternet/Content/Brands/National.htm Select Service Partner]. Company Website&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Moto Hospitality|Moto]] has stores at 37 of its motorway service stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6136684.stm Perils of the motorway pit stops] May, Maurice&amp;nbsp;— BBC News Online – 10 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Orders from M&amp;S accounted for more than half of [[Uniq plc|Uniq]]'s food product supplies to UK retailers in 2010 after several years service as a major M&amp;S food product supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Business-News/Uniq-Brands-will-drive-footfall-at-M-S-but-not-in-the-desserts-fixture |title=Uniq: Brands will drive footfall at M&amp;S, but not in the desserts fixture |publisher=Foodmanufacture.co.uk |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 it was noted that M&amp;S were operating [[express pricing]]; i.e., charging more in their Simply Food branches than in regular branches. A spokesperson stated that "prices are a little higher than at our high street stores but this reflects the fact that these stores are open longer and are highly convenient for customers on the move".&lt;ref name="m&amp;s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confused.com/money/articles/mystery-shop-how-much-more-do-you-pay-in-m-s-simply-food#ixzz2V8aHbrYr|title=Mystery shop: How much do you pay in M&amp;S Simply Food?|publisher=[[Confused.com]]|accessdate=3 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927074743/http://www.confused.com/money/articles/mystery-shop-how-much-more-do-you-pay-in-m-s-simply-food#ixzz2V8aHbrYr|archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Simply Food brand has been phased out in all stand-alone larger stores since the rebrand in 2015 and the stores have now been branded as "M&amp;S Foodhall."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/marks-spencer-open-m-s-foodhall-bath/story-28652896-detail/story.html|title=Marks &amp; Spencer to open an M&amp;S Foodhall in Bath|date=2 February 2016|work=Bath Chronicle|accessdate=21 March 2017}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online services===
Products could be ordered online since the mid-2000s, in response to [[Tesco]] launching their pioneering [[Tesco.com]] home shopping delivery service in the early 2000s. Both Tesco, M&amp;S and others are expanding rapidly into this new niche market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39743611|title=M&amp;S online food delivery service will be no piece of cake|last=Plummer|first=Robert|date=28 April 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online flower service was accused of unfair trading and using [[Google]] to piggy-back advertise on online searches aimed at [[Interflora]] online in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11531677 |publisher=BBC News  | title=Interflora sues Marks &amp; Spencer over Google ad links | date=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] shopping chain beat M&amp;S to the title of the UK's best high-street website by late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bold |first=Ben |url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/channel/DigitalMedia/article/1035596/John-Lewis-beats-M-S-UKs-best-high-street-website/ |title=John Lewis beats M&amp;S as UK's best high-street website |work=Marketing magazine |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's ranges include clothing for men, woman and children, as well as home products and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksandspencer.com/|title=Welcome to Marks &amp; Spencer|website=www.marksandspencer.com|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these ranges, M&amp;S use a number of own brands, such as those used within its womenswear division, including Indigo Collection Junior, Indigo Collection and Portfolio. Indigo Collection is aimed at women over 30s, while Portfolio is aimed at those aged over 45. By 2010, M&amp;S had 10 sub-brands within womenswear and 6 sub-brands within menswear, following a reduction in brands.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8098977/MandS-plans-to-take-Twiggy-international.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=James | last=Hall | title=M&amp;S plans to take Twiggy international | date=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marks &amp; Spencer were selling clothes under the ''St Margaret'' and ''St Michael'' label by the mid-1950s and launched their [[school uniforms]] in the early 1950s, but would be scrapped in the early 2000s as part of the corporate modernisation plan.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

Within Marks &amp; Spencer's food ranges, it first pioneered boil-in-the-bag and sachet meals in 1972. The company also sells main meals, lunches, sweets and other savoury items. It launched its "[[Percy Pig]]s" sweets in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/high-on-the-hog-how-percy-pig-came-to-dominate-the-sweetie-market-and-win-the-nations-hearts-1989583.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=6 June 2010 | title=High on the hog: How Percy Pig came to dominate the sweetie market, and win the nation's hearts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the billionth "Percy Pig" sweet was sold by October 2007.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; M&amp;S also has an extensive wine and beer range,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksandspencer.com/Wine-Food-Wine/b/44092030?ie=UTF8&amp;intid=gnav_food-wine_wine |title=Wine : Food &amp; Wine |publisher=Marks &amp; Spencer |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first started in 1973.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; In 2006 and 2007, M&amp;S entered over a hundred of its own wines into two wine competitions, ''[[Decanter (magazine)|The Decanter World Wine Awards]]'' and the International Wine Challenge. Both years, almost every wine won an award, ranging from the 2005 Secano Pinot Noir, Leyda Valley, Chile (Best Pinot Noir in the world for under £10) to the Rosada Cava (Commended).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decanter.com/worldwineawards/2007/dwwa_search.php?rsearch=M%26S |title=Decanter World Wine Awards 2007 |publisher=Decanter.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

M&amp;S's relatively successful interior design 'Home' brand was launched in 2005 and featured products like vases, furniture and beds.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

The children's online only 'Living the Dream' range of [[Lewis Hamilton]] and [[Heikki Kovalainen]] memorabilia and merchandise was launched in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishamilton.com/news/2009/09/mandslaunch09 |title=Pit-stop press!

===Per Una===
[[File:Women peruna.jpg|thumb|Per Una's logo, three hearts]]
"Per Una" was launched on 28 September 2001 as a joint venture between M&amp;S and [[Next plc|Next]] founder [[George Davies (retailer)|George Davies]] with the contribution of Julie Strang. The ''Per Una'' brand has been a major success for the company,&lt;ref name=davies&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4329412.stm |title=M&amp;S sales rise but Davies resigns |date=11 October 2005 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2004, M&amp;S bought the brand in a £125&amp;nbsp;million, two-year service contract with George Davies.&lt;ref name=per&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3715654.stm |title=M&amp;S completes Per Una purchase |date=5 October 2004 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Davies was to stay on for at least two years to run the company, with 12 months notice required if he wished to leave.&lt;ref name=davies/&gt;&lt;ref name=per/&gt;

===Old labels===
The "St Michael" brand was introduced by Simon Marks in 1928 in honour of his father and co-founder of Marks &amp; Spencer, [[Michael Marks]]. By 1950, virtually all goods were sold under the St Michael brand. M&amp;S lingerie, women's clothing and girls' uniform were branded under the ''St Margaret'' brand, until the whole range of general merchandise became St Michael.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; The synthetic fibre Tricell was first used in 1957 and lasted until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; and another synthetic fibre called Courtelle was first launched, nationally, by Marks &amp; Spencer during 1960 and also lasted well into the 1970s.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; Machine washable wool first appeared in 1972 and [[Lycra]] hosiery first came in during 1986.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

M&amp;S launched their own brands of domestic products, such as [[washing powder]] and [[aluminium foil]] in 1972, under the brand name of 'House-care'.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;
The 1996–1997 'Orient Express Tagged' brand was the first of numerous new brands, most of which were in feminine and children's clothes. The 'Orient Express Tagged' brand was part of the inspiration behind the 'Portfolio' brand.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; The men's Autograph brand was then launched in 2000&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; and continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksandspencer.com/c/men/autograph |title=Autograph |publisher=Marks &amp; Spencer |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Sir Stuart Rose axed a number of brands including the menswear brand "SP Clothing", the "View From" sportswear range, the [[David Beckham]] children's range "DB07" and several food lines as he thought the company's stock inventory management had become 'too complicated'.&lt;ref name="thisismoney.co.uk 512068"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Birnbaum |url=http://www.just-style.com/analysis/sir-stuart-hands-over-golden-baton_id108297.aspx |title=Sir Stuart hands over golden baton: Apparel and textile news &amp; analysis |publisher=Just-style.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of Per Una aimed at teenagers, "Per Una Due", was also discontinued, despite having launched earlier in the year, due to poor sales.&lt;ref name="thisismoney.co.uk 512068"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Craven |first=Neil |date=15 August 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |title=M&amp;S clothing brands set for overhaul |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=512068&amp;in_page_id=2 |work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hayes |first=David |date=7 February 2004 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-11737114-ms-and-teenage-frills.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421120827/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-11737114-ms-and-teenage-frills.do |dead-url=yes |archivedate=21 April 2013 |title=M&amp;S and teenage frills |work=[[Evening Standard]] |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also began to sell branded goods like [[Kellogg's Corn Flakes]] in November 2008.&lt;ref name="top brands"/&gt; Following a review by Marc Bolland in 2011, M&amp;S confirmed it would begin to reduce the number of branded items on sale, instead offering only those that it did not have an M&amp;S alternative for.&lt;ref name="ausfoodnews.com.au"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.ausfoodnews.com.au/2010/10/19/marks-and-spencer-may-cut-sales-of-name-brands.html|title=Marks and Spencer may cut sales of name brands|publisher=Food News|date=19 October 2010|accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==

===New logo===
[[File:Marks &amp; Spencer corporate logo.svg|thumbnail|The older logo, used from 2000 to 2007]]
During the height of the company's troubles at the beginning of the 21st century, the ''St Michael'' brand used as the selling label for all M&amp;S products was discontinued in favour of ''Marks &amp; Spencer'' and a new logo in the [[Optima]] typeface was introduced and began to appear in place of ''St Michael'' on product packaging. The same logo was also applied to store fascias and carrier bags. The ''St Michael'' name was subsequently adopted as a 'quality guarantee' and appeared as the ''St Michael Quality Promise'' on the back of food products, on the side of delivery vehicles and on in-store ordering receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/674973.stm|title=M&amp;S drops St Michael|date=12 March 2000|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Your M&amp;S===
[[File:Your M&amp;S logo.svg|thumb|''Your M&amp;S'' promotional logo 2004–2014.]]
When Steve Sharp joined as marketing director in 2004, after being hired by new Chief Executive Sir Stuart Rose, he introduced a new promotional brand under the ''Your M&amp;S'' banner, with a corresponding logo.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/marks/story/0,,1804124,00.html Steve Sharp: Shy marketing whizz creating sparks at Marks]". Martinson, Jane – ''The Guardian'', 23 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-profile media campaigns===
[[File:Marks &amp; Spencer new logo.svg|thumbnail|Logo 2007-2015]]
M&amp;S has always run newspaper and/or Magazine ads since the early 1950s, but the introduction of some famous stars such as [[Twiggy]]&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6636506/Supermodel-Erin-OConnor-told-to-have-cosmetic-surgery.html |title=Supermodel Erin O’Connor told to have cosmetic surgery |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2009 | location=London | first=Urmee | last=Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2009/may/15/marks-spencer-anniversary-ad |title=Video: Watch Twiggy in Marks &amp; Spencer's 125th birthday ad |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 18 May 2009|accessdate=19 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Jason]] in various TV ads has helped raise the company's profile. Twiggy first appeared in 1967, returning later in 1995 and 2005. Anne Grierson&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; first featured in adverts during the late 1950s and most of the 1960s. In later years, [[Erin O'Connor]],&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; [[Myleene Klass]],&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; Tanja Nadjila, Peter Kay, [[David Beckham]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Antonio Banderas]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Claudia Schiffer]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Helena Christensen]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Tatjana Patitz]],&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[Lisa Snowdon]], [[Dannii Minogue]], [[V V Brown]] and [[Carmen Kass]] have also featured in a few ads, along with many others.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt; [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]], David Jason and [[Joanna Lumley]] have either appeared in or voiced over adverts since 2008.&lt;ref name="marksintime"/&gt;

The new look has been instrumental in the company's recent resurgence, particularly with the success of a new clothing campaign featuring the celebrated model, [[Twiggy]], and younger models associated with the [[Boho-chic#The influence of boho|bohemian]] styles of 2005–6, and the new TV ad campaign for its food range. These adverts have the tag-line "This is not just food, this is M&amp;S food" and feature slow motion, close-up footage of various food products, described in a sultry [[voice-over]] by [[Dervla Kirwan]], to an enticing instrumental song&amp;nbsp;— most notably Fleetwood Mac's "[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]" as well as [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s "[[Samba Pa Ti (instrumental)|Samba Pa Ti]]", [[Olly Murs]]' "[[Busy (Olly Murs song)|Busy]]", [[Groove Armada]]'s "[[At the River]]" or [[Spandau Ballet]]'s "[[True (Spandau Ballet song)|True]]". These adverts have been referred to by both fans and critics as being ''[[food porn]]'', with a number of other companies copying the idea, such as [[Aldi]] and, most recently, [[Waitrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kollewe, Julia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/04/marksspencer |title=Food porn for every hedonist in the world |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 4 July 2008|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 TV advertising campaign drew complaints, leading to national press coverage, regarding sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/sexism-complaints-over-marks-and-spencer-christmas-ad-14566626.html |title=Sexism complaints over Marks and Spencer's Christmas ad |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, it was confirmed that Dannii Minogue would be one of the new faces of Marks &amp; Spencer. She filmed her first commercial in South Africa, which featured [[Cheryl Lynn]]'s "[[Got to Be Real]]", for their Spring campaign that aired on 24 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/24/dannii-minogue-marks-and-spencer-ad|title=Marks &amp; Spencer launches ads starring Dannii Minogue and Lisa Snowdon|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 March 2010|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dannii travelled to [[Miami]], Florida in January 2011 to shoot the commercial for M&amp;S for the 2011 Spring collection, prior to her contractual termination. In August 2011, M&amp;S announced the new faces of their campaigns would be [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]], [[Ryan Reynolds]] and [[David Gandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/Article.aspx?Id=TMG8731621 |title=David Gandy and Ryan Reynolds Join Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for M&amp;S |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=22 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313062227/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/Article.aspx?Id=TMG8731621 |archivedate=13 March 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marks &amp; Spencer dropped a series of planned television adverts in the July 2011, featuring [[Twiggy]], [[Dannii Minogue]] and [[VV Brown]]  as it started its corporate image revamp. It confirmed that Twiggy, [[Lisa Snowden]] and [[Jamie Redknapp]] would return for future advertising.&lt;ref name="peacock1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8643936/MandS-drops-ad-featuring-Twiggy-Minogue-and-VV-Brown.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Louisa | last=Peacock | title=M&amp;S drops ad featuring Twiggy, Minogue and VV Brown | date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2014, M&amp;S launched the new iteration of its 'Leading Ladies' marketing campaign featuring figures including [[Emma Thompson]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Rita Ora]] and [[Baroness Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1286622/emma-thompson-annie-lennox-rita-ora-unveiled-marks-spencer-leading-ladies/ | title = Emma Thompson, Annie Lennox and Rita Ora unveiled as Marks &amp; Spencer 'Leading Ladies' | publisher = Campaign Live | accessdate = 25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Israel===
Marks &amp; Spencer has been criticised by pro-Palestinian activists over what they claim is its past support for [[Zionism]], and for fruit trading with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boycott-israel.co.uk/business-links/133-marks-and-spencer |title=Boycott Israel Website |publisher=Boycott-israel.co.uk |date=21 September 1941 |accessdate=18 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911025551/http://www.boycott-israel.co.uk/business-links/133-marks-and-spencer |archivedate=11 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A shop in [[Brighton]] was vandalised in 2004 with pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2004/10/299453.html?c=on#c103995 Brighton Activists deface Marks and Spencer store]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company states, "We deal with politicians and officials, in government and opposition. We do not support or align ourselves to political parties and make no political donations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/howwedobusiness/working_with_government Working with Government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604154054/http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/howwedobusiness/working_with_government |date=4 June 2013 }} Marks &amp; Spencer&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comprehensive Spending Review===
{{see also|2010 Spending Review}}
In October 2010, chairman Sir Stuart Rose was a signatory to a controversial letter to ''The Daily Telegraph''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=18 October 2010 Comments |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/8069609/Osbornes-cuts-will-strengthen-Britains-economy-by-allowing-the-private-sector-to-generate-more-jobs.html |title=Osborne’s cuts will strengthen Britain’s economy by allowing the private sector to generate more jobs |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed that "The private sector should be more than capable of generating additional jobs to replace those lost in the public sector, and the redeployment of people to more productive activities will improve economic performance, so generating more employment opportunities", despite recent job cuts of 1,000 staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5455026.ece M&amp;S cuts 1,000 jobs as fashion sales dive], Helen Power and Marcus Leroux, ''The Times'', 6 January 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612031348/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5455026.ece |date=12 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted calls for a boycott of Marks &amp; Spencer and the companies represented by the other signatories to the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberalconspiracy.org/2010/10/24/why-im-boycotting-the-35-businesses-who-support-the-cuts/ |title=Why I’m boycotting the 35 businesses who support the cuts, Kate Belgrave |publisher=Liberalconspiracy.org |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contactless payment issues===
Some Marks &amp; Spencer customers claim that the chain's [[contactless payment]] terminals have taken money from cards other than the ones intended for payment. Contactless cards are supposed to be within about 4&amp;nbsp;cm of the front of the terminal to work. M&amp;S investigated the incident and confirmed the new system had been extensively tested and was robust.

=== Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium ===
[[File:Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts Belgique 1101.jpg|thumb|353x353px|Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]
The Museums’ collections trace the history of the visual arts – painting, sculpture and drawing – from the 15th to the 21st centuries. They preserve the works of the [[Flemish primitives|Flemish Primitives]], of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Jacob Jordaens|Jacques Jordaens]], [[Jacques-Louis David|Jacques Louis David]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[James Ensor]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Paul Delvaux]], [[René Magritte]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Jan Fabre]] and many others. This jewel among Belgium's cultural institutions comprises several entities: the [[Oldmasters Museum|Musée Old Masters Museum]], the Musée Modern Museum, the [[Wiertz Museum|Musée Wiertz Museum]] and the [[Constantin Meunier|Musée Meunier Museum]], the [[Magritte Museum|Musée Magritte Museum]] and the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Musée Fin-de-Siècle Museum]].

Michel Draguet repositioned the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] nationally as well as internationally through a redeployment of the collection focused on the specificity of Belgian creation as well as on the particularity of Belgian reception of European creation.

In 2009, he created the [[Magritte Museum]] with, for the first time in Belgium, a private-public partnership (with [[Engie|GDF-Suez]]) on competencies. The selection of works exhibited in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is constantly expanding with a changing selection of external loans. With the support of Belgian and foreign museums as well as private collectors, works are being made available that have previously never been exhibited. The visitor can thus discover many treasures that are still in private possession. Since its creation, this museum, measuring 2500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has welcomed more than two million visitors and thus contributed to the economic and cultural development of the Belgian capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/ripostes/brandir-l-importance-economique-de-la-culture-pour-la-defendre-544aa05a3570fe7cfbf80d01|title=Brandir l'importance économique de la culture pour la défendre ?|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=2018-05-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magritte Museum]] has already received 8 nominations and prizes. Every year more than 300,000 visitors come here from all over the world to discover the life and the works of [[René Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/uploads/pages/files/magritte_museum_key_figures_2009_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BRX-musée-magritte.3.JPG|alt=Magritte Museum|thumb|277x277px|Magritte Museum]]
In 2013, Michel Draguet inaugurated the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Fin-de-siècle Museum]] as first chapter of a new conception of a museum of Modern Art. Famous visual artists like [[Constantin Meunier]], [[James Ensor]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Léon Spilliaert]] and [[George Minne|Georges Minne]] testify to the effervescent activity of this period, reflected also in all other creative fields: literature, opera, music, architecture, photography and poetry ([[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Émile Verhaeren|Emile Verhaeren]], [[Octave Maus]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Henry van de Velde|Henry Van de Velde]], [[Maurice Kufferath]], [[Guillaume Lekeu]] and others). [[Art Nouveau]] architecture is evoked by means of a 3D reconstruction of six buildings Art Nouveau. This was the first introduction of new technologies inside de Museum. Located at the heart of Brussels, where between 1884 and 1914 the exhibitions of ''Les XX'' and ''La Libre Esthétique'' made the city one of the artistic capitals of the late 19th century, this museum is distinguished by its multidisciplinary nature, through a partnership formed with the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Library]], the [[La Monnaie|Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie]], the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], [[Cinematek]], the [[Bibliotheca Wittockiana]], the [[King Baudouin Foundation]] and the [[Brussels Capital Region]] for housing the Gillion Crowet collection, which is one of the museum's highlights.The [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum]], which was applauded internationally when it opened,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/belgique-bruxelles-s-offre-un-musee-fin-de-siecle-06-12-2013-1765553_3.php&lt;/ref&gt; welcomed 170,000 visitors during its first operating year.

Michel Draguet also initiate a highly popular yet challenging exhibition program from ancient masters to contemporary art mounting up to eight major shows per year. The quality and quantity of this program has been supported by a renewing strategy to the public in its diversity. In this way, Draguet initiate “Museum on measure”: a program dedicated to fragilized public supported by charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.article27.be/IMG/pdf/accompagner_les_publics_socialement_fragilises_au_musees_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the educational services have developed a range of new activities and the social programs have been extended. This is a result of the increase in partnerships between the public and private sectors .

Among the highlights of the programme have been large exhibitions such as “Art Nouveau Bing”, “Rubens in Brussels”, “CoBrA”, “Alechinsky”, “Leon Spilliaert” “Jordaens and Antiquity”, “The Flemish Primitives in  Brussels”, “Andres Serrano”, “Marc Chagall”, “Kandinsky and Europe”, “Symbolism in Belgium” and “Stanley Kubrick Photographer”. Michel Draguet introduced also a wide spectrum of new exhibition formats with from small “cabinet exhibitions” on such artists Pierre Lahaut, [[Jules Schmalzigaug]], [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]], and others. He placed permanent installation of contemporary artist inside the [[Oldmasters Museum|OldMasters]] department like [[David Altmejd]] or [[Jan Fabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/the-collection|title=The collection – Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|website=www.fine-arts-museum.be|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years now, the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]  has been the most popular art institution in Belgium. In 2015, the Museum had its best attended year so far with a total of 767.355 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Visitor-Figures-2015-LO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was accompanied by a significant increase in corporate funding. From 2005 until 2017, the number of visitors has doubled and the turnover tripled, thereby reducing the State contribution from 54.4% of the global budget to 32%. And this has been achieved during a period of very severe budgetary cuts: 11% in 2013 and 2014, 30% for the period 2015-2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/michel-draguet-reconduit-la-direction-des-musees-royaux-des-beaux-arts-de-belgique-132655|title=Michel Draguet reconduit à la direction des Musées royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique - 28 avril 2017 - lejournaldesarts.fr|website=Le Journal Des Arts|language=fr|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online and digital outreach of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is considered as pioneer. In this perspective, Draguet initiated the ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' project which allows members of the public to delve into the works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] († Brussels, 1569). While the artist and his paintings are instantly recognizable worldwide, every composition also depicts a whole host of characters - some surprising, others familiar - and vignettes that provide the subtext of history, which are masterpieces worthy of exploration in their own right.

Drawing on a wide spectrum of virtual and on-site experiences, this unique initiative offers everyone the chance to immerse themselves in Bruegel’s works by honing in on the details of each painting and accessing expert knowledge. By delving deeper into the artist’s world, the viewer will discover the unexpected elements in Bruegel’s works which constitute the pinnacle of the Flemish master’s craft. The [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] launched this project jointly with the [[Google Cultural Institute]] in anticipation of the 450thanniversary of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]’s death, in 2019. The project brings together major international museums, many of which are European, around the focal figure of Bruegel the Elder. This innovative concept is the fruit of in-depth thinking on current transformations in the field of museology as it adapts to the digital era.

The ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' virtual exhibitions' can be accessed on the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]’s interactive screens, on their mobile app and on the [[Google Cultural Institute]] platform.

=== Royal Museums of Art and History ===
[[File:Park of the Cinquantenaire - Royal Museums of Art and History, Brussels, 2010 (HDR 1).jpg|thumb|339x339px|Royal Museums of Art and History of Belgium]]
From 1st August 2010 till 28 February 2014, Michel Draguet was designated temporary Director-General of the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This entity includes the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Museum of Antiquities]], the Museum of Non-European Civilizations, the Museum of the Decorative Arts, the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower, [[Halle Gate]], and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]].

He was charged to manage this institution, which was then in crisis, to overhaul its accounts and structure. Under his leading, the museum put together a restructuring plan that, starting with the merging of the support staff, created enough flexibility to allow modernization of the administrative organizations of both entities – the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]] and [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]].

Michel Draguet initiated a large project of redeployment of both institutions. The home of the former would house collections of a more universalist nature, on the model of the [[Louvre]] and [[British Museum]], and that of the latter would offer a more “national” foundation that broadens to embrace a European dynamic comprising the very future of Brussels as the capital of what is today a common space. From there came the idea of redeploying the collections in accordance with two guidelines: first, to bring the federal collections together in one place; second, to develop theme-based museums that complement rather than compete with one another.

Together the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]] and [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Art and History]] welcome more than 1.1 million visitors a year: this is the equivalent of the population of Brussels. Merged, the two institutions would increase their attractiveness to the public: by reorganizing the presentation of the collections between the different institutions; by creating poles of scientific excellence based on the strong points of the collections; by creating new museum entities that offer a new dimension for marketing the city of Brussels; and by rationalizing the teams and practices employed. For the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], the entities proposed are as follows : a Museum of Non-European Civilizations, which would initially be a world museum through the eyes of Europeans, on the basis of which a new intercultural dialogue could be initiated; a Museum of Antiquities as a platform for the European identity; and a Museum of Music that will broaden the perspectives of the current [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]]. Plus a few heritage assets – the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower and [[Halle Gate]] – which contribute to the attractiveness of the city.

His plan for redeployment of both the collections and personnel that would culminate in the fusion of the two entities was discussed at the Belgian Parliament in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Without initiative from the politics and considering that his Secretary of State was not supporting the reforme led by him and by the Chairman of [[BELSPO|Belspo]] [http://plus.wikimonde.com/wiki/Philippe_Mettens Philippe Mettens], Michel Draguet decided to step down in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml|title=La Chambre des représentants de Belgique|website=www.dekamer.be|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">'''NSCAD conceptual art''' refers to a period beginning in 1969 when [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] (NSCAD), a post-secondary [[art]] school in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] became an important art centre with an international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Barber, "Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973", ''Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973'', Halifax: Anna Leonowens Gallery, 1998, p. 11''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1967, the artist [[Garry Kennedy]] was appointed President, and he immediately moved to remake the College from a provincial art school into an international centre for artistic activity. He invited notable artists to come to NSCAD as visiting artists, particularly those involved in [[conceptual art]]. Artists who made significant contributions during this period include [[Vito Acconci]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Claes Oldenburg]].

==NSCAD University Press==
Under the direction of Kennedy, The Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design was established as a vehicle to publish books by and about leading contemporary artists. The Press was instrumental in establishing the university's international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Garry Neill Kennedy, "NSCAD and the Sixties", ''Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973'', pp. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1972 and 1987, 26 titles by such artists as [[Michael Snow]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Gerhard Richter]] and [[Yvonne Rainer]] were published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1158">'''Necrorealism''' is a Russian art movement primarily focusing on [[black humor]] and [[absurdism|the absurd]]. Russia artist and filmmaker [[Yevgeny Yufit]] (1961–2016) is generally considered the father of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.artforum.com/news/id=65640 |date=29 December 2016 |accessdate=3 January 2017 |title=Eugene Yufit (1961–2016) |publisher=''[[Artforum]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a parody of the term [[Socialist realism]].&lt;ref name="RussArt"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rusartnet.com/russian-artistic-movements/20th-century/modern/nonconformism/necrorealism |title=Necrorealism |access-date=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early Necrorealists included [[Igor Bezrukov]], [[Yevgeniy Kondratiev]], and [[Konstantin Mitenev]]. Their film-making efforts in the 1980s outside of the official Soviet [[State Committee for Cinematography|Goskino State Cinema]] system became known as [[Parallel Cinema (Russia)|Parallel Cinema]]. Necrorealist works often explore the themes of [[death]], [[decomposition|decay]], and the transformation of the body.

{{Culture of New Zealand}}

'''New Zealand art''' consists of the [[visual arts|visual]] and [[plastic arts]] (including architecture, woodwork, textiles, and ceramics) originating from [[New Zealand]]. It comes from different traditions: indigenous [[Māori art]], that of the early European (or [[Pākehā]]) settlers, and later immigrants from Pacific, Asian, and European countries. Owing to New Zealand's geographic isolation, in the past many artists had to leave home in order to make a living. The visual arts flourished in the latter decades of the 20th century as many [[New Zealanders]] became more culturally sophisticated.

==Prehistoric art==

The drawings are estimated to be between 500 and 800 years old, and portray animals, people and fantastic creatures, possibly stylised reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/SRARNZ/logo.html|title=The SRARNZ Logo|publisher=Society for Research on Amphibians and Reptiles in New Zealand|accessdate=2009-02-15}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the birds pictured are extinct, including [[moa]] and [[Haast's eagle]]s.

[[Image:KupeWheke.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Late twentieth century carved house post depicting the navigator [[Kupe]]. Although in an essentially traditional style, this carving was created using metal tools and uses modern paints, creating a form distinct from that of pre-European times.]]{{Further|Māori culture}}
Māori visual art consists primarily of four forms: carving, tattooing (''[[ta moko]]''), weaving, and painting. It was rare for any of these to be purely decorative; traditional Māori art was highly spiritual and in a pre-literate society conveyed information about spiritual matters, ancestry, and other culturally important topics. The creation of art was governed by the rules of [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]. Styles varied from region to region: the style now sometimes seen as 'typical' in fact originates from [[Te Arawa]], who maintained a strong continuity in their artistic traditions thanks partly to early engagement with the tourist industry. Most traditional Māori art was highly stylised and featured motifs such as the spiral, the [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] and the [[koru]]. The colours black, white and red dominated.

===Carving===
{{Main|Whakairo}}
Carving was done in three media: wood, bone, and stone. Arguably ta moko was another form of carving. Wood carvings were used to decorate houses, fencepoles, containers, [[taiaha]] and other objects. The most popular type of stone used in carving was [[pounamu]] (greenstone), a form of [[jade]], but other kinds were also used, especially in the [[North Island]], where pounamu was not widely available. Both stone and bone were used to create jewellery such as the [[hei-tiki]]. Large scale stone face carvings were also sometimes created. The introduction of metal tools by Europeans allowed more intricacy and delicacy, and caused stone and bone fish hooks and other tools to become purely decorative. Carving is traditionally a tapu activity performed by men only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10759246 |title=Janet McAllister: Sacred practice of creating art |work=nzherald.co.nz |accessdate=16 October 2011 |date=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ta moko===
{{Main|Ta moko}}
Ta moko is the art of traditional Māori [[tattooing]], done with a chisel. Men were tattooed on many parts of their bodies, including faces, buttocks and thighs. Women were usually tattooed only on the lips and chin. Moko conveyed a person's ancestry. The art declined in the 19th century following the introduction of Christianity, but in recent decades has undergone a revival. Although modern moko are in traditional styles, most are carried out using modern equipment. Body parts such as the arms, legs and back are popular locations for modern moko, although some are still on the face.

===Weaving===
{{Main|Māori traditional textiles}}
Weaving was used to create numerous things, including wall panels in meeting houses and other important buildings, as well as clothing and bags (kete). While many of these were purely functional, others were true works of art taking hundreds of hours to complete, and often given as gifts to important people. Cloaks in particular could be decorated with feathers and were the mark of an important chief. In pre-European times the main medium for weaving was flax, but following the arrival of Europeans cotton, wool and other textiles were also used, especially in clothing. The extinction and endangerment of many New Zealand birds has made the feather cloak a more difficult item to produce. Weaving was primarily done by women.

===Painting===
Although the oldest forms of Māori art are rock paintings, in 'classical' Māori art, painting was not an important art form. It was mainly used as a minor decoration in meeting houses, in stylised forms such as the [[koru]]. Europeans introduced Māori to their more [[Figurative art|figurative]] style of art, and in the 19th century less stylised depictions of people and plants began to appear on the walls of meeting houses in place of traditional carvings and woven panels. The introduction of European paints also allowed traditional painting to flourish, as brighter and more distinct colours could be produced.

==Explorer art==
[[File:Gilsemans 1642.jpg|thumb|''A view of the Murderers' Bay, as you are at anchor here in 15 fathom'', Isaac Gilsemans, 1642]]
Europeans began producing art in New Zealand as soon as they arrived, with many exploration ships including an artist to record newly discovered places, people, flora and fauna. The first European work of art made in New Zealand was a drawing by [[Isaac Gilsemans]], the artist on [[Abel Tasman]]'s expedition of 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealandInBrief/History/2/ENZ-Resources/Standard/1/en|title=A view of the Murderers’ Bay|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, pp 16-23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MaoriChief1784.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a New Zealand man'', Sydney Parkinson, 1784, probably from a sketch made in 1769.]]
[[Sir Joseph Banks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bea01Bank.html|title=The Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks 1768–1771 (Volume One)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bea02Bank.html|title=The Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks 1768–1771 (Volume Two)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sydney Parkinson]] of Captain [[James Cook]]'s ship [[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]] produced the first realistic depictions of Māori people, New Zealand landscapes, and indigenous flora and fauna in 1769. [[William Hodges]] was the artist on [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS Resolution]] in 1773, and [[John Webber]] on HMS Resolution in 1777. Their works captured the imagination of Europeans and were an influence in the 19th century movement of art towards [[naturalism (arts)|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, pp 23-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook's artists' paintings and descriptions of [[Tā moko|moko]] sparked an interest in the subject in Europe, and led to the [[tattoo]] becoming a tradition of the British Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, p 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century Pākehā art==
Early 19th-century artists were for the most part visitors to New Zealand, not residents. Some, such as James Barry, who painted the [[Ngare Raumati]] chief Rua in 1818, and [[Thomas Kendall]] with the chiefs [[Hongi Hika]] and [[Waikato (chief)|Waikato]] in 1820, did not visit New Zealand at all, instead painting his subjects when they visited Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, pp 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/logicrouter/servlet/LogicRouter?PAGE=object&amp;OUTPUTXSL=object.xsl&amp;pm_RC=REPO03DB&amp;pm_OI=294&amp;pm_GT=Y&amp;pm_IAC=Y&amp;api_1=GET_OBJECT_XML|title=The Rev Thomas Kendall and the Maori chiefs Hongi and Waikato 1820|publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]]|accessdate=2009-03-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105557/http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/logicrouter/servlet/LogicRouter?PAGE=object&amp;OUTPUTXSL=object.xsl&amp;pm_RC=REPO03DB&amp;pm_OI=294&amp;pm_GT=Y&amp;pm_IAC=Y&amp;api_1=GET_OBJECT_XML|archivedate=2008-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Landscape art]] was popular with early colonisers, and prints were widely used to promote settlement in New Zealand. Notable landscape artists included [[Augustus Earle]], who visited New Zealand in 1827-28,&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, pp 52-56, 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?action=null&amp;wid=295|title=A narrative of a nine months' residence in New Zealand in 1827: together with a journal of a residence in Tristan D'Acunha, an island situated between South America and the Cape of Good Hope|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Longman|year=1832|last=Earle|first=Augustus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]], who later became [[Premier of New Zealand|Premier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natlib.govt.nz/collections/highlighted-items/william-fox|title=William Fox - Painter and Premier|publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]]|accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first oil portraits of Māori Chiefs with full [[Tā moko]]  in New Zealand were painted by the portrait artist [[William Beetham]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzportraitgallery.org.nz/whats-on/te-rū-movers-shakers-early-new-zealand-portraits-by-william-beetham&lt;/ref&gt; As colonisation developed a small but derivative art scene began based mostly on landscapes. However the most successful artists of this period, [[C. F. Goldie|Charles Goldie]] and [[Gottfried Lindauer]] were noted primarily for their portraits of Māori. Most notable [[Pākehā]] artists of their period worked in two dimensions; although there was some sculpture this was of limited notability.

[[Photography in New Zealand]] also began at this time and, like painting, initially concentrated mostly on landscape and Māori subjects.

==20th century==
[[Image:Rita Angus, Cass (1936).jpg|thumb|right|''Cass'', painted in 1936, is one of [[Rita Angus]]' best-known landscapes.]]

===Creation of a distinct New Zealand art===
Beginning in the 1930s, many [[Pākehā]] (New Zealanders not of Maori origin, usually of European ancestry) attempted to create a distinctive New Zealand style of art. Many, such as [[Rita Angus]], continued to work on landscapes, with attempts made to depict New Zealand's harsh light. Others appropriate Māori artistic styles; for example [[Gordon Walters]] created many paintings and prints based on the koru. New Zealand's most highly regarded 20th-century artist was [[Colin McCahon]], who attempted to use international styles such as [[cubism]] in New Zealand contexts. His paintings depicted such things as the [[Archangel Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] in the New Zealand countryside. Later works such as the [[Urewera triptych]] engaged with the contemporary [[Māori protest movement]].

===Māori cultural renaissance===
From the early 20th century, politician [[Āpirana Ngata]] fostered a renewal of traditional Māori art forms, for example establishing a school of Māori arts in [[Rotorua]].

===Late 20th and early 21st centuries===
The visual arts flourished in the later decades of the 20th century, with the increased cultural sophistication of many New Zealanders. Many Māori artists became highly successful blending elements of Māori culture with European modernism. [[Ralph Hotere]] was New Zealand's highest selling living artist, but other such as [[Shane Cotton]] and [[Michael Parekowhai]] are also very successful. Many contemporary Maori artists reference ancient myths and cultural practices in their work such as [[Derek Lardelli]], [[Lisa Reihana]], [[Sofia Minson]], [[Te Rongo Kirkwood]], [[Robyn Kahukiwa]], [[Aaron Kereopa]], [[Rangi Kipa]], John Miller, [[Kura Te Waru Rewiri]], [[Tracey Tawhiao]], [[Roi Toia]], [[Shane Hansen]], [[John Bevan Ford]], [[Jennifer Rendall]], [[Todd Couper]], [[Manos Nathan]], [[Wayne Youle]], [[Lyonel Grant]], [[Wi Taepa]] and [[David Teata]].

==Art organisations and museums==
[[Creative New Zealand]] is the national agency for the development of the arts in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/ |title=Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa homepage |work= Creative New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Art Gallery of New Zealand]] was established in 1936, and was amalgamated into the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] in 1992. The [[Auckland Art Gallery]] is New Zealand's largest art institution with a collection numbering over 15,000 works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Auckland Art Gallery|title=Collection overview and policies|url=http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/the-collection/overview-and-policies|work=Auckland Art Gallery website|publisher=Auckland Art Gallery|accessdate=04/07/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including major holdings of New Zealand historic, modern and contemporary art, and outstanding works by Māori and Pacific Island artists.

==Art schools==
New Zealand has three university-based fine art schools: [[Elam School of Fine Arts]] at the [[University of Auckland]] was founded in 1890, the [[University of Canterbury]] school of fine arts founded in 1950 and Massey School of Fine Arts founded in 1885, but was not officially a university institution until 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/1966/A/ArtSchools/en|title=Art Schools - Elam School of Fine Arts|last=A.

[[File:Tiger calf Musei Capitolini MC1222.jpg|thumb|Tigress attacking a calf, marble ''opus sectile''  (325–350 AD) from the [[Basilica of Junius Bassus]] on the [[Esquiline Hill]], Rome]]

'''''Opus sectile''''' is an art technique popularized in the ancient and medieval [[Roman world]] where materials were cut and [[inlay|inlaid]] into walls and floors to make a picture or pattern. Common materials were [[marble]], [[nacre|mother of pearl]], and [[glass]]. The materials were cut in thin pieces, polished, then trimmed further according to a chosen pattern. Unlike [[opus tessellatum|tessellated mosaic]] techniques, where the placement of very small uniformly sized pieces forms a picture, ''opus sectile'' pieces are much larger and can be shaped to define large parts of the design.

==Origin==
[[File:Pannelli di giunio basso 03.1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Biga (chariot)|Two-horse chariot]] bearing the presiding [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] at a ''[[pompa circensis]]'' ("[[ludi circenses|circus]] parade"), from the Basilica of Junius Bassus&lt;ref&gt;Katherine M.D. Dunbabin, "The Victorious Charioteer on Mosaics and Related Monuments," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 86.1 (1982), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although early examples have been found from [[Egypt]] and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], the most prominent artifacts remain from 4th century Rome. A large set from the [[Basilica of Junius Bassus]] survived, depicting an elaborate [[chariot]] and other things. The popularity of ''opus sectile'' decoration continued in Rome through the 6th century, and affected areas as far as [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]] in Turkey).  Particularly remarkable are a series of ''opus sectile'' glass panels, found in a possible sanctuary of Isis at the eastern Corinthian port of Kenchreai, in excavations carried out in the 1960s; they have scenes of famous authors like Homer and Plato, scenes of [[Nilotic landscape]]s, harbour-front cities and geometric panels. Recent work in Jerusalem has recovered enough pieces of floor tile from the Herodian Temple Mount to reconstruct geometric patterns of ''opus sectile'' flooring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/temple-at-jerusalem/what-the-temple-mount-floor-looked-like/?mqsc=E3854622 Frankie Snyder, Gabriel Barkay and Zachi Dvira. 2016. ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', November/December.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later uses==
[[File:Ca' d'oro, cortile 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Cosmatesque pavement, [[Ca' d'Oro]], Venice]]
Although the technique died in Rome with the decline of the Empire, it continued to be used prominently in [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] churches, primarily in floor designs. From Byzantium it was eventually brought back to [[Sicily]] and the Italian mainland, in the 12th century as the [[Cosmatesque]] style, concentrating on geometric patterns.  There was a major revival from the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the form of [[pietra dura]] work, although this normally consists of much smaller compositions and it is used on furniture, mainly.  Architectural work from later periods tends to be called [[Intarsia]].

In England, the technique was revived in the late 19th century by artists working in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. Charles Hardgrave, whose designs were executed by [[James Powell &amp; Sons]] at the Whitefriars Glass Works, was a noted designer in this technique.

'''Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts''', founded in 1996, is a privately run culinary school located just outside the entrance of [[Granville Island]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]. The school is fully accredited by the Private Career Training Institutions Agency of British Columbia until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/program_affiliations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diploma Programs==

The Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts offers [[diplomas]] both in [[Culinary Arts]] and Pastry Arts; each full-time program runs for 6 months. Classes are held 5 days a week, running approximately 7 hours per day for a total of 917 hours. Four sessions per year are offered, starting in September, January, March and June. The classes are 90% hands-on, the chef-student ratio is 1:15 for Culinary Arts &lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/culinary_arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; and 1:12 for Pastry Arts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/baking_pastry_arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; All chef instructors are European-trained and have at least 10 years experience. 

As of September 2010, approximately 2000 students, from Canada and other nations, have graduated from both programs. Applicants do not need to have any prior kitchen experience, but a high school diploma and the ability to read, write and speak English is required.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt; The programs are intended to give students a solid foundation of theoretical and practical training to improve their chances of success in the industry, but they should not expect to go from school directly to an Executive [[Chef]] position.

'''''Panoramic view of the Amstel looking toward Amsterdam''''' is a 17th-century [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]. It is in the collection of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in [[Cambridge]].{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}}

The painting is catalogue number 10 in the 1911 catalogue raisonné by art historian [[Hofstede de Groot]]. He wrote "The river fills much of the right-hand side of the picture. In the centre is a road with several figures; on the river are a raft of timber and a small vessel, from which a gun is being fired. On the left are three windmills, houses, and a bleaching-ground. The town, with its many churches and public buildings, extends in the background. One may distinguish the Westerkerk, the town-hall, the Zuiderkerk, and Oude Kerk, as well as the great synagogue. The blockhouses are not shown."{{sfn|Hofstede de Groot|1911|p=10}} The painting is catalogue number 3 in [[Seymour Slive]]'s 2001 catalogue raisonné of Ruisdael.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}} It is object number 74 in the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://webapps.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/explorer/index.php?qu=ruisdael&amp;oid=1895| title = Panoramic view on the Amstel looking towards Amsterdam|publisher = [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its dimensions are 52.1 cm x 66.1 cm. It is signed in the lower left.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}} Based on the presence of certain buildings Slive estimated that the undated painting was made between 1671 and 1681.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}} Ruisdael lived in Amsterdam at that time.

The drawing that served as a preliminary study for this painting, and a similar one that is in the Philips-de Jongh Collection, is at Leipzig.{{sfn|Slive|2001|p=16}}

'''Patent analysis''' is a family of techniques and tools for studying the information present within and attached to [[patents]], a major form of [[intellectual property]]. 
Although this has traditionally been done using spreadsheet-based [[data analysis]] methods, the field of intellectual property has witnessed a surge in the availability of software-based patent analysis tools.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The cost structure of most patent analysis tools varies from [[freemium]] business models to annual [[subscriptions]].

[[File:Scotland Dunadd 1.jpg|thumb|This footprint (replica&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.heraldscotland.com/revealed-carved-footprint-marking-scotland-s-birth-is-a-replica-1.827928 Revealed: carved footprint marking Scotland's birth is a replica]'', The Herald, 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) carved into the rock on [[Dunadd]], in [[Argyll]], is linked to the crowning of the Scots kings of [[Dál Riata]].]]
A '''petrosomatoglyph''' is a supposed image of parts of a human or animal body in rock.
They occur all over the world, often functioning as   an important form of symbolism, used in religious and secular ceremonies, such as the crowning of kings. Some are regarded as artefacts linked to [[saints]] or [[culture hero]]es.

The word comes from the Greek ''πέτρα&amp;nbsp;– petra'' ("stone"), ''σῶμα&amp;nbsp;– soma'' ("body"), and ''γλύφειν&amp;nbsp;– glyphein'' ("to carve"). Feet are the most common; however, knees, elbows, hands, head, fingers, etc., are also found.

Stylised representations of parts of the body are often open to dispute and are therefore on the fringes of acceptability as identifiable petrosomatoglyphs. Natural objects, such as rock crystals and rock formations which look like petrosomatoglyphs, whole animals, plants, etc., are collectively called "mimeoliths".

==Natural versus man-made petrosomatoglyphs==
Many examples of petrosomatoglyphs are likely to be natural in origin, such as [[rock-cut basin]]s in rivers; however they still have relevance as they have often become associated with Saints, legendary figures, fairies, etc.

Feet are the most common; however, knees, mythological heroes, saints, etc. Some may be man-made but have become a petrosomatoglyph by the original function being forgotten.

A typical example of a possibly re-used concavity is the footprint on [[Dunadd]] which some locals at one time thought was a cast for a bronze axe head.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;[[F. W. L. Thomas|Thomas, F.W.L.]] &amp; Scot, S.A. (1878–79). ''Dunadd, Glassary, Argyllshire''. Proc Soc Antiq. Scot. Vol. 1. - New Series. Pps. 28–47.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[pseudofossil]] of an apparent footprint of a human foot wearing a sandal with a [[trilobite]] fossil in the print has been quoted by anti-evolutionists to show that modern man did walk the earth at this time, around five hundred million years ago. The Burdick Print&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo.cc/paluxy/wilker6.htm |title=The Burdick Print |publisher=Paleo.cc |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or Burdick Track) from [[Glen Rose, Texas]], USA, is claimed by some [[creationists]] to be part of a "giant man track", walking alongside dinosaurs.

==Animal petrosomatoglyphs==

===Dogs===
In the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', the story is told of Culhwch and Olwen, and part of this relates to the hunting by [[King Arthur]] and his knights of the wild boar Twrch Trwyth&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, G. &amp; Jones, T. (1973). ''The Mabinogion''. Everyman Library. {{ISBN|0-460-00097-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with dogs. Cefn Carn Cafall (the ridge of Cafall's cairn) is a mountain near Builth in Breconshire where the footprint of King Arthur's favourite hunting dog, Cafall, is located in a conglomerate boulder on top of the cairn. If taken away, the boulder always mysteriously returns to its position on the cairn.&lt;ref name="Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain"&gt;Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain. (1973).

===Horses===
'''''In Europe: Wales and Cornwall''''' Royal and other horses were sacred to [[Epona]], the horse-goddess. Near Castell Cilan in Gwynedd, North Wales, is a stone embedded in the ground bearing the hoof-print of [[Einion Frenin|King Einion]]'s horse.&lt;ref name=sabi&gt;Baring-Gould, Sabine &amp;&amp;nbsp;al.

Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Close to Llyn Barfog in Wales is a hoof-print&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; etched deep into the rock "Carn March Arthur", or the "Stone of Arthur's Horse", which was supposedly made by King Arthur's mount, [[Llamrai]], when it was hauling the terrible [[Addanc]], or "afanc" monster, from the lake. At the Creiqiau Tylwch near Llangurig [[Oliver Cromwell]] is said to have ridden his horse over the precipitous rocks and left behind a hoof print.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyparishll00lloygoog/historyparishll00lloygoog_djvu.txt Llangurig Parish] Retrieved : 2012-09-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Not far from the Devil's [[Dolmen|Quoit]] in [[St Columb Major|St. Columb]], on the edge of Goss Moor in Cornwall, is a large stone with four deeply impressed marks, known as "King Arthur's Stone". The marks are said to be footprints made by the horse upon which Arthur rode when he resided at [[Castle an Dinas, St Columb|Castle an Dinas]] and hunted on the moors.&lt;ref name="Ralls-MacLeod"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/concepts/folkgazt.htm| title=A Gazetteer of Arthurian Topographic Folklore| accessdate=2006-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Welsh legend has [[King Arthur]] pursuing [[Morgan le Fay]], who turns herself into a stone. Arthur's steed leaps across the [[Bristol Channel]], leaving its hoof-prints on a rock.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;

'''''In Europe: Scotland''''' At Loch Loran in Kilmichael, Argyll and [[Isle of Bute|Bute]], are five flat stones bearing what may be natural markings improved by light pecking. They lie under water near the inlet at the northern end of the loch and can be best seen in dry weather. Two of the markings are called the "[[Fairy]] Footprints", and close behind them are two ovals and several ''V''-hollows suggesting large hoof-prints.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS1964"&gt;*RCAHMS&amp;nbsp;– various reports from the Historic Scotland Canmore website.&lt;/ref&gt; On Loch Etiveside, near [[Ben Cruachan]] in [[Argyll]], is the place named "Horseshoes" indicating the stone by the loch's side where the horse belonging to the son of the winter hag (the Cailleach or Carlin) left its hoof-prints as it leapt across an arm of the sea.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;McKenzie, Donald A. ''Ancient Man in Britain''. Gresham Publishing, London; p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; At Shielhill Bridge near [[Memus]] in [[Angus, Scotland]], a [[Kelpie]]'s cloven hoof mark is to be seen on a stone in the river.&lt;ref name="McHardy"&gt;McHardy, Stuart (1999), ''Scotland: Myth, Legend &amp; Folklore''. Pub. Luath Press, Edinburgh. {{ISBN|0-946487-69-3}} P. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]] in Roxburgh Street is the outline of a horseshoe where the horse of Prince Charles Edward Stuart cast a shoe as he was riding it through the town on his way to Carlisle in 1745.&lt;ref name="Westwood"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A guide to Legendary Britain.'' Pub. Grafton Books. London. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. P. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Fergus [[Clan Barclay|Barclay]], Baron of [[Ardrossan]] was in league with the devil, and in one of his dealings, he set the task of the devil to make ropes from sand; upon failing to do so, Satan kicked the castle with his hoof and left a hoof-print.&lt;ref name="Ardrossan"&gt;Ardrossan &amp; Neighbourhood. Guide. 1920s. P. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; A horse's hoof is carved on a rock at Eggerness in Galloway, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, Daphne (2006). ''Saints and Goddesses : The Interface with Celtic Paganism.'' Whithorn : Friends of the Whithorn Trust. 7th. Whithorn Lecture. page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Europe: England''''' At [[Tedstone Delamere]] in [[Herefordshire]], England, the Sapey Brook runs its course to Upper Sapey. A mare and a colt had been stolen, and the hoof-prints stopped at the bank of the brook. The owner prayed for their safe return and, upon examining the bed of the brook, saw hoof-prints clearly visible in the rocky bottom. These hoof-prints were followed and, the thief caught, the horses being safely recovered. The nearby Hoar Stone is said to be the horse thief petrified for his crimes. A later version involves Saint Catherine of [[Ledbury]] as the owner of the horses.&lt;ref name="Westwood2"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A guide to Legendary Britain.'' Pub. Grafton Books. London. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. P. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Asia''''' A winged horse named El-Buraq, which had the face and breasts of a woman and the tail of a peacock, was tethered for a period of time on the Rock, or foundation stone of the Holy Jewish Temple in [[Israel]], leaving a hoof-print on the Rock. It is said that the hoof print of Muhammad's steed, El Burak, from which he was propelled to heaven, can be seen imprinted in the [[Foundation Stone]] in Jerusalem.

===Other animals===
St Victor Petroglyphs Provincial Park,&lt;ref name="St. Victor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/StVictor |title=St. Victor |publisher=Tpcs.gov.sk.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, features footprint petrosomatoglyphs of bison, deer, elk and antelope.

'''''Cattle'''''  At [[South Lopham]] in [[Norfolk]], England is the Ox-Foot Stone, which previously lay in a meadow still known as the Oxfoot Piece, and bears the supposed imprint of an ox's foot. The legend goes that in a time of great famine, a miraculous cow appeared and provided a never-ending supply of milk to the starving poor. When the famine ceased, the cow struck its hoof against the stone leaving the imprint and then vanished. The stone itself is a flattish slab of sandstone about 60&amp;nbsp;cm x 90&amp;nbsp;cm, likely deposited during the last [[ice age]] as a [[Glacial erratic]], and the 'hoofprint' is probably the imprint of a fossil [[bivalve]]. This part of [[East Anglia]] has virtually no naturally occurring stone (local geology being [[boulder clay]] with flints overlaid on chalk), so the Stone's very existence would have been notable. The stone now stands outside the door of Oxfootstone Farm House.&lt;ref name="Westwood"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A guide to Legendary Britain.'' Pub. Grafton Books. London. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. P. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sacred Celtic bull is said to have left its hoof print in a stone "as if it were the softest wax" in a legend relating to [[Saint Ninian]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, Daphne (2006) ''Saints and Goddesses : The Interface with Celtic Paganism.'' (''7th. Whithorn Lecture.'') Whithorn: Friends of the Whithorn Trust; page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bears''''' In Roseville, [[California]], a bear footprint was carved into one portion of the Northstar stone representative of a bear walking in a docile manner, the back print overlapping with the print of the forepaw. A bear footprint carving is located in Northwestern California. A large carving representing the claw marks of a bear can be seen at Chaw'se, Indian Grinding Rock State Park, near Fiddletown, California. St Victor Petroglyphs Provincial Park,&lt;ref name="St. Victor"/&gt; [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, contains [[grizzly bear]] paw print petroglyphs.

==Mythical and folkloric beings==

===Fairies===
At Loch Loran in Kilmichael, [[Argyll and Bute]], are five flat stones bearing what may be natural markings improved by light pecking. They lie under water near the inlet at the northern end of the loch and can be best seen in dry weather. Two of the markings are called the "Fairy Footprints", being 11" overall, close together, with narrow heels which point across the loch. The left foot has possibly artificially added toes. Close behind are two ovals and several ''V''-hollows suggesting large hoof-prints.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS1964"/&gt; They were not located on a visit in 1970.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} On Wangan Island, one of the [[Penghu]] group between China and [[Taiwan]], are a group of fairy footprints on the top of Tiantai hill. In the very remote Pony Hills, New Mexico, near the desert border with Mexico, are examples of shamanic rock art. The site is located around a spring-fed rock pool. The images depict a variety of spirit forms and also tiny carved footprints—the trail of Water Baby spirits trekking from one pool to another.

===The devil===
At the ruined Kirk of Lady, near Overbister on [[Sanday, Orkney]], are the Devil's Fingermarks, incised as parallel grooves into the parapet of the kirk.&lt;ref name="Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain"/&gt; In [[North Kingstown]] is a large, granite ledge known as Devil's Foot Rock. Legends going back to the colonial era tell of a Native woman being chased by the devil. Some say that she fled from Boston. Her pursuer is said to have left his footprints at Devil's Foot Rock, then at Chimney Hill in South Kingstown, and finally at Block Island.

[[File:Devils claw.jpg|thumb|The devil's talons at [[St Augustine's Abbey|St Pancras chapel, St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury]].&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;Wall, J. Charles (1912), ''Porches and Fonts.'' Pub. Wells Gardner, Darton * Co. London. P. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
At Dol de Bretagne in [[Brittany]] are found the claw mark of the devil on Mont Dol as well as the footprints of [[St. Michael]]. Near [[Holmfirth]] in [[Yorkshire]], the devil left his footprints as scorch marks on Netherton Edge. One day, the devil disguised himself as a [[druid]] in an attempt to gain favour with the old priests but was discovered in his plans and so, in anger, flew out across the hills carrying a great stone with him, which he dropped from the skies, and it landed where the Hood Hill Stone still remains. Also, in anger, he jumped down and stood on the great rock and in doing so, left his footprint impressed upon the stone. The site is at Kilburn, [[Northallerton]], in [[Yorkshire]]. In Lancashire, the devil threw stones at [[Clitheroe]] Castle and left his footprints in Deerstones Quarry near Pendle. At Castle [[Bentheim Castle|Bentheim]] in Germany, there is a curious smooth rock that the devil used as a pillow, leaving behind an imprint of his ear. In [[Cologne]], on a heavy stone called Teufelsstein, are imprinted the hands and talons of the devil. The Lugenstein in the cathedral square at [[Halberstadt]] was carried there by the devil to destroy the cathedral. It was too heavy, and he dropped it, leaving behind an imprint of his red hot thumb.

Sir Fergus Barclay, also known as the De'il of [[Ardrossan]], was a horseman, famous around the lands for his tremendous skill. The secret to his skill, however, was a magical bridle, which was given to Barclay by the devil, in exchange for his soul. However, the devil was tricked by Barclay into giving his soul back. Infuriated by this trickery, the devil attacked the castle in his rage and is said to have left his hoof prints on one of the rocks.

The 'Packstone' is a huge whinstone block to be found at the farm of that name near Muirhead, [[Shotts]]. The story goes that the magician [[Michael Scot]] had relatives in the area and he employed the devil to build a bridge across the [[Firth of Forth]] at [[South Queensferry]] however he fell out with his builder and the devil threw down the 'pack' he was carrying and the marks of his shoulders are still to be seen on the stone.&lt;ref&gt;Grossart, William (1880), ''History of the Parish of Shotts''. Glasgow. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eastern wall of the church of [[Pancras of Rome|Saint Pancras]] in the ancient monastery of [[Saint Augustine]] outside Canterbury is to be seen the imprint of the devil's talons as he was furious that his heathen temple had become a Christian place of worship.&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt; On a coping stone of the Devil's Bridge at [[Kirkby Lonsdale]] in Cumbria are the fingermarks of the devil left behind when in his fury at being tricked out of a soul.&lt;ref name="Westwood17"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain''. London: Grafton Books. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Teufelsschritt Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|left|The Devil's Footstep in the [[Munich Frauenkirche]].]]
At the entrance to the [[Munich Frauenkirche]] church in [[Bavaria]] is located the Devil's Footstep or ''Teufelsschritt.'' This mark in a tile resembles a footprint, which according to legend was where the [[devil]] stood after he had made a deal with the builder to finance construction of the church on the condition that it contain no windows. The builder managed to trick the devil by siting columns so that the windows were not visible from the spot where the devil stood at the entrance. The devil eventually worked out that he had been tricked, however he could not enter a consecrated church and could only stand in the entrance foyer, stamping his foot furiously, leaving the footprint that remains visible in the church's entrance today.

Legend also says the devil then rushed outside and manifested its evil spirit in the wind that furiously rages around the church.&lt;ref name="destination"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frauenkirche| url=http://www.destination-munich.com/frauenkirche.html| publisher= Destination Munich| year=2011| accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giants===
On a natural stone in Cornwall is a foot-shaped impression in a rock in the valley leading to the cliffs and coastal footpath near Chapel Porth. It is said to be the foot mark of [[Giant Bolster]] of [[St Agnes, Cornwall|St Agnes]] legend. Just below the formation, there used to be a Holy Well dedicated to St Agnes, but it dried up due to the mining in the area. Footprints at North Yell, up Hena, in Shetland were thought to be lost&lt;ref name="Breeze1997"&gt;Breeze, David &amp; Munro, Graeme (1997). ''The Stone of Destiny. Symbol of Nationhood''. Historic Scotland. {{ISBN|1-900168-44-8}}. Pps. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt; but were rediscovered in 1969 by the ordnance survey. The footprint, 12" by 4", is known locally as the "Wartie" and was used to wash in dew or rainwater, and standing in it was supposed to get rid of warts. In legend, it was made by a giant placing one foot here and the other on the Westing of [[Unst]]. In Bristol, the giants Vincent and Goram dug the Avon gorge and left their footprints. Moso's Footprint in [[Samoa]] was made when the giant Moso stepped over to Samoa from [[Fiji]], and the other footprint can be found on Viti Levu of Fiji. It is a 1&amp;nbsp;m by 3&amp;nbsp;m rock enclosure. At the foot of the Doa mountain in Vietnam, towards the west, is a big rock. There are two human footprints on the rock. It is said that the footprints belonged to a giant who used to help the villagers with the construction of their houses. One of the footprints has been damaged. At [[Arthur's Stone, Herefordshire|Arthur's Stone]] chambered tomb in Herefordshire is a "cup mark" stone which bears the imprints of a giant's (or king's) elbow, left behind after he fell dead to the ground, killed by King Arthur.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin (1988).

==Religious leaders, patriarchs and saints==

===Adam===
The ''Sri Pada'' footprint in the rock atop [[Adam's Peak]], [[Sri Lanka]] is attributed to [[Adam]] by Christians and Muslims.

===Abraham===
The ''Maqām Ibrāhīm'' ("Abraham's place of standing") is a rock kept in a crystal dome next to the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] in Mecca. The footprint in it is believed, by Muslim tradition, to have been made by [[Islamic view of Abraham|Abraham]] when he was lifting stone blocks to build the Ka'bah.

===Archangel Gabriel===
In Islamic tradition, the [[Foundation Stone]] is where Muhammad ascended to heaven, and during this ascension, the rock itself started to rise at the southern end but was held down by the Archangel Gabriel, and some marks on the western side of the rock are said to be the fingerprints of Gabriel.

===The Buddha===

The footprints of the Buddha abound throughout Asia, dating from various periods.&lt;ref name="Strong_087"&gt;{{cite book | title = Relics of the Buddha (Buddhisms: A Princeton University Press Series) | first = John S. | last = Strong | isbn = 0-691-11764-0 | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | year = 2004 | page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese author {{nihongo|Motoji Niwa|丹羽基二|Niwa Motoji}}, who spent years tracking down the footprints in many Asian countries, estimates that he found more than 3,000 such footprints, among them about 300 in [[Japan]] and more than 1,000 in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=Niwa_009&gt;{{cite book |title=Zusetsu sekai no bussokuseki: bussokuseki kara mita Bukkyō |script-title=ja:''図説世界の仏足石: 仏足石から見た仏教'' |trans-title=Buddha's footprints, pictures and explanations: Buddhism as seen through the footprints of Buddha | publisher = Meicho Shuppan | language = Japanese, English | year = 1992 | page= 5 | first = Motoji | last = Niwa | isbn = 4-626-01432-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They often bear distinguishing marks, such as a [[Dharmachakra]] at the centre of the sole, or the 32, 108 or 132 auspicious signs of the Buddha, engraved or painted on the sole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Footprints of the Buddha | publisher = Buddha Dharma Education Association Inc | url = http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/b_feet.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-11 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist legend holds that during his lifetime the Buddha flew to Sri Lanka and left his footprint on [[Adam's Peak]] to indicate the importance of Sri Lanka as the perpetuator of his teachings, and also left footprints in all lands where his teachings would be acknowledged.&lt;ref name=Stratton_301/&gt; In [[Thailand]], the most important of these "natural" footprints imbedded in rock is at [[Wat Phra Phutthabat|Phra Phutthabat]] in Central Thailand.&lt;ref name=Stratton_301/&gt; In [[China]], during [[Tang Dynasty]], the discovery of a large footprint of the Buddha in [[Chengzhou]] caused Empress [[Wu Zetian]] to inaugurate a new reign name in that year, 701 CE, starting the Dazu (Big Foot) era.&lt;ref name="Strong_087"/&gt;

===Jesus===
[[File:I piedi del quo vadis.jpg|thumb|According to legend, these impressions are a copy of the footprints of [[Jesus]] at the [[Church of Domine Quo Vadis]], Rome.]]

At the Chapel of the Ascension&lt;ref name="Ascension"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-chapel-of-ascension.htm |title=Chapel of the Ascension |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jerusalem]], there are a pair of footprints reputed to be those of [[Jesus]] made at the time of his [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] into [[heaven]]. These are sometimes shown in medieval depictions of the [[Ascension of Jesus in Christian art|Ascension in art]].

The church of [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Saint Sebastian Outside the Walls]] in Rome houses a stone which, according to tradition, bears the footprints of Jesus when he appeared to [[Saint Peter]] on the [[Appian Way]]. A copy of these footprints is preserved, as an [[ex voto]] offering, at the [[Church of Domine Quo Vadis]], the chapel marking the traditional spot of Jesus' appearance to Peter.

[[Henry III of England]] was given a piece of white marble which allegedly carried a trace of one of Jesus' feet, which he had left as a souvenir to his [[apostles]] after his Ascension. Henry gave this [[relic]] to [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref Name="Jusserland"&gt;Jusserand, Jean Jules (1888) ''English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages''; trans. L. T. Smith. London: T. Fisher Unwin; p. 327–328&lt;/ref&gt; This may simply have been a votive copy of the footprint in the Chapel of the Ascension.

===Mary, the mother of Jesus===
In [[Wales]], the knees and breasts of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] are said to be imprinted on a rock beside her well at Ffynnon Fair, [[Llanfair, Gwynedd|Llanfair]], between [[Barmouth]] and [[Harlech]] in [[Gwynedd]]. Marks said to be her footprint and thumb-print are to be found nearby. Two other Mary footprints are recorded in the vicinity at Llan Maria (St. Mary) near [[Llanbedr]], and Wenallt Hill at Llanaber.&lt;ref name="Bord2004"/&gt;

At [[Pochayiv Lavra]] in western [[Ukraine]], there is a footprint which by tradition was left in the stone by the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) after her miraculous [[Marian apparition|appearance]] to two [[monk]]s in the 15th century. A spring of water which is believed to have miraculous powers flows from the footprint to this day.

===Muhammad===
At the Qubbat al-Sanaya (the Dome of the Front Teeth) the mark made by the [[Muhammad]]'s tooth is to be found on a stone in a wall. Muhammad was attacked and lost a tooth during the incident. A mark on a stone wall is said to have been made when the tooth fell. Muhammad's footprints are (by Islamic tradition) found in numerous places, such as the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], in [[Damascus]], and in [[mosques]] in [[West Bengal]], [[Bangladesh]] and Gudjarat.&lt;ref name="Bord2004"&gt;Bord, Janet (2004).

Heart of Albion Press. {{ISBN|1-872883-73-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the hoof print of Muhammad's steed [[Buraq|al-Burāq]], upon which he was propelled to heaven, can be seen imprinted in the [[Foundation Stone]].

===Rama===
The footprint in the rock at [[Hampi]] is attributed to that of [[Rama]].

===Shiva===
The ''Sri Pada'' footprint in the rock atop [[Adam's Peak]], [[Sri Lanka]] is attributed to that of [[Shiva]] by Hindus (and the Buddha by Buddhists).

===Footprints===
[[File:Columbafootprints.jpg|left|thumb|Footprints of [[Columba|Saint Columba]] at Belmont, Londonderry Road, [[Ireland]]]]

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were accustomed to carve pairs of footprints on a stone with the inscription ''pro itu et reditu'', "for the journey and return".&lt;ref name="Pennick199640"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; They used them for protective rites on leaving for a journey and for thanksgiving for a safe return, when the traveler would place his feet in the footprints to mark the beginning or end of the undertaking. This same story is told of King Maelgwn of [[Gwynedd]] in [[North Wales]], who placed his feet in carved footprints to ensure his safe return from a pilgrimage to Rome.

In northern Europe, rock footprints were closely associated with Kingship or Chieftainship. [[Saxo Grammaticus]] notes that "The ancients, when they came to choose a King, stood on stones planted in the ground to proclaim their votes, signifying from the steadfastness of the stones that the deed would be lasting."

Standing on a special stone is a link between the king and the land from which his people earned their food. Links with King Arthur and "The Sword in the Stone" may be relevant in this context of kingship, a right to power over his subjects and links with nature. A similar idea seems to be associated with the [[Moot hill]], or Boot Hill, at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], for the latter name comes from an ancient tradition whereby emissaries swore fealty to their king by wearing the earth of their own lands in their foot-bindings or boots.&lt;ref name="Boot"&gt;[http://www.scone-palace.net/palace/moothill.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807151718/http://www.scone-palace.net/palace/moothill.cfm |date=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper echelons of the clergy of the Celtic Church were drawn from the nobility; indeed, even some kings retired to become monks and eventually even saints, as in the case of [[Constantine of Cornwall|King Constantine]] of [[Cornwall]], who retired to [[Govan]] on the Clyde in Scotland. This meant that the association of stone footprints was also made with the saints, bishops and others.

The poet [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] states that the custom amongst the Irish was to place the man who is to be chief upon a stone, always reserved for that purpose alone and located on a hill. Some of these had a footprint cut into them which was the size and shape of the candidate's. The oath was taken with the foot in the footprint, the individual swearing that as chief he would preserve all the ancient customs and respect the laws of royal inheritance.

A ''Locus terribilis'' is a sacred place into which only a divine or sacred person could enter. Petrosomatoglyph footprints for the ordination of kings would be an example, for it was believed that only the rightful king was able to use them for the purpose that they were intended.&lt;ref name="Pennick134"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Footprints may also have to do with the cult of the ancestors, whose spirits dwell in the stone, so that a newly invested King would have received the luck or mana of his predecessors through contact with it.&lt;ref name="Westwood180"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain''. London: Grafton Books. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

Footprints have been found in Sweden, Denmark, Italy, [[Sri Lanka]] (Adam's Foot), and [[Uganda]].

Close to St. Olann's Well at Coolineagh, near [[Coachford]], [[County Cork]], are the footprints of St. Olann on a boulder. In the garden of Belmont, on the Greencastle Road, about a mile from Derry, there was, in 1837, a block called St. Columba's Stone with two footprints on it. It may have been the inauguration stone of the Kings of Aileach, brought here by the local Chief of Derry.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; On the [[Clare Hills]] in Ireland, on the Gort to Feakle road in the townland of Drumandoora, is the engraved outline or impression of a foot clothed by a sandal. On the Hill of Lech, or, previously, Mullach Leaght, the "Hill of the Stone", three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Monaghan]] in Ireland, was the inauguration stone of the Mac Mahons. It was used in 1595 and destroyed by a farm owner in 1809.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;
At [[Clonmacnoise]], [[County Offaly]], Ireland, close to the Chapel of Clonfinlough. there are several limestone boulders, one of which is called the Fairy's or Horseman's Stone.  It has many cup-shaped hollows, crosses, daggers, and a pair of human feet. At [[Templemore]] in [[County Londonderry]] is a slab named St. Columbkille's Stone.  It has the imprint of two feet, each ten inches (254&amp;nbsp;mm) in length. Traditionally, it was the inauguration stone of the ancient Irish chieftains.&lt;ref name="Bord1976"&gt;Bord, Janet &amp; Colin (1976). ''The Secret Country''. Pub.

A set of [[Jesus]]'s footprints, according to legend, are preserved at the [[Church of Domine Quo Vadis]] outside of Rome. In [[Buddhist symbolism]], a ''Buddhapada'' ([[Buddha footprint|footprint]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]) with [[Dharmacakra]] and [[Triratna]] symbols from the 1st century is to be found at [[Gandhāra]], Northern Pakistan.

Sweden's rich flora of petroglyphs include many hundred footprints, singles and in pairs.

On [[Sri Pada]], or Adam's Peak, a mountain in [[Sri Lanka]], is a footprint mark said by Buddhists to be that of the left foot of the Buddha, the right footprint being in a city about 150 kilometres distant, or at Phra Sat in [[Thailand]]. [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Hindus]] consider it to be the footprint of [[Shiva]]. Some [[Muslim]]s and Christians ascribe it to [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], where Adam the "first ancestor" is said to have set foot as he was exiled from the [[Garden of Eden]]. Sometimes Christians ascribe it to [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]], the "Apostle of India". Footprints of the Buddha also exist in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Maldives]], Pakistan, [[Singapore]], and [[Burma]]. The St. Victor's Petroglyphs in [[Provincial Park]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], feature human footprints.

A human-like footprint in volcanic ash was discovered in 1970 during the construction of the [[Demirköprü Dam]] in Turkey. The ash was dated as having been deposited about 250,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnaby|first=Wendy|title=International News 'picture story'|journal=Nature|date=April 17, 1975|volume=254|issue=5501|page=553|doi=10.1038/254553a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tradition of body-part impressions at holy wells, rivers and beneath waterfalls comes from the fact that Celtic monks or [[culdee]]s often prayed in such places, continuing the veneration of the [[Druid]]s for sacred water. Folk belief ascribes healing powers to waters taken from these holy impressions, and this water was used to cure sickness, wounds and sores, as well as preventing or curing sickness in animals such as cattle.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996"/&gt;

At Llangynnlo in Wales are Olgliniau Cynllo, the knee prints of King Cynllo at prayer. At Troedraur in [[Dyfed]], South Wales are the knee-marks of St. Gwyndaf Hen impressed on a flat rock in the bed of the River Ceri.&lt;ref name="Pennick199641"/&gt; These are 'pot holes' or [[Rock-cut basin]]s made by the grinding effect of stone in the river currents to the sceptics. St Cynwyl in the river at [[Caio, Carmarthenshire|Caio]] in Wales. St. Beuno at Llanaelhaiarn in Wales. At Arthur's Stone chambered tomb in Hereford &amp; Worcester is a cup-mark stone which bears the imprints of [[King Arthur]]'s knees left behind after he prayed to God in thanks for victory over a giant (or king) whom he had killed and whose tomb this is.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt; At Llanllyfni in Wales are the knee prints of St. Gredfyw.&lt;ref name="Pennick199641"/&gt;

John O'Donovan, in his Ordnance Survey Letters of 1840, tells the story of [[Saint Moling]] crossing a small hill in the [[County Wexford]] district, when an evil spirit annoyed him. He knelt on a rock to curse the spirit, leaving the impression of his knees on the stone. While there is no account of the stone today, it is said that the incident gave the name to the townland Cloch na Mallacht, i.e. "the stones of the curses", linking the episode to [[Bullaun]] stones which often contain cursing stones.

Near [[St Fillan's Kirk, Seat and Well|St Fillan's Kirk]] in [[Renfrewshire]] there is recorded a large flat rock called the 'Kneelins Stane' that had three depressions, two made by the knees of pilgrims and the third made by their staffs.

===Hands and arms===

[[File:YMBB Petrosomatoglyph.jpg|thumb|Petrosomatoglyphs in cement at [[Spier's school]]]]

A diminutive pair of hands are carved on a boulder beside the Crinan Canal in Argyll.&lt;ref name="Hadingham"&gt;Hadingham, Evan (1974). ''Ancient Carvings in Britain: A Mystery''. Garnstone Press. {{ISBN|0-85511-391-X}}. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The St. Victor's Petroglyphs Provincial Park, in Saskatchewan, Canada, feature hand-prints. From Waldenbuch in Germany is a four-sided stone pillar with scroll carving and a left arm and hand.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;Powell, T.G.E. (1966). ''Prehistoric Art''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-20046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Oberhasli]] on the road to [[Gadmen]] near [[Meiringen]] in Switzerland is the Sterbensstein, a rock with the impression of a hand and several fingers left by a dying man after he had been attacked. Near [[Minden]] in the Geismarwald on the Totenberg in Germany, an army leader who before a battle in the [[Thirty Years' War]] declared that he had as much chance of winning as he had of the stone becoming soft. It did, and his foot- and hand-prints are still there to be seen by all.

A carved left hand is to be found on the wall of the Decorated Hall in the [[Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni]] on [[Malta]]. It measures 8¼" by 4".&lt;ref name="Agius"&gt;Agius, A.J. ''The Hypogeum at Hal-Saflieni''. Freedom Press. Malta. p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; At Arthur's Stone chambered tomb in Hereford and Worcester is a "cup mark" stone which bears the imprints of a king's or giant's elbow, left behind after he fell dead to the ground, killed by King Arthur.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt; The Petroglyph National Monument has an estimated 20,000 carved images, including many of hands. These images are inseparable from the cultural landscape, the spirits of the people who created and who appreciate them. At Barnakill near Dunardy in Argyll is a stone bearing two hand prints. The hands appear to have a covering; one may be the back of the hand having interesting designs, the other being the palm with some faint markings.&lt;ref name="Proc Soc"&gt;Proc. Sco. Antiq. Scot. Vol. XCVII. 1963–1964. p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Llanllyfni in Wales is the thumb print of St. Gredfyw.&lt;ref name="Pennick199641"/&gt; Near [[Strathpeffer]] in Scotland is the finger and thumb print of a dwarf associate of Finn Mac Cuill on an old gate post near to the [[Pictish Eagle Stone]].&lt;ref name="McHardy1"&gt;McHardy, Stuart (1999), ''Scotland: Myth, Legend &amp; Folklore''. Pub. Luath Press, Edinburgh. {{ISBN|0-946487-69-3}} p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Argyll and Bute, Kilneuair's kirk has inside, to the east of the nave door, a sandstone block bearing a now almost invisible five-toed print with nails on three of the toes and which is referred to as 'the Devil's hand'. The story goes that a local tailor did not believe in the Devil and [[Devil in Christianity#Christian tradition|Old Nick]] appeared as a skeleton just missing the man and scratching the wall with his bone hand.&lt;ref&gt;Pallister, Marian (2007). ''Argyll Curiosities''. Edinburgh : Birlinn. {{ISBN|978-1-84158-531-4}}. Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eyes===
At St. Mary's Church in Newchurch-in-Pendle, an eye is carved on the tower, said to be the all-seeing eye of God. Local tradition says that it was originally placed there to protect the worshippers from the witches who once plagued the district.&lt;ref name="Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain"/&gt; In [[Almería]], Spain, is a carved limestone pillar with eyes or the oculos / oculi motif. The eyes have eyebrows and/or accentuating arcs. An "eye goddess" may have existed as shown by many other examples of carved oculi.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt; The Folkton "drums" are made of chalk and are elaborately carved, with distinct oculi or eyes.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;  [[Petrosphere]]s or carved stone balls from Scotland, especially the Aberdeen area, often have concentric carved lines, some of which appear to be stylised oculi.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt; Pecked carvings of "eyebrows" are found on a lintel inside Holm of [[Papa Westray]] south chambered cairn, Orkney. They are similar to the 'owlish' eyes and eyebrows carved on the Folkton Drums.&lt;ref name="Sharp1994"&gt;Sharp, Mick (1994). ''A land of Gods and Giants''. Frazer Stewart Books. {{ISBN|1-85648-214-6}}. P. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The Food-vessel peoples at the [[Treneglos#Tregulland Burrow|Tregulland barrow]] near [[Bodmin moor]] in Cornwall had placed slate slabs around the central burial bearing circular pecked hollows resembling oculi, presumably having a protective function for the person buried within.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;Fox, Aileen (1973).

The Celts are well known for their cult of the "severed head" of which many examples exist as three-dimensional carvings or sculptures. Petrosomatoglyphs are much rarer. Pump Sant Stone near Carmarthen in Wales has the imprint in it of the heads of the five saints, named Ceitho, Celynnin, Gwyn, Gwyno and Gwynoro. The stone is made of [[Diorite]], a very hard stone brought from another district. It stands on a mound facing the Ogofau Lodge of [[Dolaucothi]] House, near to the Roman [[Gold]] Mines. It has depressions on all four faces characteristic of the wear produced from crushing quartz.&lt;ref name="An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire"&gt;''An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire''. V. County of Carmarthen. (1917). Roy. Com. Anc. Hist. Monu. Const. in Wales &amp; Mon. P. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serpent Stone from a Roman cemetery in Maryport in [[Cumbria]] has a Celtic severed head wearing a torc carved on the top of a phallic-shaped pillar. On the back is a carving of a serpent.&lt;ref name="Sharp1997"/&gt; At Tarren Deusant, [[Llantrisant]] in Mid-Glamorgan is a pagan site with two heads originally carved, showing incised eyebrows and slit mouths characteristic of some Celtic cult heads. Six other heads have been carved since 1696, when they were first recorded.&lt;ref name="Sharp1997"/&gt; The Husjatyn god-pillar from the River Zbrucz in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], Poland, has several heads carved on its four sides, together with images of horses, people and weapons.&lt;ref name="Pennick1997"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1997).

The pillar came from the Celtic sanctuary which was destroyed by the Romans in 124 BC.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Piggott"&gt;Piggott, Stuart 1985. ''The Druids''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-27363-4}} P. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; At Alderly Edge, [[Cheshire]], England, is the face of [[Merlin]] carved into the native rock face of a crag.&lt;ref name="Matthews"&gt;Matthews, John (2004).

Two carved stone heads are located at Chapelhall House, [[Innellan]], Argyll. One resembles a Celtic stone head and may indeed be one, the other is more likely to have been a corbel in the early medieval chapel that lay nearby.&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;Atkinson John A. (2000) Excavation of 10th-century burials at Chapelhall, [[Innellan]], Argyll, 1994. P.S.A.S. 130, P. 651–676.&lt;/ref&gt; St. Aid, or [[Áed mac Bricc]], was Bishop of Killare in the 6th century. At Saint Aid's birth, his head had hit a stone, leaving a hole that collected rainwater that cured all ailments, thus linking it with the Irish tradition of [[Bullaun]] stones.&lt;ref name="Hasenfratz"&gt;Isler H, Hasenfratz H, O'Neill T.

Saint Aid or [[Áed mac Bricc]] was Bishop of Killare in 6th-century. At Saint Aid's birth his head had hit a stone, leaving a petrosomatoglyph type hole in which collected rainwater that cured all ailments, identifying it also with the Irish tradition of [[Bullaun]] stones and possible links to cup and ring mark stones.&lt;ref name="Hasenfratz"&gt;Isler H, Hasenfratz H, O'Neill T.

===The female form and reproductive structures===
[[File:Menantol5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mên-an-Tol]], [[Cornwall]], [[UK]]]]

It has been stated that many of the signs or symbols which accompany maze or geometric patterns from sites such as [[Newgrange]] in Ireland are identifiable or interpretable as human, the womb (lens symbol), the pubic area (lozenge symbol), fallopian horns (ram's horns), the female form (hour-glass symbol), breasts (''w'' or omega symbol), etc. The [[vesica piscis]] shape as found on the lid of the [[Chalice Well]] at [[Glastonbury]] includes an almond- or lozenge-shaped central area that is seen as a possible representation of the female genitals. Meehan&lt;ref name="Meehan"&gt;Meehan, Aidan (1996). ''Celtic design. Maze Patterns''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-27747-8}} Pps. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; does not, however, clearly indicate his sources for these interpretations.

In the gallery-grave of Kerguntuil at Tregastel in [[Brittany]] are nine pairs of breasts above engraved necklaces.&lt;ref&gt;Giot, Pierre R. (1990). ''Menhirs and Dolmens''. {{ISBN|978-2-85543-003-4}}. Page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barclodiad y Gawres]] is a passage-grave on [[Anglesey]] with its internal surfaces decorated with lozenges, chevrons, wavy lines and spirals. The whole tomb has been likened to a womb, that of the [[Mother Goddess]]. These symbols are also commonly used in passage graves found in Ireland and [[Brittany]]. Triangular stones are sometimes regarded as being representations of the female sexual organs or overall body shape.&lt;ref name="Sharp1994"/&gt; At Boscawen un stone circle in Cornwall, a leaning central standing stone and a large white [[quartz]] boulder may represent the male and female elements of nature.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt; At [[Carn Euny]] Iron Age village in Cornwall is a [[fogou]] which may represent the womb of the Great Earth Mother.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt;

At Avebury and West Kennet Avenue in [[Wiltshire]], the tall pillar and "broad diamond shape" stones were used alternately in the stone circles, possibly symbolising males and females at this famous [[Paganism|pagan]] ritual site.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt; [[Stoney Littleton Long Barrow]] near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] has been likened to a "womb-tomb" of the Great Goddess who awaited the return of the sun.

Tolmen stones, such as the example on the North Teign river on [[Dartmoor]], England, are said to derive their name from the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''tol'' ("hole") and ''maen'' ("stone") and were thought to have been used by [[Druid]]s for purification and that the wrongdoer was lowered through into the water for lustration, a purification rite or cleansing ritual.&lt;ref name="tolmen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/tolmen.htm |title=Druids and bullauns |publisher=Legendarydartmoor.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rock-cut basin|hole]] in the stone represented the female birth canal in the Druid or pagan mind, and by passing through it, a person was symbolising the act of rebirth and therefore regaining innocence or being cleansed of post-[[Childbirth|parturition]] illness, etc.&lt;ref name="rebirth"&gt;Tuck, C. (2003).''Landscapes and Desire''. Pub. Sutton. Stroud.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male reproductive structures===
[[File:Hampi lingas.jpg|thumb|Thousand [[Shivalinga]]s at [[Hampi]] in india.|right|300px]]
[[File:Chesterspetro.jpg|thumb|Phallic Petrosomatoglyph, [[Cilurnum]] Roman Fort, [[Chesters (Humshaugh)]], [[Scotland]]]]

[[Shivalinga]] is carved in [[List of Shiva temples in India|numerous Hindu temples]] across [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|southeast asia]], including in [[Angkor Wat]], [[List of rock-cut temples in India|rock-cut temples in India]] such as [[Aihole]], [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Amarnath Temple]], [[Badami cave temples]], [[Ellora Caves]], [[Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple]], [[Hampi]], [[Hulimavu Shiva cave temple]], [[Mahabalipuram]], [[Masroor Rock Cut Temple]], [[Udaygiri Caves]], [[Vaishno Devi]], etc.

Many references have been made to the obviously [[phallic]] appearance of standing stones. It is suggested that they may serve as stylised representations of the phallus, the purpose of which is to magically enhance the fertility of humans, animals and crops.&lt;ref name="Sharp1994"/&gt; A number of practices which are supposed to give fertility to barren women are linked to standing stones throughout Europe. At Avebury and West Kennet Avenue in [[Wiltshire]], the tall pillar and broad diamond shape stones were used alternately in the stone circles, possibly symbolising males and females at these famous [[Paganism|pagan]] ritual sites. At [[Boscawen un]] stone circle in Cornwall, a leaning central standing stone and a large white [[quartz]] boulder may represent the male and female elements of nature.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt; The [[Maypole]] is often considered a phallic symbol, coinciding with the worship of Germanic phallic figures such as that of [[Freyr]].

Phallic fertility symbols were carved for good luck, and they were also a powerful antagonist to the evil eye. The Romans regularly carved them onto military buildings, and [[Hadrian's Wall]] has several at [[Chesters]] and [[Housesteads]] forts. One at Barcombe Hill shows a crude phallus and testicles with the legs of a chicken.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, Frank (1990), ''Hadrian's Wall in the Days of the Romans.'' Pub. Frank Graham. {{ISBN|0-85983-177-9}}. P.230.&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal, phalli are represented together with cup-marks, zig-zags, straggly-lines, etc., on the ninety or so stones of the 4000-year-old ''Cromeleque dos Almendres'' near [[Évora]].&lt;ref name="Cope"&gt;Cope, Julian (2004) ''The Negalithic European''. Pub. Element. London. {{ISBN|0-00-713802-4}}. P. 412–413.&lt;/ref&gt; At Valhaugen in Norway a realistic representation of a phallus has been found and restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=a312&amp;file=index&amp;do=showpic&amp;pid=49383 |title=Valhaugen |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple body parts===
At Portpatrick on the Island of [[St. Kilda, Scotland|St. Kilda]], there is the impression of a pair of knees and a right hand, said to be those of [[St. Patrick]] in the posture of prayer. In Cornwall, St. Newlyna knelt on a stone and left the impression of her elbows and knees in the posture of prayer. At Llanllyfni are found stones with the knee-prints, thumb and bed of St. Gredfyw. Medicine Rock in the USA was located on a hill fifteen miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Gettysburg, South Dakota|Gettysburg]], near the mouth of the Cheyenne Creek. Indians considered it to be a sacred rock and visited it regularly. Five footprints, hand prints and animal prints were originally visible, made by the [[Great Spirit]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].

==Recent and modern petrosomatoglyphs==
[[File:Georgemarsh Footprint2.jpg|left|thumb|This footprint is said to be made by Protestant martyr [[George Marsh (martyr)|George Marsh]].]]

Located at [[Smithills Hall]], near [[Bolton]] in [[Lancashire]], is the impressed footprint at the bottom of a set of stairs of [[George Marsh (martyr)|George Marsh]], a [[Protestant]] martyr. In 1555, Marsh was interrogated at Smithills Hall and then taken to [[Boughton, Cheshire|Boughton in Cheshire]] and burnt at the stake for the sake of his faith. It is said that the footprint is a [[divinity|divine]] reminder of this unjust persecution and murder.&lt;ref name="Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain"/&gt;

[[File:Handprints.jpg|thumb|Handprints made in wet [[concrete]]]]
Often, impressions of hands are made in concrete to commemorate the famous as at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]] (USA) on pavement slabs or in wet concrete. Making footprints in stone of family members is part of [[New Age]] beliefs.

In [[Sarajevo]], there is a preserved square of footpath or pavement asphalt with two shoe prints which are believed to be those of [[Gavrilo Princip]], made as he waited for the arrival of the motorcade of the Austrian [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]] in June 1914.  The Archduke's assassination precipitated the start of [[World War I|the Great War]].

[[Image:Platform Artists Group Inc.jpg|thumbnail|Platform Artists Group Inc. [[Campbell Arcade]]]]
'''Platform Artists Group Inc.''', commonly known as '''Platform''', is Australia's longest operating [[artist-run initiative]]. The organisation develops exhibitions of [[visual arts]] by  artists from Australia and around the world. Platform primarily consists of 3 separate spaces, all located in and under the busy [[Flinders Lane]] precinct in the heart of [[Melbourne]] city.

Most of the activities of Platform are located in the [[Campbell Arcade]] subway under [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]] in Melbourne. A pedestrian poll conducted in 2005 by [[Connex Melbourne|Connex]] estimated that more than 35,000 people a week pass through the Platform exhibition sites, making it one of the most visible sites for public art in Melbourne.

Platform provides support for many young artists by enabling them to present solo exhibitions and the organisation often debuts artists to the general public. In its 23 years of operation, Platform has presented new work from more than 2,500 artists. Many have established successful art careers and have become well-respected professional artists. Many exhibiting artists are now featured in major Australian and international public art collections and several have represented Australia at the Venice Biennale.

== History of Platform Artists Group Inc. ==

Founded in 1990 by artists Andrew Seward and Richard Holt, Platform's first location was a collection of glass display cases in the old [[Southern Cross railway station|Spencer Street station]] pedestrian underpass. In 1995, the [[City of Melbourne]] offered the group another underground space, Campbell Arcade, a subway located under Flinders Street and connecting [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] to [[Degraves Street]]. The late [[Art deco]]-style arcade was opened on 31 August 1955 and features black marble columns and pink-tiled walls lined with glass display cases. Platform expanded the exhibition program into this second space, running group and solo exhibitions at both the city's major train stations.

In 2000, Platform Artists Group further expanded the organisation into a subway shop they named Sticky. Promoting and selling [[Artist books]] and [[Zines]], Sticky has since become an independent organisation and one of Australia's largest sellers of zines, stocking work from the United States, UK, Germany, France, China, Japan and New Zealand.

In 2004, the Spencer Street site was destroyed as part of the redevelopment of the station. Platform continues to deliver an ambitious contemporary art program at Campbell Arcade, Flinders Street Station under the new title, Platform Public Contemporary Art Spaces. In 2010, Platform marked its 20th Anniversary by publishing the book, ''What Art, Which Public?''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thethousands.com.au/melbourne/look/twenty-years-of-platform/ Twenty Years of Platform, Three Thousand (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quadrangular castle''' ({{lang-az|'''Dördkünc Mərdəkan qalası'''}}) is a historic castle located in [[Mərdəkan|Mardakan]], [[Baku]]. It is one of the most noticeable castles in Mardakan, a similar one being [[Round Tower (Mardakan)|Round Tower]].

==History==
[[File:Stamps of Azerbaijan, 1999-537.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Postage stamp (1999)]]
The castle was built in the middle of the 12th century by [[Akhsitan I]], son of the [[Manuchihr III of Shirvan|Manuchihr III]]. It was erected after the victory of Akhsitan I. The castle was used as a shelter and observation point of [[Feudalism|feudals]].&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

==Architectural features==
The castle was built in a quadrangular form. It is divided into 5 tiers. The castle consists of 6 rooms. The inner courtyard of the castle is 28x25 m. The height of the tower is 22 meters. The thickness of it is 2.10 meters at lower part and 1.60 meters at upper portion. There are 76 stairs in the castle.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Dördkünc Mərdəkan qalası|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/defensive-structure/8e6b8882d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

108 empty wells in the yard were used to store food. There is also a water well of 25 meters when entering the entrance of the castle.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web|title= Əsrlərin yadigarı – Dördkünc Mərdəkan qalası|url= https://report.az/multimedia/dordkunc-merdekan-qalasi|publisher= report.az|language= az|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papal '''regesta''' are the copies, generally entered in special registry volumes, of the [[papal]] letters and official documents that are kept in the papal archives. The name is also used to indicate subsequent publications containing such documents, in chronological order, with summaries of their essential contents, for which English diplomatics use usually the term [[Calendar (archives)|"calendar"]].

==Early history==

The growth of the correspondence of the [[Holy See]] is evident even by the end of the 2nd century. Probably from a very early date a copy was made of papal documents before their dispatch, and that the collection of these documents was preserved at the seat of the central administration of the Roman Church. At that time high officials of the Roman State administration, the imperial chancery, the Senate, the consuls, the provincial governments, had all official documents entered in such volumes and preserved in the archives. The books in which these documents were entered were called ''commentarii regesta'', the latter word from ''regerere'', to inscribe.

The existence of such papal regesta can be proved for the 4th century and the succeeding era. In his polemic with [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] ("Apolog. adv. Rufinum", III, xx), [[St. Jerome]] refers to the archives (''chartarium'') of the Roman Church, where the letter of [[Pope Anastasius I|Pope Anastasius]] (399-401) on the controversy over the doctrines of Origen was preserved. There are also notices concerning the registration of papal letters in the documents of several popes of the 5th century. Thus Pope Zosimus in his letter of 22 Sept., 417, to the bishops of Africa refers to the fact that all the earlier negotiations with Coelestius had been examined at Rome (Coustant, "Epist. Rom. Pontif.", 955). Consequently, copies of the documents in question must have existed. From this time onwards it remained the fixed custom of the papal chancery to copy the official papers issued by it in registers.

==Surviving regesta==

From the centuries previous to the pontificate of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1199–1216) there remain only fragments of the registry volumes of the papal chancery and these in large part merely in later copies. Nearly all the volumes of the papal regesta up to the end of the 12th century have disappeared.

The most important fragments of this period that have been preserved are: nearly 850 letters, in three groups, of the Regesta of [[Pope Gregory I]] (590-604). An investigation proved that the original Regesta consisted of fourteen papyrus volumes, corresponding to the number of years of the pontificate, which were arranged according to [[indictions]]; that each of these volumes was divided into twelve parts, before each of which the name of the corresponding month was written. This indicates the plan of the earliest volumes of the papal Regesta. A manuscript of the Vatican archives contains letters of [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]] (872-882) from September 876 to the end of the pontificate. This is not an original register, but an 11th-century copy. Separate letters, fifty-five in number, belonging to the first four years of the pontificate of this pope, are in a manuscript of the 12th century in the British Museum (Ms. Add. 8874). The manuscript contains letters of [[Gelasius I]] (492-96), [[Pelagius I]] (556-561), [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] (847-55), John VIII (872-82), [[Pope Stephen V|Stephen V]] (885-91), Alexander II (1061–73), and [[Urban II]] (1088–99). The study of the manuscript by Ewald ["Neues Archiv", V (1880), 275 sqq., 503 sqq.] led to important conclusions concerning the volumes of the Regesta. Another manuscript at Cambridge contains some seventy letters from the Regesta of Adrian IV (1154–59), Alexander III (1159–81), and Lucius III (1181–85) [see Löwenfeld in "Neues Archiv", X, 1885, 585 sqq.]. Again, large parts of the Regesta of Gregory VII (1073–85), namely 381 letters, are contained in a manuscript in the Vatican archives. This collection is also only an extract of the original Regesta. In it the letters are no longer arranged according to indictions, but according to the year of the pontificate. A fraction of the Regesta of the antipope Anacletus II (1130–38) containing thirty-eight letters has been preserved in a manuscript of Monte Cassino (Ewald in "Neues Archiv", III, 164 sqq.). Besides these collections of letters which have preserved fragments of the earliest papal Regesta, rich material is also to be found in the canonical collections of the Middle Ages. In part these collections go back directly or indirectly to the volumes of the Regesta of the papal archives, from which the authors of these collections, as Anselm of Lucca, and above all Deusdedit, gathered the greater part of their material.

==From the 13th century==

From [[Pope Innocent III]] onward the manuscript volumes of the papal Regesta still exist in the Vatican Archives.

The Regesta of the 13th century are beautifully written parchment volumes. Yet the most of these in their present form have been made from older volumes. How these older volumes, the real original Regesta, were planned cannot be decided. From the 14th century onward, registry volumes of paper were used for the entering of the copies. However, when the popes returned from Avignon to Rome, these paper Regesta were left at Avignon, and copies of them were made in parchment registry volumes that were brought to Rome. At a later era, the original Regesta volumes were also brought to the Vatican Archives so that there are two series in existence for the Avignon epoch of the 14th century. From the 14th century onwards the volumes of the Regesta were generally made of paper. Numerous investigations have been made by various scholars as to the arrangement of the volumes of the Regesta, the rules or customs observed in the entering of the separate pieces, as to the question of whether the draft or the finished letter was copied, and as to many other matters in diplomatics, without reaching very certain results. In the 13th century the letters were divided into "Litteræ communes" and "Litteræ de curia" or "Curiales", the latter dealing mostly with affairs of general importance. At a later date other headings (litteræ secretæ, litteræ de beneficiis) were also introduced. Besides the regular Regesta of the papal letters made in the papal chancery, there were similar Regesta of the papal letters executed since the 14th century in the Apostolic Camera. From about the middle of the 14th century the registers of petitions were also preserved, in which were entered, not the papal documents, but the memorials to the pope, in reply to which the papal documents were issued.

==As historical sources==

As collections of the official documents of the papal chancery, the Regesta are a very important historical authority.{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} For convenience in historical investigation various scholars have published in chronological order all known papal documents of large periods, with brief summaries of the contents of the letters. The three greatest collections of this kind are:

*[[Philipp Jaffé]], "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum ab condita ecclesia ad annum p. Chr. n. 1198"; 2nd ed. by S. Löwenfeld, F. Kaltenbrunner, P. Ewald (2 vols., Leipzig, 1888); 3rd ed. by Klaus Herbers, Waldemar Könighaus, Cornelia Scherer, Thorsten Schlauwitz, Marucs Schütz, Viktoria Trenkle, Judith Werner (vol. 1 (39?-604), Göttingen 2016).
*[[Paul Fridolin Kehr]] has undertaken a new edition of the Regesta for this period in topographical and at the same time chronological order: "Regesta Pontif. Roman.: Italia Pontifica" (Berlin, 1906–); "Germania Pontificia" (Berlin, 1910-); Gallia Pontificia; Iberia Pontificia; Polonia Pontificia; with the cooperation of other scholars.
*Jaffé's work was supplemented by [[August Potthast]], "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum inde ab an p. Chr. n. 1198 ad an. 1304 (2 vols., Berlin, 1874-75).

The database [http://www.papsturkunden.de "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum online"] from the "Göttinger Papsturkundenwerk" will combine the several Regesta projects up to the year 1198.

Letters of several popes taken from the volumes of the Regesta have been published by: Löwenfeld: "Epistolæ Pontificum Romanorum ineditæ" (Leipzig, 1885) taken from the manuscript at Cambridge; Rodenberg, "Epistolæ sæc. XIII e Regestis Rom. Pont. selectæ" (Berlin, 1883 —), in "Mon. Germ. Hist." The Regesta of the letters of Gregory I were edited again by Ewald and Hartmann, "Gregorii I Registrum epistolarum" in "Mon. Germ. Hist." (Berlin, 1891 —).

The letters of Gregory VII were edited by Jaffé, "Monumenta Gregoriana" in "Bibliotheca Rerum Germanicarum" (2 vols., Berlin, 1868). As early as 1591 the records of John VIII were published from the manuscript in the Vatican. Of the popes of the 13th century, Pressuti edited (Rome, 1888–96) the Regesta on Honorarius III (1216–27) from the volumes of the Regesta in the Vatican Archives; the Regesta of the succeeding popes to Boniface VII (d. 1303) were edited by the members of the Ecole Françoisaise of Rome, the publication of the Regesta of all the popes being yet incomplete; after a group of Benedictines had issued the Regesta of Clement V (1305–14), the members of the Ecole Françoisaise began again with John XXII (1316–34), with the intention of publishing the Regesta of the Avignon popes to Gregory XI (1370–78). In this later series, besides the documents of general interest, they kept in view particularly those documents that bore on the history of France. For the later eras only the first numbers were published of the Regesta of Leo X (1513–21), edited by [[Cardinal Hergenröther]] (see under the different popes).

In addition a number of works have been issued or are in course of publication that contain Regesta from the Vatican Regesta of the 14th century, bearing on special questions or on the history of various countries and dioceses, e.g., Werunsky, "Excerpts ex registris Clementis VI et Innocenti VI (Innsbruck, 1885); Ruezler, "Vatikanische Akten zur deutschen Geschichte in der Zeit Ludwigs des Bayern" (Munich, 1890).

The '''Singapore Biennale''' ({{zh|c=新加坡双年展}}) is a [[contemporary art]] [[wikt:biennale|biennale]] in [[Singapore]].  The first Singapore Biennale operated as one of a lineup of [[Singapore 2006]] events.  Fumio Nanjo, Director of Tokyo's Mori Art Museum, has been reappointed Artistic Director of the Singapore Biennale 2008.   Working with Mr Nanjo on Singapore Biennale 2008 are two curators: independent curator Joselina Cruz, formerly a curator at the Singapore Art Museum and the Lopez Museum in Manila; and Matthew Ngui, one of Singapore's leading artists in contemporary art.

The first Singapore Biennale employed the theme of "Belief", commencing on 4 September 2006 and ended on 12 November 2006. The event was held in various locations throughout Singapore.  It featured 195 artworks, from 95 [[artist]]s and collectives from 38 different countries. The event was part of the [[Singapore 2006]] events which included the 2006 Annual Meetings of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank Group]] held at the [[Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre]]. The event was organised by the [[National Arts Council Singapore|National Arts Council]] (which also organised the annual [[Singapore Arts Festival]]) in conjunction with the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]].

The first and second editions of the Biennale were organised by the National Arts Council. For the third edition, [[Singapore Art Museum]] - Singapore's contemporary art museum - came on board as a venue organiser. In the fourth and fifth editions, the National Arts Council of Singapore appointed the Singapore Art Museum as the Singapore Biennale organiser.  Under the direction of the Singapore Art Museum, the Biennale has focused on deepening awareness and understanding of Southeast Asian contemporary art, and attracted over 500,000 visitors over 4 months.

The 2016 edition of the Singapore Biennale takes place from 27 October 2016 to 26 February 2017, and is titled "[https://www.singaporebiennale.org/about-singapore-biennale-2016.php An Atlas of Mirrors]". Exploring shared histories and current realities within and beyond the region, [http://www.singaporeartmuseum.sg/singaporebiennale Singapore Biennale 2016] will be a constellation of artistic perspectives that provide unexpected ways of seeing the world and ourselves.  The international contemporary art exhibition will feature site-specific and never seen before contemporary artworks by more than 60 artists across Southeast Asia, and East and South Asia.  The Biennale aims to cultivate deeper public engagement with contemporary visual arts through its accompanying public engagement and education programmes, that include artist and curator talks and tours, school visits and workshops, and community days.

==Timeline==

* 1st Singapore Biennale - "Belief" - The first Singapore Biennale featured different types of contemporary art including drawings, paintings, installations, new media, performances, photography, video, publishing, sound, wall painting, and furniture. Artists of note included Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, Fujiko Nakaya, Jenny Holzer, Mariko Mori, Shigeru Ban, Yayoi Kusama, Jenny Holzer and Takashi Kuribayashi.  The Curatorial Team for the Singapore Biennale was headed by renowned curator Fumio Nanjo. The other curators involved were Roger McDonald (Japan), Sharmini Pereira (Sri Lanka/United Kingdom) and Eugene Tan (Singapore).
* 2nd Singapore Biennale - "Wonder"- The second Singapore Biennale, held over 8 weeks in 2008, was again helmed by Fumio Nanjo, this time working with the curatorial team of Joselina Cruz and Matthew Ngui. Under the theme of 'Wonder', the Biennale invited people to be 'surprised and tantalised' by contemporary art. Foregrounding beauty and aesthetic experience, the exhibition also used the other meaning of the title to encourage questioning and debate. 66 artists from 36 countries participated in the exhibition.
* 3rd Singapore Biennale - "Open House" - Led by Matthew Ngui as Artistic Director and curators - Russell Storer and Trevor Smith, the third Biennale featured 60 artists from 30 countries. Held over nine weeks, the Singapore Biennale was titled 'Open House', examining multiple perspectives and myriad creative approaches to questions of how we move across borders, see other points of view, and form connections with others.
* 4th Singapore Biennale - "If the World Changed" - Featuring works by 82 artists and artist collectives from 13 countries, the fourth Biennale has harnessed the energy of the Southeast Asian region to bring to the fore unique practices, concerns and myriad perspectives of artists from this part of the world. Drawing on the combined expertise of its team of 27 curators from Southeast Asia, a significant 93% of works are by artists or collectives from the region, resulting in the strongest Asian representation to date.
* 5th Singapore Biennale - "An Atlas of Mirrors" - Retaining a collaborative curatorial framework, the fifth Biennale is led by a curatorial team of SAM Curators Ms. Joyce Toh, Ms. Tan Siuli, Mr. Louis Ho, Ms. Andrea Fam and Mr. John Tung, as well as four Associate Curators who are invited by SAM to work together.  The four Associate Curators are Ms. Suman Gopinath - based in Bangalore, India; Ms. Nur Hanim Khairuddin - based in Ipoh, Malaysia, Mr. Michael Lee from Singapore, and Ms. Xiang Liping - based in Shanghai, China. The curatorial team will work closely with SB2016 Creative Director, Dr. Susie Lingham, who shapes and facilitates curatorial discussions, and oversees all SB2016 creative content.

The '''Société des Artistes Français''' is the [[Professional association|association]] of French painters and sculptors established in 1881. Its annual exhibition is called the "Salon des artistes français" (not to be confused with the better-known [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]], established in 1667).

When the Société was established, it associated all the French artists. Its president was a painter and its vice-president a sculptor. The main task of the Société is to organize the ''Salon'', since the French government ceased to do it.

== Secession ==

In December 1890 president Bouguereau suggested that the ''Salon'' should be an exhibition of young, yet unrecognized, artists. [[Ernest Meissonier]], [[Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Auguste Rodin]] and others rejected this proposal and left the organization. They quickly created their own exhibition ([[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in 1899) that was also named the ''Salon'', officially ''Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux–Arts'', in short ''Salon du Champs de Mars''.  The original ''Salon'' was sometimes called ''Salon de Champs-Élysées'', or simply ''Salon des artistes français'').

'''Trajan's Column''' ({{lang-it|Colonna Traiana}}, {{lang-la|COLVMNA·TRAIANI}}) is a [[Roman triumphal column]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], that commemorates [[Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]]'s victory in the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. It was probably constructed under the supervision of the architect [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] at the order of the [[Roman Senate]]. It is located in [[Trajan's Forum]], built near the [[Quirinal Hill]], north of the [[Roman Forum]]. Completed in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 113, the freestanding column is most famous for its spiral [[bas relief]], which artistically represents the wars between the Romans and [[Dacia]]ns (101–102 and 105–106). Its design has inspired numerous [[victory column]]s, both ancient and modern.

The structure is about {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} in height, {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=off}} including its large [[pedestal]]. The shaft is made from a series of 20 colossal [[Carrara marble]]{{efn|In ancient times, Carrara marble bore the name of ''Luna marble'' after the port of [[Luna (Etruria)|Luna]], [[Etruria]] on the harbor of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] from which it was shipped after being quarried in the mountains of [[Carrara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://class.coursera.org/romanarchitecture-001/lecture/99 | title=The Ascent of Augustus and Access to Italian Marble | publisher=Yale University | people=Diana E. E. Kleiner | medium=Multimedia presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} drums, each weighing about 32 tons,&lt;ref name="Jones 1993, 32"/&gt; with a diameter of {{convert|3.7|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}. The {{convert|190|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid}} [[frieze]] winds around the shaft 23 times. Inside the shaft, a spiral staircase of 185 steps provides access to a viewing platform at the top. The capital block of Trajan's Column weighs 53.3 tons, which had to be lifted to a height of c. {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 426-428"/&gt;

Ancient coins indicate preliminary plans to top the column with a statue of a bird, probably an eagle,&lt;ref name="Platner"&gt;{{harvnb|Platner|1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after construction, a statue of Trajan was put in place; this statue disappeared in the [[Middle Ages]]. On December 4, 1587, the top was crowned by [[Pope Sixtus V]] with a bronze figure of [[St. Peter]], which remains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paoletti|Radke|2005|p=541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The column was originally flanked by two libraries, which may have contained Trajan's scroll-written despatches from his [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Roman-Dacian Wars]]. [[Filippo Coarelli]] suggests that such scrolls are the basis both of the column's design and its spiraling, sculpted narrative. The column shows 2,662 figures, and 155 scenes; Trajan himself appears on the column 58 times.&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curry|first1=Andrew| title=Trajan's Amazing Column|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/trajan-column/article.html| website= National Geographic|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frieze ==

===Design===
The continuous helical frieze winds twenty-three times from base to capital, and was in its time an architectural innovation.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillon|first1=Sheila|title=Representation of War in Ancient Rome|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=244–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was adopted by later emperors such as Marcus Aurelius. The narrative band expands from about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=off}} at the base of the column to {{convert|1.2|m|ft|1|abbr=off}} at the top.&lt;ref&gt;Art History: Fourth Edition by Marilyn Stoksad and Michael W. Cothren&lt;/ref&gt; 
The scenes unfold continuously. Often a variety of different perspectives are used in the same scene, so that more can be revealed (''e.g.'', a different angle is used to show men working behind a wall).

===Historical content portrayed===

====Narrative====

The relief portrays Trajan's two victorious military campaigns against the [[Dacia]]ns; the lower half illustrating the first (101–102), and the top half illustrating the second (105–106). These campaigns were contemporary to the time of the Column's building. Throughout, the frieze repeats standardized scenes of imperial address (''adlocutio''), sacrifice (''lustratio''), and the army setting out on campaign (''profectio'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holscher| first=Tonio |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes of battle are very much a minority on the column, instead it emphasizes images of orderly soldiers carrying out ceremony and construction.

The war against Dacia was one of conquest and expansion. Therefore, with the aim of the Dacian Campaigns being the incorporation and integration of Dacia into the Roman Empire as a Roman province, depictions of violent action towards foreign women and children are nonexistent.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt; Wartime violence in general seems to have been downplayed.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt; 

Some scholars suggest the lack of battle scenes and large number of building scenes is a propaganda constructed specifically for the urban population of Rome (the primary audience), addressing their fear and distrust of the army by depicting its warfare as one with little collateral damage.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

Key specific events portrayed are the first crossing of the Danube by the Roman legion, Trajan's voyage up the Danube, the surrender of the Dacians at the close of the first war, the great sacrifice by the Danube bridge during the second war, the assault on the Dacian capital, and the death of the Dacian king [[Decebalus]].&lt;ref name="Trajan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trajan's Column|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/antiquity/trajans-column.htm|website=visual-arts-cork.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sections are separated by a personification of [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] writing on a shield flanked on either side by Trophies.

====Figures and sets====
[[File:046 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel XLVI (Ausschnitt 01).jpg|thumb|right|Roman carroballista, a cart-mounted field artillery weapon (relief detail)]]

Great care is taken to distinguish the men and women from both sides of the campaign as well as the ranks within these distinct groups. The scenes are crowded with sailors, soldiers, statesmen and priests, showing about 2,500 figures in all. It also exists as a valuable source of information on Roman and barbarian arms and methods of warfare (such as forts, ships, weapons, etc.) and costume. The relief shows details such as a [[ballista]] or catapult. The precise details create a strong effect of [[Effect of Reality|verisimilitude]]; the designer presents the images as objective historical truth.&lt;ref name="Dillon"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Dillon|first1=Sheila|title=Representation of War in Ancient Rome|publisher=Cambridge University Press| pages=244–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperor Trajan is depicted realistically in the Veristic style, making 59 appearances as the central hero among his troops.&lt;ref name="Spiral"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Spiral Frieze of Trajan's Column in Rome|url=http://www.trajans-column.org/?page_id=404|website=Trajan's Column in Rome|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrayal of the Roman army as relatively gentle may have been designed to support Trajan's image as a man of "justice, clemency, moderation, and restraint".&lt;ref name="Spiral"/&gt;

====Women====
Women for the most part occupy and define the margins of the scenes. However, mortal females in Roman state art are so rare, it is remarkable that they are included at all in a war monument. In the male discourse of warfare, women are a visual trope that develops further the idea of subjugation by feminizing the foreign conquered.&lt;ref name="Dillon"/&gt; 

However, on the Column is "one of the most unusual, disturbing, and violent depictions of women in Roman art, the torture scene.".&lt;ref name="Dillon"/&gt; In this unusual scene, five Dacian women are depicted torturing three naked men, perhaps to depict female domination increasing the humiliation of the Roman enemy.

Today, the Column of Trajan is the most prominent architectural feature of Trajan’s Forum, left nearly intact but now isolated from its original setting. The Column was placed toward the northernmost point of the forum, acting as the focal point of the entire forum complex. It was surrounded on three sides by two flanking libraries and the Basilica Ulpia. The two libraries to the northeast and southwest of the Column were for the study of scrolls written in both Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Hungerford Pollen, John. A Description of the Trajan Column. George E. Eyre and William Spottiswoode. Queen Victoria, London. 1874.&lt;/ref&gt; These libraries were built in tandem with the Column &lt;ref&gt;Lancaster, Lynne. (1999) Building Trajan's Column. American Journal of Archaeology 103. 3. p.419-439.&lt;/ref&gt; They apparently included upper level viewing platforms for two sides of the column. By having an elevated vantage point, the figures of the scenes, carved in shallow relief and detailed with paint and metal fittings, could be seen more closely (nevertheless it remained impossible for the ancient viewer to follow sequentially the continuous spiral of the reliefs). The problem with visibility of the upper areas is further apparent when we compare Trajan’s Column to the Column of Marcus Aurelius. The figures in the later Column of Marcus Aurelius are more deeply cut and even simplified over the height of the shaft because there were no surrounding buildings to serve as viewing platforms. The different carving style seems to have been adopted to enhance visibility.

The two libraries flanking the Column helped to further the emperor's program of propaganda. In addition to serving as viewing platforms for the Column, they housed valuable works of literature for the people of Rome.  Surely one important text kept here was Trajan's own account of the Dacian Wars, now lost.  The reliefs on the Column documenting the Dacian campaigns would have provided a vivid complement to Trajan's  account of the wars. The people of Rome were reminded of his victories every time they enjoyed the open space and amenities of the forum.&lt;ref&gt;Packer, James E., (1998) Trajan’s GLORIOUS FORUM. Archaeology. 51. 3. p 32-41&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the Column and the magnificent buildings that surrounded it created an awe inspiring spectacle.

== Purpose ==
[[File:032 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel XXXII.jpg|thumb|240px|Battle scene between the Roman and Dacian armies]]

It is unclear whether the Column was meant to serve a commemorative function or as a propaganda piece. Traditional scholarship held that the Column was a glorifying monument, upholding Trajan as Rome's great emperor. However, recent reconstructions of [[Trajan's Forum]] have determined that any wide view of the Column would have been mostly obstructed by two libraries in the Forum which tightly bookended it. Also, because it would have been difficult to follow the spiral frieze from end to end (walking in circles with head inclined), the Column's narrative power would have been fairly limited.

On the other hand, as French archaeologist [[Paul Veyne]] notes, the relief could be read "vertically" from below, with the figure of the emperor recognizable across the bands of images—just as, on the [[Vendôme Column|Colonne Vendôme]], Napoleon's figure can be picked up, scene after scene. Additionally, the two libraries surrounding it provided platforms from which to observe the Column if the viewer stood on the top floors, making the complete view of frieze much more visible.

While there is certainly evidence that the Column was not put in an ideal spot for visibility, it is impossible to reject the Column as some form of a glorification structure. There is the significant point that the Column was extremely challenging to construct, and so it is unlikely that it would have been placed in the Forum with the intentions of being hidden or out of plain sight.&lt;ref name="Packer, James E 1998"&gt;Packer, James E. 01/01/1998. Archaeology: Trajan's glorious forum.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the important idea of the Column as a symbol for Trajan. Trajan’s ashes were buried in a chamber at the base of the Column. At the top of the Column was a statue of Trajan. The ground level of the Forum, which is a center of life for Romans, is where the earthly remains of Trajan are buried. The Column from the base goes up, taking us through Trajan’s triumph in the Dacian wars, and (as originally constructed) finishes with a statue of Trajan above the forum. If we consider the practice of deification of emperors, which was expected during this time period, especially of glorious Trajan, it is hard to ignore the symbolism here. Trajan’s earthly remains stay in the Forum with the Roman people, while his conquests ascend him up into the heavens. It would be hard to prove this set up as a coincidence, thus the Column should be regarded in some sense as a symbol of glorification.&lt;ref name="Packer, James E 1998"/&gt;

The Column acting as a funerary monument has also been considered. After Trajan's death in 117, the [[Roman Senate]] voted to have Trajan's ashes buried in the Column's square base, which is decorated with captured [[Dacia]]n arms and armor.  His ashes and those of his wife, [[Pompeia Plotina|Plotina]], were set inside the base in [[gold]]en urns (which later disappeared from the monument). One reading of this is that Trajan may have intended the Column to be his final resting place from the project's inception, and that the similarities in design to other funerary structures made it a natural choice for the Roman Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1997|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the circumambulation demanded of onlookers of the Column's frieze is evocative of Roman funerary practice, drawing attention toward the center – and consequently, the finial of Trajan.

Perhaps the simplest interpretation is provided by the inscription written above the entrance (translated below): that the mere existence of Column was an engineering marvel due to the immense excavation efforts necessary for its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossi|1971|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inscription ==
[[File:002 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel II.jpg|thumb|240px|The inscription plate above the entrance to the interior (upper image)]]

The inscription at the base of the column in finest lettering reads:
{{quote|SENATVS·POPVLVSQVE·ROMANVS&lt;br/&gt;
IMP·CAESARI·DIVI·NERVAE·F·NERVAE&lt;br/&gt;
TRAIANO·AVG·GERM·DACICO·PONTIF&lt;br/&gt;
MAXIMO·TRIB·POT·{{Overline|XVII}}·IMP·{{Overline|VI}}·COS·{{Overline|VI}}·P·P&lt;br/&gt;
AD·DECLARANDVM·QVANTAE·ALTITVDINIS&lt;br/&gt;
MONS·ET·LOCVS·TANT&lt;IS·OPER&gt;IBVS·SIT·EGESTVS}}

[[File:001 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel I.jpg|thumb|left|Trajan's Column around 1896]]

Translated, the inscription reads:

{{quote|The [[SPQR|Senate and people of Rome]] [give or dedicate this] to the emperor Caesar, son of the divine [[Nerva]], Nerva Traianus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus, ''[[pontifex maximus]]'', in his 17th year in the office of [[tribune]], having been acclaimed 6&amp;nbsp;times as ''[[imperium|imperator]]'', 6&amp;nbsp;times [[consul]], ''[[pater patriae]]'', to demonstrate of what great height the hill [was] and place [that] was removed for such great works.}}

It was believed that the column was supposed to stand where the saddle between the [[Capitoline]] and [[Quirinal]] Hills used to be, having been excavated by Trajan, but excavation has revealed that this is not the case. The saddle was where [[Trajan's Forum]] and [[Trajan's Market]] stood. Hence, the inscription refers to the Trajan's entire building project in the area of the [[Imperial fora]].

This is perhaps the most famous example of [[Roman square capitals]], a script often used for stone monuments and, less often, for manuscript writing. As it was meant to be read from below, the bottom letters are slightly smaller than the top letters, to give proper perspective. Some, but not all, word divisions are marked with a dot, and many of the words, especially the titles, are abbreviated. In the inscription, numerals are marked with a ''titulus'', a bar across the top of the letters. A small piece at the bottom of the inscription has been lost.

The [[typeface]] [[Trajan (typeface)|Trajan]], designed in 1989 by [[Carol Twombly]], uses letter forms based on this inscription, working from the research of [[Edward Catich]]. There have been many other typefaces based on the inscription from such designers as [[Frederic Goudy]] and [[Warren Chappell]].[http://www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/trajan/]

== Spiral stair ==
{{See also|List of ancient spiral stairs}}
[[File:Trajans-Column-lower-animated.svg|thumb|left|Section view of the pedestal and the interior stairway (click on image)]]

The interior of Trajan's Column is hollow: entered by a small doorway at one side of the base, a spiral stair of 185 steps gives access to the platform above, having offered the visitor in antiquity a view over the surrounding Trajan's forum; 43 window slits illuminate the ascent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|1997|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The column stands {{convert|38.4|m|1|abbr=on}} high from the ground to the top of the statue base:&lt;ref name="Lancaster 419"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located immediately next to the large [[Basilica Ulpia]], it had to be constructed sufficiently tall in order to function as a vantage point and to maintain its own visual impact on the forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The column proper, that is the shaft without the pedestal, the statue and its base, is {{convert|29.76|m|ft|2|abbr=off}} high, a number which almost corresponds to 100 [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman feet]]; beginning slightly above the bottom of the base, the helical staircase inside measures a mere {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}} less.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The column is composed of 29 blocks of [[Carrara marble|Luni marble]], weighing in total more than 1100&amp;nbsp;t.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 419"/&gt; The spiral stair itself was carved out of 19 blocks, with a full turn every 14 steps; this arrangement required a more complex geometry than the more usual alternatives of 12 or 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|pp=31–32, Fig. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the craftsmanship was such that the staircase is practically even, and the joints between the huge blocks still fit accurately.&lt;ref name="Jones 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous earthquakes in the past, the column today leans at an angle of less than half a degree.&lt;ref name="Jones 31"/&gt;

Trajan's Column, especially its helical stairway design, exerted a considerable influence on subsequent [[Roman architecture]]. While spiral stairs were before still a rare sight in Roman buildings, this space-saving form henceforth spread gradually throughout the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beckmann|2002|pp=353–356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the practical advantages it offered, the design also became closely associated with imperial power, being later adopted by Trajan's successors [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]. In [[Napoleon]]'s time, a similar column decorated with a spiral of relief sculpture was erected in the [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris to commemorate his victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]].

== About the Column==
{{See also|List of Roman monoliths}}
[[File:1586 Rome obelisk erection.jpg|thumb|240px|Erection of the [[List of obelisks in Rome|Vatican obelisk]] in 1586 by means of a lifting tower. A similar arrangement was presumably used for the construction of Trajan's Column, but with less available space and thus manpower.]]

It is assumed that the column drums were lifted by [[crane (machine)|crane]]s into their place.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 426-428"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=426–428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones 34-36"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|pp=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources, as well as a substantial body of archaeological evidence, show that [[Roman engineers]] were capable of raising large weights clear off the ground. The typical drum of Trajan's Column weighs c. 32&amp;nbsp;t,&lt;ref name="Jones 1993, 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Capital (architecture)|capital]], the heaviest block above the base and pedestal, is even at 53.3&amp;nbsp;t, which had to be lifted 34 m high.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 426-428"/&gt; To save weight, the treads had probably been carved out before either at the quarry or ''in situ''.&lt;ref name="Jones 31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, for such loads, the typical Roman [[treadwheel]] crane, which could only reach a maximum height of {{convert|15|to(-)|18|m|ft|abbr=off}} in any event, was clearly inadequate.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 426-428"/&gt; Instead, a tower-like wooden construction was erected around the building site, in the midst of which the marble blocks were raised by a system of [[pulley]]s, ropes and [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]]; these were powered by a large workforce of men and possibly also [[draught animal]]s, spread out on the ground.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 428-437"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=428–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to modern calculations, eight capstans were needed to hoist the 55&amp;nbsp;t base block, while the length of rope required for the highest drums measured some {{convert|210|m|ft|abbr=off}} assuming two-block pulleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a lifting tower was later also used to great effect by the [[Renaissance]] architect [[Domenico Fontana]] to relocate [[obelisk]]s in Rome. From his report, it becomes obvious that the coordination of the lift between the various pulling teams required a considerable amount of concentration and discipline, since, if the force was not applied evenly, the excessive stress on the ropes would make them rupture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=436–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of Trajan's Column, the difficulties were exacerbated even further by the simultaneous work on the neighbouring Basilica Ulpia, which limited the available space so that the capstan crews had proper access only from one side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=430–431, Fig. 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TrajanscolumbMdCR.jpg|thumb|240px|The plaster casts laid out at eye level in the [[Museum of Roman Civilization]]]]

Plaster casts of the relief were taken in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. After a century of [[acid rain|acid pollution]], they are now more legible in some details than the original, and the way they are displayed offers students a closer look at the reliefs than at the original site. Examples can be studied at:

* [[Museum of Roman Civilization]] in Rome, where each "frame" of the narrative has been cut into a separate section and the sections are then displayed horizontally in order
* [[National Museum of Romanian History]], Bucharest, Romania, which displays the frieze horizontally in segments
* [[Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum)#Trajan's Column|Cast Courts]] at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. Displayed in column form and, including the base, the column is chopped into two halves.
* [[Archaeological Collection of the University of Zürich]], [[University of Zürich]]

Additionally, individual casts of the frieze are on display in various museums, for example, in the [[:de:Museum für Antike Schiffahrt|Museum for Ancient Navigation]] in [[Mainz]]. A complete survey in [[monochrome]] was published by the German archaeologist [[Conrad Cichorius]] between 1896 and 1900 (see [[commons:Category:Trajan's Column - Cichorius Plates|Commons]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cichorius|1896|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cichorius|1900|}}&lt;/ref&gt; still forming the base of modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lepper|Frere|1988|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Cichorius's work, and on the photographic archive of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], a research-oriented Web-based viewer for Trajan's Column was created at the German-language image database.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Förtsch|2007|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Young Playwrights' Theater''' (YPT) is a [[not-for-profit]] [[theater]] [[arts]]-based [[education]] [[organization]] in [[Washington, D.C. (northwest)|Northwest]] [[Washington, D.C.]]. It provides interactive in-school and after-school programs presenting and discussing student-written work to promote community dialogue and respect for young artists. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngplaywrightstheater.org/About/GuidingPrinciples/index_E.html |title=YPT Vision and Mission   |publisher=Young Playwrights' Theater }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Leadership==
Young Playwrights' Theater was founded in 1995 by Karen Zacarías. Now a [[Helen Hayes]] Award-winning Playwright-in-Residence at [[Arena Stage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arenastage.org/new-play-institute/playwright-residencies/ |title=Playwright Residencies   |publisher=Arena Stage }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zacarías began volunteering her time teaching playwriting workshops in DC classrooms after returning to her hometown with a M.F.A. in [[playwriting]] from Boston University. By 1997, her workshops were so successful that she incorporated YPT as a [[501c3]] nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/Jan06/zacarias.cfm  |title=Karen Zacarias: A Writer's Tightrope    |publisher=Theatre Communications Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, when Zacarías transitioned to Arena Stage, David Andrew Snider took over as Producing Artistic Director and CEO. Since then the organization has grown to employ six full-time staff members, eight professional [[teaching artists]], and dozens of professional actors, directors and designers supporting its work on-stage and in the classroom. YPT provides thousands of students and community members annually with free in-school and after-school theater arts workshops and professional performances of student-written plays, and has created a continuum of programming at the [[Columbia Heights (Washington, D.C.)|Columbia Heights]] Education Campus through programming for students of Bancroft Elementary School, Lincoln Middle School and [[Bell Multicultural High School]] to gauge the long-term effects on students as they progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2012/06/01/gJQAlmp7BV_story.html|title=Nonprofit's turnaround has brought it lots of attention   |publisher=The Washington Post | first=Vanessa|last=Small|date=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snider followed Zacarías to Arena Stage in July 2012 as Director of Artistic Programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchengine.com/arenastageatthemeadcenterforamericantheater/david-snider-to-join-arena-stage-as-director-of-artistic-programming |title=David Snider to Join Arena Stage as Director of Artistic Programming   |publisher=www.pitchengine.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Deputy Director Brigitte Pribnow Moore stepped in as Acting Executive Director and former Program Manager Nicole Jost assumed the role of Associate Artistic Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.georgetown.edu/scs/prcc/224264.html  |title=MPS PR/CC Student Implements Class Project and Exceeds $50,000 Fundraising Goal    |publisher=Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/blogarticles/21083.html |title=Our List of Women to Watch   |publisher=The Washingtonian }}&lt;/ref&gt; YPT's staff operates out of the [[Josephine Butler Parks Center]], adjacent to [[Meridian Hill Park]] in the Columbia Heights neighborhood and regularly stages performances at nearby [[Tivoli Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Tivoli Theatre]], a renovated 1920's Italian Renaissance Revival theater, now home to [[GALA Hispanic Theatre]]. The organization receives federal and private sector funding, as well as individual donations.

==Programs and Performance Series==

===''In-School Playwriting Program''===
YPT's flagship program integrates the art of playwriting into the classroom in order to enhance student literacy, creative expression and communication. During 12 in-class workshops led by teaching artists, students explore the mechanics of language, drama, and self-expression, culminating with each student writing his or her own short play. Professional actors and directors visit the classroom throughout the process, reading students' plays and helping to bring their words to life. The most dynamic plays are chosen by a reading committee composed of professional playwrights, directors, and actors, to be performed at Tivoli Theatre by YPT's acting company in the '''''New Play Festival''''' and at satellite locations during the '''''New Writers Now!''''' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2012/04/26/ypts-new-play-festival-young-playwrights-turn-life-into-plays/|title=YPT's New Play Festival: young playwrights turn life into plays   |publisher=DC Theatre Scene }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/video/#!/on-air/as-seen-on/Stupid-Cupid--The-Ugly-Side-of-Valentines-Day/139264198 |title=Stupid Cupid: The Ugly Side of Valentine's Day   |publisher=NBC 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The young authors work with a dramaturge to polish their scripts, attend rehearsals, and offer input to actors and a director during their plays' development and production. In 2012, YPT published some of the best student works.

===''Out-of-School Time Programming''===
Since 2008, YPT has hosted an after-school '''''Young Playwrights' Workshop''''' at its facilities in the Josephine Butler Parks Center, aimed at developing students' creative expression and collaboration by exploring theater as an ensemble. Students have written plays and performed them at the [[Capital Fringe Festival]], [[Intersections (arts festival)|Intersections]] at [[Atlas Performing Arts Center]], the [[Source Festival]] and Tivoli Theatre. The workshop hosted arts delegations from China and Russia in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/therootdc/post/dc-students-write-original-play-at-the-young-playwrights-workshop/2012/06/08/gJQAZi3AOV_blog.html|title=D.C. students write original play at The Young Playwrights' Workshop    |publisher=The Washington Post | first=DeNeen|last=Brown|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several schools host YPT's '''''After-School Playwrighting Program''''', providing a similar collaborative, explorative writing and performance experience. Additionally, the '''''Summer Playwriting Series''''', a series of playwriting workshops for local youth, is conducted at partner schools, camps and community centers, culminating in community sharing and staged readings.

===''Express Tour''===
Each fall, YPT's professional acting company tours the Greater Washington, D.C. area performing student-written plays at schools, nursing homes, hospitals, community centers and theaters, free of charge. Plays are selected from the previous school year to align with an overarching theme chosen for that year's tour. Audiences participate with actors in post-performance interactive workshops to develop their own artistic interpretations and customized storytelling experiences. The tour usually concludes with a public showcase performance at Tivoli Theatre.

===''Special Projects''===
YPT has received commissions and enjoyed partnerships with regional and international institutions including the [[White House Historical Association|White House]], [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]], [[National Geographic Society]], [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution's Discovery Theater]], [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], [[Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company|Woolly Mammoth]], [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institute]], [[Theater J]], [[Round House Theatre]], [[African Continuum Theatre Company|African Continuum]], [[Busboys and Poets]], [[Washington Parks and People]], [[Capitol Hill Arts Workshop]] (CHAW), the [[Embassy of Canada, Washington, D.C.|Canadian Embassy]], [http://esartes.org/ EsArtes] of Suchitoto, El Salvador, and a Youth Village in Israel.

==Evaluations and Assessments==
Written literacy evaluations and self-assessments are conducted during initial and final workshop visits at program sites, and assessment results are judged via a specific rubric developed by YPT's outside evaluator, faculty and staff, aimed at showing the changes in students' literacy, their abilities with language and addressing [[District of Columbia Public Schools]] and [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act|national]] English [[Language Arts]] Standards, as well as measurable changes in attitude/engagement in their own education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/What+Students+Are+Learning/Learning+Standards+for+Grades+Pre-K-8 |title=Learning Standards for Grades Pre-K-8   |publisher=DCPS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/What+Students+Are+Learning/Learning+Standards+for+High+School+Subjects |title=Learning Standards for High School Subjects   |publisher=DCPS }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] have called on YPT to share their successful evaluations and assessments to advance the field of arts education on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.ed.gov/grants/investing-in-innovation/applicant/15084 |title=Young Playwrights' Theater - In-School Playwriting Program Development Project   |publisher=United States Department of Education }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
YPT has received several regional and national awards, most notably the 2006 District of Columbia Mayor's Arts Award for Outstanding Contribution to Arts Education, a 2009 Helen Hayes nomination for Best New Play for [http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=6580518 Chasing George Washington: A White House  Adventure], the [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene and Agnes Meyer]] Foundation [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/10/AR2009111018947.html 2009 Exponent Award], the [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/19/AR2010101906768.html 2010 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award] (formerly the Coming Up Taller Award),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahyp.org/awardees/2010-awardees/after-school-playwriting-program/ |title=After-School Playwriting Program   |publisher=National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[HandsOn Network|HandsOn]] [http://www.greaterdccares.org/ Greater DC Cares] Essence of Leadership Award in 2011 and Community Impact Award in 2012, recognition in the 2009-2010 Catalogue for Philanthropy, and most recently an honorable mention for [[The Washington Post]] [http://www.nonprofitadvancement.org/blog/young-playwrights%E2%80%99-theater 2012 Award for Excellence in Nonprofit Management]. YPT is a member of the [[League of Washington Theaters]] and the [[Theatre Communications Group]].
