He is the 14th [[Secretary of Energy (Philippines)|Secretary of Energy]] under the administration of President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]. He is also the Vice Chairman of [[PDP–Laban]] and served in the [[Presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Arroyo Administration]] as head of government air and sea transportation agencies from 2001 to 2010.

== Early life and education ==
Cusi was born in the municipality of [[Roxas, Oriental Mindoro|Roxas]] in the then undivided island province of [[Mindoro (province)|Mindoro]]. He was educated at the [[University of St. La Salle]] in [[Bacolod]] (then known as La Salle College Bacolod), earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1972. He also attended the [[University of the Philippines Cebu]] in [[Cebu City]] and received a Master of Business Administration in 1976.&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt;

== Career and businesses ==
Cusi started his career in shipping. He joined the Aboitiz Shipping Company (now [[2GO Group]]) in 1973 as Assistant Comptroller. He worked his way up to become the company's and its subsidiaries' Credit Collection Manager, Purchasing Manager, Passage and Stevedorial Manager, and Trucking Manager. By 1977, he was promoted as Assistant to the President, and eventually as Assistant Vice President in 1979, Vice President in 1983, and General Manager and EVP in 1985. He was Senior Vice President and Director before resigning from the company in 1990.&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt;

Cusi then ventured into his own shipping, logistics and distribution businesses. He founded the [[Starlite Ferries]] which offers [[roll-on/roll-off]] ferry service between his home province [[Mindoro]] and [[Batangas]], as well as [[Aklan]]. He is also the President and founder of Starlite Cargo Xpress.&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt; He also entered the retail business with his own chain of convenience stores called Quick Stop.&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt;  

With his broad experience and knowledge in the shipping and transportation industry, he was invited to join government service in 2001 as General Manager of the [[Philippine Ports Authority]] during the first  term of President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]]. As head of the port authority, he is credited with having introduced and developed seaport terminals throughout the country. He was also the main project head of the [[Strong Republic Nautical Highway System]] of the Arroyo administration.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/business-usual/2016/01/11/1541334/game-changer |title=A game changer |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] |author=Reyes, M.A.L. |date=11 January 2016 |accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Cusi was then assigned by Arroyo to lead the [[Manila International Airport Authority]]. As an airport manager, he was responsible for finally opening the long-delayed [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] Terminal 3 in 2008.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; 

Cusi assumed leadership of the [[Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines]] (CAAP) in March 2010. Among his contributions to the agency is regaining the Category 1 status of the Philippine aviation industry from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) which finally allowed Philippine carriers to fly to the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/energy-department-needs-a-turbo-boost/ |title=Energy department needs a turbo boost |publisher=[[BusinessMirror]] |author=Hilario, E. |date=23 May 2016 |accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cusi resigned from CAAP in December 2010 and returned to his private businesses. He served in the board of [[Intex Resources]] Philippines which has a nickel and cobalt mining project in his home province of Oriental Mindoro. He was also involved in Double Concept Investments, Ltd. prior to his return to government service under President Rodrigo Duterte on June 30, 2016.&lt;ref name="inter"/&gt;

The '''Allied Quality Assurance Publications (AQAP)''' are standards for quality assurance systems that have been developed by [[NATO]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/stanags/current/4107eed08a8.pdf |title=Stanag 4107 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.difesa.it/SGD-DNA/STAFF/DT/NAVARM/Pagine/AQAP.aspx  |title=Link to current AQAP publications |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the AQAP agreement is to define standards for Quality Assurance of defence products. These standards are an integral part of contracts awarded in the military field involving NATO member countries. AQAP documents are therefore important to contractors and companies wanting to bid for such contracts.

The AQAP system is described in [[STANAG]] 4107 issued by the [[NATO Standardization Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nso.nato.int/nso/ |title=Nato Standardization Office homepage |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently two main types of AQAP documents; Contractual Type which are written as a Technical Specification intended for contractual use; and Guidance Type which provide general guidance.

== List of current AQAP publications ==

* AQAP 160 NATO Integrated Quality Requirements for Software throughout the Life Cycle
* AQAP 169 NATO Guidance on the Use of AQAP 160 Ed.1
* AQAP 2000 NATO Policy on an Integrated Systems Approach to Quality through the Life Cycle 
* AQAP 2009 NATO Guidance on the Use of the AQAP 2000 Series
* AQAP 2050 NATO Project Assessment Model
* AQAP 2070 NATO Mutual Government Quality Assurance (GQA) Process
* AQAP 2105 NATO Requirements for Deliverable Quality Plans
* AQAP 2110 NATO Quality Assurance Requirements for Design, Development and Production

'''Asher Karni''' ({{lang-he|אשר קרני}}; born 1954) is a [[South Africa|South African]] and [[Israelis|Israeli]] businessman known for his financial involvement and support for both the [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistani]] and [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israeli nuclear programs]]. Originally from [[Hungary]], he is a collaborator and associate of [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], and considered one of the prime suspects connected with the Khan Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schapiro|first=Mark|title=The Middleman|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2005/05/middleman|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and business ==

Karni originally came to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] in the mid-1980s to work for [[Bnei Akiva]], a [[Jewish]] [[Zionist youth movement]]. He remained in [[Cape Town]] and began work as a salesman, selling and buying electronic devices for a local electronics company.

== Nuclear proliferation ==

In early 2004, Karni was accused by the [[United States]] of being part of a conspiracy to sell stolen [[nuclear fuel|nuclear material]]. He was arrested while on holiday with his family in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. Chief Judge [[Thomas F. Hogan]] ordered Karni released on US$100,000 bail to [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Maryland]], having agreed to waive diplomatic immunity and wear an electronic surveillance device, but the US Government moved to have that ruling overturned.

== Involvement in the Khan network ==

Karni was accused of selling 200 [[Spark gap|triggered spark gap]]s to Humayun Khan, a [[Pakistan]]i man believed connected to a larger terrorist group in [[Jammu]] and [[Kashmir]]. The nuclear [[black market]] is believed to be very tightly knit and to have been headed by [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], a major figurehead of the Pakistani nuclear program, who was accused of illicitly transferring nuclear technology to multiple states such as [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].

==Criminal sentencing==

On Thursday, August 4, 2005 Karni was sentenced to three years in prison for the sale of restricted equipment to companies in India and Pakistan. His defense team requested eighteen months, while the maximum sentence is nine years. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Urbina told Karni that although he now believes Karni's deeds might have been done innocently, the longer than requested sentence was to "send a message", and that Karni's cooperation kept it from being longer.

'''Bleisure travel''' ('''UK''' /ˈbleʒ.əʳ/ '''US''' /ˈbliː.ʒɚ/) is a [[portmanteau]] of “[[business]]” and “[[leisure]]”, and, it refers to “the activity of combining [[business travel]] with leisure time”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionaryblog.cambridge.org/author/cambridgewords|title=About words. New words – 1 January 2018|last=|first=|date=1 January 2018|website=Cambridge Dictionary|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term bleisure was first published in 2009 by the Future Laboratory as part of their biannual Trend Briefing. The term was originally coined by writer and silent revolutionist, Jacob Strand, then a future forecaster working for The Future Laboratory. And co-written by journalist and futurologist Miriam Rayman.

In [[Corporate business travel|corporate business]] travel, extending a business trip for personal purposes is also known as “bizcation”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlex.com/vid/maximizing-the-value-of-641761817|title=Maximizing the value of conferences to communities: 'Bleisure Travel' and 'Bizcations' emerge with social media boosts.|last=Zak|first=Karen|date=2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon has been studied from 2011, from this year on, a report shows that bleisure travel has been maintaining a constant growth, accounting for 7% of all business trips.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.gbta.org/l/5572/2017-06-02/55l1xn|title=Extending business travel into leisure time – Bleisure study|last=Global Business Travel Association in partnership with Hilton|first=|date=June 2017|website=GBTA Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bleisure traveller profiles ==
Bleisure travellers can be described as “individuals who combine leisure with professional business obligations when abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lichy, McLeay|first=Jessica, Fraser|date=August 2017|title=Bleisure, motivation and typologies|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318878088_Bleisure_Motivations_and_Typologies?enrichId=rgreq-0166c8432de1f7b171f9bd6a403e0082-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzMxODg3ODA4ODtBUzo1MjMyMjc3MDI4NjE4MjRAMTUwMTc1ODYxMzY5Nw%3D%3D&amp;el=1_x_3&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|volume=|pages=|via=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;”.

The elements characterising bleisure travellers are some and different, this make difficult to draw a defined profile of these individuals. Bleisure is a widespread practice among US travellers, especially for those working in [[Technology]], [[Health system|Healthcare]], [[Public administration|Public Administration]] sectors. A report shows that US traveller add bleisure to nearly half of the cases, precisely 52% for International trips and 42% for domestic ones. The main reasons for travelling would be [[conference]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], [[team building]], client meetings and [[presentation]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.advertising.expedia.com/influencing-bleisure-travelers|title=Profile of American bleisure traveller|last=Expedia Media Solutions and Luth Research|first=|date=6 December 2016|website=Expedia Media Solutions Blog|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleisure travellers could be grouped according to various aspects, in particular [[gender]], [[Ageing|age]] and trip frequency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carlsonwagonlit.com/content/dam/cwt/pdf/insights/20160712-solutions-group-white-paper-bleisure.pdf|title=A quantitative look at the bleisure phenomenon|last=CWT Solutions Group|first=|date=July 2016|website=Carson Wagonlit Travel|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research indicates that female business travellers would be more likely to take bleisure trips than male. In both groups 20% of travellers would take one or more bleisure trips in a year time, however women look to register higher rate: 8.5% against 6.8% of men.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;To explain this observation, CWT have looked at the average number of bleisure trips per bleisure travellers per year, this was roughly the same value for both genders (1.4). However, women take overall fewer business trips than men, on average. This difference in the total amount of business travel is responsible for the higher bleisure rate measured in the female population.&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger travellers (between 20 and 25) look significantly more likely to add weekends to their business trips, measuring a rate close to 15%. This result is two or three times higher than those for 45-50 age interval.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;To explain this finding, CWT calculated the average number of bleisure trips  in each segment. Across the age range 20 to 65, this varies from 1.3 to 1.5 bleisure trips/year. At the same time, the amount of total travel varies much more significantly (+2 trips/year), from the 20-25 to the 45-50 age interval. The larger denominator in the bleisure rate is thus responsible for the lower values observed in the 45-50 group. Interpretation: these results show that travellers appear to have fixed capacity for bleisure: when they do it, they take 1 or bleisure trips per year, almost irrespective of how much they travel. In other words, bleisure does not scale with the total amount of travel.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Millennials]] travellers deserve a special attention because they appear to be the individuals shaping the future of business travel, nearly twice likely to travel for business than [[Baby boomers|Baby Boomers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This could be attributed to their flexible attitude to life, which would lead to the blurring of the line between their private and professional life. Millennials seem to work often from home or during the evening hours, to dedicate leisure on-goings to traditional work hours. A consequence of this freedom could be their willingness to extend business trips including [[vacation]] activities. In comparison with other age group, Millennials look to be more likely to take bleisure trips, compared to older travellers. However, it is not clear whether this reflects unique preferences or transitory life events.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Do take more bleisure trips than other generations did in their 20s and 30s? Or will Millennials take much fewer bleisure trips in later years? It seems possible that Millennials are actually different. One observation in particular would reinforce this idea: When business travellers have children, they seem to be equally likely to extend their trip, compared to those who do not have them. This would suggest that, when Millennials will have families in greater numbers, they may still take bleisure trips&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequent travellers taking 20 trips or more per year seem to be less than 5% likely to take a bleisure trip during the year, they would account for 8% of all bleisure trips. By contrast, one third of all bleisure trips would be taken by employees travelling once a month.

== Factors influencing the phenomenon ==
It seems evident that Millennials workers are increasingly demanding for bleisure from their work trip. Despite the state-of-the-art technology available nowadays, Millennials still prefer face-to-face meetings to get business done, therefore travel is still important for business companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.gbta.org/groups/reviews/item/20/11/2155|title=GBTA Business Traveler Sentiment Index™|last=GBTA Foundation|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleisure travel looks as a good opportunity to save on travel expenses, mostly for those who do not take a lot of vacation: 66% of US business traveller spend more money on leisure activities because of the money they save on travel. 60% take bleisure trips because do not have a lot of regular vacations. To decide whether to turn a business travel into bleisure or not, employee takes into consideration travelling on exciting destinations, additional costs required to extend the trip, how close the trip is to the weekend, the number of night they must stay for business, how affordable the hotel is, whether they have friends or family in the area, whether they can bring friends or family along. The general trend would indicate the addition of one or two days as the most frequent option, only 23% of bleisure travellers would extend their trips for more than three days. In many cases leisure days equal (37%) or even exceed business days (42%). The length of business trip seems to be a crucial factor when considering extending the trip in 62% of cases. In particular, when business days are more than three, bleisure travellers are not only likely to extend the trip, but also to visit different cities in the area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Advantages for employee and companies ==
For the [[Employment|employees]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vlex.com/vid/welcome-to-the-world-678428901|title="Welcome to the world of bleisure: the trend is growing of adding leisure time to the business trip."|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Compromise between work [[duties]] and leisure time;
* [[Career development]].
* Possibility to bring family or friend with them; 
* Improvement of their [[well-being]];
For the companies:
* Improvement of the knowledge about the culture of the location they’re visiting that would simplify business negotiations;
* Possibility to have happier and therefore more productive employees;
* Discounted rate offered by the hotels;
* Opportunity to recruit new workers and attempting to retain current ones.

== Main activities and destinations ==
The more likely bleisure destinations are cities offering a combination of different elements, which could allow the travellers to add leisure time to their business trip, such as sightseeing locations, [[Sports venue|sport venues]] and cultural events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The difference between the origin and the destination city seems to affect bleisure rates: in the case of domestic trips, the amount of bleisure is expected to be low because the two cities should be easily accessible and share similar culture. On the other hand, long intercontinental trips would offer the chance to know realities that are different from ordinary. Researches seem to confirm this trend: bleisure trips would account for 5.2% of the domestic trips and 9.7% of the international ones. The highest bleisure rate (18.4%) appears in international trips when the origin and destination cities are located in different geographical regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The top bleisure cities in [[United States|US]] are: [[Honolulu]] (above 20%), [[Miami]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Las Vegas]] (12-15%) [[New York City|NYC]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]] and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] (9-12%). In [[Europe]] rates looks lower, this could be due to the shorter domestic and continental routes: [[Lisbon]], [[Barcelona]], [[Nice]], [[Istanbul]] (8-11%), [[London]], [[Dublin]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Moscow]], [[Rome]], [[Geneva]], [[Paris]], [[Madrid]] (6-8%).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Corporate policy ==
Given that bleisure travel is a rising phenomenon, there is still no official regulation, therefore extending business trips for bleisure would have to be decided by [[management]] on a case-by-case basis. Some preventive measures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/the-atlas/bleisure-travel-policy/|title=American Express Global Business Travel|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; could be followed in advance to avoid misunderstanding.
* Companies have to differentiate between business and non-business amenities and declare what is willing to pay for; 
* Employees have to define when the business travel ends and when the leisure one starts;
* Company and employees must arrange a corporate travel insurance.

[[Image:Broadcast_Electronics_FM_Transmitter.jpg|200px|thumb|A Broadcast Electronics transmitter installed at [[WHJY]] in Providence, RI]]
'''Broadcast Electronics''' (BE) is a manufacturer of AM and FM [[transmitter]]s, Marti Electronics STL and [[Remote pickup unit|RPU]] equipment, developer of the AudioVAULT radio automation system and parent company to Commotion - a social media company for radio.

Founded in 1959 in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], BE initially manufactured endless loop cartridge "[[Fidelipac|cart]]" machines. Through the years, BE also manufactured [[phonograph|turntables]], [[Mixing console|audio consoles]], and program automation equipment which was the precursor to today’s [[Broadcast automation|automation systems]] for radio stations.

In 1977, BE relocated to [[Quincy, Illinois]] and it was there that BE began designing and manufacturing FM and AM [[transmitter]]s.  Initially the offering was for tube transmitters but their line also expanded to solid state broadcast transmitters.

The AudioVAULT automation system was one of the first [[digital audio]] storage and [[playout]] solutions for radio. AudioVAULT compensated for the slow PC processing speeds at the time by manufacturing their own [[sound card]]s and using off-bus technology. Today, AudioVAUL is in its 4th generation architecture since the time the technology was known as a "[[Fidelipac|cart]]" machine replacement product.

In 1994, BE acquired [[MARTI Electronics]]. Today, Marti Electronics equipment is also manufactured in Quincy, Illinois.

BE is the largest radio only equipment manufacturer in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bdcast.com/about-us/ |title =About Us |accessdate = 2015-06-22 |author = Broadcast Electronics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''city manager''' is an official appointed as the [[Administration (government)|administrative]] [[Management|manager]] of a city, in a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] form of city government. Local officials serving in this position are sometimes referred to as the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) or [[chief administrative officer]] (CAO) in some municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naperville.il.us/community_relations_government.aspx City of Naperville&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Dayton, Ohio]] suffered a great flood in 1913, and responded with the innovation of a paid, non-political city manager, hired by the commissioners to run the bureaucracy; civil engineers were especially preferred. Other small or middle sized American cities, especially in the West, adopted the idea.

In Europe, smaller cities in the Netherlands were specially attracted by the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Couperus, "The managerial revolution in local government: municipal management and the city manager in the USA and the Netherlands 1900–1940." ''Management &amp; Organizational History'' (2014) 9#4 pp: 336-352.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1940 there were small cities with city managers that grew enormously by the end of the century: Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; Rochester, New York; and San Diego, California.&lt;ref&gt;Harold A. Stone et al., ''City Manager Government in Nine Cities'' (1940); Frederick C. Mosher et al., ''City Manager Government in Seven Cities'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a technical sense, the term "city manager," as opposed to CAO, implies more discretion and independent authority that is set forth in a charter or some other body of [[codified law]], as opposed to duties being assigned on a varying basis by a single superior such as a mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Svara, James H. and Kimberly L. Nelson. (2008, August). Taking Stock of the Council-Manager Form at 100.

==History==
[[File:Municipal government diagram.png|thumb|500px|Municipal government diagram.]]
Most sources trace the first city manager to [[Staunton, Virginia]] in 1908. Some of the other cities that were among the first to employ a manager were [[Sumter, South Carolina]] (1912) and [[Dayton, Ohio]] (1914); Dayton was featured in the national media, and became a national standard. The first "City Manager's Association" meeting of eight city managers was in December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=City managing, a new profession |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/433/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Dec 14, 1914 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city manager, operating under the [[council-manager government]] form, was created in part to remove city government from the power of the political parties, and place management of the city into the hands of an outside expert who was usually a business manager or engineer, with the expectation that the city manager would remain neutral to city politics.  By 1930 200 American cities used a city manager form of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Bruce Fairbanks|author2=Patricia Mooney-Melvin|author3=Zane L. Miller|title=Making Sense of the City: Local Government, Civic Culture, and Community Life in Urban America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jT_3aZGDE4C&amp;pg=PA85|year=2001|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
As the top appointed official in the city, the city manager is typically responsible for most if not all of the day-to-day administrative operations of the municipality, in addition to other expectations.&lt;ref name=duties&gt;[http://bookstore.icma.org/FreeDocs/Council-Manager%20FAQ%20Brochure.pdf Council Manager Form of Government, ICMA publication]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duties#2"&gt;[http://icma.org/upload/library/2009-06/%7B660CAD64-A62D-4486-B22B-BDD53952F8AA%7D.pdf Sample Ordinance, ICMA.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the basic roles, responsibilities, and powers of a city manager include:
* Supervision of day-to-day operations of all city departments and staff through department heads;
* Oversight of all recruitment, dismissal, disciplining and suspensions;
* Preparation, monitoring, and execution of the city budget, which includes submitting each year to the council a proposed budget package with options and recommendations for its consideration and possible approval;
* Main technical advisor to the council on overall governmental operations;
* Public relations, such as meeting with citizens, citizen groups, businesses, and other stakeholders (the presence of a mayor may alter this function somewhat);
* Operating the city with a professional understanding of how all city functions operate together to their best effect;
*Attends all council meetings, but does not have any voting rights&lt;ref name="Nelson 49–61"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Roles of Local Government Managers in Theory and Practice: A Centennial Perspective|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12296/abstract|journal = Public Administration Review|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1540-6210|pages = 49–61|volume = 75|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/puar.12296|first = Kimberly L.|last = Nelson|first2 = James H.|last2 = Svara}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Additional duties that may be assigned by the council&lt;ref name="duties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="duties#2"/&gt;

The responsibilities may vary depending upon charter provisions and other local or state laws, rules, and regulations. In addition, many states, such as the states of New Hampshire and Missouri, have codified in law the minimum functions a local "manager" must perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C000-099/0780000610.HTM MRS] [http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/III/37/37-6.htm NH RSA]&lt;/ref&gt; The City Manager position focuses on efficiency and providing a certain level of service for the lowest possible cost.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Lynn. "The Impact Of Government Structure On Local Public Expenditures." Public Choice 136.3/4 (2008): 457-473. Political Science Complete. Web. 25 Sept. 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; The competence of a city manager can be assessed using composite indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manager members of the ICMA are bound by a rather rigid and strongly enforced code of ethics that was originally established in 1924. Since that time the code had been up-dated/revised on seven occasions, the latest taking place in 1998. The updates have taken into account the evolving duties, responsibilities, and expectations of the profession; however the core dictate of the body of the code--“to integrity; public service; seek no favor; exemplary conduct in both personal and professional matters; respect the role and contributions of elected officials; exercise the independence to do what is right; political neutrality; serve the public equitably and governing body members equally; keep the community informed about local government matters; and support and lead our employ-ees”—have not changed since the first edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?bcid=72&amp;hsid=1&amp;ssid1=2514&amp;ssid2=2570&amp;ssid3=2571 |title=ICMA Code of Ethics page |access-date=2009-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106171929/http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?bcid=72&amp;hsid=1&amp;ssid1=2514&amp;ssid2=2570&amp;ssid3=2571 |archive-date=2007-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile==
In the early years of the profession, most managers came from the ranks of the engineering professions.&lt;ref name=stillman&gt;Stillman, Richard J. (1974). ''The Rise of the City Manager: A Public Professional in Local Government.'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the typical and preferred background and education for the beginning municipal manager is a master's degree in Public Administration (MPA) and at least several years’ experience as a department head in local government or as an assistant city manager. As of 2005 more than 60% of those in the profession had a MPA, MBA, or other related higher-level degree.&lt;ref name="ICMA#1"&gt;[http://icma.org/main/bc.asp?ssid1=2868&amp;ssid3=2868&amp;from=search&amp;hsid=9&amp;bcid=812 ICMA statistics]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average tenure of a manager is now 7–8 years and has risen gradually over the years. Tenures tend to be less in smaller communities and higher in larger ones, and they tend to vary as well depending on the region of the country.&lt;ref name="ICMA#1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ammons, David M and Matthew J. Bosse. (2005). “Tenure of City Managers: Examining the Dual Meanings of ‘Average Tenure’.” ''State &amp; Local Government Review'', Vol. 37, No. 1, pp. 61-71. at: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4355387]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1403">The first idea of a digital administrative law was born in Italy in 1978 by Giovanni Duni and was developed in 1991 with the name [[teleadministration]] (look).
In the [[public administration]] [[debate]] about [[New Public Management]] (NPM), the concept of '''digital era governance''' (or '''DEG''') is claimed by [[Patrick Dunleavy]], [[Helen Margetts]] and their co-authors as replacing NPM since around 2000-05. DEG has three key elements: reintegration (bringing issues back into government control, like US airport security after 9/11); needs-based holism (reorganizing government around distinct client groups); and [[digitizing|digitization]] (fully exploiting the potential of digital storage and Internet communications to transform governance).

'''Eduardo Georgetti''' (October 11, 1866 – 1937), was an agriculturist, businessman, philanthropist, and politician. Georgetti, who came from a family of prosperous land owners, became one of Puerto Rico's wealthiest sugar barons and benefactors. In 1917, he became the [[1st Puerto Rican Senate|first Vice-president of the Puerto Rican Senate]].

==Early years==
Georgetti (sometimes also spelled as "'''Giorgetti'''") was born in the town of [[Manati, Puerto Rico|Manatí]]. His father was Dr. Pedro Juan Giorgetti Battesti, an immigrant from [[Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico|Corsica]] and his mother Guadalupe Fernandez Vanga y Freites, native of Puerto Rico whose family were land owners. He became orphaned at a young age and went to live with his maternal uncle. He received his primary education in the ''Colegio de los Jesuitas de San Juan'' (School of the Jesuits of San Juan). Georgetti inherited the lands of his parents which his uncle administrated, during the time that he was in [[Corsica]] pursuing his secondary education at the ''Liceo de Córcega'' (Lyceum of Corsica).&lt;ref name="PIB"&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/super2/barceloneta/personasimportantes/politica/eduardogeorgetti.html Personas Importantes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sugar baron==
Upon his return to Puerto Rico he found that the lands which he had left in the hands of his uncle had prospered enormously. Georgetti married Aúrea Balseiro Dávila in 1888. Together with is father-in-law, Rafael Balseiro, he purchased a company called ''Florida Agrícola'' and renamed it ''Sociedad Agrícola Industrial Balseiro y Georgetti'' (the Balseiro and Georgetti Industrial Agricultural Society). Georgetti founded and was the owner of the ''Plazuela Sugar Company,'' a sugar refinery, in the town of [[Barceloneta, Puerto Rico|Barceloneta]] which had its own dock that was used to transport sugar by barge to the waiting ships on the ocean. The company, which was the core of his fortune, was the main source of income and employment of the towns' inhabitants.&lt;ref name="PIB"/&gt; 

Georgetti expanded his sugar industry empire by purchasing land and other sugar refineries. Among the sugar plantations which Georgetti purchased were ''Los Canos'' in [[Arecibo]] and the ''Central Plata,'' in which he served as the corporation's president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carloslopezdzur.blogspot.com/2009/07/cronologia-del-comercio-y-la-indudstria.html Cronologia del Comercio y la indudstria]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the owner of the island's second largest pineapple plantation. Giorgetti was also a member of the board of directors of various banks, including the American Colonial Bank, ''Banco Comercial de Puerto Rico'' and ''Banco Nova Scotia.''&lt;ref name="EG"&gt;Eduardo Giorgetti Y Su Mundo: La Aparente Paradoja De Un Millonario Genio Empresarial Y Su Noble Humanismo"; by [[Delma S. Arrigoitia]]; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto; {{ISBN|0-942347-52-8}}; {{ISBN|978-0-942347-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
It was common practice in Puerto Rico for businessmen to become involved in politics.&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt; On December 23, 1897, Georgetti was named Mayor of Barceloneta by Sabas Marin Gonzalez, the then-appointed Spanish governor of Puerto Rico. After the United States invaded Puerto Rico and the island became a U.S. territory as a result of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, which ended the [[Puerto Rico Campaign|Spanish–American War]], the military-appointed governor, Major General John R. Brooke, permitted, upon the advice of Luis Muñoz Rivera, that Georgetti continue as mayor. Under the new administration, Barceloneta was merged with the town of [[Manati, Puerto Rico|Manati]], as part of a joint municipality. Georgetti did not agree with this, and fought successfully for the re-establishment of Barceloneta as a separate, stand-alone municipality.&lt;ref name="EG"/&gt;        

Georgetti continued to serve as mayor of Barceloneta from 1897 to 1898. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico, which supported the Spanish government headed by [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta]], which had promised an autonomous government for Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="HB"&gt;[http://www.ortizal.com/barceloneta.html Historia de Barceloneta]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Spanish–American War]], when Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States, Georgetti, together with his friend [[Luis Muñoz Rivera]], [[Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón]], [[Antonio R. Barceló]] and [[José de Diego]], founded the Union Party of Puerto Rico. The party won the elections in 1904 and Georgetti was elected to the Puerto Rican House of Representatives. This Union Party opposed the passage of the U.S. [[Foraker Act]], which extended every U.S. federal law into Puerto Rico, and subsumed the entire body of Puerto Rico's statutory and regulatory code under the framework of U.S. federal law. The Union Party also favored the acquisition of greater political autonomy for Puerto Rico, as a pathway to full independence.

In 1916, Georgetti's long-time friend Luis Muñoz Rivera fell gravely ill in [[New York City]] and returned to Puerto Rico, staying in Georgetti's house to recuperate. Georgetti summoned Muñoz Rivera's wife and son, [[Luis Muñoz Marin]], to Puerto Rico and informed them that he was suffering from an infection that had begun in the [[gallbladder]], before expanding throughout his body.&lt;ref name="p.22"&gt;Bernier-Grand et al., p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 1916, Muñoz Rivera died during his stay in the Georgetti residence. Georgetti's 1914 [[Pierce Arrow]] [[automobile]] was used in the statesman's funeral procession. Together with a group of friends, Georgetti purchased Muñoz Rivera's newspaper ''La Democracia'' and provided Muñoz Rivera's widow Amalia Marín Castilla with a small monthly pension. ''La Democracia'' also provided Rivera's son, Muñoz Marin, with an outlet to publish his written works. Georgetti also purchased the Muñoz Rivera home in 1916 and donated it together with the Pierce Arrow car to the town of [[Barranquitas, Puerto Rico|Barranquitas]] to be preserved as a national monument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/puerto_rico/visitors_info/eng/article_detail.php?nt_id=261&amp;ct_id=3 Caribbean Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Muñoz Rivera's death, Barceló became the leading force behind the Union Party and its liberal ideas for the island. In the elections of 1917, the Union Party was victorious. Antonio R. Barceló was named President of the [[Puerto Rican Senate]] and Georgetti was named vice-president, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to hold said position. In 1924, Barceló later formed a political coalition with [[José Tous Soto]], the president of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico, and founded the [[Alianza Puertorriqueña]] (''Puerto Rican Alliance''). This coalition came about because both Barceló and Tous Soto came to believe that neither independence nor statehood would be considered by the United States. Therefore, rather than wage a futile political battle, their "Alliance"  would concentrate on Puerto Rico's economic situation. This led to ideological conflict between Georgetti and Barceló. 

Georgetti was committed to the original ''independentista'' ideals of the Union Party, and found these incompatible with an "economic partnership" with the United States, as espoused by the Alliance coalition. Barceló and a group of party delegates had traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to seek changes in the [[Jones–Shafroth Act|Jones Act]] of 1917, by claiming that the Puerto Rican economy was sound and that Puerto Ricans were capable of electing their own governor. In response, Georgetti traveled to Washington as a representative of various island organizations, among them the Agriculturist Association and the Association of Sugar Producers. The group which he represented became known by the press as the ''Fuerzas Vivas'' (Live Forces). 

Georgetti and the ''Fuerzas Vivas'' submitted a "Fiscal Memorandum" to the U.S. Secretary of War, which presented a much bleaker view of the Puerto Rican economy. According to this memorandum, the island was on the brink of economic ruin unless it diversified its agricultural production, and become less dependent on the sugar industry as its sole source of income. Georgetti's actions were viewed by Barceló as an attempt by Georgetti and the ''Fuerzas Vivas'' to discredit Barceló and weaken the Alliance. Georgetti denied this, and quit the Alliance.&lt;ref name="El Pensador"&gt;[http://www.ellibrepensador.com/2010/01/06/gente-de-mi-pueblo-jeremias-beauchamp/ El Pensador]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Pensador"/&gt;

In 1923, Georgetti and his wife built a mansion in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]]. Known as the "Mansion Georgetti," it was located on the ''Avenida Ponce de León'' (Ponce de León Avenue), designed and built by [[Czech people|Czech]] architect [[Antonin Nechodoma]], and considered to be the grandest mansion in the [[Caribbean]] at the time.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;[http://www.prfrogui.com/home/mansion.htm Mansion Georgetti]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to the mansion, Georgetti lived in a [[Rio Piedras]] house built in 1868. The house, known as the "Casa Georgetti," is the oldest Spanish colonial structure in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Casa Georgetti"&gt;[http://www.grf.pr/casa-georgetti Casa Georgetti]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Georgetti and his wife did not have any offspring, however they were the benefactors of many talented children who lacked the economic means to pursue an education. As a [[philanthropist]], he was a sponsor of the arts and sciences. Georgetti was also the president of the Children's Tuberculosis Sanitarium of Puerto Rico. 

Eduardo Georgetti died in his Santurce residence in 1937. His wife Aúrea died the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/BiografiasPr/eduardo_georgetti.htm Eduardo Georgetti]&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Mansion Georgetti'' was sold in 1971, demolished, and replaced with an apartment building complex.&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt; 

The ''Casa Georgetti'' in Rio Piedras was landmarked and restored to its original condition.&lt;ref name="Casa Georgetti"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The town of Barceloneta honored Georgetti's memory by naming a principal avenue and an urbanization (Villa Georgetti) after him. In the town of Santurce there is also a theater, ''Teatro Georgetti,'' named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foro.univision.com/t5/Cesar-Evora/Pareja-Abierta-TEATRO-GEORGETTI-SANTURCE/m-p/301529206 Univision]&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities in Puerto Rico have honored his memory by naming several streets after him, including [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Humacao, Puerto Rico|Humacao]], [[Comerio, Puerto Rico|Comerio]] and [[Vega Alta, Puerto Rico|Vega Alta]].

'''Ernesto Carlos Tornquist''' (31 December 1842 – 17 June 1908) is considered to be one of the most important entrepreneurs in Argentina at the end of the 19th century.  The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world.  Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in [[Buenos Aires]], the [[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partido]] of [[Tornquist Partido|Tornquist]] and [[Tornquist, Buenos Aires|Tornquist]] its main city, in the south of [[Buenos Aires Province]].

== Biography ==
Born in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist (1801-1876), a [[Lutheran]] born in [[Baltimore]], United States and whose parents came from a [[Germany|German]] family in the city of [[Hamburg]] with roots in [[Karlskrona]] in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of [[Bremen]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a [[Catholic]], was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of [[yellow fever]] in 1871.

Tornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evangélica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of [[Krefeld]] for two years.  On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which [[export]]ed [[wool]] and [[leather]] and [[import]]ed [[agricultural machinery]].  In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law’s company which was now renamed, ''Ernesto Tornquist y Cia''.  With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries.  The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Rios]],  previously occupied by Indians.  In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, ''Refineria Argentina'', in [[Rosario]].  Other initiatives included founding the ''Bieckert'' brewery, the ''Seeber'' [[margarine]] manufacturer and the ''Bianchetti'' [[Weighing scale|scale]] manufacturer.
[[File:Marriott Plaza Hotel Buenos Aires, Argentina - exterior.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Marriott Plaza Hotel]]

On 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province.  From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and [[Volga German]] immigrants.  After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company ''Sansinena'' and its cold-storage plant ''La Negra'' in [[Villa Riachuelo|Riachuelo]] and set up the plant ''Cuartreros'' in [[Bahía Blanca]].

Amongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia Islands]] through  the ''Compañía Argentina de Pesca'', oil exploration in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], the exploitation of [[Quebracho tree|quebracho]] in [[Santiago del Estero]] and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital.

Ernesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister [[Estanislao Zeballos]].  He represented the German armaments group [[Krupp]] in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil.

In 1903 he built the [[estancia]], ''Sierra de la Ventana'', in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect [[Carlos Nordmann]] in [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic]] style typical of German castles in the [[Rhine|Rhine Valley]].  The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, [[Carlos Thays]].

He maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents [[Julio A. Roca]] and [[Carlos Pellegrini]] and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of [[José Figueroa Alcorta]] (1906-1910).

In 1909 he built the [[Marriott Plaza Hotel, Buenos Aires|Plaza Hotel]] (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martin]] in Buenos Aires.

He died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.

'''Financial mismanagement''' is management that, deliberately or not, is handled in a way that can be characterized as "wrong, bad, careless, inefficient or incompetent" and that will reflect negatively upon the financial standing of a business or individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/mismanagement|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways of how financial mismanagement is carried out. For example, the wrong distribution of responsibility, to be remiss with payments, [[Invoice|bills]] and taxes and neglecting responsibility, financial problems and economical standing can cause great financial mismanagement and further on devastate your [[economy]]. By looking to various cases where the financial management has gone wrong we will be able to comprehend the effect financial mismanagement can have and how crucial it is for an economy´s success to carry out well working financial management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dealing With Personal Financial Mismanagement|url=http://moneystartinfo.com/2013/01/22/dealing-with-personal-financial-mismanagement/|publisher=MoneyStartInfo|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Financial management has always been key to a [[Goal|successful]] [[business]], and is crucial for an economy to function. There are not only companies and [[individuals]] that have economies that rely on financial management but also entire [[societies]] and [[countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Management|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/21926|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* From 2007 till 2015 the Feyenoord company "list en bedrog" was responsible  for the financial mismanagement inside the top of the direction. Eric Gudde also called the "self employed dictator of the republic Feyenoord-Korea" ([[portmanteau]] of "Feyenoord" and "Noord-Korea", [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "[[North Korea]]"). Together with Martin van Geel he was responsible  for destroying the total club. During this period there were no consequences for the two self-employed dictators of the republic Feyenoord-Korea. 
Throughout the years there have been infinite companies, persons and also countries that have been declared bankrupt, caused by financial mismanagement. By taking a look at some of the worlds largest economies we can find cases where the [[financial management]] has somehow gone wrong and will depict how severe the effect of financial mismanagement can actually lead out to be. 
* [[Argentina]], with its many natural resources, well-educated workforce and export-oriented agricultural sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina- Country Profile|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/country_profiles/1192478.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is today Latin America´s third largest [[economy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina|url=http://icma.org/en/international/regions/Country/1013/Argentina|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Argentine economy has been through quite a few ups and downs. In 2001 this led to a severe [[recession]] and ever-increasing poverty. This economical crisis was inter alia caused by the country's increasing public [[debt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Things to Know About Argentine Debt Crisis|url=http://americasmarkets.usatoday.com/2014/07/31/5-things-to-know-about-argentine-debt-crisis/|publisher=America´s Markets|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By the end of 2009 Greece experienced one of the most severe economical collapses in today's society. The crisis had severe results and for instance resulted in great public poverty. In [[Athens]], 20 per cent of the shops were all of a sudden completely empty and in February 2012 it was reported that 20,000 Greeks, during the proceeding year had been made destitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greece´s Financial Crisis Explained|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/BUSINESS/02/10/greek.debt.qanda/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By years of unrestrained governmental spending, cheap lending and a failing try at implementing financial reforms [[Greece]] was left badly off when the global economical crisis struck and the country had loans they were completely unable to repay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nejati|first1=Mehran|last2=Nejati|first2=Mostafa|title=Global Business and Management Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=no&amp;lr=&amp;id=P8Q6CcabXdQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=greek+financial+crisis&amp;ots=QzwnCqtUH8&amp;sig=J3BZ47R0n7NlAEoqpdveE9i78Gw#v=onepage&amp;q=greek%20financial%20crisis&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 October 2014|format=PDF.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2008 the company [[Lehman Brothers]] filed for bankruptcy, after being the fourth largest investment bank in the U.S at the time. By lending severe amounts to fund the company´s investing for example housing-related assets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lartey|first1=Richard|title=What Caused the Collapse of Lehman Brothers?|ssrn=2130200|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the financial services firm extremely exposed to the financial downturn and subprime crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lehman Brother´s Bankruptcy - Lessons Learned for the Survivors|url=http://www.pwc.com/en_JG/jg/events/Lessons-learned-for-the-survivors.pdf|publisher=PWC|accessdate=21 October 2014|format=PDF.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are numerous examples of where [[finance]]s are not managed right and where companies, individuals and even countries are liquidated, and even more examples where there has been episodes of financial mismanagement but the situation was still able to be escaped.

==Prevention==
Financial mismanagement will always be a possible [[problem]], for businesses, individuals and also entire countries. To prevent personal financial mismanagement it is important to have financial education from an early age. For a [[business]] to succeed in their [[finances]] it is crucial to [[employ]] people with the right qualifications and experiences and to continuously appraise the financial state within the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waters|first1=Maxine|title=How to Prevent Another Financial Crisis|url=http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/how-to-prevent-another-financial-crisis-1062243-1.html|publisher=American Banker|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13015">A '''flow-through entity''' ('''FTE''') is a [[Legal personality|legal entity]] where income "flows through" to investors or owners; that is, the income of the entity is treated as the income of the investors or owners. Flow-through entities are also known as '''pass-through entities''' or '''fiscally-transparent entities'''. Depending on the local tax regulations, this structure can avoid [[dividend tax]] and [[double taxation]] because only owners or investors are taxed on the revenue. Technically, for tax purposes, flow-through entities are considered "non-entities" because they are not taxed; rather, taxation "flows-through" to another tax return.

Common types of FTEs are [[general partnerships]], [[limited partnership]]s and [[limited liability partnerships]]. In the United States, additional types of FTE include [[S corporation]]s, [[income trust]]s and [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]].

Most countries require an FTE (or its owners) to file an annual return reporting the shares of income allocated to owners, and to provide each owner with a statement of allocated income to enable owners to report their shares of income on their own tax returns. In the United States, the statement of allocated income is known as form '''K-1''' (or '''Schedule K-1''').

==Definitions==
According to [[International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation]] (IBFD) a pass-through entity or flow-through entity (FTE) is a "non-taxable entity, such as a partnership, under which the income or expense is generally regarded as income or expense of the participants under the transparency principle."&lt;ref name="IBFD_2009"&gt;{{cite book |title=IBFD International Tax Glossary |isbn=9789087220570 |agency=International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation (IBFD) |year=2009 |first=Julie |last=Rogers-Glabush |edition=7 |pages=550}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|313}} FTEs are based on [[conduit theory]] or [[pipeline theory]] which is defined as a "method of integrating the taxation at the entity and participator level under which income or deductions flow through from the entity to its participators. The entity is in effect regarded as an extension of the participators. A partnership is generally taxed according to the conduit system. The conduit system may be contrasted with the classical system."&lt;ref name="IBFD_2009"/&gt;{{rp|89}}

==Types of FTEs==
In the United States, pass-through entities include "sole proprietorships, partnerships and [[S corporation]]s that ... pay taxes at the individual rate of their owners"&lt;ref name="NYT_Parlapiano_taxplan_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/03/us/politics/five-changes-for-families-in-the-republican-tax-bill.html |title=The Five Biggest Changes for Families in the Republican Tax Bill |first=Alicia |last=Parlapiano |date=November 2, 2017  |access-date=December 3, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[income trust]]s and [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]].

According to ''CNN Money'', in the United States, most "businesses are set up as pass-throughs, not corporations"&lt;ref name="CNN_Senate_taxreform_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/02/pf/taxes/senate-tax-bill-passed/index.html |title=Here's what's in the Senate tax bill - and how it differs from the House's bill |first=Jeanne |last=Sahadi |newspaper=CNN Money |date=December 2, 2017 |access-date=December 3, 2017 |quote="The House bill dropped the top income tax rate to 25% from 39.6%, while prohibiting anyone providing professional services (e.g., lawyers and accountants) from taking advantage of the lower rate. It also phases in a lower rate of 9% for businesses that earn less than $75,000. The Senate bill lowers taxes on filers in pass-throughs by letting them deduct 23% of their income, up from 17.4% originally. The 23% deduction would be prohibited for anyone in a service business -- except those with taxable incomes under $500,000 if married ($250,000 if single). Prevent abuse of pass-through tax break: If the owner or partner in a pass-through also draws a salary from the business, that money would be subject to ordinary income tax rates. But to prevent people from recharacterizing their wage income as business profits to get the benefit of the pass-through deduction, the Senate bill would automatically limit the deduction to half of the W-2 wages of the pass-through entity or its share to the individual taxpayer. The W-2 rule would not apply, however, if the filer's taxable income is under $500,000 if married, $250,000 if single."}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "means their profits are passed through to the owners, shareholders and partners, who pay tax on them on their personal returns under ordinary income tax rates."&lt;ref name="vox_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/2/16724738/senate-tax-vote-house-bill-differences |title=Republicans still have a lot of differences between the House and Senate tax bills to hash out: The House and Senate now have to pass the same tax bill. Here’s where the two diverge|authors=Dylan Scott and Tara Golshan  |date=December 2, 2017 |access-date=December 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words pass-through businesses are not "taxed like corporations and instead pay taxes on business income as if it were personal income."&lt;ref name="vox_2017"/&gt;

===Sole proprietorships===

A sole proprietor is "someone who owns an unincorporated business by himself or herself." However, if you are the sole member of a domestic limited liability company (LLC), you are not a sole proprietor if you elect to treat the LLC as a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/sole-proprietorships&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, sole proprietors "must report all business income or losses on [their] personal income tax return; the business itself is not taxed separately. The IRS refers to this as "pass-through" taxation, because business profits pass through the business to be taxed on your personal tax return.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses&lt;/ref&gt;

===S corporation===
{{main|S corporation}}
While an S corporation shareholders are subject to tax on their "pro rata shares of income" based on their shareholdings in the S corporation which is not itself taxed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_S.html 26 USC 1361-1368.].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bond and bond option sales strategy (BOSS)===

FTEs included in the 2009 ''IBFD International Tax Glossary'' included the ''Bond and Bond Option Sales Strategy'' (BOSS) transaction] referring to an "investment strategy developed in the United States to generate tax losses without a corresponding economic loss. The transaction involves the use of a partnership or other flow-through entity that makes an investment in a foreign corporation that is capitalized for the purpose of carrying out the transaction. Variants of Boss Transactions are referred to as Son of Boss Transactions.&lt;ref name="IBFD_2009"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

==Chronology==
According to a report published by Brookings in May 2017, in the early 1980s almost all business income in the United States was generated by [[C corporations]]. In terms of [[Income tax in the United States]] C corporations are taxed separately from their owners.&lt;ref name="Brookings_Kruptin_2017"/&gt;

In December 2004 the ''Financial Asset Securitization Investment'' (FASIT) which was a flow-through entity formed in the United States, was repealed. FASIT was an investment instrument in "non-mortgage receivable pools such as credit card receivables, automobile loans, construction loans, and finance leases." FASITS in existence on October 24, 2004 were exempted from the repeal.&lt;ref name="IBFD_2009"/&gt;{{rp|179}}

By 2005 the US Internal Revenue Service viewed Son of Boss as "an abusive transaction aggressively marketed in the late 1990s and 2000 primarily to wealthy individuals." The IRS began a "settlement initiative" which "required taxpayers to concede 100 percent of the claimed tax losses and pay a penalty of either 10 percent or 20 percent unless they previously disclosed the transactions to the IRS."&lt;ref name="IRS_2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-collects-32-billion-from-son-of-boss-final-figure-should-top-35-billion |title=IRS Collects $3.2 Billion from Son of Boss; Final Figure Should Top $3.5 Billion |date=March 24, 2005 |access-date=December 3, 2017 |agency=U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2013, "only 44 percent of the income of business owners was earned through C-corporations."&lt;ref name="Brookings_Kruptin_2017"/&gt;

Starting in 2013, [[Kansas]] Governor [[Sam Brownback]] undertook what was described by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in a June 2017 article as the United States' "most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy".&lt;ref name="theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/kansass-conservative-tax-experiment-is-dead/529551/ |title=The Death of Kansas's Conservative Experiment |date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=June 7, 2017 |quote=Republicans in the state legislature on Tuesday voted to reverse Governor Sam Brownback’s signature tax cuts, dealing a blow to the kind of fiscal policy the Trump administration wants to enact nationally.|first=Russell |last=Berman}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013 to 2017, 300,000 businesses as pass-through income entities, benefited from the complete tax exemption.

By 2017, pass-through businesses earned the "majority of business income" in the United States and "owners of S-corporations and partnerships now earn about half of all income from businesses."&lt;ref name="Brookings_Kruptin_2017"&gt;{{cite report |title=9 facts about pass-through businesses |first1=Aaron |last1=Krupkin |first2=Adam |last2=Looney|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses/#fact4 |agency=Brookings |date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a September 2017 article in the ''New York Times'', about "95 percent of companies in the United States are structured as pass-through entities, generating the bulk of the government’s tax revenues."&lt;ref name="NYT_Gelles_taxplan_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/business/trump-tax-businesses.html |title=In Trump Tax Plan, a Windfall for Businesses Large and Small |first=David |last=Gelles |date=September 28, 2017  |access-date=December 3, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2017 the U.S. Senate passed a tax overhaul bill as part of the proposed [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] that reduced taxes on pass-through business income by allowing them to "deduct 23% of their income".&lt;ref name="CNN_Senate_taxreform_2017"/&gt; The Senate added features to the bill to prevent abuse.&lt;ref name="CNN_Senate_taxreform_2017"/&gt; In a November article, the ''New York Times'' reported that the tax bill would "[r]educe the pass-through tax rate to 25% regardless of income level. Since 95% of businesses are incorporated as pass-through entities.&lt;ref name="NYT_Gelles_taxplan_2017"/&gt; Examples include "sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate of their owners."&lt;ref name="NYT_Parlapiano_taxplan_2017"/&gt; whose owners pay taxes as if it were personal income at a much lower rate. This represents a large tax cut for owners that is capital as opposed to labor. Approximately the largest 2% of pass-through businesses represent 40% of pass-through income and today are taxed at 39.6%, the top individual rate."&lt;ref name="NYT_Parlapiano_taxplan_2017"/&gt;

'''Gerard Kerkum''' (17 December 1930 – 26 May 2018)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ad.nl/nederlands-voetbal/feyenoord-icoon-gerard-kerkum-overleden~a30549b9/&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] footballer and was twice chairman of Dutch football team [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]].

Kerkum, born in [[Rotterdam]], played a total of 349 matches in Feyenoord's (Feijenoord in those days) first team from 1951 to 1965. He was the team's captain for many years and scored a total of 13 goals for the club. He played one match for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]].

After his career Kerkum entered the Feyenoord staff and board before he became the first and to present only former Feyenoord player to be chairman of the club in 1982. He stayed at the club until 1989, when Feyenoord suffered with financial problems and was succeeded by [[Jorien van den Herik]]. In 1984 Feyenoord won the double, winning both the [[Eredivisie]] and the [[KNVB Cup]].

In the time that Van den Herik was Feyenoord's chairman (1989–2006) Kerkum was no longer part of the team, but always stayed in contact with those who were. After the growing pressure on Van den Herik in the media and by the fans in 2006 due to financial trouble and underachievements Feyenoord decided that the club's future had to be re-evaluated. This was done by a newly formed commission called the Commissie Kerkum, led by Gerard Kerkum.

The Commissie Kerkum had several meetings and finally came to the conclusion things at the club had to change. One of the results was that Van den Herik had to leave the club in December 2006. As Feyenoord was unable to find a new chairman right away Van den Herik was temporary replaced by Kerkum himself, until the end of the 2006–07 season. From then on [[Dick van Well]] took over as the new chairman at the club.

'''Judicus Marinus Henricus Jacobus "Henry" Keizer''' (born 4 November 1960) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] businessman and a former [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy#Leadership|Chairman of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], the leading political party in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://nos.nl/artikel/661072-henry-keizer-nieuwe-vvdvoorzitter.html Henry Keizer nieuwe VVD-voorzitter], NOS, 14 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.elsevier.nl/Politiek/nieuws/2014/6/Henry-Keizer-gekozen-als-nieuwe-partijvoorzitter-VVD-1542119W/ Henry Keizer gekozen als nieuwe partijvoorzitter VVD], Elsevier, 14 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Keizer was elected on 14 June 2014. On 26 May 2015, Keizer stated that the Netherlands should introduce an [[Election threshold|electoral threshold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://nos.nl/artikel/2037740-vvd-wil-kiesdrempel-tegen-te-kleine-partijen.html VVD wil kiesdrempel tegen te kleine partijen], NOS, 26 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He also declared that he would make [[integrity]] a central theme.

In April 2017 the Dutch platform for investigative journalism Follow the Money (FTM) published an article that accused Henry Keizer and three partners claiming that they had unfairly enriched themselves by buying an enterprise at a price that was below the actual value. It was also claimed that there was a conflict of interest, as Keizer was also an advisor to the sellers. Keizer denied the allegations and stated that they had done nothing wrong and claimed that the take-over was based on independent audit reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VVD-praeses Henry Keizer ontkent zelfverrijking met uitvaartorganisatie|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/vvd-praeses-henry-keizer-ontkent-zelfverrijking-met-uitvaartorganisatie-100-procent-schoon-geweten~a4490083/|publisher=de Volkskrant|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former owners of the company officially supported this statement.

His party for the time being decided not to consult its Integrity Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.nl/nederland/achtergrond/2017/04/vvd-reageert-koeltjes-op-schandaal-rond-voorzitter-keizer-497442/ VVD reageert koeltjes op schandaal rond voorzitter Keizer, [[Elsevier]], 22 April 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; Later on at the request of Keizer the Integrity Committee of the VVD did start an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rd.nl/vandaag/politiek/integriteitsonderzoek-naar-vvd-voorzitter-1.1397233 Integriteitsonderzoek naar VVD-voorzitter], RD, 29 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Pending the results he decided to temporarily suspend his duties as president of the VVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rtlz.nl/algemeen/politiek/henry-keizer-legt-vvd-voorzitterschap-voorlopig-neer-om-omstreden-deal|title=Henry Keizer legt VVD-voorzitterschap voorlopig neer om omstreden deal|website=rtlz.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 2017 Pieter Lakeman of the Dutch Foundation for Research Business Information (SOBI) filed a complaint against Keizer and his partners at the prosecutor's office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiek.eenvandaag.nl/tv-items/74107/aangifte_van_oplichting_tegen_vvd_er_henry_keizer Een Vandaag, aangifte van oplichting tegen VVD-er Henry Keizer], May 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; SOBI at the same time also filed a disciplinary complaint against the external auditor of the company at the Disciplinary Court for Accountants (Dutch Accountantskamer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accountant.nl/contentassets/8400a05e3b3844f884c34c72a5a550bc/tuchtklachtey10mei2017.pdf|website=Accountant.nl|publisher=Accountant|accessdate=10 May 2017|title=Tuchtklacht tegen drs. M de Kimpe RA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2017 Keizer stepped down as Party Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verklaring Henry Keizer, partijvoorzitter VVD|url=https://www.vvd.nl/nieuws/verklaring-henry-keizer-partijvoorzitter-vvd/|website=VVD|publisher=VVD|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Party Congress later that year Christianne van der Wal was elected as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christianne van der Wal is de nieuwe partijvoorzitter|url=https://www.vvd.nl/nieuws/christianne-van-der-wal-is-de-nieuwe-partijvoorzitter/|website=VVD|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January 2018, the Dutch ‘Accountantskamer’ ruled and rejected all complaints and accusations against the accountant made by SOBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rechter spreekt accountant voormalig VVD-partijvoorzitter Keizer vrij|url=https://www.ad.nl/politiek/rechter-spreekt-accountant-voormalig-vvd-partijvoorzitter-keizer-vrij~ae1c50ca/|website=AD.nl|publisher=AD|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Business administration}}An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions. '''Incident management''' ('''IcM''') is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. These incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an [[incident response team]] (IRT), an [[incident management team]] (IMT), or [[Incident Command System]] (ICS).

An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebci.org/glossary.pdf Glossary of Terms, The Business Continuity Institute Good Practice Guidelines 2010 Global Edition]. thebci.org Retrieved on 2015-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. If not managed, an incident can escalate into an emergency, crisis or a disaster. Incident management is therefore the process of limiting the potential disruption caused by such an event, followed by a return to business as usual. Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Physical incident management ===

Incident management is considered to be much more than just the analysis of perceived threats and hazards towards and organization in order to work out the risk of that event occurring, and therefore the ability of that organization to conduct business as usual activities during the incident. An important part of risk management process and business resilience planning that Incident management is a real time physical activity.

The planning that has happened to formulate the response to an incident—be that a disaster, emergency, crisis or accident—has been done so that effective business resilience can take place to ensure minimal loss or damage whether that is to tangible or non tangible assets of that organization. Efficient physical management of the incident—making best use of both time and resources that are available and understanding how to get more resources from outside the organization when needed by clear and timely liaison—ensure the plan is implemented.

[[National Fire Protection Association]] states that incident management can be described as, '[a]n IMS [incident management system] is "the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures and communications operating within a common organizational structure, designed to aid in the management of resources during incidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=1600&amp;cookie_test=1|title=List of NFPA Codes and Standards|date=2013|website=www.nfpa.org|language=en|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/incident|title=Incident Management {{!}} Ready.gov|date=2012|website=www.ready.gov|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical incident management is the real time response that may last for hours, days, or longer. The [[Cabinet Office|United Kingdom Cabinet Office]] have produced the National Recovery Guidance (NRG), which is aimed at [[First responder|local responders]] as part of the implementation of the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] (CCA). It describes the response as the following: "Response encompasses the actions taken to deal with the immediate effects of an emergency. In many scenarios, it is likely to be relatively short and to last for a matter of hours or days – rapid implementation of arrangements for collaboration, co-ordination and communication are, therefore, vital. Response encompasses the effort to deal not only with the direct effects of the emergency itself (eg fighting fires, rescuing individuals) but also the indirect effects (eg disruption, media interest)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-recovery-guidance|title=National Recovery Guidance - GOV.UK|year=2007|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents|title=Civil Contingencies Act 2004|year=2012|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which is the world's largest developer of international standards also makes a point in the description of its risk management, principles and guidelines document [[ISO 31000]]:2009 that, "Using ISO 31000 can help organizations increase the likelihood of achieving objectives, improve the identification of opportunities and threats and effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso31000.htm|title=ISO 31000 Risk management|year=2009|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This again shows the importance of not just good planning but effective allocation of resources to treat the risk.

=== Computer security incident management ===
{{Main|Computer security incident management}}
Today, an important role is played by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), due to the rise of internet crime, and is a common example of incident faced by companies in developed nations all across the world. For example, if an organization discovers that an intruder has gained unauthorized access to a computer system, the CSIRT would analyze the situation, determine the breadth of the compromise, and take corrective action. [[Computer forensics]] is one task included in this process. Currently, over half of the world’s hacking attempts on Trans National Corporations (TNCs) take place in North America (57%). 23% of attempts take place in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/b/rhalbheer/archive/2010/03/12/hacking-incidents-2009-interesting-data.aspx Hacking Incidents 2009 – Interesting Data – Roger's Security Blog – Site Home – TechNet Blogs]. Blogs.technet.com (2010-03-12). Retrieved on 2012-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Having a well-rounded Computer Security Incident Response team is integral to providing a secure environment for any organization, and is becoming a critical part of the overall design of many modern networking teams.

== Roles ==
Incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an [[incident response team]] (IRT), or an [[incident management team]] (IMT). These are often designated beforehand or during the event, and are placed in control of the organization whilst the incident is dealt with, to restore normal functions.

The [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) is designed to deal with a larger incident involving a respond from multiple agencies. Popular with [[public safety]] agencies and jurisdictions in the United States, Canada and other countries, it is growing in practice in the private sector as organizations begin to manage without or co-manage emergencies with public safety agencies. ICS is a command and control mechanism that provides an expandable structure to manage emergency agencies.  Although some of the details vary by jurisdiction, ICS normally consists of five primary elements: command, operations, planning, logistics and finance/administration.  Several special staff positions, including public affairs, safety, and liaison, report directly to the incident commander (IC) when the emergency warrants establishment of those positions.

Another response system is the [[Gold–silver–bronze command structure]], which is used by emergency services in the United Kingdom and other countries. The system has three levels of command: a gold commander sets the overall strategy, a silver commander is in direct charge of those at the scene and bronze commanders direct responders on the ground. An individual agency may use the system, or multiple agencies may use the system as they liaise. A common feature of the ICS and Gold-Silver-Bronze systems is that they create a separate command system to the agencies' usual hierarchy.

Usually as part of the wider management process in private organizations, incident management is followed by post-incident analysis where it is determined why the incident happened despite precautions and controls. This analysis is normally overseen by the leaders of the organization, with the view of preventing repetition of the incident through precautionary measures and often changes in policy. This information is then used as feedback to further develop the security policy and/or its practical implementation. In the United States, the [[National Incident Management System]], developed by the [[Department of Homeland Security]], integrates effective practices in emergency management into a comprehensive national framework. This often results in a higher level of contingency planning, exercise and training, as well as an evaluation of the management of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1230910518359.shtm About the Contingency Planning and Incident Management Division | Homeland Security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402131642/https://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1230910518359.shtm |date=April 2, 2012 }}. Dhs.gov (1999-02-22). Retrieved on 2012-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident management software systems ==
Incident management software systems are designed for collecting consistent, time sensitive, documented [[incident report]] data. Many of these products include features to automate the approval process of an incident report or case investigation. These products may also have the ability to collect real time incident information such as time and date data. Additionally incident report systems will automatically send notifications, assign tasks and escalations to appropriate individuals depending on the incident type, priority, time, status and custom criteria. Modern products provide the ability for administrators to configure the Incident report forms as needed, create analysis reports and set access controls on the data.  These incident reports may have the ability for customization that may best suit the organizations using the systems. Some of these products have the ability to collect images, video, audio and other data. Incident management software systems exist that relate directly to specific industries.

== Root cause analysis ==
{{Main|root cause analysis}}

=== Human factors ===
{{One source|section
| date = January 2018
}}

During the [[root cause analysis]], human factors should be assessed. James Reason conducted a study into the understanding of adverse effects of human factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reason J | title = Understanding adverse events: human factors | journal = Quality in Health Care | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 80–9 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 10151618 | pmc = 1055294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that major incident investigations, such as [[Piper Alpha]] and [[Kings Cross Underground fire|Kings Cross Underground Fire]], made it clear that the causes of the accidents were distributed widely within and outside the organization. There are two types of events: active failure—an action that has immediate effects and has the likelihood to cause an accident—and latent or delayed action—events can take years to have an effect and are usually combined with triggering events that then cause the accident.

Active failures are unsafe acts (errors and violations) committed by, for instance, the operators of machinery and supervisors of tasks. It is the people at the human-system interface whose actions can have immediate adverse consequences.

Latent failures are created as the result of decisions taken at the higher echelons of an organisation. Their damaging consequences may lie dormant for a long time, only becoming evident when they combine with local triggering factors (e.g., the [[spring tide]], the loading difficulties at [[Zeebrugge]] harbour, etc.) to breach the system's defences. Decisions taken in the higher echelons of an organization can trigger the events towards an accident becoming more likely, the planning, scheduling, forecasting, designing, policy making, etc., can have a slow burning effect. The actual unsafe act that triggers an accident can be traced back through the organization and the subsequent failures can be exposed, showing the accumulation of latent failures within the system as a whole that led to the accident becoming more likely and ultimately happening. Better improvement action can be applied, and reduce the likelihood of the event happening again.&lt;ref&gt;O’Callaghan, Katherine Mary, [http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp272.01032011/index.html Incident Management:  Human Factors and Minimising Mean Time to Restore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917053506/http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp272.01032011/index.html |date=2011-09-17 }}, Ph.D. Thesis, Australian Catholic University, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''information broker''' or '''data broker''' collects information about individuals from [[public records]] and private sources including [[census]] and [[change of address]] records, [[motor vehicle]] and [[driving]] records, [[User-generated content|user-contributed material]] to [[social networking sites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.propublica.org/article/yes-companies-are-harvesting-and-selling-your-social-media-profiles|title = Yes, Companies Are Harvesting – and Selling – Your Facebook Profile|last = Beckette|first = Lois|date = 9 November 2012|work = |accessdate = 17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[News story|media]] and court reports, [[voter registration]] lists, consumer purchase histories, [[Most wanted list|most-wanted]] lists and terrorist watch lists, [[payment card|bank card transaction records]], health care authorities, and [[Web browsing history|web browsing histories]].&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/2013/12/testimony-what-information-do-data-brokers-have-on-consumers/|title=Congressional Testimony: What Information Do Data Brokers Have on Consumers?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The data are [[Aggregate data|aggregated]] to create individual profiles, often made up of thousands of individual pieces of information such as a person's age, race, gender, height, weight, marital status, religious affiliation, political affiliation, occupation, household income, net worth, home ownership status, investment habits, product preferences and health-related interests. Brokers then sell the profiles to other organizations that use them mainly to target advertising and marketing towards specific groups, to verify a person's identity including for purposes of fraud detection, and to sell to individuals and organizations so they can research people for various reasons.&lt;ref name="Government of the United States"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014/140527databrokerreport.pdf|title = DATA BROKERS: A Call for Transparency and Accountability|date = May 2014|accessdate = 13 August 2014|website = Federal Trade Commission|publisher = Government of the United States|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data brokers also often sell the profiles to government agencies, such as the FBI, thus allowing law enforcement agencies to circumvent laws that protect privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|title=Reining in Private Agents|journal=Minnesota Law Review|date=2016|volume=101|pages=279–331|ssrn=2869439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Beginning in the late twentieth century, technological developments such as the development of the [[internet]], increasing computer processing power and declining costs of [[Computer data storage|data storage]] made it much easier for companies to collect, analyze, store and transfer large amounts of data about individual people. This gave rise to the information broker or data broker industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|first1 = |last1 = |first2 = |last2 = |first3 = |last3 = |first4 = |last4 = |title = Big data: seizing opportunities, preserving values|url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf|date = |publisher =Executive Office of the President |website = |accessdate = Aug 17, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610084800/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals generally cannot find out what data a broker holds on them, how a broker got it, or how it is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.privacyrights.org/online-info-broker-faq |title=Online Information Broker FAQ |work= Privacy Rights Clearinghouse |publisher=privacyrights.org |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some data brokers retain all information indefinitely.

Files on individuals are generally sold in lists; examples cited in testimony to the U.S. Congress include lists of rape victims, seniors with dementia, financially vulnerable people, people with HIV, and police officers (by home address).&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; Less controversial are lists of rich people, doctors, or parents.

There are probably between 3500 and 4000 data broker companies, and about a third may provide opt-outs, with some charging over a thousand dollars for them.&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"/&gt;

Data brokers collect information concerning myriad topics, ranging from the daily communications of an individual to more specialized data such as product registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Data Revolution|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd. (UK)|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brokers and datasets ==
Data brokers in the United States include [[Acxiom]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, [[Experian]], [[Alliance Data#Epsilon|Epsilon]], [[CoreLogic]], [[Datalogix]], [[inome]], [[PeekYou]], [[Exactis]], and [[Recorded Future]].&lt;ref name="Government of the United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"&gt;http://educationnewyork.com/files/rockefeller_databroker.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Acxiom claims to have files on 10% of the world's population,&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; with about 1500 pieces of information per consumer&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/technology/acxiom-the-quiet-giant-of-consumer-database-marketing.html&lt;/ref&gt; (quoted in [[Senate.gov]]).&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; In 2017, [[Cambridge Analytica]] claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million US citizens based on 5,000 separate data sets&lt;ref name="InkJun2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://series.fountainink.in/aadhaar-in-the-hand-of-spies |title=Aadhaar in the hand of spies Big Data, global surveillance state and the identity project |author=Govind Krishnan V. |date=3 June 2017 |accessdate=27 August 2017 |publisher=Fountain Ink Magazine |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826163725/https://series.fountainink.in/aadhaar-in-the-hand-of-spies/ |archivedate=26 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (another 2017 claim is 230 million Americans&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==
Credit scores were first used in the 1950s, but did not become widely known or specifically regulated until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"/&gt;

In 1977 [[Kelly Warnken]] published the first fee-based information directory, which continues to be published and has expanded to cover international concerns.

==Criticism==
A U.S. Senate Committee in 2013 published ''A Review of the Data Broker Industry: Collection, Use, and Sale of Consumer Data for Marketing Purposes''.&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; It states that "Today, a wide range of companies known as “data brokers” collect and maintain data on hundreds of millions of consumers, which they analyze, package, and sell generally without consumer permission or input." Their main findings were that:
*Data brokers collect a huge volume of detailed information on hundreds of millions of consumers.
*Data brokers sell products that identify financially vulnerable consumers.
*Data broker products provide information about consumer offline behavior to tailor online outreach by marketers.
*Data brokers operate behind a veil of secrecy.

The information produced by data brokers has been criticized for enabling discrimination in pricing, services and opportunities. For example, a May 2014 White House report found that web searches that included black-seeming first names such as Jermaine were more likely to result in ads being displayed that include the word "arrest," compared with web searches including white-seeming first names such as Geoffrey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An Online Information Broker FAQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.privacyrights.org/online-info-broker-faq|title=Online Information Broker FAQ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published by [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]] (PRC), a nonprofit consumer organization in the United States. PRC also maintains a list of information brokers (data brokers, with links to their privacy policies, terms of service, and opt-out privisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.privacyrights.org/online-information-brokers-list|title=- Privacy Rights Clearinghouse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data brokers have also faced legal charges for security breaches due to poor data security practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2008/03/agency-announces-settlement-separate-actions-against-retailer-tjx|title=Agency Announces Settlement of Separate Actions Against Retailer TJX, and Data Brokers Reed Elsevier and Seisint for Failing to Provide Adequate Security for Consumers Data|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calls for regulation and legislation ==
A 2007 [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] study, after requesting and analyzing information-sharing practices at 86 companies, found many operating under an [[opt-out]] model that it described as inconsistent with consumer expectations, and recommended that the [[California State Legislature|California state legislature]] require companies to disclose their information-sharing policies using clear, unambiguous language, and consider creating a centralized, user-friendly method for consumers to opt out of information-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 1137990|title = Consumer Information Sharing: Where the Sun Still Don't Shine|last = Hoofnagle, and Jennifer King|first = Chris Jay|date = 17 December 2007|journal = (working paper)|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |archiveurl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Federal Trade Commission|U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] had recommended the U.S. Congress develop legislation enabling consumers to see the information that data brokers hold about them, a recommendation it renewed in subsequent reports in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also called for Congress to consider legislation.&lt;ref name="Government of the United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FTC"&gt;{{cite web|title=TC Recommends Congress Require the Data Broker Industry to be More Transparent and Give Consumers Greater Control Over Their Personal Information|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/05/ftc-recommends-congress-require-data-broker-industry-be-more|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation attempts==
The [[Data Accountability and Trust Act]] contained a number of requirements for auditing and verification of accuracy of data held by information brokers, and additional measures in the case of a security breach. The bill also gave identified individuals the means and opportunity to review and correct the data held that related to them. It passed through the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the [[111th Congress]], but failed to pass the [[United States Senate]]. It was revived by the [[112th Congress]] in 2011 as H.R. 1707.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1707 Data Accountability and Trust Act (2011; 112th Congress H.R. 1707)]. GovTrack.us. Retrieved on 2013-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; but died after being referred to committee. The bill was first introduced by Rep. [[Bobby Rush]] [D-IL1] on Apr 30, 2009, H.R. 2221&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr2221 |title=Data Accountability and Trust Act (2009; 111th Congress H.R. 2221) |publisher= govtrack.us |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
In [[fiction]], information brokers usually find data for a story's main character(s). Fictional information brokers can be of varying importance and have varying methods. For example, a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] can be an information broker, though they may be simply transferring whatever information they find to the main character(s). Other brokers may have [[memorize]]d data and tell the main character(s) [[covert]]ly. Also, a fee is not always involved. The information broker may have an alliance with the main character(s) or be one themselves.

Examples of information brokers in contemporary fiction would be [[Edward G. Robinson]]'s character Sol in the film ''[[Soylent Green]]''; the Shadow Broker in the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]''; Nicholas Wayne, Rachel, Elean Duga, Gustav St. Germain, Carol, and the President of the Daily Days newspaper company in ''[[Baccano!]]''; or Izaya Orihara in the light novel series ''[[Durarara!!]]''. A few of the characters in [[Neil Stephenson]]'s novel [[Snow Crash]] find work selling data as "stringers" for the Central Intelligence Corporation. Information broker characters play a prominent role in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. The character trope is best exemplified by the superhero [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], but the trope is later used with the characters [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], [[Wendy and Marvin|Proxy]], [[Chloe Sullivan]], and [[Felicity Smoak]] as well.

'''Jean-Claude Biver''' (born September 20, 1949) is a Luxembourgish [[watchmaker]], [[Cheesemaking|cheesemaker]], and businessman currently serving as the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[TAG Heuer]]. In January 2014, he was named the president of [[Louis Vuitton]]'s watchmaking division.  

Since 2014, he served as chief executive, board member, and minority [[shareholder]] of [[Hublot]], a [[Swiss]] luxury [[watchmaker]].&lt;ref name="Hublot"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The History of Hublot Geneve |url=http://www.hublot.com/wwwdata/historique/HISTORY_HUBLOT.EN.pdf |publisher=Hublot |accessdate=2009-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712230339/http://www.hublot.com/wwwdata/historique/HISTORY_HUBLOT.EN.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biver has been successful at Hublot, and was previously successful in rejuvenating the [[Blancpain]] and [[Omega SA|Omega]] brands, both currently owned by [[The Swatch Group|Swatch Group]]. Biver is also known for his own exclusive [[cheese]]. Biver's leadership in the Swiss watch industry has been credited as "single handedly {{sic}} ... saving [the industry] from the [[Quartz clock|quartz]] movement."&lt;ref name=Timezone&gt;{{Cite web |last=Margolis |first=Mike |title=A TimeZone Interview with Jean-Claude Biver |url=http://www.timezone.com/library/tzints/200508081757 |publisher=Timezone.com |date=May 2005 |accessdate=2009-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724163557/http://www.timezone.com/library/tzints/200508081757# |archive-date=2009-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, even prestigious Swiss watch brands had "a proportion of 70% more or less quartz [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]]s in their collection;"&lt;ref name=Timezone/&gt; since then, the Swiss watch industry has staged a "remarkable recovery", with 2008 exports valued at [[Swiss franc|CHF]]17 billion.&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{Cite web |title=Salesman of the irrational |url=http://www.economist.com/people/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14857221 |publisher=''[[The Economist]]'' |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Biver was born on September 20, 1949, in [[Luxembourg]],&lt;ref name=Hublot/&gt; and at the age of 10 moved with his family to [[Switzerland]], attending school in [[Saint Prex]].  He later studied at Collège des Morges, and earned a degree in [[business]] at [[HEC Lausanne]] (also known as the Faculty of Business and Economics of the [[University of Lausanne]]).&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;  Upon graduation, he spent time in the [[Vallée de Joux]], absorbing the culture of [[watchmaking]], where he met [[Jacques Piguet]], who was running the [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]] factory [[Frederic Piguet]].&lt;ref name=Timezone/&gt; Through Jacques' father, he met Georges Golay, chairman and CEO of [[Audemars Piguet]], where he was offered a job as sales manager for Europe.&lt;ref name=Timezone/&gt; In a year of working for AP, he was able to learn the "art of watchmaking," though he left after a year, thinking he could do better elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Timezone/&gt; He left Audemars Piguet to become product manager at [[Omega SA|Omega]], a major multinational brand, leaving Omega after a year to return to the ''[[manufacture d'horlogerie]]'' of the Vallée de Joux.  Jean-Claude Biver was awarded a  [[Honorary degree|Doctor Honoris Causa]] from [[Business School Lausanne]] in 2012 in recognition of his contribution to the success of the Swiss watchmaking industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Jean Claude Biver|url=https://www.bsl-lausanne.ch/people/jean-claude-biver/|journal=BSL Lausanne|date = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watch industry==

===Blancpain===
Upon return to the Valley de Joux in 1981, Biver and Jacques Piguet purchased the rights to [[Blancpain]], a watchmaker that had gone out of business in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt; Blancpain had a long history but had been rendered obsolete by the development of [[quartz watch]]es. Using this as a strength, Biver and Piguet rebuilt the brand on the concept that "Since 1735 there has never been a quartz Blancpain watch. And there never will be."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;  Blancpain quickly became one of the most respected traditional watch brands, achieving a turnover of [[Swiss franc|CHF]]50m. In 1992, the brand was sold to [[Société de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie|SMH Group]] (now known as [[The Swatch Group|Swatch Group]]) for CHF60m ([[USD]]43m), having been initially purchased for CHF22,000.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;  Biver remained CEO of Blancpain until 2003.&lt;ref name=Timezone/&gt;

===Omega===
Upon the sale of Blancpain, Biver joined the board of directors of Swatch Group,&lt;ref name=Timezone/&gt; where he was charged with turning around Swatch's [[Omega SA|Omega]] brand.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; Biver's main influence was in the product and marketing fields,&lt;ref name=Timezone/&gt; employing techniques such as [[product placement]] (notably in [[James Bond]] films) and celebrity sponsorships (including testimonials from [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Michael Schumacher]], and [[Pierce Brosnan]]).&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;  Biver left Omega in 2003, having presided over the company's "dazzling" recovery.  Over Biver's ten years at Omega, its sales had almost tripled.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

===Hublot===
Biver briefly exited the watchmaking world in 2004, before joining [[Hublot]] as CEO and board member.&lt;ref name=Timezone/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; At Hublot, he has emphasized "the fusion of tradition and future."&lt;ref name=Timezone/&gt; Hublot was bought by [[LVMH]] in 2008, following a fivefold increase in sales from 2004 to 2007.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; Even in the [[late-2000s recession]], Hublot has been considered to be very successful, with sales down 15% up to November 2009 compared with 30% for the entire Swiss luxury watch business.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; Biver has retained the brand's exclusivity through methods such as restricting supply in the face of large demand, citing that "people want exclusivity, so you must always keep the customer hungry and frustrated."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

===TAG Heuer===
Biver became the CEO of [[TAG Heuer]] in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljeweler.com/watches/brand-profiles/TAG-Heuer-CEO-resigns-as-brand-lowers-its-sights-6497.shtml|title=TAG Heuer CEO Resigns|publisher=nationaljeweler.com|date=December 12, 2014|access-date=2015-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406055418/http://www.nationaljeweler.com/watches/brand-profiles/TAG-Heuer-CEO-resigns-as-brand-lowers-its-sights-6497.shtml#|archive-date=2015-04-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's thirty-year cooperation with the [[McLaren]] motorsport team came to an end in late 2015, after Biver had a falling out with McLaren owner [[Ron Dennis]]. TAG Heuer subsequently joined [[Red Bull Racing]], becoming namesake to their [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parkes|first1=Ian|title=McLaren's Ron Dennis admits he fell out with TAG Heuer chief|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/122135|website=autosport.com|accessdate=5 December 2015|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timing is Everything|url=http://www.infiniti-redbullracing.com/article/timing-everything|publisher=Red Bull Racing|accessdate=5 December 2015|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cheese==
Every year, Biver produces approximately five [[tonne]]s of cheese at his farm in the [[Swiss Alps]].&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; Biver produces cheese for only a few weeks every summer during which the alpine meadows [[flower]], rendering "a flowery taste to the milk and subsequently, to the cheese."&lt;ref name=Anecdote&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bhattacharya |first=Mitrajit |title=Cheese &amp; Crackers: Get a taste of Hublot President Jean-Claude Biver's passion for cheese |url=http://www.watchworldmagazine.com/watchworld/vol9/anecdote.asp |publisher=''Watch World'' Magazine |accessdate=2009-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807090955/http://www.watchworldmagazine.com/watchworld/vol9/anecdote.asp# |archive-date=2009-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the cheese's exclusivity, Biver refuses payment, offering cheese only to his friends and family, and to particular restaurants of his choosing.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; Biver stated that by refusing payment, he can remain in absolute control of the cheese's distribution: "I will be the master of my cheese until the last piece."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

'''KYCR''' (1440 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a [[radio station]] serving the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] metropolitan area. It is owned by [[Salem Media Group]], and is carrying a business radio format.

KYCR's studios are located in [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]], while its transmitter is located in Golden Valley.

==History==
[[File:Radio Disney1440 2010.png|left|150px|thumb|''Radio Disney 1440'' logo used from 2010 to 2013.]]
The original call letters were '''KEYD''' and the station played [[country music]] for many years. The station was launched in May 1948 by former management and advertisers of [[KFAN (AM)|WDGY]], who had become disenchanted with the owners of that station over the discontinuance of religious programming. Family Broadcasting basically started the station as a new home for the spurned WDGY programming. KEYD got a sister TV station in 1955, KEYD-TV 9 (now [[KMSP-TV]]), and the two stations were co-owned by Family Broadcasting until mid-[[1956 in radio|1956]]. The original KEYD radio studios were located in downtown [[Minneapolis]] on 9th Street off of Hennepin Avenue practically next to the Orpheum Theater (see photo link below). According to the 1955 Broadcasting Yearbook, both the AM and TV stations were co-located in the Foshay Tower by the end of 1955.

The [[call sign]] was changed to '''KEVE''' in June 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAoEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1956-06-23|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the studios moved to the station's transmitter and antenna site at 917 Lilac Drive in Golden Valley. During that time, the station played [[country music]]. [[KQRS-FM|KEVE-FM]] (92.5 FM) signed on September 1, 1962, and by October 1963, it was given the call letters '''KADM''' to match its AM sister as the pair became known as "Adam and Eve in the Valley"; the city of license for the two stations is the suburb of Golden Valley. A gradual shift from country music to a mix of [[classical music]], [[show tunes]] and [[adult standards]] began in 1960 and was completed on both stations by March 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQsEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1963-03-30|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1964, the call letters for both stations became '''[[KQRS-FM|KQRS]]''' for "Quality Radio Stations".

In 1967, the stations began experimenting with [[freeform (radio format)|freeform rock]] music from midnight to 5 AM every night via the "Night Watch" program, playing [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[jazz]] and [[psychedelic rock]]. The foray proved successful and by the end of 1968 it became the full-time format.

The two KQs were a simulcast until 1982, when the AM briefly switched to an  [[oldies]] format as '''KGLD''' before returning to the simulcast. The KGLD calls became effective November 22, 1982, with the KQRS calls returning on March 28, 1984.

In 1985, [[ABC Radio Network]], then a division of the original [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC, Inc.]] bought the station and its main FM counterpart with it from previous owner Hudson Communications Corporation, a radio broadcasting company owned by [[Washington D.C.]] lawyer Joe McKenna, which owned the station from 1956 to 1985. Along with its main FM sister, it was ABC's first foray into the Minnesota broadcast market. At first, ABC programmed the station with a [[classic rock]] format, albeit essentially being an AM simulcast of its FM sister at the time from 1985 until 1996.

The station again broke away from the simulcast in late 1996, this time permanently, when it became one of the four initial affiliates of the new Radio Disney with a children's format that competed with [[WWTC]], then the flagship station of "[[Radio Aahs]]," which had its own children's format. The station's call letters changed to '''KDIZ''' on November 15, 1996. With the advent of [[HD Radio]], KDIZ began broadcasting with the technology, as did most other Radio Disney affiliates.

Disney had previously been collaborating with [[Children's Broadcasting Corporation|Radio Aahs]], which was based in Minneapolis and had launched its children's format in 1990. Radio Aahs had grown to approximately 30 affiliate stations around the country. Disney withdrew from the Aahs contract and began competing against Aahs with Radio Disney. Children's Broadcasting Corp. sued Disney and was awarded $9.5 million in 2002. Disney appealed, and after the court upheld the judgement, it was paid in 2005; with accumulated interest, the total was $12.4 million.

On November 12, 2005, the station made world news when a riot erupted at its "Jingle Jam Concert" featuring [[B5 (band)|B5]], forcing the venue, Brookdale Mall, to be closed. Members of the group were stripped of shirts, shoes and earrings.

On August 13, 2014, Disney put KDIZ and twenty-two other [[Radio Disney]] stations up for sale, in order to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network.&lt;ref name=b&amp;c-radiodisneysell2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lafayette|first1=Jon|title=Exclusive: Radio Disney Moving Off Air to Digital|url=http://broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/exclusive-radio-disney-moving-air-digital/133166|accessdate=August 13, 2014|date=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-selling&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Disney to Sell the Majority of Its Stations|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/6214509/radio-disney-to-sell-the-majority-of-its-stations|website=Billboard|accessdate=13 August 2014|ref=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It held the distinction of being not only the longest-tenured Radio Disney station in its history, but also one of ABC's longest-tenured non-mainstream radio stations in its history. It was also the last-remaining Disney/ABC broadcast property in Minnesota, having had sold the others in 2007, with ABC Radio going to [[Citadel Broadcasting]] ([[KXXR]], acquired in 1993, [[Love 105]], acquired in 1997, and [[KQRS-FM]], acquired in 1985).

[[Malay titles|Tan Sri]] '''Khoo Kay Peng''' ({{zh|t=邱繼炳}}; born 1939) is a [[Malaysian Chinese]] businessman. He is the chairman and a major shareholder of [[Laura Ashley plc]], and the owner of [[MUI Group]].

==Early life==
Khoo Kay Peng was born in 1939.&lt;ref name=MM&gt;{{cite news|last1=Su-Lyn|first1=Boo|title=Daughter backs mum in divorce from tycoon, says dad disapproves of son-in-law’s race|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/daughter-backs-mum-in-divorce-from-tycoon-says-dad-disapproves-of-son-in-la|accessdate=2 March 2015|work=Malay Mail|date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Khoo was mentored by [[Khoo Teck Puat]], who founded [[Malayan Banking]] in 1960. Khoo  joined the new bank and soon became a manager. In 1965, he was seconded to Bank Bumiputra, and quickly rose to a senior position. In his ten years there, he built relationships with [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]], [[Robert Kuok]] and [[Tan Koon Swan]].&lt;ref name="Searle1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Searle|title=The Riddle of Malaysian Capitalism: Rent-Seekers Or Real Capitalists?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpuovMTBl2MC&amp;pg=PA197|year=1999|publisher=Asian Studies Association of Australia|isbn=978-0-8248-2053-4|pages=197–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He left in 1976 to start his own business, developing property in Kuala Lumpur with a loan from Southern Banking, which made him a millionaire. In 1976, he bought a major stake in [[MUI Group]], then a manufacturer of toothbrushes and household utensils, and used it as a vehicle for a series of corporate takeovers, growing MUI to a $91 million pre-tax profit in 1984.&lt;ref name="Searle1999"/&gt;

| accessdate = January 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1999, Komeil Bahmanpour was introduced to an [[United States|American]] eforms software company willing to open overseas subsidiaries for the purpose of [[Middle East]]ern software development and marketing. The deal went on and Chortkeh ({{lang-fa|چرتکه}})—back then doing business as ''Chortkeh Rayaneh Hamrah, LLC'' ({{lang-fa|چرتکه رایانه همراه، شرکت با مسئولیت محدود}})—was established.&lt;ref name="NewsInterview" /&gt;

=== Chortkeh ===
He was assigned as the chief [[software architecture|software architect]] also managing development teams working on projects in different fields such as [[Document conversion|eforms conversion]], [[virtual printer]], [[object recognition]], [[barcode]], etc.

=== Persian Open Directory Project ===
Since 2003, Komeil Bahmanpour has been the managing editor of [[Netscape]]'s [[Persian language|Persian]] [[Open Directory Project|ODP]],&lt;ref name="DmozProfile"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Profile - komeil
| publisher = [[Open Directory Project]]
| url = http://www.dmoz.org/public/profile?editor=komeil

| title = Persian Open Directory Project
| publisher = Chortkeh
| language = Persian
| url = http://www.dmoz.ir/
| accessdate = August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won the Best World/Farsi Editor at the 2004 ODP Autumn Editor Awards.&lt;ref name="MozzieAward"&gt;{{cite web

| format = GIF
| accessdate = August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Persian ODP managing editor, Bahmanpour was behind a big decision to change the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the Persian ODP from [http://www.dmoz.org/World/Farsi/ Dmoz.org/World/Farsi/] into [http://www.dmoz.org/World/Persian/ Dmoz.org/World/Persian/].&lt;ref name="GoogleUpdateDelay"&gt;{{cite web

| date = August 18, 2007
| accessdate = March 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing in the fact that employing ''Farsi'' instead of ''Persian'' across the [[English language|English]] [[World Wide Web|Web]] is [[Betrayal|betraying]] Persian language,&lt;ref name="PersianBetrayal"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during a month-long discussion between him and the ODP meta editors, he persisted on replacing the [[Transliteration|transliterated]] word ''Farsi'' with the more adequate word ''Persian'', but metas on the other hand precluded the change based on the assumption that URLs have been promoted for years, so it will not be a wise choice to change them. Eventually, in March 2007 the URL was changed.&lt;ref name="DmozUrl"&gt;{{cite web

=== Unicode contribution ===

'''Latigent LLC''' was an international provider of [[Business Intelligence]], Enterprise RSS, and [[Call Center]] Reporting and Analytics software.

==History==
Latigent, LLC of [[Chicago, IL]], was founded in 2002, as a privately held and funded company, by Chris Crosby and Jason Kolb, two veterans of the contact center industry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Both founders believed that there was a more efficient way of using the information typically gathered in the contact center to better serve the customer and more profitably serve the enterprise.  As a result, the Latigent BlueVue performance management product was born and introduced to the market in 2003.

In December 2005, Latigent released BlueVue II, a Business Information (BI) suite.  Besides reporting functionality and complete data warehousing capabilities, BlueVue II also offered data integration capabilities for performance management.

On September 27, 2007 [[Cisco Systems]] announced a definitive agreement to acquire Latigent LLC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/corp_092707.html Announced A Definitive Agreement to Acquire Latigent LLC]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)''' are a key policy initiative of the [[Government of India]] to improve the country’s logistics sector by lowering overall freight costs, reducing vehicular pollution and congestion, and cutting warehousing costs. The government’s [[Ministry of Road Transport and Highways]] (MoRTH) is developing multi-modal logistics parks at selected locations in the country under its Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP).&lt;ref&gt;IANS. 2017. Government to develop 15 multi-modal logistics parks for Rs 33,000 cr. Business Standard. 16 May. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/government-to-develop-15-multi-modal-logistics-parks-for-rs-33-000-cr-117051501161_1.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; India is burdened with high logistics costs, which account for about 13% of the value of goods sold in the economy compared with 8% in other major economies. The average cost to export/import one container in India is about 72% higher than in China.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;R. Arora. 2017. Government Approves Plan to Build 34 Mega Multi-Modal Logistics Parks at an Investment of Rs2 Lakh Cr. The Economic Times. 21 July. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/government-approves-plan-to-build-34-mega-multi-modal-logistics-parks-at-an-investment-of-rs-2-lakh-cr/articleshow/59690653.cms&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

LEEP, which is spearheaded by the MoRTH and the [[National Highways Authority of India]] (NHAI), aims to enhance freight transport in India by reducing costs and time, and improving the tracking and traceability of consignments through infrastructural, procedural, and information technology interventions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2016. Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP). Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government defines an MMLP as a freight-handling facility encompassing a minimum area of 100 acres (40.5 hectares), with various modes of transport access, and comprising mechanized warehouses, specialized storage solutions such as cold storage, facilities for mechanized material handling and inter-modal transfer container terminals, and bulk and break-bulk cargo terminals.&lt;ref&gt;Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2017. Draft Policy Document: Development of Multimodal Logistics Parks. Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; Logistics parks will further provide value-added services such as customs clearance with bonded storage yards, quarantine zones, testing facilities, and warehousing management services. Provisions will also be made for late-stage manufacturing activities such as kitting and final assembly, grading, sorting, labelling and packaging activities, re-working, and returns management (Arora, 2017).

== Background ==
Keeping pace with India’s rapid economic growth is the expansion of the country’s logistics sector. The movement of freight in the country nearly doubled to around 2,300 billion ton-kilometers in fiscal year 2015 from 1,200 billion ton-kilometers in fiscal year 2008.&lt;ref&gt;A ton-kilometer is a unit of transport measurement equivalent to moving 1 ton of cargo a distance of 1 kilometer.&lt;/ref&gt; The government expects freight movement in the country to continue its growth trajectory, with expected annual growth of 8%–10% over the next 10 years. The logistics sector as a whole, according to a study commissioned by MoRTH, is poised to expand at roughly 1.2 times the rate of India’s gross domestic product growth through 2032, by which time it is expected to generate $360 billion in value added, up from $115 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;H.Y. Jeong. 2017. What Multimodal Parks Can Do for Logistics in India. 27 September. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://blogs.adb.org/blog/what-multimodal-parks-can-do-logistics-india&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, India managed to improve its performance in the [[Logistics Performance Index]] (LPI), a ranking published by the [[World Bank]] to measure the logistics performance of countries.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. 2016. Connecting to Compete 2016: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy—The Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators. Washington: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; India’s LPI ranking rose to 35th in 2016, up from 46th in 2012. India’s ranking, however, still lags behind some of its economic peers, including other Asian countries. The best logistics performer in Asia is Singapore, which was ranked 5th in 2016, followed by Hong Kong, China (9th); Japan (12th); the Republic of Korea (24th); and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (27th). Among the grouping of so-called [[BRICS]]—comprising Brazil, Russia, India, the PRC, and South Africa—aside from the PRC, South Africa also outperformed India in 2016 with a ranking of 20th (World Bank, 2016).

However, there remain significant challenges to the sector’s development. Logistics costs are high in India relative to costs in developed countries. Logistics costs as a percentage of gross domestic product stood at approximately 13% in 2015. In comparison, the logistics cost in developed countries is approximately 8%–10%. In more specific terms, India’s road freight cost per ton-kilometer, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is ₹1.90 ($0.03), which is almost double that of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2017. Concept Note: Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Program (LEEP)—Development of Multimodal Logistics Parks. Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher logistics costs in India are primarily driven by five key factors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One is an unfavorable inter-modal mix, with 60% of freight movement skewed toward road transport despite the lower freight cost of rail transport. Second is India’s inefficient fleet mix, which is characterized by smaller, inefficient trucks. Third is the underdeveloped material handling infrastructure that is characterized by a fragmented industry consisting largely of small, unorganized warehouses with limited mechanization. Fourth is the underdeveloped road infrastructure with a limited presence of 4- and 6-lane national highways. Lastly, the lack of a national logistics policy, institutional and regulatory bottlenecks, such as complicated documentation and procedures related to toll collections, adversely impact logistics costs in India.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Government policy initiatives ==
Along with its initial efforts, including the [[Make in India]] program and improvements in infrastructure, Government of India has made a number of decisions aimed at transforming the country’s logistics sector. According to R. Goyal and S. Singh, adviser and young professional in the infrastructure–connectivity vertical section of [[NITI Aayog]], the government is committed towards an integrated development of logistics sector through policy amendments, infrastructural development, tax reforms and technology adoption.&lt;ref&gt;R. Goyal and S. Singh. 2018. Indian Logistics Sector: On the Path of Transformation. Government of India, NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India). &lt;nowiki&gt;http://niti.gov.in/content/indian-logistics-sector-path-transformation&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These decisions include the nationwide imposition of a goods and services tax (GST), which came into effect 1 July 2017. This levy on the supply of goods and services, which replaced many indirect tax laws that previously existed in India, should expedite the conversion of informal logistics operations into formal ones and speed up freight movement at interstate borders as check posts are dismantled. The government further established a new logistics division in the Department of Commerce to coordinate integrated development of the sector via policy changes, improvement in existing procedures, identification of bottlenecks and gaps, and introduction of technology-based interventions. The [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Ministry of Commerce and Industry]] is aiming to develop an integrated logistics portal to connect buyers, logistics service providers and relevant government agencies. The logistics sector has been reclassified by the government with its inclusion under the Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure Subsector. With this, the logistics sector can access long-term credit, the approval process for the construction of MMLPs is simplified, and investments by debt and pension funds into recognized logistics projects would be encouraged by the regulated sector’s market accountability (Goyal &amp; Singh, 2018).

== Purpose and design ==
The development of MMLPs is envisaged as a key policy measure to reduce logistics costs and help address three of the five constraining issues identified above. Specifically, these include an unfavorable modal mix, inefficient fleet mix, and underdeveloped material handling infrastructure. In July 2017, the Government of India approved a plan to build 35 MMLPs. State governments will provide the land needed for the projects, which will then be taken up through public–private partnerships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to MoRTH, these MMLPs are expected to serve five key functions: freight aggregation and distribution, multi-modal freight transport, integrated storage and warehousing, information technology support, and value-added services.

== ADB role and support ==
In 2017, the Government of India launched a program to develop 35 multi-modal logistics parks across the country over the succeeding years and invited [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) to become a lead partner and provide the necessary support (Jeong, 2017). ADB then conducted a pre-feasibility study to assess the suitability of MMLP locations and identify the requisite infrastructure, connectivity, and regulatory reforms in two selected locations: [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]] in Karnataka and [[Guwahati]] in Assam.

In this regard, the state government identified Dabaspete as the site for the park for Bengaluru in Karnataka. Bengaluru is ideally located for an MMLP in south India, with good connections via rail and road networks, and proximity to 17 million potential consumers in Chennai. ADB sees the Bengaluru MMLP as having the potential to become a model for other multimodal logistics parks in India. ADB also supported the pre-feasibility study for a MMLP in [[Jogighopa]], Assam, which incorporates rail, road, and inland-waterway connectivity. The proposed site is located along [[National Waterway 2]] and on the Indo-Bangladesh road route, making it suitable for the MMLP with multi modal access.&lt;ref&gt;K. Rathi. 2018.

Although the temple, as an institution, was founded on its present site by Pillay in 1827, little remains of the original structure he built.]]

'''Narayana Pillai''' was a social entrepreneur and businessman, who spent most of his life in Singapore during the [[Colonialism|colonial period]]. Of [[Tamil films|Tamil]] origins, he greatly contributed to the Tamil community in Singapore.

Prior to 1819, Pillai (also spelled Narayana Pillay) worked in [[Penang]], which was ruled by the [[United Kingdom|British]]. There, he came into contact with [[Stamford Raffles]], a senior official of the [[British East India Company]], who was keen to establish a new trading post at the southern end of the [[Straits of Malacca]]. This resulted in the [[founding of modern Singapore]] in 1819. In Penang, Raffles persuaded Pillai to join him and to work at his new settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Naraina (Narayana) Pillai (Pillay) | publisher = [[National Library Board]] | url = http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_771_2004-12-29.html | accessdate = 2008-01-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109033611/http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_771_2004-12-29.html | archivedate = 2008-01-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

=== Arrival in Singapore ===
Pillai arrived in Singapore with Raffles in 1819 on the ship ‘Indiana’, making him one of the first Tamil men to set foot there. He started his career there as the chief clerk at the government [[Treasury]], where he verified the authenticity of [[currency]]. However, he soon moved on to become a successful entrepreneur and community leader in his own right.

== Businesses ==
With the establishment of a modern urban settlement at Singapore, Pillai noticed a boom in building works. He wrote to his contact in Penang to send [[bricklayer]]s, [[carpenter]]s and cloth merchants to Singapore. He then established the island’s first [[brick]] [[kiln]] at what is now [[Tanjong Pagar]]. Through these efforts, he also became Singapore’s first [[general contractor|building contractor]]. 

Pillai also ventured into the [[cotton]] goods trade. He sold these at Cross Street. In time, his shop became the largest and best known in town. However, a fire in 1822 destroyed his business, leaving him in debt to British merchants who had let him large volumes of cloth on [[credit (finance)|credit]]. Pillai struggled to negotiate with his creditors, and also secured help from Raffles when the latter returned to visit Singapore. At land he obtained in Commercial Square (now [[Raffles Place]]), he erected new warehouses and rebuilt his business from scratch, eventually paying off his debts and remaking his wealth.

== Contributions ==
Apart from his success in business, Pillai is best remembered for his social contributions. He was keen to build a temple on the island to serve the growing [[Hindu]] population there. After some difficulty in obtaining a suitable site, he was able to acquire land at [[South Bridge Road]] for the purpose in 1823. Here, he erected the [[Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore|Sri Mariamman Temple]] in 1827,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sri Mariamman Temple (A National Monument) | publisher = [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]] | url = http://www.nhb.gov.sg/PE/FOF_2003/sites_srimariamman.html | accessdate = 2008-01-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071221083919/http://www.nhb.gov.sg/PE/FOF_2003/sites_srimariamman.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which endures today as the oldest Hindu place of worship on the island, and one of the [[National Monuments of Singapore]]. Pillai also envisioned a Hindu Institute for young boys, but this did not materialize. Nevertheless, Pillai’s standing led to his appointment by the British as the chief of the Indian population, which conferred on him powers to settle disputes within the community.

== Awards ==
Pillay gained recognition as a leader amongst the [[Tamil people|Tamils]] and was appointed chief of Indians from Cholamandalaman, given the authority to settle disputes amongst the [[Tamils]].

'''Offshore outsourcing''' is the practice of hiring an external organization to perform some business functions ("[[Outsourcing]]") in a country other than the one where the [[Product (business)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] are actually developed or manufactured ("[[:wikt:Offshore|Offshore]]"). It can be contrasted with [[offshoring]], in which a company moves itself entirely to another country, or where functions are performed in a foreign country by a foreign subsidiary. Opponents point out that the practice of sending work overseas by countries with higher [[wage]]s reduces their own domestic employment and domestic investment. Many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the [[information technology]] sectors ([[data processing]], [[computer programming]], and [[technical support]]) in countries such as the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] - have been or are potentially affected.

==Types==
There are four basic types of offshore outsourcing:
* [[Information technology outsourcing]] (ITO) is where outsourcing related to technology or internet such as computer programming.
* [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) involves contracting out of operational functions to a third party service provider.
* [[Offshore software R&amp;D|Offshore software development]]
* [[Knowledge process outsourcing]] (KPO) is a type of outsourcing which involves or requires a more advanced technical skill and a higher level of expertise.

==Criteria==
The general criteria for a job to be offshore-able are:
* There is a significant wage difference between the original and offshore countries;
* The job can be [[telework]];
* The work has a {{clarify|text=high information content|date=November 2015}};
* The work can be transmitted over the [[Internet]];
* The work is {{clarify|text=easy to set up|date=November 2015}};
* {{cnspan|text=The work is repeatable|date=November 2015}}.

The driving factor behind the development of offshore outsourcing has been the need to cut costs while the enabling factor has been the global electronic internet network that allows digital data to be accessed and delivered instantly, from and to almost anywhere in the world.

==Countries involved==
Some of the major countries/districts that provide such services, among many others, are:-
* [[Algeria]] (Full Spectrum Services)
* [[Argentina]] (Full Spectrum Services)
* [[Bangladesh]] (Web &amp; Software Programming, Game Development, IT Support, Network Solutions, Offshore Outsourcing Service)

* [[Russia]] (Programming and R&amp;D)
* [[Ukraine]] (Programming and R&amp;D)
* [[Vietnam]] (ITO, BPO, IT services, Offshore Outsourcing Service)

==Impact of the Internet==
The widespread use and availability of the Internet has enabled individuals and small businesses to contract [[freelancer]]s from all over the world to get projects done at a lower [[cost]] due to lower wages and property prices. [[Crowdsourcing]] systems such as [[Amazon Mechanical Turk|Mechanical Turk]] and CrowdFlower have added the element of scalability, allowing businesses to outsource information tasks across the Internet to thousands of workers.

This trend runs in parallel with the tendency towards outsourcing in larger corporations, and may serve to strengthen [[small business]]' capacity to compete with their larger competitors (who are capable of setting up offshore locations) or arrive at major contracts with offshore companies.

On the other hand, according to Gartner, it also helped with accessibility to labor resources across the world, regardless of company size.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner Outlines the Top 10 Forces to Impact Outsourcing and IT Services Industry. Sep. 2010. http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1433214&lt;/ref&gt; It gave rise to business models such as [[Remote In-Sourcing]] that allow companies to tap into resources found abroad, without losing control over security of product quality. The resulting ability to work remotely and online, will continue to have a huge impact on the overall development of the global economy, for small companies and for large corporations.

==Source of conflict==
There are different views on the impact of offshore outsourcing on the various societies affected, which reflects the attitude of [[Protectionism]] versus [[Free Trade]]. Some see it as a potential threat to the domestic job market in the developed world and ask for government protective measures (or at least closer scrutiny of existing trade practices), while others, including the countries who receive the work, see it as an opportunity. In fact, offshore outsourcing has led to Domestic factories and companies closing down leaving tens of thousands of U.S. workers jobless while underdeveloped countries such as Brazil, Turkey, etc. begin to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Kupchan, C. (2012, January 1). The Democratic malaise: Globalization and the threat to the West, 62-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Free-trade advocates suggest economies as a whole will obtain a net benefit from labor offshoring, but it is unclear if the displaced receive a net benefit.

Many companies offshore outsource because the wages are cheaper in other areas. This is beginning to create a conflict because many wages overseas are raising. For example, a study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that Chinese wages were almost tripled in the seven years following 2002. The wage increases could change the set up of offshore outsourcing in years to come.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett Research Group, https://www.plunkettresearch.com/industries/outsourcing-offshoring-bpo-market-research/ &lt;/ref&gt;

One issue offshoring of technical services has brought more attention to is the value of education as an alleged solution to trade-related displacements. Education may no longer be a [[comparative advantage]] of high-wage nations because the cost of education may be lower in the nations involved in the controversy. 
[http://www.latimes.com/news/education/la-na-outsource6mar06,1,3461071.story?page=1&amp;coll=la-news-learning&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true] While it is true that education is usually considered helpful to competitiveness in general, an "education [[arms race]]" with low-wage nations may not pay off.

Gubarev had earlier declared himself leader of the [[Donbass People's Militia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=13 May 2018|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/894286-sud-arestoval-gubernatora-samozvantsa-gubareva-na-dva-mesyatsa.html|title=Суд арестовал губернатора-самозванца Губарева на два месяца|trans-title=Court arrested the impostor governor Gubaryov for two months|agency=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But since then he has been sidelined by other separatist leaders and was banned from taking part in the [[Donbass parliamentary elections, 2014|2014 Donbass parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref name="http://www.mk.ru/politics/2014/10/30/dadut-li-novorossii-sdelat-vybor.html"/&gt; These elections also eliminated the post of "People's Governor".&lt;ref name="http://www.mk.ru/politics/2014/10/30/dadut-li-novorossii-sdelat-vybor.html"/&gt; Gubarev was not a major figure in local politics prior to the beginning of the [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Shortly after declaring himself "People's Governor" on March 6, Gubarev was arrested by the [[Security Service of Ukraine|Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)]] for "advocating separatism" and "illegal seizure of power".

On 1 March 2014, pro-Russian citizens at a meeting in Lenin Square in the center of Donetsk elected Gubarev as governor of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=RBK|publisher=РосБизнесКонсалтинг|url=http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/20140306193140.shtml|script-title=ru:В Донецке задержан "народный губернатор" Губарев|date=6 March 2014|language=ru|trans-title='People's Governor' Gubaryev held in Donetsk|accessdate=13 May 2018|quote=1 марта пророссийски настроенные граждане на площади Ленина в центре Донецка избрали губернатором региона Губарева, затем они захватили здание обладминистрации.

From the beginning of the [[2014 Crimean crisis]], Gubarev led pro-Russian protesters who blockaded and occupied the Donetsk Regional State Administration building.

During a press-conference with journalists on 6 March 2014, Gubarev stated that his main goal as the self-proclaimed governor was to declare a referendum on the territorial status of [[Donetsk Oblast]], non-recognition of the new Ukrainian government, and non-recognition of Donetsk governor [[Serhiy Taruta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/donetsks-self-proclaimed-separatist-governor-talks-to-journalists-gets-arrested-338638.html|author=Daryna Shevchenko|title=Donetsk's self-proclaimed separatist governor talks to journalists, gets arrested|work=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=6 March 2014|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March, a crowd of protesters stormed government buildings in Donetsk demanding Gubarev's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukraine crisis: Pro-Russians flock to Crimea vote|accessdate=13 May 2018|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26598832|publisher=BBC News|date=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May 2014 Gubarev and two other pro-Russian activists were freed in exchange for [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] officers, detained earlier by the [[Donbass People's Militia]].&lt;ref name="en.itar-tass.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gubafree/&gt;

Gubarev was excluded by the election commission from participating in the [[Donbass parliamentary elections, 2014|2014 Donbass parliamentary elections]] "because his party was not able to hold a founding conference".&lt;ref name="http://www.mk.ru/politics/2014/10/30/dadut-li-novorossii-sdelat-vybor.html"&gt;{{cite news|language=ru|url=http://www.mk.ru/politics/2014/10/30/dadut-li-novorossii-sdelat-vybor.html|script-title=ru:Дадут ли Новороссии сделать выбор?|trans-title=Will Novorossia be given a choice?|newspaper=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/a-prelude-to-a-farce-prearranged-ballots-for-kremlin-backed-breakaway-regions-370349.html|title=A prelude to a farce: Prearranged ballots for Kremlin-backed breakaway regions|author=Oleg Sukhov|work=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=1 November 2014|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Playboy: The Mansion''''' is a [[simulation game|simulation]] [[video game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] consoles, developed by [[Cyberlore Studios]], published by [[Groove Games]] and [[Arush Entertainment]] and licensed by [[Playboy Enterprises]].

==Gameplay==

''Playboy: The Mansion'' puts players in the role of [[Hugh Hefner]], the founder of ''[[Playboy]]'' Magazine and [[Playboy Enterprises]], referred to in the game as 'Hef'. The aim of the game is to build the famed Playboy Empire from scratch, starting from a humble magazine to celebrity endorsements to home entertainment to Internet websites to merchandise.

The player can mold the famed [[Playboy Mansion]] to their own needs and wants, and has the option of experiencing the infamous ''Playboy'' [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] parties in locations such as the Grotto and the Clubhouse. Hef, as well as all other characters in the game, can build three types of relationships with other characters: casual, business, and romantic.  Each month, the player has to print an issue of the magazine.  To do that the player needs a cover shoot, a centerfold, an essay from a celebrity, interview with a celebrity, a pictorial about a subject and an article about a subject.  The player must hire photographers and writers to create each issue.  All the characters have interests, such as sports and music, and writers on those topics will produce higher-quality articles. In the game, the player is the photographer during photo shoots. The game contains many sexual references, including sexual relationships.

There are twelve missions in total. Some of the goals include making and/or fixing relationships with people, publishing certain magazine content, and throwing parties. Players can also choose not to achieve goals, as there is no time limit, and do other things such as parties, mansion renovations and playing with the mansion's variety of games; however, magazines must continue to be published as that is the player's income source.

==Music==

A soundtrack to the game, mixed by [[United States|American]] [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] and [[record producer]] [[Felix da Housecat]] has been released. It features house tracks by many renowned producers like [[Armand Van Helden]], [[DJ Sneak]] or [[Kaskade]].

==Expansion pack==
''Playboy: The Mansion -  Private Party Expansion Pack'' is the expansion pack. It adds extra features such as parties like [[Playboy Mansion#Midsummer Night's Dream Party|Midsummer Night's Dream]], world-famous celebrities and [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]]s, new animations, enhanced character editing and party-themed music.

===Features===
The expansion adds many new features to the game. When characters engage in sexual activities, they now remove their underwear and their [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] are blurred, much like ''[[The Sims]]'' characters. Another feature is the ability to throw "theme parties", which consist of Halloween, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hef's Birthday, Tropical, Playmate of the Year and more.

[[Eurogamer]] noted that the game was similar to ''The Sims'' series but was unfortunately less entertaining.  It was considered "a little too slight a proposition for a full game."&lt;ref name=EuroG/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' gave it a mixed review and stated, "Sex and nudity often work well in movies, but video games laced with sex never rise above mediocrity, and ''Mansion'' seems decidedly underbaked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/technology/circuits/17game.html?ex=1109307600&amp;en=c4214af930777332&amp;ei=5070&amp;_r=0|title=Underneath It All, Substance Sells|last=Herold|first=Charles|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2005-02-17|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it "A frisky concept with limited thrills and not enough depth to challenge gamers."&lt;ref name=Sydney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Games/Playtime-cut-short/2005/03/23/1111525214598.html|title=Playtime cut short|last=Wilcox|first=Mike|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=2005-03-25|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' gave it two stars out of four and stated, "I flipped on the game expecting a world of champagne, roses and frequent wisps of steam.

The '''[[pulp and paper industry]] in Europe''' accounts for about a quarter of world production and is a major employer. The leading producing countries are [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Germany]]. The industry is a large user of [[renewable energy]] and achieved a [[recycling rate]] of 71.5% in 2015.&lt;ref name="Key Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Statistics 2015|url=http://www.cepi.org/topics/statistics/keystatistics2015|website=CEPI|publisher=Confederation of European Paper Industries|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production data== 
The European [[paper industry]] produces more than 90 million tonnes of paper and board and more than 36 million tonnes of pulp annually. Directly it provides 178,000 jobs and indirectly 3 million jobs along the forest and paper chain.&lt;ref name=cepi&gt;[http://www.cepi-sustainability.eu CEPI Sustainability Report] CEPI Sustainability Report 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The European paper industry's [[revenue|turnover]] is approximately 180 billion euros.&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{cite web|title=Pulp and paper industry|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/raw-materials/industries/forest-based/pulp-paper/index_en.htm|website=Growth|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 633 companies are represented by the [[Confederation of European Paper Industries]] (CEPI)&lt;ref name="cepi.org"&gt;http://www.cepi.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and these account for 23% of world production.
The raw material consists of 40% recycled fibre and 44% virgin pulp, the balance being other pulp (1%) and non-fibrous materials (15%). 94% of the wood requirements come from managed forests within Europe.

In national terms the largest ''paper'' producer is Germany, followed by Finland, Sweden and France; the largest ''pulp'' producers are Finland and Sweden. The two largest European companies in the sector, [[Stora Enso]] and [[UPM (company)|UPM]], are both based in Finland.

==Renewable energy==
The European pulp and paper industry is the largest industrial producer and consumer of energy from [[renewable source]]s. Its share of [[biomass]]-based energy exceeds 55% of its total primary annual [[energy consumption]] of 1,301,483  TJ.&lt;ref name=cepi /&gt; The sector has adopted an objective to reduce carbon emissions of 80% by 2050, which is likely to involve new technological methods to reduce water usage and thus reduce energy usage.&lt;ref name=ec /&gt;

==Recycling==
Paper for recycling is a major source of the paper industry’s raw material, which is why the industry aims to maximise the European recycling rate. The recycling rate along the paper value chain (ERPC) reached 71.5% in 2015 - exceeding the voluntary target of 70% that was set by the industries declaration in 2011. The total amount of paper collected and sent to recycling in paper mills in 2015 was almost 56 million tonnes. 18.2% was exported for recycling in third countries in 2015.&lt;ref name="Key Statistics"/&gt; The recycling rate is now considered close to its maximum possible.

==Innovation==

The European paper industry is a highly innovative sector. Its strategic vision of reconciling sustainability and competitiveness, the inherent properties of its raw materials, and the transformation the sector is going through, are already delivering new products, new technologies, new bio-values, and business opportunities. 
In 2011, the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI)&lt;ref name="cepi.org"/&gt; launched the “2050 Roadmap to a low-carbon bioeconomy”,&lt;ref name=roadmap&gt;{{cite web|title=2050 Roadmap to a low-carbon economy|url=http://www.cepi.org/node/300|website=CEPI|publisher=Confederation of European Paper Industries|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the very first European manufacturing industry sector to react to the European Commission’s roadmap towards a low-carbon economy with its own sector roadmap. The “Two Team Project”, which ran in 2013, sought to find the most innovative breakthrough technologies of the industry with two teams competing against each other. Eight breakthrough technologies made it to the publication.&lt;ref name="Two Team Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Team Project report|url=http://www.cepi.org/system/files/public/documents/publications/innovation/2013/finaltwoteamprojectreport_website_updated.pdf|website=CEPI|publisher=Confederation of European Paper Industries|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2015, CEPI collected more than 40 of the industry’s most innovative products in another publication, “The Age of Fibre”,&lt;ref name="Age of Fibre"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Fibre|url=http://www.cepi.org/system/files/public/documents/publications/innovation/2015/Finalwebversion.pdf|website=CEPI|publisher=Confederation of European Paper Industries|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  showcasing once again the versatility and innovation in the industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2110">The '''Rushmore Drilling Index''' (RDI) and '''Rushmore Estimated Drilling Days''' (REDD) are popular analytical tools developed in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=72342| title=Rigzone: Operators Welcome New Global Drilling Difficulty Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned by [[Rushmore Reviews]], to assist [[Oil_well|well]] planners.

==History==
The RDI is an analytical tool based on [[Rushmore Reviews]] extensive global drilling database of [[Offset Well Data|offset wells]], and is available to oil and gas companies who participate in the Reviews. The index is an entirely objective tool, and essentially estimates the speed it will take to drill a well after the user supplies the equation with 8-10 characteristics. The drilling speed is converted into an index number, ranging from 10 (easiest) to over 200 (most difficult). The resulting RDI number can then be used as a point of reference for well planning.&lt;ref name=oe200911&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slb.com/~/media/Files/drilling/industry_articles/200911_oe_operation_support_center.pdf|last=Offshore Engineer|title=Putting It All Together|magazine=Offshore Engineer|date=November 1, 2009|page=55|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307143856/http://www.slb.com/~/media/Files/drilling/industry_articles/200911_oe_operation_support_center.pdf|archivedate=March 7, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The REDD was developed alongside the RDI by combining the most significant coefficients into a formula. Once the user has supplied the equation with 8-10 characteristics, it provides a P50 estimate of the number of days and ‘average’ Operator would take to drill a well.

'''SecureDrop''' is an [[open-source software]] platform for [[secure communication]] between [[journalist]]s and [[Source (journalism)|sources]] ([[whistleblower]]s).&lt;ref name=Guardian-SecureDrop-2014&gt;{{cite news|first1= James|last1=Ball|title= Guardian launches SecureDrop system for whistleblowers to share files|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/guardian-launches-securedrop-whistleblowers-documents|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally designed and developed by [[Aaron Swartz]] and [[Kevin Poulsen]] under the name ''DeadDrop''.&lt;ref name=kassner2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/aaron-swartz-legacy-lives-on-with-new-yorkers-strongbox-how-it-works/ |title=Aaron Swartz legacy lives on with New Yorker's Strongbox: How it works |last1=Kassner |first1=Michael |date=20 May 2013 |website=[[TechRepublic]] |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorker-StrongboxAaronSwartz-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poulsen|first1=Kevin|title=Strongbox and Aaron Swartz|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/strongbox-and-aaron-swartz|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=14 May 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Dolan (computer security expert)|James Dolan]] also co-created the software.&lt;ref name=FreedomPressFdn-Dolan-Obit-2018&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timm|first1=Trevor|title=A tribute to James Dolan, co-creator of SecureDrop, who has tragically passed away at age 36|url=https://freedom.press/news/tribute-james-dolan-co-creator-securedrop-who-has-tragically-passed-away-age-36/|work=[[Freedom of the Press Foundation]]|date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After Aaron Swartz's death, the first instance of the platform was launched under the name ''Strongbox'' by staff at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on 15 May 2013.&lt;ref name=davidson2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/05/introducing-strongbox-anonymous-document-sharing-tool.html |title=Introducing Strongbox |last1=Davidson |first1=Amy |authorlink1=Amy Davidson (author) |date=15 May 2013 |website=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=20 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]] took over development of DeadDrop under the name ''SecureDrop'', and has since assisted with its installation at several news organizations, including [[ProPublica]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Intercept]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="strongbox"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New Yorker|url=https://projects.newyorker.com/strongbox/ |title=Strongbox|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="luxembourg"&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1308.6768|last1=Biryukov|first1=Alex|title=Content and popularity analysis of Tor hidden services|last2=Pustogarov|first2=Ivan|last3=Thill|first3=Fabrice|last4=Weinmann|first4=Ralf-Philipp|class=cs.CR|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;{{cite news|author=Davidson, Amy|date=15 May 2013|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/05/introducing-strongbox-anonymous-document-sharing-tool.html |title=Introducing Strongbox|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==

SecureDrop uses the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] to facilitate communication between [[whistleblowers]], journalists, and news organizations. SecureDrop sites are therefore only accessible as hidden services in the Tor network. After a user visits a SecureDrop website, they are given a randomly generated code name.&lt;ref name= davidson2013/&gt; This code name is used to send information to a particular author or editor via uploading. [[Investigative journalist]]s can contact the whistleblower via SecureDrop messaging. Therefore, the whistleblower must take note of their random code name.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;

The system utilizes private, segregated [[server (computing)|servers]] that are in the possession of the news organization. Journalists use two [[USB flash drive]]s and two personal computers to access SecureDrop data.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;&lt;ref name= davidson2013/&gt; The first personal computer accesses SecureDrop via the Tor network, the journalist uses the first flash drive to download [[encrypted]] data from the Internet. The second personal computer does not connect to the Internet, and is wiped during each reboot.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;&lt;ref name= davidson2013/&gt; The second flash drive contains a [[decryption]] code. The first and second flash drives are inserted into the second personal computer, and the material becomes available to the journalist. The personal computer is shut down after each use.&lt;ref name=kassner2013/&gt;

Freedom of the Press Foundation has stated it will have the SecureDrop code and security environment audited by an independent third party before every major version release and then publish the results.&lt;ref name=second-audit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timm|first1=Trevor|title=SecureDrop Undergoes Second Security Audit|url=https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/01/securedrop-undergoes-second-security-audit|accessdate=13 July 2014|agency=Freedom of the Press Foundation|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first audit was conducted by University of Washington security researchers and [[Bruce Schneier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Czeskis|first1=Alexei|last2=Mah|first2=David|last3=Sandoval|first3=Omar|last4=Smith|first4=Ian|last5=Koscher|first5=Karl|last6=Appelbaum|first6=Jacob|last7=Kohno|first7=Tadayoshi|last8=Schneier|first8=Bruce|title=DeadDrop/StrongBox Security Assessment|url=http://www.czeskis.com/research/pubs/UW-CSE-13-08-02.PDF|publisher=University of Washington Department of Computer Science and Engineering|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second audit was conducted by [[Cure53]], a German security firm.&lt;ref name=second-audit/&gt;

SecureDrop suggests sources disable [[JavaScript]] to protect anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/source.html Source Guide] SecureDrop&lt;/ref&gt;

== Company history ==
[[Image:Norema treaty.jpg|thumb|left|The Portuguese secretary of economy and the Norwegian ambassador signing the agreement that originated the company, Lisbon, 1981]]

Founded as Norema Portuguesa in 1981 by the marriage of the Norwegian [[Norema]] SA and the Portuguese Mendes Godinho SA, it was meant to
combine the Norway's high technology with the Portuguese efficiency and affordable costs to produce [[furniture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dre.pt/|title=Home - DRE|website=Diário da República Eletrónico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1984 and 1994, the company manufactured a line of modular furniture for [[IKEA]]  which contributed to the improvement of its production and the decreased of its costs.

In 1995, the Norwegian partners took complete ownership of the company and started to produce kitchen, bathroom and living furniture exclusively to the Norwegian market where it maintained its own flagship stores.

In 2000, TemaHome was created through the leadership of its new major shareholder, the British [[3i group]] PLC. From this point on, the ownership of the company was composed by four different stockholders, the British 3i&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3i.com|title=Home|website=www.3i.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (41.50%), the Spanish MCH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.es/|title=Grupo MCH|website=www.mch.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; (25.25%), the Portuguese ESCAPITAL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapital.pt|title=Haitong|website=www.escapital.pt|access-date=2008-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201045816/http://www.escapital.pt/|archive-date=2014-02-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (25.25%) and its management team (8%).

Later in 2006, a new ownership structure was defined by a [[Management buy-in]] headed by a new management team and ownership was divided as follows: Management team (30%), Lead Capital management fund (60%) and an individual investor, Miguel Calado (10%).

By the end of 2007, the company employed over 170 workers in its staff, distribute between its Lisbon headquarters and a 16.500 Sq meters production plant in the city of [[Tomar]].

Today, TemaHome produces a line of contemporary furniture and decorative accents combining modern lines and designs by some Portuguese designers such as the likes of [[Filipe Alarcão]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resourceguide.interiordesign.net/CompanyInfo.aspx?CoID=3658137&amp;Company=Temahome|title=Interior Design Magazine|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product range ==
[[Image:gem filipe.jpg|thumb|Filipe Alarcão and the GEM table]]

The range of products is composed by 3 distinct lines: essence, style and trends.
* ''Essence'': Basic essential furnishing, ready to assembly similar to the [[IKEA]] style.

== Design team ==

The in house team is composed by [[Maria Joao Maia]], [[Délio Vicente]], [[Ricardo Marçal]] and [[Nádia Soares]].

The company also works in cooperation on external designers like [[Marco Sousa Santos, Fernando Brizio and Miguel Vieira Batista]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''''The Money Wheel''''' was a business news [[television program]] aired on weekdays on the [[CNBC]] network from its inception in 1989 until 1998. Initially, ''The Money Wheel'' covered almost all of the channel's business day hours, airing continuously from 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

''The Money Wheel'' was hosted by many anchors of CNBC, including [[Ted David]], [[Felicia Taylor]], [[Bill Griffeth]], [[Sue Herera]], [[Ron Insana]], [[Terry Keenan]], [[John Stehr]] and [[Kevin McCullough]].

Regular segments included ''Taking Stock'' where viewers could phone-in and ask the guest analysts' recommendations on certain stocks.

As a result of CNBC's alliance with [[Dow Jones]], the show was renamed ''[[Market Watch]]'' in the morning and was replaced by an extended ''[[Street Signs (television show)|Street Signs]]'' in the afternoon.  At the time, most segments remained the same.

==International Editions==
CNBC's two main international channels, CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia aired regional versions of the programme to give viewers live action on regional markets.

The '''University of Malaya''' ('''UM'''; {{lang-ms|Universiti Malaya}})  is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. It is the oldest and most prestigious university in Malaysia.

University of Malaya has its roots in Singapore with the establishment of King Edward VII College of Medicine on 28 September 1905. University Malaya was established on 1949 October in Singapore with the merger of the King Edward VII College of Medicine and Raffles College (founded 1929). The growth of the University was very rapid during the first decade of its foundation and this resulted in the setting up of two autonomous Divisions on 15 January 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur. In 1960, the government of the two indicated that the two divisions of the University of Malaya should become autonomous separate national universities, one located in Singapore (later becoming the [[National University of Singapore]]) and the other in Kuala Lumpur (retaining the name University of Malaya). Legislation was passed in 1961 and the University of Malaya was established on 1 January 1962.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.nus.edu.sg/nusbiodata/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620012218/http://www.lib.nus.edu.sg/nusbiodata/history.htm |archivedate=20 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malaysiacentral.com"/&gt; In 2012, UM was granted autonomy by the Ministry of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AMINUDDIN|first=MOHSIN|title=UM set for autonomy|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/1/23/nation/10314089&amp;sec=nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126040711/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/1/23/nation/10314089&amp;sec=nation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 January 2012|work=|publisher=The Star|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today, UM  has more than 2,500 faculty members and is divided into 12 faculties, 2 academies and 3 Centres, namely: Faculty of Law, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Built Environment, Faculty of Economics and Administration, Faculty of Business and Accountancy, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Academy of Malay Studies, Academy of Islamic Studies, Cultural Centre, Sports Centre and [[Centre for Foundation Studies (University of Malaya)]].

In 2018, the [[QS World University Rankings]] ranked UM at the 87th place in the world, 19th place in Asia, 3rd in Southeast Asia and the top-ranked learning institution in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universiti-malaya-um|title=Universiti Malaya (UM)|publisher=QS Top Universities|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===King Edward VII Medical College of Medicine===
The establishment of the university began with the issue of shortage of medical assistants in [[Singapore]] and [[Penang]] during the late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=1–2 |chapter=Early Medical Education |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was addressed in a report published by the Education Commission in April 1902. In the report, it was stated that the Commission was in favour of establishing a medical school to fulfil the demand for medical assistants in government hospitals. However, such a view was not in favour among the European community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=3–4 |chapter=The Foundation |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation was passed by the [[Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements|Straits Legislative Council]] in June 1905 under Ordinance No. XV 1905. The school opened on 3 July 1905 and began functioning in September. On 28 September 1905, Sir John officiated the school under the name ‘The Straits and Federated Malay States Government Medical School.’&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=6 |chapter=The Quest for Recognition |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was located in the old Female Lunatic Asylum near the [[Singapore General Hospital]] at Sepoy Lines off [[New Bridge Road]], where four of the asylum buildings were converted into a medical school. In 1907, a lecture hall and laboratory were added. There were no library and room to keep pathological specimens.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

In 1905, there were 17 medical students, four students attending the hospital assistant course. Five years later, the enrolments increased to 90 medical students and 30 trainee hospital assistants.  The school had only one permanent staff which was the Principal, the teaching staff were employed on a part-time basis.  The Principal was Dr Gerald Dudley Freer, who previously served as Senior Colonial Surgeon Resident of Penang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=6–9 |chapter=The Quest for Recognition |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheah |first=Jin Seng |authorlink= |author2=TM Ho |author3=BY Ng |editor= |others= |title=Annals Academy of Medicine|origyear= |url=http://www.annals.edu.sg/pdf/34VolNo6200506/V34N6p19C.pdf |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series=6 |volume=34 |date= July 2005 |publisher=National University of Singapore |location=Singapore  |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=19C |chapter=The First Graduates in 1910|chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School Council wanted to gain recognition of its Diploma by the [[General Medical Council|General Council of Medical Education]] in the [[United Kingdom]] to ensure that the Licentiate of Medicine and Surgery Diploma offered by the school would gain worldwide recognition. In 1916, the GCME recognised the Licentiate of Medicine and Surgery Diploma offered by the school. The licentiates were placed on the General Council’s Colonial List of the British Medical Register and were entitled to practise anywhere within the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=10 |chapter=Students: The Trail-Blazers |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tan Teck Guan Building, Aug 07.JPG|thumb|220px|left|thumb|[[Tan Teck Guan Building]]]]

In 1910, Dr Robert Donald Keith became the second Principal of the School. The first two years of the five-year course were devoted to pure science studies. Physics, biology and chemistry were taught in the first year, followed by physiology and elementary anatomy in the second year. The remaining three years were attachment to clinical clerkships in medicine, surgery and midwifery, which covered pathology, hygiene and medical jurisprudence. [[Materia Medica]] was integrated into the fourth year, where practical pharmacy was taught.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=7 |chapter=The Quest for Recognition |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students were posted to several hospitals, initially at the [[Singapore General Hospital]]. From 1908 onwards, attachments were made to [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]] (for medicine and surgery) and [[Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital|Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital]] (for midwifery).&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

In 1912, the medical school received an [[financial endowment|endowment]] of $120,000 from the [[King Edward VII]] Memorial Fund, started by Dr [[Lim Boon Keng]]. Subsequently, on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to the King Edward VII School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=11–12 |chapter=Students: The Trail-Blazers |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first batch of 16 students of 1905, only seven made to the final and graduated in May 1910 while the remaining six students graduated in four months later and others resigned from the school. In 1919, the drop-out rate had risen to 35%, while in 1939 the number of students failed in their final examinations stood at 44%.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

At this time a hostel was built to accommodate 72 male students from the Federated Malay States.

In 1921, the school was elevated in status to college. Between 1920 and 1930, the college went through a series of transformations, by replacing the old teaching staff with a younger generation of professionals and also nine new Chairs were created, the first in Anatomy in 1920, followed by Medicine, Surgery, and Midwifery &amp; Gynaecology in 1922 and Clinical Surgery, Bacteriology, Biology, Bio-Chemistry, and Dental Surgery in 1926. And the tenth Chair for Pathology was created in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=12–14 |chapter=Consolidation |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the college’s new building at [[Outram, Singapore|Outram Road]] was commenced. It was completed in November 1925 and officially opened by Sir [[Laurence Guillemard]] in February 1926. During the opening ceremony, the College conferred Honorary Diplomas on Sir [[David James Galloway]], Dr [[Malcolm Watson]] and Dr [[Lim Boon Keng]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=14 |chapter=Consolidation |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Dr George V. Allen the new principal took the helm, succeeding his predecessor Dr MacAlister.

===Raffles College===
The establishment of Raffles College was a brainchild of Sir [[Stamford Raffles]] and Dr Robert Morison. Sir Stamford, the founding father of Singapore, had knowledge of the Malay language and culture, while Morison was a distinguished sinologist missionary. Both men wanted to establish a centre dedicating to the study of Malays and Chinese at tertiary level.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=23 |chapter=Raffles College: Background |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 1823, a site designated for an education institution had its foundation stone laid by Sir Stamford. Soon after that, Raffles left for England and Morrison left for China, thus the establishment of the school never happened. The school building was revived as an English school named the [[Raffles Institution (Secondary)|Raffles Institution]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

In 1918, Sir [[William George Maxwell]], the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements chaired the Maxwell Committee to review the scheme to commemorate the centenary of the founding of Singapore by Sir Stamford. The committee members were [[Roland Braddell]], [[A.W. Still]], [[Seah Ling Seah]], Dr [[Lim Boon Keng]], [[Mohammed Yusoff bin Mohammed]], [[N.V. Samy]], and [[Mannesseh Meyer]].  The working committee headed by H.W. Firmstone recommended the establishment of a college for tertiary education to commemorate the centenary founding of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=25 |chapter=The Maxwell Committee|chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July 1919, the Government decided to undertake the construction of the building with the cost not more than $1,000,000 and would contribute $50,000 as annual recurrent expenditure as soon as the Centenary Committee had collected $2,000,000 for the Raffles College Endowment Fund. On 31 August 1920, the Committee had achieved the figure, amounting to $2,391,040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=26 |chapter=The Maxwell Committee|chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 1920, [[Richard Olaf Winstedt]] was appointed as the Acting Principal of Raffles College. The course offered was a three-year basis. The establishment of the school was seen far more systematic compared to the King Edward VII Medical College. The school was situated at a site called the Economic Gardens and was designed by [[Cyril Farey]] and Graham Dawbarn. And the construction took place in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=27 |chapter=The Maxwell Committee|chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 1929, [[Raffles College]] was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayans. The courses offered were divided into Art and Science streams. Four years later, the College Council proposed changes in the curriculum, so that the Diploma could be furthered to a Degree through external examinations in collaboration with universities in [[England]].

In 1937, Sir [[Shenton Thomas]] declared the college would have a full-time Principal. The College had its fourth Principal, [[Alexander Keir]], succeeding [[Frederick Joseph Morten]]. By 1939 war was waged in Europe, and had put a halt to the development of the college. The war in Europe came to Asia and Singapore was invaded by the [[Japanese invasion of Singapore|Japanese]] in February 1942.

After the war, the school was reopened and W.E. Dyer was Principal. The future of Raffles College was uncertain, until 1948 when Dr George V. Allen (later Sir) who was formerly the Principal of King Edward VII Medical College posted as the last Principal of Raffles College. The college was amalgamated with the former, for the making of a university for the Malayans.

===University of Malaya (1949–1967)===
[[File:Evolution of the University of Malaya.png|thumb|left|The evolution of the University of Malaya]]

In 1938 the government appointed a commission under the chairmanship of Sir William H. McLean to study the higher education potential and progress in Malaya. The Commission concluded that Malaya was not ready to have a university, and that a university college would be more suitable. In 1939, the Higher Education in the British Colonies appointed a Commission led by Justice Asquith to further study the matter. The Commission shared the same opinion as the former McLean Commission.

In 1946, Dr Raymond Priestley, the Vice-Chancellor of Birmingham University was invited by the British Malaya Government to continue the review of setting up a University for Malaya. The Priestly Commission shared the same opinion as the McLean Commission, which was to form a university college first.

In 1947, the Secretary of State for the Colonies appointed Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders to chair a commission to study the development of tertiary education in Malaya. Initially, the Carr-Saunders Commission shared the same opinion as the McLean Commission. However, after the report was completed (but not yet summited to the Secretary of State), Sir Alexander listened to the thoughts of the Alumni Association of the King Edward VII College and also the Medical College Students Union. He was impressed with the ideas of the President of the Students Union, Dr K. Shamugaratnam. In 1948, the Carr-Saunders Commission supported the establishment of a university for the Malayans.

As a result, the institution named the University of Malaya was chartered under the Carr-Saunders Commission in 1949. The formation of the University of Malaya on 8 October 1949 in Singapore came from the merger of King Edward VII College of Medicine and Raffles College, which had been established in 1905 and 1929, respectively.

In Carr-Saunders Commission’s report in 1949, it was stated that "the university shall act as a single medium of mingle for enhancing the understanding among the multi-ethnics and religions in the back than Malaya. The University too should be modelled after the tertiary educations in the United Kingdom of Great Britain in term of academic system and administration structure".

The Carr-Saunders Commission postulates “the principle that all children who show the necessary capacity should enjoy an equal chance of reaching the University; and, in particular, that no able child should be handicapped in climbing the educational ladder by race, religion, rural domicile, or lack of means.”

In 1959, the university was divided into two autonomous campuses, one in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur. In 1961, the governments of Malaysia and Singapore passed the legislation to make the university a national university. As a result of such desire, on 1 January 1962 the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur was permanently located on a 309 hectare land and remained with the name. However, the campus in Singapore became the University of Singapore (today the [[National University of Singapore]]).

On 16 June 1962, the university celebrated the installation of its first [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], Malaysia's first [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]]. The first [[Vice-Chancellor]] was former [[Dean (education)|Dean]], Sir [[Alexander Oppenheim]], the world-renowned mathematician who formulated the [[Oppenheim conjecture]] in 1929. When Oppenheim left in 1965 with no successor in sight, [[Rayson Huang]] who later went on to become the first Asian Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;University of Hong Kong: [http://www.hku.hk/convocat/newsletter/web_0101/con_huang.htm A Liftime of Memories – Dr Rayson Huang Book Launch] (retrieved 11 June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; was asked to take over as the Acting Vice-Chancellor. He served in that capacity for 12 months but declined reappointment to return to academic pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huang |first=Rayson |authorlink=Rayson Huang |editor= |others= |title=A Lifetime in Academia: An Autobiography by Rayson Huang |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2000 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |location=Hong Kong, China  |isbn=962-209-518-6 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=81–83 |chapter=A New University in a New Country |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chin Fung Kee]], an authority in [[geotechnical engineering]],&lt;ref&gt;Southeast Asian Geotechnical Society: [http://www.seags.ait.ac.th/history.htm A Brief History of the SEAGS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420071113/http://www.seags.ait.ac.th/history.htm |date=20 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced Huang as Acting Vice-Chancellor until the university filling the position in 1967 by the appointment of [[James H.E. Griffiths]]. A distinguished physicist and a fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], Griffiths was also the former head of [[Clarendon Laboratory]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and one of the discoverers of [[ferromagnetic resonance]].

===Coat of Arms===
The University of Malaya’s Coat of Arms was designed under a Council established in 1961,chaired by Tan Sri Y.C. Foo. The members of the committee involved in the design were the Chairman of the Council, Y.C. Foo, Professor A. Oppenheim (the Vice-Chancellor) and Professor Ungku Aziz (later Regius Professor). The Coat of Arms was officially chartered in April 1962 by Tunku Abdul Rahman, the university’s first Chancellor.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khoo |first=Kay Kim |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=100 Years: The University of Malaya |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2005 |publisher=University of Malaya Press |location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  |isbn=983-100-323-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=ii |chapter=Coat of Arms |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coat of Arms is divided into two parts, namely the Chief (upper part) and the Base (the remainder). The Chief is a bundle of seventeen strips of the leaves of ''Borassus flabellifer'' or the Palmrya palm. These strips were used as printed material for ancient books by the Malays, long before paper was invented.  On the centre of these seventeen strips is the university’s motto ‘Ilmu Puncha Kemajuan’. The motto consists of ‘Ilmu’ derived from Arabic, ‘Puncha’ from Sanskrit, and ‘Kemajuan’ from Malay. These words mean knowledge is the source of progress.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

In the centre of the emblem is a ''Hibiscus rosa-sinensis'' species encircled by three Malayan tigers. The tigers symbolise the three main races in Malaysia (Malays, Chinese and Indians), who work hand-in-hand to protect the nation and uphold the duty to serve the country.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

==Early life==
Janković was born in the village of [[Saraorci]] near the town of [[Smederevo]] in [[Serbia]], then part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], to a [[Serbs|Serb]] father and a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] mother. His parents moved to Slovenia for a better life, and left their son in poverty with his grandmother in Saraorci. In this time, his sister Jagoda was born. After finishing fourth grade of the primary school in 1964, he moved to Ljubljana so that he could learn English instead of Russian. He did not know Slovenian at the time. In Ljubljana, he attended the Valentin Vodnik Primary School in [[Šiška District|Šiška]] and the Kette and Murn Primary School in [[Kodeljevo]] in the last grade. Then, he attended the [[Poljane High School]], where he learned French. There, he met his wife Mija, the cousin of [[Gregor Virant]], who later became an influential politician. In 1971, he entered the [[Faculty of Economics, Ljubljana|Faculty of Economics]] in Ljubljana, from which he graduated in 1980 with the thesis "Agricultural Goods Wheelers-Dealers in Our Country" ({{lang-sl|Prekupčevalci s kmetijskim blagom pri nas}}). During study, he built a house with the money he earned working for the AMD Moste (Auto-Moto Society Moste), with bookkeeping and with cargo transportation. In 1974, he married Mija and later had two children with her, Damijan and Jure.&lt;ref name="Mladina"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mladina.si/91503/nar-kdo_je_kdaj--vanja_pirc/ |title=Zoran Janković |publisher=Mladina |year=2004 |author=Vanja Pirc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as manager==
Janković started his career in 1978 in the investment sector of [[Pošta Slovenije|Post of Slovenia]]&lt;ref name="Finance"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.finance.si/intervju.php?id=25 |title=Zoran Janković, župan Ljubljane |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Zoran Janković, the Mayor of Ljubljana |publisher=Finance.si |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is deficient information, as at the time the postal, telephone and telegraph services were still united within PTT Slovenija with several regional PTT branches and it is not clear in which of these organizations Janković was employed).&lt;ref name="Pošta Slovenije"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.posta.si/opis-storitve/554/Posta-nekoc |title=Pošta nekoč, Obdobje druge Jugoslavije in nadaljnji razvoj pošte pri nas |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Postal service in the past, the period in the second Yugoslavia and further development of postal service |publisher=posta.si}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1979 till 1984, he was a representative of the company Grič Zagreb, and was appointed the acting director of the tourism and trade company Mercator Investa in 1984. As the company sponsors the basketball club [[KK Union Olimpija|Smelt Olimpija]], he became also the vice-president of the club.&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt; Later, he became the general director of the company.&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt;  After the merge of Mercator Investa and Mercator Inženiring in 1988, he was not appointed the director of the joint company, so he left. Since 1988 till 1990, he was the vice-director of SOZD Emona and the acting director of Emona-VPS. In December 1988, he survived a severe car crash without major injuries.&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt; In 1990, as he was not appointed the director of Emona, he founded the civil engineering and interior design company [[Electa]] and remained its director till 1997. He moved to [[Golovec]] where he jogged a lot. Electa sponsored several junior sports teams. Janković became the main sponsor in 1992 and the president of the handball club [[RK Krim|Krim]], later renamed to HC Krim Electa. The club made extraordinary progress and then won the national handball cup for several years. In 1995, Janković stepped down from the position of the president of the club due to his dissatisfaction with the Ljubljana city distribution of money to clubs.&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krim"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/sport/zgodbe/liga-prvakinj-v-rokometu/174 |title=Liga prvakinj v nogometu |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The League of Handball Champions |publisher=MMC RTV Slovenia |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he became the president of the [[Handball Federation of Slovenia]]. He retained the position till 2004.&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt;

In 1995, Janković entered the Supervisory Board of Mercator as the representative of the [[Slovenian Compensation Company]] ({{lang|sl|Slovenska odškodninska družba}}, SOD), which was led at the time by [[Tone Rop]], the then Slovenian [[Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Affairs|Minister of Labour]] and the president of the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]] (LDS). According to the magazine [[Mladina]], the main lobbyist for the entry of Janković into Mercator was Peter Rigl, who was also member of LDS.&lt;ref name="MlaMerc" /&gt;

In 1997, after the Supervisory Board of the Slovenian retail company [[Mercator (Slovenia)|Mercator]] deposed [[Kazimir Živko Pregelj]] as the chairman, due partly to the 2.5 billion [[Slovenian tolar|tolars]] debt of the company, the board appointed Janković as the new director. In 2002, a recording by [[POP TV]] was published, in which Rop scolded at Janković that he himself had enabled Janković to enter Mercator. Both of them claimed later that the recording had been torn out of context, and that it had been about the entry into the supervisory board and not becoming the president of the company. According to [[Miran Goslar]] and Janković himself, the appointment was not politically motivated but made exclusively by influential managers in Mercator.&lt;ref name="MlaMerc" /&gt; Goslar stated that not even one of the then politicians supported the appointment of Janković.&lt;ref name="MlaMerc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mladina.si/94792/slo--mercatorgate-vanja_pirc/ |title=Politično imenovanje ali razrešitev |language=Slovenian |trans-title=A Political Appointment or a Dismissal |publisher=Mladina |date=4 December 2005 |author=Vasja Pirc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mercator Brežice - plošča temeljni kamen.jpg|thumb|left|The plaque next to the entrance of the [[Brežice]] Mercator mall commemorating the laying of the [[foundation stone]] by Zoran Janković]]
The entry of Janković transformed the company Mercator to the biggest retail company in Slovenia and one of the biggest in the region. The company took over numerous companies, starting with Klas in 1998, and numerous others, among them the most controversial being the take-over of [[Emona Merkur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cek.ef.uni-lj.si/u_diplome/kocjancic1359.pdf |title=Združitve in prevzemi v Sloveniji |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Diploma Thesis: Mergers and Take-Overs in Slovenia: Mercator Živila |author=Peter Kocjančič |date=May 2004 |publisher=Faculty of Economy, University of Ljubljana}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1999, the first Mercator [[hypermarket]] was opened in [[Šiška District|Šiška]]. Despite being a director, Janković actively helped his employees, for example with tidying [[shopping carts]].&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt; In December 2000, Mercator opened its shops abroad for the first time, in [[Pula]], Croatia, and [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in 2002, the largest one in [[Belgrade]], Serbia.&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt;

In 1999, Janković became a member of the management board in the [[Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia]] ({{lang|sl|Gospodarska zbornica Slovenije}}, {{lang|sl|GZS}}), where he was appreciated as constructive and decisive.&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt; In February 2001, Janković received a prize for extraordinary economic and business achievements by GZS.&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt;  In September 2001, an article is published in [[Delo]] describing Electa as being severely indebted, not paying its subcontractors, and making profit from business with Mercator. Several lawsuits were filed in but later withdrawn. Despite the accusations, Janković remained the director of Mercator and Electa fulfilled its obligations. In 2002, he was proclaimed the manager of the year by the management magazine [[Manager (magazine)|Manager]].&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt;

In 2003, Janković started his second term in Mercator. During this term, he actively opposed the act restricting the use of alcohol that prohibited the sale of alcohol to the youth and to drunk people and the sale of alcohol after 9&amp;nbsp;pm. He also opposed the closure of shops on Sundays, which was in September 2003 supported on a referendum. The magazine [[Kapital (magazine)|Kapital]] bestowed him with the title "The best director 2003" ({{lang|sl|Naj direktor 2003}}). At the end of 2003, Mercator took over [[Živila]].

In January 2004, Slovenia hosted the [[2004 European Men's Handball Championship]] and Janković announced his candidacy for the president of the [[European Handball Federation]]. He was a favourite at first but fell out already after the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/sport/rokomet/ehf-jankovic-favorit-za-zmago/102634 |title=EHF: Jankovič favorit za zmago |language=Slovenian |trans-title=EHF: Janković a Favourite for the Win |date=5 May 2004 |publisher=MMC RTV Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/sport/rokomet/jankovic-ne-bo-predsednik-ehf-a/102657 |title=Janković ne bo predsednik EHF-a |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Janković Won't be the President of EHF |publisher=MMC RTV Slovenia |date=7 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, SOD and [[Capital Corporation|KAD]] ({{lang|sl|Kapitalska družba}}) sold a little less than 30% of Mercator to two suppliers of Mercator, [[Istrabenz]] and [[Laško Brewery|Pivovarna Laško]]. On 15 November 2005, the new owners removed Janković from his position for non-culpable reasons and appointed [[Žiga Debeljak]], the financial director of [[Gorenje]].&lt;ref name="Finance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://24ur.com/novice/gospodarstvo/jankovic-dobil-naslednika.html?ar= |title=Janković dobil naslednika |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Janković Gets a Successor |date=November 2005 |publisher=24ur.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janković later accused Prime Minister [[Janez Janša]] of having conspired to achieve his removal as part of a political deal with the new owners of Mercator.

==Mayor of Ljubljana==
[[File:Angela Merkel in Slovenia 2011 (08).jpg|thumb|left|[[Borut Pahor]], [[Angela Merkel]] and Janković in [[Ljubljana Town Hall]]]]

In September 2006, Janković announced his intent to run for the office of mayor of [[Ljubljana]] as an independent candidate. He was elected with a landslide in the first round on 22 October 2006, with almost 63% of the popular vote. [[Zoran Janković List|His list]] won 23 out of 45 seats in the city council, virtually guaranteeing the stability of his administration. He took the office on 17 November 2006. There were numerous campaign promises made before the elections –  including the most prominent one, the building of the [[Stožice Stadium]], a new central football stadium and indoor sports arena, which was built in 2010, solving the decades-old issue of Ljubljana not having such facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siol.net/sportal/nogomet/2010/08/stozice_odpirajo_vrata_2_del.aspx |title=Vse (p)o odprtju štadiona v Stožicah |publisher=Siol.net |date=11 August 2010 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 2010, Janković was re-elected for another 4-year term, receiving almost 65% of the popular vote. His list won 25 out of 45 seats in the city council. The downtown of Ljubljana has been significantly redesigned during his terms, and closed for traffic. However, the debt of the City Municipality of Ljubljana significantly increased, and many promises were not or were only partly realised.&lt;ref name="Dnevnik2012-02-23"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/1042511898 |title=Šestletna zapuščina Jankovića: Veliko projektov je ostalo nedokončanih |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Six-year Legacy of Janković: Many Projects Have Remained Unfinished |newspaper=Dnevnik.si |date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his term as the mayor of Ljubljana, the daily newspaper ''[[Finance (newspaper)|Finance]]'' accused Janković of having abused his powers as mayor of Ljubljana to create economic benefits for his sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslovenija.si/slovenija/od-travnika-do-logisticnega-centra-s-pomocjo-zorana-jankovica/232590 |title=Od travnika do logističnega centra s pomočjo Zorana Jankovića? :: Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=Rtvslovenija.si |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janković rejected these accusations as completely false and based on the journalists' imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibn.si/articles/detail/5847 |title=Janković zanika obtožbe |publisher=IBN.si |accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a celebration of his father's second victory at the Ljubljana local elections, his younger son Jure Janković publicly threatened to murder the ''Finance'' journalist Jaka Elikan, who investigated and wrote about the alleged corruption of the Janković family and who was present at the event; the threat was recorded by the journalists and made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/crna-kronika/jure-jankovic-daj-ubij-tega/241348 |title=Jure Janković: Daj, ubij tega :: Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=Rtvslo.si |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoran Janković publicly reacted to the threat by rejecting any use of violence and apologizing for his son's words; at the same time, however, he accused the journalist of being excessively provocative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=K. K./Ba. B./B.

Following the media allegations of Janković's abuse of power to create economic benefit for his son Jure, an Investigation Commission was formed by the [[Slovenian National Assembly]], headed by the opposition MP Alenka Jeraj. In its final report, the Commission stated that there is a [[reasonable suspicion]] that Zoran Janković abused his power as Mayor of Ljubljana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/jankovic-osumljen-da-je-zlorabljal-svoja-pooblastila.html |title=Janković osumljen, da je zlorabljal svoja pooblastila |publisher=Delo.si |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview to the Croatian daily newspaper ''[[Večernji list]]'' in October 2010, Janković stated corruption is not an important problem in Slovenia; this statement caused some controversy in the Slovenian media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.si/292225/Jankovi%E6-Ne-vem-ali-je-v-Sloveniji-sploh-korupcija/rss |title=Janković: Ne vem, ali je v Sloveniji sploh korupcija – Slovenija |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Janković: I'm Not Sure, Whether There's Corruption in Slovenia At All |publisher=Finance.si |date=17 October 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and triggered a negative public response by the [[Commission for the Prevention of Corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delo.si/zgodbe/sobotnapriloga/kot-da-partizanov-leta-1965-ne-bi-bilo-vec-na-oblasti.html |title=Kot da partizanov leta 1965 ne bi bilo več na oblasti |publisher=Delo.si |date=4 December 2011 |accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entry into national politics==

On 11 October 2011, Janković announced his candidacy for prime minister with his own party, [[Positive Slovenia]], to "make a better world for all Slovenians, beyond current political doctrines and practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siol.net/novice/slovenija/2011/10/jankoviceva_stranka_naj_bi_se_imenovala_pozitivna_slovenija.aspx |title=Jankovićeva stranka naj bi se imenovala Pozitivna Slovenija – Planet |publisher=Siol.net |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked what made him decide to run for the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2011|Slovenian parliamentary election]], Janković replied that his final decision was made upon his wife's insistence that he should run in order to protect their children from unjust persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://tvslo.si/predvajaj/pogledi-slovenije/ava2.122823508/#ava2.118884445;; |title=Pogledi Slovenije |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Views of Slovenia |date=20 October 2011 |publisher=RTV Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was made in regard of the committee established by the Slovenian [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]] in order to investigate Janković's alleged misuse of power as mayor of Ljubljana; his both sons were summoned to testify at the committee, both availing themselves with the [[right to silence]]. The influential&lt;!-- http://www.pomurec.com/vsebina/7436/Milanu_Kucanu_pripisujejo_vecji_vpliv_kot_Danilu_Trku_najvplivnejsi_Zoran_Jankovic --&gt; investigative journalist [[Bojan Traven]] raised a theory, according to which Janković's entry into state politics was conditioned by the concern over the financial status of his family.&lt;ref name="Traven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslovenija.si/slovenija/pogledi-slovenije-druzina-jankovic-se-bori-za-prezivetje-za-svoj-obstoj-a-le-za-zdaj/268862 |title=Pogledi Slovenije: Družina Janković se bori za preživetje.

But Only for Now. |first=Bojan |last=Traven |publisher=MMC RTV Slovenia |date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December, Positive Slovenia won the election with 28.51% of votes, thus gaining 28 seats out of 90 in the Assembly. In his first responses, Janković said that the victory of his party was a proof that Slovenians wanted an efficient state and that he would focus on economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/volitve-2011/zmagoviti-jankovic-vedno-bomo-na-razpolago-in-bomo-polagali-racune/272093 |title=Zmagoviti Janković: Vedno bomo na razpolago in bomo polagali račune :: Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=Rtvslo.si |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the unofficial results became available, he stated he would invite all the parties to coalition talks. Analysts predicted the most likely coalition would consist of Positive Slovenia (PS), [[Social Democrats (Slovenia)|Social Democrats]] (SD), [[Gregor Virant's Civic List]] (LGV) and [[Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia]] (DeSUS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reuters |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/04/slovenia-election-ljubljana-mayor-wins |title=Slovenia election: Ljubljana's mayor takes surprise victory &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=7 December 2011 |date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2012, President [[Danilo Türk]] proposed Janković as the candidate to form a government to the National Assembly. Two days before the scheduled voting, the Slovenian Association of Journalists and Commentators, the second largest journalists' association in the country, issued a statement raising the concern that Janković might abuse his power as prime minister by curtailing the freedom of media through intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/znp-bo-zoran-jankovic-kazensko-preganjal-novinarje-tudi-kot-premier/274390 |title=ZNP: Bo Zoran Janković kazensko preganjal novinarje tudi kot premier? :: Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=Rtvslo.si |date=19 October 2011 |accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A coalition agreement between PS, SD, LGV and DeSUS was initialled on 7 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?id=1713133 |title=Coalition Agreement Initialled, Final Decision Due Next Week |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the evening of 9 January, LGV announced it would not support Janković as the new prime minister and also not join his coalition, due to large differences in the programs of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=a&amp;id=1713606 |title=Virant List Says No to Janković and His Coalition (flash) |date=9 January 2012 |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/bo-virantova-lista-izbrala-pot-levice-ali-desnice.html |title=Virant: Ne pripisujte nam večjega pomena, kot ga imamo |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Virant: Do not Attribute Us Greater Importance Than We Have |date=9 January 2012 |work=24ur.com |publisher=Pro Plus d.o.o.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January, Janković was not elected as the new prime minister by the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]]. In a secret ballot, his candidacy only gained the support of 42 deputies, two less than expected prior to the voting, and four short of the absolute majority needed for his election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.finance.si/336537/Jankovi%C4%87u-ni-uspelo |title=Jankoviću ni uspelo |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Janković Has Failed |publisher=Finance.si |date=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election of [[Janez Janša]] as the prime minister in the second round of the voting, Positive Slovenia became an opposition party.

When Janković got elected to the National Assembly, his function as the Mayor of Ljubljana ceased because of incompatibility of the two functions. In February, Janković announced he decided to run for the position of Mayor of Ljubljana again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/zoran-jankovic-bo-kandidiral-za-zupana-ljubljane/277849|title=Osem se jih bo potegovalo za županski stol Ljubljane|work=Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He participated at the by-election for the mayor of Ljubljana on 25 March 2012 and was elected for the continuation of the second term with 61% of votes. He retook the leadership of the city council on 11 April 2012.&lt;ref name="STA2012-04-11" /&gt; His mandate of a deputy ceased on 16 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?id=1747831 |title=Jankoviću prenehal poslanski mandat |date=16 April 2012 |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Janković's Mandate of a Deputy Has Ceased |work=Splošni servis: Novice |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April, he was replaced by the former athlete [[Alenka Bikar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=a&amp;id=1749371 |title=National Assembly Appoints Substitute MP for Janković |work=English Service: News |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency |date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January 2013, [[Alenka Bratušek]] was replaced Janković as president of the Positive Slovenia party after Janković temporarily renounced all functions in the party following allegations raised by the official [[Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia|Commission for the Prevention of Corruption]] report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pozitivnaslovenija.si/ekipa/alenka-bratusek-1|title=Alenka Bratušek|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2014, Zoran Janković was again voted as the president of the party with 422 votes for out of 763 voters; his only opponent, Alenka Bratušek, received 338 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pozitivnaslovenija.si/n-11186-zoran-jankovic-je-predsednik-pozitivne-slovenije|title=Pozitivnaslovenija.si - Zoran Janković je predsednik Pozitivne Slovenije|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 2014 Bratušek resigned from Positive Slovenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/bratuskova-izstopila-iz-ps-ja-volitve-ob-dogovoru-mogoce-ze-pred-poletjem/335699 |title= Bratuškova izstopila iz PS-ja.

==Public perception==
Throughout his presence in the public life, Janković has been mired in scandals. This is alleged by his detractors and acknowledged by his sympathisers. The latter say that while every politician is corrupt, at least Janković is “a man of action” and has finally done something for residents of Ljubljana.&lt;ref name="Dnevnik2012-02-23" /&gt; This normally refers to him having built the Stožice stadium. His opponents point out, however, that he built it with taxpayers' money and that his family and companies owned by them have benefited to the tune of many millions from backhanders paid by building contractors engaged to construct it, while subcontractors were not paid for their work, supposedly for lack of funds.&lt;ref name="winkler1"/&gt;

In 1998, the left liberal magazine ''[[Mladina]]'' accused Janković of having used his influence as businessman in order to secure his younger son's participation in the spring [[matura]] state exams, although he should have first passed two retake exams.&lt;ref name="Mladina" /&gt; In October 2011, a whole episode of the talk political show ''Pogledi Slovenije'', aired by the national broadcaster [[Radiotelevizija Slovenija|RTV Slovenija]], was focused on Janković's alleged nepotism.&lt;ref name="Traven" /&gt;

He has been a target of satire, especially by the popular comedian [[Denis Avdić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.primorske.si/Priloge/7--Val/Denis-Avdic--Tri-ure-politike-za-40-sekund-smeha.aspx |title=Denis Avdić: Tri ure politike za 40 sekund smeha |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Denis Avdić: Three Hours of Politics for 40 Seconds of Laughter |publisher=Primorske novice |first=Ilona |last=Dolenc |date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 it was revealed that the Slovene tax administration is investigating how 400 thousand out of the 15 million euros, paid by the City of Ljubljana to the [[Stožice Sports Park]] construction contractor (GREP), ended on the account of the ''KLM Naložbe'' company, which is majority-owned by Zoran Janković.&lt;ref name="klm1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/obcinski-denar-koncal-pri-jankovicevem-klm-ju/283487 | title = Občinski denar končal pri Jankovićevem KLM-ju | author = A. Č., An. Ma. | publisher = [[RTV Slovenija]] | language = Slovenian | date = 20 May 2012 | accessdate = 23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janković and his son Jure are under investigation by the tax authorities and the police in connection with the Cypriot company Blue Train of which Jure Janković has been revealed to be a director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reporter.si/slovenija/ciprski-posli-jureta-janković-direktor-za-en-dan/13135 |title=Ciprski posli Jureta Jankovića: direktor za en dan |date=11 December 2012 |work=Reporter.si |agency=STA |language=Slovenian |accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Ljubljana's mayor enjoys considerable electoral support, principally from the large Serbian minority in Ljubljana, due to his own Serb heritage.&lt;ref name="winkler1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://diepresse.com/home/meinung/dejavu/717680/Slowenien_Wo-die-Vergangenheit-der-Zukunft-im-Wege-steht |title=Slowenien: Wo die Vergangenheit der Zukunft im Wege steht |trans-title=Slovenia: Where the Past Stands in the Way of the Future |language=German |first=Hans |last=Winkler |publisher=Die Presse |date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to left-wing media, he is one of the most influential people in the country.&lt;ref name="STARoundUp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=a&amp;t=0&amp;id=1591693 |title=News Roundup – Monday, 3 January, until 3&amp;nbsp;pm |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency |date=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.finance.si/333681/Jankovi_najvplivnej%9Ai_mo%9Aki_Daki_eva_prva_%9Eenska |title=Janković najvplivnejši moški, Dakićeva prva ženska |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Janković the Most Influential Man, Dakić the First Woman |newspaper=Finance.si |publisher=Časnik Finance, d.o.o.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of 2011, media reported that he, the President Danilo Türk, and another two left-wing politicians, [[Gregor Golobič]] and [[Milan Kučan]], form the "gang of four", which has the biggest influence on the most important decisions in Slovenia.&lt;ref name="STARoundUp" /&gt;
