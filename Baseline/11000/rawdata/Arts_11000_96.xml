'''''1066 and All That: A Memorable History of England, comprising all the parts you can remember, including 103 Good Things, 5 Bad Kings and 2 Genuine Dates''''' is a tongue-in-cheek reworking of the [[history of England]]. Written by [[W. C. Sellar]] and [[R. J. Yeatman]] and illustrated by John Reynolds, it first appeared serially in [[Punch magazine|''Punch'']] magazine, and was published in book form by [[Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd.]] in 1930.

==Setting and background==
[[Raphael Samuel]] saw ''1066 and All That'' as a product of the post-[[First World War]] debunking of British greatness, very much in the tradition of ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' (1918):&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; as he put it, "that much underrated anti-imperialist tract ''1066 and All That'' punctured the more bombastic claims of drum-and-trumpet history".&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both the Tory view of a 'great man' history, and the liberal pieties of [[Whig history]] are undermined in the work, in the (then contemporary) style of such serious historians as [[Namier]] and [[Herbert Butterfield]].&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 209-11&lt;/ref&gt; With its conflation of history and memory, and its deconstruction of "standard" historical narrative lines, the book can also be seen as an early [[Postmodernism|post-modernist]] text.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/speaking-volumes-wc-sellars-and-rj-yeatmans-1066-and-all-that/159911.article 1066]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book is a [[parody]] of the style of history teaching in English schools at the time, in particular of ''[[Our Island Story]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; It purports to contain "all the History you can remember", and, in sixty-two chapters, covers the history of England from [[Roman Britain|Roman times]] through [[Norman conquest of England|1066]] "and all that", up to the end of World War I, at which time "America was thus clearly Top Nation, and history came to a [[full stop|.]]" [full-stop, like a telegram]. The book is full of examples of half-remembered and mixed-up facts.

Although the subtitle states that the book comprises "103 Good Things, 5 Bad Kings and 2 Genuine Dates", the book's preface mentions that originally four dates were planned, but last-minute research revealed that two of them were ''not memorable''. The two dates that ''are'' referenced in the book are 1066, the date of the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of Britain]] (Chapter XI), and 55 BC, the date of the [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|first Roman invasion of Britain]] under [[Julius Caesar]] (Chapter I). However, when the date of the Roman invasion is given, it is immediately followed by the date that Caesar was "compelled to invade Britain again the following year (54 BC, not 56, owing to the peculiar Roman method of counting)". Despite the confusion of dates the Roman Conquest is the first of 103 historical events in the book characterised as a ''Good Thing'', "since the Britons were only natives at that time".

Chapter II begins "that long succession of Waves of which History is chiefly composed", the first of which, here, is composed of [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], mere [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], and [[Huns]]. Later examples are the "Wave of Saints", who include the [[Bede|Venomous Bead]] (Chapter III); "Waves of Pretenders", usually divided into smaller waves of two: an [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]] and a [[Charles Edward Stuart|Young Pretender]] (Chapter XXX); plus the "Wave of Beards" in the [[Elizabethan era]] (Chapter XXXIII).

According to Sellar and Yeatman, in English history kings are either "Good" or "Bad". The first "Good King" is the confusingly differentiated [[King Arthur]]/[[Alfred the Great|Alfred]] (Chapter V). Bad kings include King [[John, King of England|John]], who when he came to the throne showed how much he deserved this epithet when he "lost his temper and flung himself on the floor, foaming at the mouth and biting the rushes" (Chapter XVIII). The death of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] from "a surfeit of [[palfrey]]s" (recorded in other historical works as a "surfeit of [[lamprey]]s", Chapter XIII) proves to be a paradigmatic case of the deaths of later monarchs through a surfeit of over-eating or other causes. Other ''memorable'' monarchs include the Split King ([[Henry IV, Part 1]] and [[Henry IV, Part 2]]) and [[Mary I of England|Broody Mary]].

''Memorable'' events in English history include the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Disillusion of the Monasteries]] (Chapter XXXI); the struggle between the [[Cavalier]]s (characterised as "Wrong but Wromantic") and the [[Roundhead]]s (characterised as "Right but Repulsive") in the [[English Civil War]] (Chapter XXXV); and [[Industrial Revolution|The Industrial Revelation]] (Chapter XLIX).

The book also contains five joke "Test Papers" interspersed among the chapters, which contain nonsense instructions including the famous "Do not on any account attempt to write on both sides of the paper at once" (Test Paper V),&lt;ref&gt;R Samuel, ''Island Story'' (London 1999) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; and "Do not attempt to answer more than one question at a time" (Test Paper I) and such unanswerable questions as "How far did the Lords Repellent drive [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] into the arms of [[Peter of Castile|Pedro the Cruel]]? (Protractors may not be used.)" (Test Paper II).

==Musical comedy==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
In 1935, the [[musical comedy]] ''1066—and all that: A Musical Comedy based on that Memorable History by Sellar and Yeatman'' was produced. The book and lyrics were by [[Reginald Arkell]]; the music was composed by [[Alfred Reynolds (composer)|Alfred Reynolds]]. It was revived at the [[Palace Theatre, London]], in 1945.

The narrative for the musical is based on the idea of an [[Everyman]] character, the Common Man, who is visiting a waxworks museum. He experiences some of the major events and characters of British history, starting with the Romans. "What good did history ever do me?" moans the Common Man. While his wife and son traipse round the waxworks, he dreams the waxworks come to life, singing and dancing and recalling the events and characters first met in dry-as-dust school lessons that are most likely to stick, however imperfectly, in an everyman-school-student's mind: [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]] burning the cakes; [[Cnut the Great|Canute]] inventing [[King Canute and the waves|sea bathing]]; [[John, King of England|King John]] losing his washing, and [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] marrying [[Henry VIII of England|VIII wives]] – or vice versa. From the Roman Conquest to the Modern Era of automobiles.

A chorus of Roman soldiers sing about "Going home", and being "on the road that leads to Rome. / We've been to Gaul, we've been to Spain / And now we're going home again / Rome, sweet home". Later a chorus of monks sing about the horrors of meatless Friday meals in the abbey. A Puritan and a Cavalier sing a jaunty, flirting ditty, and so on.

At the end, the Common Man is run down by a passing taxi, and the Finale reprises the "Going home" song with suitably modified lyrics.

==Works inspired by ''1066''==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
''1066 and All That'' inspired [[Paul Manning (British writer)|Paul Manning]]'s ''1984 and All That'', dealing with the subsequent history of Britain and the rest of the world up to 1984, and written in the same style, with similar prose, illustrations and tests. ("What caused the [[Wall Street Crash]]? Speculate wildly.") The title also echoes [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Ned Sherrin]] and Neil Shand wrote a sequel ''1956 and All That'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrin|first=Ned|title=1956 And All That|year=1984|publisher=Michael Joseph Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0718124793|page=144|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/1956-All-That-Ned-Sherrin/dp/0718124790}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the subtitle ''a memorable history of England since the war to end all wars (Two)''.

[[Scoular Anderson]] has written a humorous history of Scotland in two volumes: ''[[Battle of Bannockburn|1314]] and All That'' and ''[[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]] and All That''. Although the titles reflect Sellar and Yeatman's work, the style of writing and illustration is very different.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 2005 [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] released ''[[1966 and All That (book)|1966 and All That]]'', which copied the book's style (including elements like the end of chapter tests), recounting the remainder of the 20th century. In 2006 the book was [[1966 and All That (radio)|adapted for BBC Radio 4]] in four parts.

[[Richard Armour (poet)|Richard Armour]]'s book ''It All Started With Columbus'' (1953, revised 1961) treats the history of the United States, from 1492 to the presidency of [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]], in a manner that owes a great deal to Sellar and Yeatman ("[[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] refused to believe the world was round, even when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] showed them an [[Egg of Columbus|egg]]"). Acknowledging the debt, Armour dedicated his book to Sellar and Yeatman.

[[Dave Barry]]'s 1989 book ''[[Dave Barry Slept Here: A Sort of History of the United States]]'' is another treatment of American history reminiscent of ''1066 and All That'', though Sellar and Yeatman are not acknowledged. ("The first major president to be elected after the [[War of 1812]] was President [[Monroe Doctrine]], who became famous by developing the policy for which he is named.")

[[Matthew Sturgis]]' book ''1992 and All This'' (Macmillan, 1991) is a "humorous look at Europe in preparation for 1992 when Britain officially becomes part of the Continent. Much of the humour focuses on the differences between the British and the Europeans."{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Malcolm Knox (author)|Malcolm Knox]]'s 2009 book ''[[1788 Words or Less]]'' gives a Sellar and Yeatman-esque twist to the history of Australia.

==Works with titles inspired by ''1066''==
* The title was adapted by [[Raymond F. Streater]] and [[Arthur S. Wightman]] for their (serious) textbook on [[axiomatic quantum field theory]], ''[[PCT, Spin and Statistics, and All That]]''. This in turn influenced the titles of several other books, monographs, and papers on [[mathematical physics]]: as of November 2013, a search for "and all that" in the open collection of specialized scientific articles [[arXiv]] yields 25 such titles; MathSciNet ([[Mathematical Reviews]] online) lists 83 hits for corresponding mathematical papers. There is also an introductory vector calculus text by H. M. Schey called ''Div, Grad, Curl, and all that''.
* Australian cricketer and cartoonist [[Arthur Mailey]] had taken all 10 wickets for 66 runs in a first-class match during the 1921 tour of England, and hence titled his 1958 autobiography ''10 for 66 And All That''.
* Liverpool band [[Half Man Half Biscuit]] featured a song entitled "1966 and All That" on their debut EP ''[[The Trumpton Riots]]''.   
* Welsh rock band [[Mclusky]] recorded the song "1956 and All That" for their third album ''[[The Difference Between Me and You Is That I'm Not on Fire]]''.
* ''1089 and All That—A Journey into Mathematics'' is a popular mathematics book by [[David Acheson (mathematician)|David Acheson]].
* ''Amo, Amas, Amat... and All That: How to Become a Latin Lover'' by [[Harry Mount]] is a guide to (and celebration of) the [[Latin language]].
* In 1992, [[Robert Royal]] wrote ''1492 And All That: Political Manipulations of History.'' From the dust jacket: "Spurning the false idealism and bland caricatures of historical actors that distort the arguments of both sides, Robert Royal surveys the available facts and political positions about Columbus and his legacy and seeks to find the truth among them. His provocative analysis recommends a better-balanced reading of our past and a wise use of that base for determining our common future."{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* In the 1960s, the railway enthusiasts' book ''Four feet eight and a half and all that'' was published in a comparable style by [[G. R. Mills]], with the same mixture of puns and humour, which will be best appreciated by those who know their subject already. Now out of print but a collector's item. The title is a reference to the [[standard gauge]] of railway tracks.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* In 2000, [[John W. O'Malley]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], published ''Trent and All That: Renaming Catholicism in the Early Modern Era.'' The book deals with historians' attempts to describe, name, and understand the Catholic side of Reformation-era Europe. The title is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the habit of most historians giving the subject little thought beyond vague references to the [[Council of Trent]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* Algebraic Geometers [[Joe Harris (mathematician)|Joe Harris]] and [[David Eisenbud]] are soon to publish an intersection theory book called ''3264 and All That.'' 3264 refers to the number of smooth conic plane curves tangent to five given general conics, an answer to a problem in enumerative geometry.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Administratium''' is a well-known [[in-joke]] in [[science|scientific]] circles and is a [[parody]] both on the [[bureaucracy]] of [[academia|scientific establishments]] and on descriptions of newly discovered [[chemical element]]s. 

In 1991, Thomas Kyle (the supposed discoverer of this element) was awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for [[physics]], making him one of only three fictional people to have won the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V111/N40/ignobe.40n.html |title=Ig Nobel Prizes Debut |publisher=The Tech |first=Alice |last=Gilchrist |issue=40 |volume=111 |date=October 4, 1991 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spoof article was written by [[William DeBuvitz]] in 1988 and first appeared in print in the January 1989 issue of ''The Physics Teacher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315075433/http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/administ.htm |title=Administratium. New chemical Element Discovered |first=William |last=DeBuvitz |publisher= The Physics Teacher |date=January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread rapidly among university campuses and research centers; many versions surfaced, often customized to the contributor's situation.

A similar joke concerns '''Administrontium''' which was referenced in print in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ebeltz.net/resume/jir.html |title=Physics Non-Department First to Photograph New Element. |first=Ellin |last=Beltz |publisher=NEIU Independent |date=June 21, 1993 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation on the same joke is '''Bureaucratium'''. A commonly heard description describes it as "having a negative [[half-life]]". In other words, the more time passes, the more massive "Bureaucratium" becomes; it only grows larger and more sluggish. This refers to the bureaucratic system, which is generally perceived as a system in which bureaucratic procedures accumulate, and whatever needs to get done takes increasingly longer to get done as soon as it touches the bureaucracy.

== Biography ==

Semionov was born in [[Torzhok]], [[Tver Oblast]], Russia. In the mid-1930s his family moved to [[Leningrad]]. Having abilities to draw from the early age, Semionov entered [[Tavricheskaya Art School]], where he studied under Alexander Gromov, Semion Bootler, [[Victor Oreshnikov]], Vladimir Levitsky and Mariam Aslamazian.

In 1940 Semionov graduated from [[Tavricheskaya Art School]]. In 1940–1941 he worked as copyist at the LenIzo Leningrad Art Centre. In the [[Russian Museum]] he painted copies from works of [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ilya Repin]] an [[Isaak Levitan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dmitry Buchkin. Alexander Mikhailovich Semionov. Biography outline.''

In 1941, Semionov went to the front as a volunteer, passing through all the trials of wartime from beginning to end. After that he returned to work in LenIzo as a painter, gradually restoring and improving his professional skills. He painted from life in such picturesque suburbs of Leningrad as Rozhdestvenno, Wyra, Daymische (for example [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase64b.jpg ''″Summer Day″''], of 1951), where from the late 1940s to the early 1950s settled Leningrad artists [[Piotr Buchkin]], [[Nikolai Timkov]], Yuri Podlaski, George Tatarnikov, and other artists.

Since 1954, Semionov started to show his work on the exhibitions of Leningrad artists. These were sketches brought back from trips to the Ural and Altai: [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase63b.jpg ''″Altai Province. Cherga Area″''], [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase25b.jpg ''″Altai Mountains. Charga Area″''], ''″Altai Province. Shebalino District″'', and ''″Altai.

In these sketches traced the taste and great abilities of the artist to plein air painting, his ability for composition, for quickly grasp and transferring the lighting on canvas.

In 1957, Semionov was admitted to the [[Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation]]. In the same year as one of the leading painters of Leningrad, Semionov participated in the [[All-Union art exhibition (Moscow, 1957)|All-Union Art Exhibition]] in Moscow dedicated to the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[All-Union art exhibition (Moscow, 1957)|All-Union Art Exhibition of 1957 dedicated to the 40th Anniversary of October Revolution. Catalogue.]]'' Moscow, Soviet artist, 1957. P.71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early successes encouraged Semionov to further creative exploration, establishing the main theme of creativity specific to his temperament and painterly talent. Since the late 1950s it became the urban landscape, a favorite theme – streets, bridges, and embankments of Leningrad. Semionov embodied it in countless sketches and paintings, and made a significant contribution to the contemporary iconography of Leningrad. Among his works shown at the exhibitions were ''″A Rainy Day″''&lt;ref&gt;[[Autumn exhibition (Leningrad, 1956)|''The Fall Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1956.

From 1950–1970, in search of material for his paintings, Semionov, in addition to trips to the Altai and the Urals, repeatedly worked in the House the work of artists in [[Staraya Ladoga]] ([http://www.leningradschool.com/pol33b.jpg ''″Winter Forest″''], 1963, [http://www.leningradschool.com/buk122b.jpg ''″Bright Day in Old Ladoga″''], 1964, [http://www.leningradschool.com/nov85b.jpg ''″Winter in ancient town Old Ladoga″''], 1969, [http://www.leningradschool.com/7win7b.jpg ''″A Midday″''], 1971, [http://www.leningradschool.com/7win14b.jpg ''″Old Ladoga.

There he painted the ancient corners of the Tver region, keeping the cherished images of childhood and youth of the artist ([http://www.leningradschool.com/ase68b.jpg ''″A Little courtyard in Rostov the Great″''], 1965, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase07b.jpg ''″Rostov the Great″''], 1965, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase47b.jpg ''″Torzhok in the Morning″''], 1972, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase87b.jpg ''″Torzhok. Hotel″''], 1972, [http://www.leningradschool.com/pol07b.jpg ''″Summer day in Torzhok ancient town″''], 1973, and others ).

To the middle of 1960 there is a characteristic style of painting of Semionov, his favorite themes and methods of their development. In cityscapes he aspires to transfer the sensation of street, movement, to keep on a canvas the peeped scenes of a city life. The great attention he gives to light and shadow contrasts and plain air effects, to transfer volumes of urban spaces. The artist liked to paint Leningrad in rainy weather, masterly transferring game of color stains on wet asphalt.

Semionov's paintings are distinguished by finesse plain air, bright saturated colors and accurate transfer of tonal relations. Generalized drawing with a brush along with the active use of palette knife made of various texture painting, and allow the artist to achieve unity of artistic conception and its realization on canvas.

In 1965–1980 Semionov was regarded as a leader of Russian cityscape painting. He created a truthful image of a modern [[Leningrad]] ([http://www.leningradschool.com/nab47b.jpg ''″At the Kirov Prospekt in Leningrad″''], 1965, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase51b.jpg ''″Leningrad Motive″''], 1967, [http://www.leningradschool.com/sbo45b.jpg ''″At the Isaakievskaya Square in Leningrad″''], 1972, [http://www.leningradschool.com/7win46b.jpg ''″View at the Smolny Cathedral in Leningrad″''], 1974, [http://www.leningradschool.com/len103b.jpg ''″Leningrad Theme″''], 1974, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase88b.jpg ''″At the Suvorov Prospekt in Leningrad″''], 1975, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase85b.jpg ''″Nevsky Prospekt in Evening Lights″''], 1976, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase36b.jpg ''″Rainy Day″''], 1977, [http://www.leningradschool.com/per11b.jpg ''″Leningrad Bridges″''], 1977, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase84b.jpg ''″A Night at the Isaaky Square″''], 1978, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase45b.jpg ''″Liteyny Bridge″''], 1982, and others). Some of his paintings are now perceived as literary evidence of the recent era: Nevsky Prospekt decorated brightly colored flags and banners ([http://www.leningradschool.com/ase57b.jpg ''″Nevsky Prospekt in Holiday″''], 1970, [http://www.leningradschool.com/sbo46b.jpg ''″Nevsky Prospekt″''], 1977), the familiar streets, retaining its appearance in the paintings of the artist ([[Malaya Sadovaya (painting)|''Malaya Sadovaya street'']], 1979).

In 1960-1980 Alexander Semionov painted a lot in the picturesque suburbs of Leningrad. His paintings allow speak of him as a subtle master of the lyrical landscape. Among them [http://www.leningradschool.com/new239b.jpg ''″Spring in the garden″''], 1967, [http://www.leningradschool.com/rim05b.jpg ''″A Midday in Pushkin town″''], 1968, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase71b.jpg ''″Relic of the Past″''], 1968, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase67b.jpg ''″A Bush of Lilac″''], 1969, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase74b.jpg ''″In the Pushkin Town″''], 1969, [http://www.leningradschool.com/rim14b.jpg ''″Summer Day″''], 1973, [http://www.leningradschool.com/pol39b.jpg ''″After the rain″''], 1976, [http://www.leningradschool.com/len106b.jpg ''″Clear up″''], 1976, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase75b.jpg ''″Windy Day″''], 1976, [http://www.leningradschool.com/nov60b.jpg ''″Chikino Lake″''], 1978, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase92b.jpg ''″Griazno Village″''], 1978, [http://www.leningradschool.com/pol38b.jpg ''″A Path in the village of Rozhdestveno″''], 1979, [http://www.leningradschool.com/ase94b.jpg ''″A Summer″''], 1979, and others.

In the 1970s Semionov's paintings were presented at the exhibitions of Soviet art in Japan, and in the 1990s at the auctions and exhibitions of Russian art in France, Italy, the UK, and the US.

'''Architectural reprography''', the [[reprography]] of [[architectural drawing]]s, covers a variety of technologies, media, and supports typically used to make multiple copies of original [[technical drawing]]s and related records created by [[architects]], [[landscape architect]]s, [[engineers]], [[surveying|surveyors]], [[cartography|mapmakers]] and other professionals in building and engineering trades.

Within the context of [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|archival preservation]], the custodians of architectural records must consider many aspects of identification and care when managing the artifactual nature of these materials. Storage containers, handling, paper and chemical compositions and interactions, ultraviolet light exposure, humidity, mold, and other agents of potential harm all interact to determine the longevity of these documents. As well, architectural reprographic drawings are often in very large formats, making storage and handling decisions especially complex.

==History==
With the rise of the professionalized practice of western [[architecture]] in the second half of the 19th century, the field of architectural reprography—and the corresponding developments of [[photography]] and mass-produced wood-pulp [[paper]]—saw significant experiments and advances in technology. Beginning with major refinements in blueprinting processes in the 1840s, through the widespread adoption of diazotype printing after World War II, the design profession turned to analog architectural reprography to create accurate, to-scale reproductions of original drawings created on tracing paper, vellum, and linen supports. These copies were typically used throughout the architect’s own design process and also for distribution to clients, contractors, governmental agencies, and other interested parties. However, the integration of CAD—or [[Computer-Aided Design]]—over the last twenty-five years of design practice has made analog reprography far less common in the profession and more ephemeral in nature. For archivists, curators, librarians and other custodians of architectural records, traditional reprographic formats are now often seen as historic documents, with attendant needs for long-term care and conservation.

==Major processes==
Both the underlying support—paper or plastic—and the image type are used to identify the specific processes used in architectural reprography. Between the late 19th century and the late 20th century, several processes emerged as the preferred methods, used for decades, while other less common processes were employed for shorter periods of time.

===Blueprints===
First developed in 1725, blueprinting uses a wet process to produce an image of white lines on a [[cyan]] or [[Prussian blue]] ground. To make a blueprint, a heavy paper (or more rarely [[drafting linen]]) support is impregnated with [[potassium ferricyanide]] and ferric ammonium, placed under a translucent original drawing, weighted with glass, and exposed to ultraviolet light. After sufficient light exposure, the glass and original drawing are removed and the blueprint paper is washed to reveal a negative image. This same process, using an intermediary reprographic drawing, could also be used to produce a positive blueprint—blue lines on a white ground—however, this more expensive and time-intensive method was far less commonly employed.

The major disadvantages of the blueprint process, however, included paper distortions caused by the wet process which might render scale drawings less accurately, as well as the inability to make further copies from the blueprints. Nonetheless, for its efficiency and low cost, the blueprint process, further simplified and mechanized by the turn of the 20th century, became the most widely used reprographic process from the mid-19th century through the first half of the 20th century.

In archival settings, because the process involves [[ammonium]], the resulting prints should not be stored in contact with other papers that have a buffered reserve, nor should blueprints be de-acidified, as the resulting chemical interactions can cause irreversible image loss. Blueprints are also highly light-sensitive and should not be exposed to [[ultraviolet light]] for long periods of time.

===Pellet prints===
Invented in 1887 by Henry Pellet, the Pellet process uses a wet process to produce an image of cyan or Prussian blue lines on a white ground. Essentially, this process produces a positive image, while a blueprint produces a negative one. To make a Pellet print, a paper (or more rarely drafting linen) support is coated with [[ferric]] salts suspended in a gelatin emulsion, placed under a translucent original drawing, weighted with glass, and exposed to ultraviolet light. As with the blueprint process, after sufficient light exposure, the original drawing is removed, the paper washed in a [[ferrocyanide]] bath, and then rinsed in an acidic bath to reveal a positive image. This process required fewer steps than creating a positive blueprint, and was thus more widely employed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In an archival setting, Pellet prints should be treated and stored under the same conditions as blueprints.

===Van Dyke prints===
The Van Dyke process, invented by F. R. Van Dyke in 1901, created an intermediary print—a white line on a dark brown ground—that could used in any of several other processes, such as blueprinting, to create a positive print, i.e. a dark line on a light ground. 

Using a translucent vellum support, the paper was prepared with a coating of silver salts. The vellum was then united with the original drawing, exposed to ultraviolet light, and later washed in a [[sodium thiosulfate]] bath.

In an archival setting, Van Dyke prints are relatively rare, as they were created for temporary purposes and often discarded after the final positive prints were made. Because of the [[nitrates]] used in preparing the paper and the preferred thin paper itself, Van Dyke prints are often extremely brittle and susceptible to damage. Van Dyke prints should be stored separately and, when possible reformatted before the image degrades unacceptably.

===Diazotypes===
By the middle of the 20th century, wet-process reprographic techniques such as blueprinting, Pellet, and Van Dyke printing were largely superseded by various dry-printing processes. The most common of these is the Diazotype process, refined in the 1920s, which used paper supports sensitized with [[Diazonium compound|diazonium salts]], a coupling agent, and an acid stabilizer to produce a dark line on a white ground. The Diazo positive print was considered more readable than a negative blueprint, and the dry process eliminated the image distortion of wet paper.

As with other earlier reprographic processes, a translucent original drawing was placed over a sheet of the sensitized paper and exposed to light. However, the next step exposed the paper to an [[ammonia]] gas. This alkaline gas catalyzed a reaction between the diazo salts and the coupling agent to produce an image that fixed in the paper over several days. Typically these prints have blue or dark purple lines on a mottled cream-colored background, although line and ground colors can vary.

A related process is the sepia Diazo print, which produced either a positive or negative print in dark brown and light tones. The negative versions of these prints were most often produced as intermediaries, like the earlier Van Dyke process, to allow corrections and revisions without disturbing the original drawing. In the negative printing process, additional resins and oils were sometimes added to the paper support to increase translucency. Positive sepia prints, generally made on opaque paper, were typically used as an alternative to positive blueline Diazo prints.

Both blueline and sepia prints were often poorly and cheaply processed, resulting in undesirable residual chemical content. Off-gassing of sulfurous compounds, image fading, and yellowing of the paper support are common signs of degradation and are not reversible. Diazo prints are also highly light-sensitive and can fade to illegibility within a short period of exposure to ultraviolet light.

In archival practice, Diazo prints are the most common reprographic format encountered in late 20th-century architectural collections. However, their inherent fragility and fugitive images, as compared with blueprints and earlier processes, makes their care problematic. Diazos—particularly sepia prints, which readily transfer color to adjacent papers—should be physically segregated from all other types of media. Exposure to light and pollutants in air should be minimized, and wherever possible, original drawings or reformatted prints should be kept for reference.

==Other processes==
* [[Hectograph|Hectographic prints]]
* Ferrogallic prints
* Gel-lithographs
* Photostatic prints
* Wash-Off prints
* Silver halide prints
* Electrostatic prints

==Cleaning, flattening, and repairing==
For large collections of architectural materials, conservation work can address several areas of concern. Consultation with a professional conservator is recommended, although some minor treatments can be accomplished by general caretakers with training. Rolled and folded reprography, once cleaned, can be flattened through humidification. Cleaning may be done with white vinyl erasers, using great care in areas of friable media, such as graphite and colored pencil. Tears, losses, and other surface damage should be treated by a professional conservator. For particularly fragile or frequently-handled prints, sheets may be encapsulated in polyester or polypropylene film for additional support and protection. This is not recommended, however, for reprographic prints with annotations in friable media.

==Storage==

===Rolled storage===
The most common form of storage for architectural drawings—both for drawings in active professional use and in archival environments—has traditionally been in rolls. While this allows for efficiency in the use of space and ease of retrieval, potentially damaging situations can arise from a casual approach to roll storage. For reprographic drawings on paper supports, rolling can stress paper fibers and make unrolling for examination more difficult. Small rolls can be easily crushed and ends can be creased and torn without additional protective wrapping and support.

===Flat storage===
In circumstances where fragile, rigid, or otherwise atypical media makes rolled storage unfeasible, storage in flat boxes or flatfile drawers can be the best choice. Acid-free and lignin-free portfolio boxes, ideally no more than four inches deep, can be cost-effective and allow more flexibility in arrangement on shelving. Flatfile furniture should meet the minimum requirements of archivally-sound construction—powder- or enamel-coated steel units with no rust or sharp edges that could damage materials while stored or moved in and out of the drawers.

Drawings should be grouped and identified for ease in retrieval, preferably within folders that are cut to fit the full dimensions of the corresponding container. As with rolled materials, the potentially damaging chemical interactions of print processes should be considered when grouping drawings in folders. Wherever possible, for example, blueprints should be segregated from diazotypes, and sepia diazo prints should be stored alone to the extent possible.

==Reformatting==
For most drawings, especially those that are oversized or significantly damaged, photographic reproduction remains the best method of accurately reproducing the fine details of a drawing. For drawings that are not significantly damaged or that are encapsulated in a polyester film, digital flat-bed scanning or other mechanical methods may be used.

==Professional resources==
The [[Society of American Archivists]] supports many architectural archivists in their professional responsibilities. In particular, the SAA's Architectural Records Roundtable is a primary forum for discussion of issues of acquisition, identification, description, conservation, and digital preservation of a wide variety of architectural documentation.

'''''ArtPremium''''' is a quarterly magazine specializing in [[contemporary art]].

== History ==
ArtPremium is an independent, ad-free, sales-driven magazine focused on exhibitions and the international contemporary art market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/6269989|title=Art premium : la revista de arte de Puerto Rico in Stanford University Libraries catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latindex.org/latindex/ficha?folio=13563|title=Latindex|last=Regional On Line Information System for Latin American Scientific Reviews|first=el Caribe|date=1997-02-17|website=Bases de datos de revistas nacionales|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://frontart.org/2017/03/11/the-front-row-triennial/|title=The Front Row Triennial|date=2017-03-11|work=FRONT International: Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was created by Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici in 2003 in Puerto Rico and is now based in [[Paris]] since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://conucopr.org/Search.do;jsessionid=14DB0DB714CFD7348986602033FFEE86?query=Bonici,+Eric&amp;scope=author_browse&amp;b_ind=0|title=Indices Conuco de Puerto Rico|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPremium begins as a magazine in Spanish dedicated to the Puerto Rican art scene, its first issues are subtitled: ''La revista de arte de Puerto Rico''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/6269989|title=Art premium : la revista de arte de Puerto Rico in Stanford University Libraries catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ArtPremium remain the art magazine of Puerto Rico until 2008, when Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici decide to internationalize the magazine. They create ArtPremium Newspaper to locally replace their magazine, ArtPremium then becomes a magazine entirely dedicated to contemporary art and ArtPremium TV to broadcast content adapted to the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/artpremium|title=ArtPremium|website=Vimeo|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel with its activities, ArtPremium develops a network of partners in major contemporary art fairs worldwide, by forming partnerships with : [[Art Basel]], Art Basel [[Miami]], Art Basel [[Hong Kong|Hong-Kong]], Fiac [[Paris]], Art Paris art fair, [[The Armory Show (art fair)|The Armory Show]] New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbasel.com/miami-beach/exhibitors|title=Art Basel|last=Basel|first=Art|website=Art Basel|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbasel.com/hong-kong/exhibitors|title=Art Basel|last=Basel|first=Art|website=Art Basel|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artparis.com/fr/media_partners|title=ART PARIS ART FAIR - PARTENAIRES MÉDIAS 2018 -  Art paris Art Fair, 5 &gt; 8 avril 2018 Grand Palais|work=Art Paris Art Fair 2018|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its distribution focus on major bookstores, concept stores, and museums such as: [[Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art]], [[Palais de Tokyo]], [[Pompidou Center]], [[Guggenheim Museum]] (Bilbao), [[Reina Sofia Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.librairieflammarion.fr/recherche/?q=ArtPremium|title=www.librairieflammarion.fr|last=Flammarion|first=Librairie|website=www.librairieflammarion.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine has published background articles on: [[Andres Serrano]], [[Aziz + Cucher]], [[Bill Viola]], [[Lee Ufan]], [[Anish Kapoor]], [[Nils Udo]], [[Subodh Gupta]].

In 2006, the magazine ArtPremium organizes and produces in [[Puerto Rico]], the first retrospective of [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artnetnews/artnetnews10-24-06.asp|title=Artnet News - artnet Magazine|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/40871/basquiat-an-anthology-for-puerto-rico/|title=Basquiat: An anthology for Puerto Rico - Announcements - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition takes place at the Muséo de arte de Puerto Rico in order to pay a national tribute to Jean-Michel Basquiat (born in [[New York (state)|New York]]), who was of Puerto Rican origins by his mother. Lourdes I Ramos-Rivas (named in 2016 president of the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach), as chief curator of the museum, is also the curator of this retrospective which brings together more than 135 original works by JMB, and contributes to the book: ''Jean-Michel Basquiat, an anthology for Puerto Rico'', also produced by ArtPremium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-molaa-lourdes-ramos-20170320-story.html|title=Lourdes Ramos named president of the Museum of Latin American Art — first Latina to hold the post|website=www.latimes.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tmlarts.com/jean-michel-basquiat/|title=Jean-Michel Basquiat|website=www.tmlarts.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/book/1086387996|title=ABAA {{!}} Jean-Michel Basquiat: Una Antologia para Puerto Rico by BASQUIAT {{!}} Search for rare books|website=www.abaa.org|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/jean-michel-basquiat-una-antologia-para-puerto-rico/oclc/156945938|title=Jean-Michel Basquiat: una antología para Puerto Rico.|last=Basquiat|first=Jean Michel|last2=Navarra|first2=Enrico|last3=Ramos Collado|first3=Lilliana|last4=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico (San Juan|first4=P.R.)|date=2006|publisher=Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico : ArtPremium|isbn=0615134637|location=San Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the entire spring issue is dedicated to [[Kiro Urdin]] to celebrate the long term achievements in his international career. During an interview, and to the question of what he thought to be so exposed, Urdin will say: "It doesn't happen frequently to the artists, but it is good when an important magazine is dedicated to one artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/4798605|title=Kiro Urdin ArtPremium Collection|website=Vimeo|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Website artpremium.com ==
Between 2011 and 2015, ArtPremium abandons its paper version to focus on its digital development,  the magazine becomes completely free and readable online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.el-status.com/knowledge.html|title=El Status - Independent Platform for Contemporary Puerto Rican Art|website=www.el-status.com|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results having been inconclusive, the paper version of the magazine returns in 2016 with a new English-language version. The ArtPremium website is now an extension of the paper review, it includes uploads of unpublished articles and a layout adapted to digital reading.

==ArtPremium TV==
Since 2008, ArtPremium has been broadcasting its ArtPremium TV channel on the [[vimeo]] social network. Web-based content can be used to relay artist interviews such as [[Kiro Urdin]], [[Carlos Betancourt]] or [[Aziz + Cucher]], exhibition montage views, or reports on contemporary art fairs such as FIAC.

The '''Arts District''' is a performing and visual arts district in [[Downtown Dallas]], [[Texas]].

It is located south of [[State Thomas, Dallas, Texas|State Thomas]]; southeast of [[Uptown Dallas|Uptown]]; north of the [[City Center District, Dallas, Texas|City Center District]]; west of [[Bryan Place, Dallas, Texas|Bryan Place]]; and east of the [[West End Historic District, Dallas, Texas|West End Historic District]].  It is bounded by St. Paul Street, Ross Avenue, [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|Spur 366]] ([[Woodall Rodgers Freeway]]), and the [[U.S. Highway 75 (Texas)|US 75]]/[[Interstate 45 (Texas)|I-45]] (unsigned [[Interstate 345 (Texas)|I-345]]) elevated freeway ([[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]]).  (Previously the district extended east only to Routh Street, but a 9 March 2005 [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] City Council approval extended it east to I-345.)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dallasnews.com The Dallas Morning News]'' - 9 March 2005.

[[File:Ballochmyle Cup and Ring marked stone - 2.JPG|thumb|250px|Cup-and-ring mark stone at Ballochmyle, [[Mauchline]]]]
The '''Ballochmyle cup and ring marks''' were first recorded at Ballochmyle (NS 5107 2552), [[Mauchline]], [[East Ayrshire]], Scotland in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Love|first=|year=2003|title=Ayrshire : Discovering a County.|publisher=|isbn=|page= 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; very unusually carved on a vertical red sandstone cliff face, forming one of the most extensive areas of such carvings as yet found in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been designated a [[scheduled ancient monument]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/SM4484|title=Ballochmyle Viaduct,rock carvings 280m NE of - SM4484|publisher= Historic Environment Scotland|accessdate= 10 September 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
These carvings or [[petroglyph]]s were first recorded in 1986 (although a '1751' carved date suggests an earlier discovery) when the [[Kingencleugh Castle|Kingencleugh Estate]] decided to clear an area of vegetation along the north side of the Liddell Burn that is a minor tributary stream of the [[River Ayr]] in an area famous for its quarrying of red sandstone. The removal of vegetation exposed the carvings that are distributed across two faces of a vertical outcrop of rock and they were reported to the Dick Institute in [[Kilmarnock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Survey of Ballochmyle Cup and Ring Marks, Ayrshire|url=http://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/ballochmyle-survey/|publisher=AOC Archaeology Group|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of possible medieval carvings, the extensive quarrying with numerous workmen employed in the area, especially during the construction of the Ballochmyle Viaduct, emphasises how surprising it is that these [[glyph]]s were overlooked for so long, especially as they are only about 2&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Mauchline]]'s town centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The rock here is described as being a "''pink dessert sandstone from the [[Permian]] age showing clear signs of dune bedding''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cup and ring marks are composed of two 'panels' with several hundred '[[Cup and ring mark|cup and ring]]' and other [[glyph]]s or carvings in a range of styles, ranging from single shallow cups through to deeper cups with multiple rings. Less common, but unique in the Scottish context are ‘square with cup’ carvings; ‘ringed stars’ are also present. Three deer-like carvings and some other inscriptions with Lombardic style letters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also carved into the rockface and these are thought to be medieval in date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Survey of Ballochmyle Cup and Ring Marks, Ayrshire|url=http://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/ballochmyle-survey/|publisher=AOC Archaeology Group|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several feet of soil were removed from the bottom of the corner that divides the two main halves of the site and this uncovered three '[[Trilithon|trilithon-like]]' carvings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and Ring Marked Rock (Prehistoric)|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43557/ballochmyle|publisher=RCAHMS|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=|year=2003|title=Ayrshire. A Historical Guide.|publisher=|isbn=|page= 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others may await discovery where the soil has not been removed. The carvings were protected by the vegetation and began to deteriorate after this was removed and in addition vandalism and theft of a panel has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that they were historically hidden from direct view by trees and shrubs.

The Ballochmyle [[glyph]]s or motifs are carved on red sandstone, however they are found elsewhere on other sedimentary rocks such as [[Millstone Grit]]s, as well as the harder [[igneous]] and [[Metamorphic|metamorphic rocks]] such as [[granite]]s and [[schist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The basic 'cup' is the most common carving however a wide range of glyphs exist with single to multiple concentric circles that are sometimes cut through in various ways by channels, etc. Where concentric rings exist the central cup often appears to dominate in depth and size&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that they were subject to repeated reworking over a period of time. Some incomplete or poorly formed glyphs exist here suggesting that different persons were involved in making them and frequent overlays of existing glyphs with either 'cups' or 'cup rings' suggests that they were created over an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest that distinct stylistic groupings may be present with one panel area having simple cups and cups with grooves, whilst another area has predominately bold cups with multiple concentric rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 35 &amp; 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; An area with an apparent Lombardic style lettering may read 'ASAID' with two or three unreadable leading letters and a likely lost section. The final element is a date '1751' that is considered authentic but did not lead to further recorded investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests that cup and ring art was created from the [[Neolithic]] through to the [[Bronze Age]], that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cup and ring mark]] stones are frequently found throughout Britain, with over 2500 sites in England alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; however an unusual feature of those at Ballochmyle is that they have been carved on nearly or actual vertical surfaces rather than horizontal and often 'altar-like' exposed stone outcrops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and Ring Marked Rock (Prehistoric)|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43557/ballochmyle|publisher=RCAHMS|access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of carvings were created using 'hammerstones' or 'peckers', examples of these have been found elsewhere, hitting the surface of the rock repeatedly or using a grinding motion until the desired design was formed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the long grooves appear to be a series of cups that were then joined together. The soft nature of the stone at Ballochmyle gives insights into how the [[glyphs]] were created with many small holes that could not have been formed by a hammering action.

The contrast with the original rock surface and the effect of shadow and rain usually makes the markings stand out however hints of the use of coloured pigments have been found at other sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such things as animal fat, charcoal, plants dyes, etc. could have been used during various types of ceremonies to enhance the glyphs or as part of their cultural use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency and widespread use of the same glyphs or motifs indicates that they had definite interpretive meanings and significance to the cultures that created them and these developed and then persisted over thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locations indicate that these carvings were mostly for public display and not usually intended as part of secret practices where the fact that they were hidden was important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be relevant that the Ballochmyle area has both spectacular geological formations and geographical features in addition to the presence of a significant [[Liminal deity|liminal]] zone in the form of a major watercourse, the [[River Ayr]]. Carvings into rocks can have deeper meanings such as with the carved footprint [[Petrosomatoglyph]]s at [[Dunadd]] in [[Argyll]], linking a person literally to the land. The concept of the [[Anima locus]] is pertinent here, that is the 'soul' of a place, its essential personality as perceived in the imagination and emotions of visitors. A concept linked to the belief in supernatural spirits of nature as residing in stones, springs, mountains, islands, trees, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pennick|first=|year=1996|title=Celtic Sacred Landscapes|publisher=|isbn=|pages= 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of religious significance linked to life and death, past and present, real and spiritual worlds, etc. has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant factor is that, as previously stated, they were created from [[Neolithic]] through to the [[Bronze Age]], that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they ceased when the [[Celts|Celtic Culture]] began to dominate and suppress older cultural practices. During this time smaller nomadic groups that might visit certain sites seasonally developed into sedentary communities with hierarchical leadership structures and specific communal religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many 'galleries' of [[cup and ring mark]] art are in prominent places within the landscape, such as river gorges, waterfalls, outcrops, caves, etc. and it has been suggested that they may have defined territorial boundaries, either for a locality or for a significant land holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few prehistoric track ways have been positively identified however some link with the more practical aspects of [[Ley line]]s may be indicated by the observation that cup and ring art is sometimes found overlooking natural harbours, on prominent natural landscape features, in mountain passes, along valley sides, at the entrances to inland routes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that natural features of the rock faces may influence the cup and ring mark sizes, distribution and type in addition to 'framing' the carvings. Fissures, grooves, wind erosion marks, cracks, dune bedding, etc. may all have been regarded by the [[Cup and ring mark]] carvers as significant and meaningful in their own right to be copied, enhanced, removed or incorporated as possibly the work of their 'ancestors' or even the works of the gods themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cup and ring mark panels may have only been used seasonally and the varying level of complexity at sites has been interpreted as being both more and less significant in terms of the level of meaning present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universality of [[cup and ring mark]]ings suggest a commonality of the origins of such [[glyph]]s that may relate to natural phenomena that are deemed significant, such as the concentricles that form on water when an object or offering is placed in it and although this may have been interpreted differently by the many cultures involved, the [[liminality]] with associated themes of thresholds and communication with the 'other side' may be one explanation for the use of cup and rings rather than the extensive use of glyphs such as ovals, boxes, triangles, star-shapes, etc.

==Surveys of the markings==
In 2015 AOC Archaeology group were employed by the Forestry Commission Scotland to carry out a survey of laser scanning and [[photogrammetry]] on the Ballochmyle cup and ring marks. Laser scanning recorded the glyphs in 3D in minute detail, taking millions of measurements. The Photogrammetry involved photographing the site from many different angles and then bringing the data together to create a 3D model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Survey of Ballochmyle Cup and Ring Marks, Ayrshire|url=http://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/ballochmyle-survey/|publisher=AOC Archaeology Group|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCAHMS carried out a survey on behalf of Historic Scotland in 1987 and a series of drawings were lodged with what is now [[Historic Environment Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and Ring Marked Rock (Prehistoric)|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43557/ballochmyle|publisher=RCAHMS|access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bartolomeo Bimbi''' (15 May 1648 &amp;ndash; 1729) was a [[Florence|Florentine]] painter of [[still lifes]], commissioned by his patrons including [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] to paint large canvases of flora and fauna for the Medici Villa dell'Ambrogiana and della Topaia, now conserved in the [[Pitti Palace]] and the Museo Botanico dell'Universita. 

==Life and Work==
Son of Nicolò, he was born in [[Settignano]] on May 15, 1648; in about 1661 he entered the workshop of [[Lorenzo Lippi]], where he remained until the death of the master (1665); then he joined [[Onorio Marinari]] as his apprentice. After a trip to Rome with Cardinal [[Leopoldo de' Medici]], he began working for the Florentine court and aristocracy. Although his training made him suitable for figure painting, Bimbi is known almost exclusively for his activity as a painter of still lifes and portraits. 

Bimbi died in Florence on 14 January 1729.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trkulja|first1=Silvia Meloni|title=- Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 10 (1968)|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/bartolomeo-bimbi_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|website=Treccani|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He partly was following the tradition of [[Jacopo Ligozzi]] in documenting the botanical collections of the Medici. He was a pupil of [[Lorenzo Lippi]] and [[Onorio Marinari]]. Others claim he was a pupil of [[Angelo Gori]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Maria|last= Farquhar| year=1855| title= Biographical catalogue of the principal Italian painters|  editor = [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]] | page = 26| publisher=  Woodfall &amp; Kinder, Angel Court, Skinner Street, London; Digitized by Googlebooks from Oxford University copy on Jun 27, 2006| id= | url= https://books.google.com/books?q=intitle:Wornum+intitle:principal+intitle:painters | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Bellsybabble" is a [[pun]] on [[Beelzebub]], [[:wikt:babble|"babble"]] and [[Tower of Babel|Babel]]. Bellsybabble has variously been called a poly-language,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0885-0429| volume = 32| issue = 4| pages = 354–367| last = Hodgkins| first = Hope Howell| title = High Modernism for the Lowest: Children's Books by Woolf, Joyce, and Greene| journal = Children's Literature Association Quarterly| accessdate = 2016-05-17| date = 2007| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/232430503/abstract/96D42492A5FF4B7FPQ/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pluridialectal idiom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 19| issue = 2| pages = 343–374, 483, 487–488| last = Mihálycsa| first = Erika| title = "Writing to the self-accompaniment of a tongue that is not mine": The Figure of Translation in Beckett's Work| journal = HJEAS : Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies| accessdate = 2016-05-17| date = 2013| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1664902206/citation/96D42492A5FF4B7FPQ/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ludic creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 19| pages = 35–44| last = Cronin| first = Michael| title = After Bellsybabble: Transformation, Invention, and Resistance in Translation| journal = Parallèles| date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}}

== Significance ==
For [[Giorgio Melchiori]], it is suggestive of the idea that in [[literary text]]s, there is not a single language, but a multitude of languages, a different one for each reader of the text.&lt;ref name="Melchiori1988"/&gt;{{rp|16}} It has been compared with the language of Joyce's novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = Emory University| last = Ferris| first = Kathleen Richard| title = James Joyce, Wandering Jew| location = United States -- Georgia| accessdate = 2016-05-17| date = 1989| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/303794530/abstract/CE031289D61944E4PQ/7|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also provided the inspiration for [[C. George Sandulescu]]'s study of ''Finnegans Wake'', entitled ''The Language of the Devil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = C. Smythe| isbn = 978-0-8023-1284-6| last = Sandulescu| first = Constantin-George| title = The language of the Devil : texture and archetype in Finnegans wake| location = Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire| date = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}}

Linguist [[John Haiman (linguist)|John Haiman]] compares Bellsybabble to ordinary [[language]] in the way it continually shapes, and is in turn shaped by, the utterances spoken within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-511524-6| last = Haiman| first = John| title = Talk is cheap : sarcasm, alienation, and the evolution of language| location = Oxford| date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}} This challenges the rigid [[Langue and parole|separation]] between [[Linguistic competence|code]] and [[linguistic performance|message]]. On one hand, the language determines the presupposed content and boundaries of possible messages, as shown by the concept of [[linguistic relativity]]. On the other hand, the message may also affect the code used by that very message.&lt;ref&gt;In English, this can happen in sentences of the type "A is B", where "A" differs from "B" in person or number. Here the grammatical pattern that requires a verb to [[Grammatical agreement|agree]] with its subject can give way, allowing agreement with whatever is asserted to be identical to the subject. Thus in the sentence "[[Our Father]], who ''are'' in heaven," it is only the use of "Our Father" as a term of address that allows the verb "are" to be in the second person. (Haiman 1998, p. 177)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Renoir, Baigneuse Blonde, 1882 PA.jpg|thumb|260px|Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1882, ''La Baigneuse blonde'', oil on canvas, 90 x 63 cm, Pinacoteca Agnelli, Turin]]
[[Auguste Renoir]] painted two very similar versions of '''''Blonde Bather''''' ('''''La baigneuse blonde''''') in 1881 and 1882 – both are now in private collections but on public display. The model was [[Aline Charigot]], later to become Renoir's wife. Influenced by seeing renaissance painting (particularly [[Raphael]]'s frescoes) in Italy in 1881, these pictures showed a marked change of style from Renoir's previous work. Some commentators consider these are works of great beauty, others that they are vulgar. There has been criticism of the conservation work performed on the 1881 painting.

==Context==
Renoir was forty and an established artist when he visited Italy in autumn 1881. Apart from a visit to [[Algiers]] earlier in the year he had not been outside  [[metropolitan France]] and indeed he had never been far from Paris. [[Ambroise Vollard]], who collected his art, reported that Renoir particularly admired the works he saw by [[Titian]] and [[Raphael]] (including ''[[Madonna della seggiola]]'' and ''[[The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple]]'') as well as [[Roman art|Pompeiian]] and [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] frescoes. More practically, in letters home Renoir wrote that he appreciated the beautiful scenery and light, and he hoped to complete many paintings which would attract good prices. He had become dissatisfied with his figure painting (which lived awkwardly beside his impressionist landscapes) and he was pleased to leave Paris where he felt obliged to do society portraits. His visit was very productive and he shipped back to Paris several crates of paintings.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Barbara Ehrlich|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=December 1969|publisher=College Art Association|volume=51|issue=4|pages=333–351|doi=10.2307/3048651|jstor=3048651|title=Renoir's Trip to Italy}}
 Note: White a major biographer of Renoir.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for ''Blonde Bather'' was his girlfriend, favourite model, and future wife [[Aline Charigot]] who was with him for part of his trip. Charigot had earlier in 1881 been included in Renoir's ''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party|Le déjeuner des canotiers]]'' (''Luncheon of the Boating Party'') where she is the woman with the little dog, on the left. She appeared in many 
of his paintings – in 1882 ''[[Dance in the Country|Danse à la campagne]]'' (''Dance in the Country'').{{refn|group=note|Charigot was born in [[Essoyes]] in 1859 and died in 1915. The couple had three sons: [[Pierre Renoir|Pierre]] (born 1885), [[Jean Renoir|Jean]] (born 1894) and Claude (born 1901).&lt;ref name=lees /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millefonti|first1=Nice|title=La baigneuse blonde|url=http://www.arte.it/guida-arte/torino/da-vedere/opera/la-baigneuse-blonde-5753|website=www.arte.it|accessdate=16 September 2017|language=it|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316072356/http://www.arte.it/guida-arte/torino/da-vedere/opera/la-baigneuse-blonde-5753|archivedate=16 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=agnelli /&gt;

[[File:Renoir Blond Bather.jpg|thumb|upright|''Blonde Bather'' (1881), [[Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute]]&lt;ref name=clarkart /&gt;]]

===Description===
The painting, now owned (and displayed) by the [[Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute]] ("The Clark") in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], is oil on canvas {{convert|81.6|x|65.4|cm}} and Renoir explained that the picture was painted on board a boat in the [[Bay of Naples]]. On his return to Paris Renoir sold or gave the painting to Henri Vever, a modern art collector, and signed the canvas adding a dedication to Vever.&lt;ref name="lees"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lees|editor1-first=Sarah|title=Nineteenth-century European Paintings at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Volume two|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300179651|url=http://media.clarkart.edu/1955.609_EuroCat.pdf|chapter=Blonde Bather 1881|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913125525/http://media.clarkart.edu/1955.609_EuroCat.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Renoir's claim, the scene is not as from a boat. The figure appears to be seated beside the shore – behind her back there seems to be grass. However, the background has been altered after the original painting had been done.&lt;ref name=lees /&gt;

In 1926 the American art collector [[Robert Sterling Clark|Sterling Clark]] purchased the painting after some uncertainty. His wife [[Francine Clark|Francine]] thought the work was a marvel; Clark thought that he had never seen finer painting in terms of colour but it might become difficult to live with. He felt the price was excessive at $100,000 thinking it would only fetch $60,000 at auction.&lt;ref name=lees /&gt; White describes the appearance of the model as "rotund".&lt;ref name=white /&gt;

===Assessments===
Renoir's biographer, Barbara White, considers 1881 marks a significant change of style for Renoir's nudes – a new style he was to perpetuate – "A new classical impressionism inspired by the Italian frescoes ... a formal timeless view of a sober and sensuous figure".&lt;ref name=white /&gt; Renoir's friends in Paris also regarded it as a distinct change of style – the figure's contours are soft and, apart from the wedding ring, there are no signs of modernity. Renoir wrote "So, by studying out of doors I have ended up by seeing only the broad harmonies without any longer preoccupying myself with the small details that dim the sunlight rather than illuminating it."&lt;ref name=lees /&gt; He had been influenced by Raphael's frescoes at [[Villa Farnesina]] such as [[Galatea (Raphael)|Triumph of Galatea]] and so, writing from Rome, he said he had come to admire grandeur and simplicity. According to White he achieved these qualities for the first time in this painting.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;  The Clark art gallery says the painting "gives the nude a monumental presence that suggests a timeless image of womanhood".&lt;ref name=clarkart&gt;{{cite web|title=Clark Art - Blonde Bather|url=http://www.clarkart.edu/Collection/6521|website=www.clarkart.edu|publisher=The Clark Art Institute|accessdate=13 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615000029/http://www.clarkart.edu/Collection/6521|archivedate=15 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
Sterling Clark regarded Renoir of one of the greatest ever painters and he considered that his very best work was done around 1881. Clark was antipathetic to art restoration – in his will he prohibited any restoration of his bequests. On his death in 1956 most of his Renoirs were pictured in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in probably a completely unrestored condition. On the occasion of a 2012 [[Royal Academy]] exhibition ''From Paris a Taste for Impressionism'' Michael Daley took the opportunity to compare the ''Life'' photographs, one taken of ''Blonde Bather'' in 1996, and one in the exhibition catalogue, which show progressively that the contrast in the background has weakened and a halo effect has appeared around the body.

===Assessments===
[[Edward Lucie-Smith]] wrote of Kenneth Clark in 2014: "He also once owned ... a large icing-sugar sweet Renoir nude from the early 1880s, now in the ''Pinacoteca Agnelli'' in Turin. This flamboyantly vulgar object would undoubtedly excite new-rich billionaire collectors if it appeared today in a [[Sotheby's]] or [[Christie's]] auction. Clark’s protégé [[Victor Pasmore]] said the Renoir nude set his teeth on edge, and painted a hostile paraphrase to prove it. Clark was sporting enough to buy it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucie-Smith|first1=Edward|title=Kenneth Clark at Tate Britain: the great panjandrum|journal=The Jackdaw|date=2014|url=http://www.thejackdaw.co.uk/?p=1376|issn=1474-3914|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222041335/http://www.thejackdaw.co.uk/?p=1376|archivedate=22 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth Clark – Looking for Civilisation – Exhibition at Tate Britain|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/kenneth-clark-looking-civilisation|website=Tate|publisher=Tate Britain|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106185530/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/kenneth-clark-looking-civilisation|archivedate=6 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Dallas Museum of Art calls this version "This superb second painting".&lt;ref name=dmabather /&gt;

==Chalk study (1880–1881)==

There exists a red chalk study {{convert|84.5|x|65.5|cm|sigfig=3}} on wove tissue paper mounted on board, owned by the [[Dallas Museum of Art]]. The museum regards it as "among the most important surviving drawings by Renoir" and say it relates to the 1881 painting, without question. It was first drawn in pencil and then developed in chalk. Renoir sold it to [[Ambroise Vollard]], his art dealer. The drawing was probably made from life before commencing the 1881 oil painting but there is no sign that it was used to transfer an initial outline to the canvas.&lt;ref name="dmabather" /&gt;

Renoir also made an oil study, {{convert|6.33|x|4.5|in|cm|sigfig=3|order=flip}}, for the 1881 painting.&lt;ref name=white /&gt;

'''Cedar Grove OnStage''' is an [[Asian Pacific American]] theatre arts organization established in 2006, based in Los Angeles, co-founded by playwright [[Tim Toyama]] and actor/director [[Chris Tashima]] who serves as Artistic Director. It is a division of the entertainment company, [[Cedar Grove Productions]] and their focus is to develop, produce and present new and original [[Asian American theatre]] works.

==Background==

=== Media company===
{{main|Cedar Grove Productions}}
In 1996 the independent media company Cedar Grove Productions was formed to produce the short film, ''[[Visas and Virtue]]'' (1997). The story focused on [[Holocaust]] rescuer [[Chiune Sugihara|Chiune “Sempo” Sugihara]] and the film won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Live Action Short Film]] at the [[70th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/biz/biz_980323_OscarWins.html 70th Oscars winners] on [[IndieWire]]&lt;/ref&gt; The company takes its name from the literal translation of "Sugihara": ''[[sugi]]'' ({{lang-ja|杉}}) meaning cedar, and ''hara'' ({{lang-ja|原}}) meaning field or grove.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usc.edu/student-affairs/dt/V131/N04/04-vision.04d.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Othon Frédéric Jean-Baptiste, Comte de Clarac''' (24 June 1777, [[Paris]] – 20 January 1847, [[Paris]]) was a French artist, scholar and archaeologist.&lt;ref name=Maury&gt;{{cite book|last=Maury|first=Frédéric Clarac|title=Description historique et graphique du Louvre et des Tuileries|year=1853|publisher=Imprimerie impériale|pages=vii–xii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwTVZTfm0KsC&amp;pg=PR7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a catalogue of the Musée du Louvre, and a ''Manuel de l'Histoire de l'art'' and also that which is considered his best work: the ''Musée de sculpture antique et moderne'', 1826-1852, completed after his death.&lt;ref name=Ripley-Dana&gt;{{cite book|last=George Ripley|first=Charles A. Dana|title=The New American Cyclopaedia: a Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge|year=1864|publisher=Chartreuse-Cougar|pages=281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-zciQ4T0bgC&amp;pg=PA281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having served for some time in the army of prince Conde, and afterward entered a Russian regiment. After that he returned to France, and then to Naples in 1808. During his stay there he superintended the excavations at Pompeii, the results of which he described in his book, ''Fouilles Faites a Pompei.'' He soon left Italy and followed the duke of [[Luxembourg]] in his embassy to Brazil. On his return to Paris he was appointed successor to Visconti as keeper of the ''Musee des Antiques.''

==Life==
Emigrating on the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], he travelled round Europe, finding success in drawing and archaeology. He became tutor to the children of [[Joachim Murat]], king of Naples, and was charged by Murat with showing them round the ruins of [[Pompeii]]. He returned to France under the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and was made conservator of antiquities at the Louvre in 1818. In 1838 he was admitted to the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] as a free member.&lt;ref name=Ripley-Dana/&gt;

Highly talented at drawing, he accompanied the diplomatic mission of the [[Duke of Luxemburg]], extraordinary ambassador to king [[Louis XVIII]], to Brazil.&lt;ref name=Maury/&gt; On the shores of the Paraîbo do Sul, in the woods of [[Rio Bonito, Rio de Janeiro|Rio Bonito]] to the north of [[Rio de Janeiro]], he made several signed ''[[croquis]]'', and once he was back in Europe worked them up into a large watercolour of the untouched and primitive forest interior of Brazil.&lt;ref name=Maury/&gt; The resulting work (also the result of minute study of tropical plants cultivated in the greenhouses of prince [[Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied|Maximilien zu Wied]]'s château), ''Forêt vierge du Brésil'', was shown at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1819. From its vegetal profusion emanates an organic luxuriance which several photographers later tried to emulate and reproduce.

The famous naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who had in his "Essay on the Geography of Plants" demanded that artists go to the New World and paint the richness of its vegetation, bought the work due to "its organic sense of the detail emanating from the totality of nature". It was acquired by the Louvre's "département des Arts graphiques" in 2004, and in 2005 a special exhibition was centred on it.

==Works==
Besides a ''Catalogue du musée du Louvre'' and a ''Manuel de l'histoire de l'art'', 1847, 3 volumes in-12, he wrote ''Musée de sculpture antique et moderne'', 1826–1855, 6 volumes in-8, with plates in-4, a magnficient publication which used up his fortune and which he was unable to finish before his death.

'''Cinéaste One''' is an arts and cultural organization based in [[Karachi]] formed for the purpose of establishing an infrastructure to encourage and promote short film making in [[Pakistan]]. It organizes workshops and seminars promoting film literacy and produces the [[Cinéaste One Student Film Festival]].

==History==
Cinéaste One film organization was formed in 2012 after [[Rumman Zia]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/796177/getting-to-know-karachi-in-five-films/ |title=Cinéaste One's Rumman Zia at Karachi Conference |publisher=[[The Express Tribune]] |date=2014-11-24 |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1152317/role-of-audience-in-creative-process-discussed |title=Rumman Zia discusses art at the Herald Forum |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Cinema 101’ workshops became a regular feature of [[Alliance Francaise]] de Karachi (AFK) cultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danka.pk/?var_action=event_details&amp;event_id=17182 |title=Cinema 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zia and AFK agreed to publicly showcase the films coming out of the workshop. Cinéaste One Student Film Festival (COSFF) was produced; highlighting selected short films from workshop participants. The first time filmmaker’s efforts were lauded and the affair was deemed a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afkarachi.com/spip.php?article284&amp;decoupe_recherche=Cin%C3%A9aste%20One%20 |title=COSFF12 - Alliance française de Karachi |publisher=Afkarachi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/#cineasteone/cineaste-one-radio-coverage |title=COSFF12 radio coverage |publisher=SoundCloud |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Zia decided to capitalize on the event’s success. With an eye on cultivating the film scene, a bigger event was launched the following year. Cinéaste One Student Film Festival 2013 (COSFF13) assimilated Karachi’s major film schools:[http://www.saampt.org/ SAAMPT], [[SZABIST]], [[Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture]], [[Iqra University]] and Cinema 101 workshops, on a single platform, supporting upcoming filmmakers and fashioning a film culture. A film-rating system was developed and an external jury composed of foreign and local artists and filmmakers were assembled.
An indie-rock band opened the event and COSFF13 marked a celebration rewarding the best coming out of Karachi’s film schools. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-4-169426-Cineaste-One-Student-Film-Festival-begins-tomorrow |title=COSFF13 press release |publisher=[[The News International]] |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/cineasteone/cosff-13-radio-coverage |title=COSFF13 radio coverage |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawn.com/2013/04/08/kurrachee-wins-at-cineaste-one-student-film-festival/ |title=Kurrachee wins best film at COSFF13 |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Cinéaste One organized an art exposition titled Filmistan from April 18 - April 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.afkarachi.com/spip.php?article608 |title=Filmistan - Where did those days go ? - Alliance française de Karachi |publisher=Afkarachi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1176764/journey-of-films-the-bygone-days |title=Journey of films: the bygone days |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date= |accessdate=2015-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fimistan featured a series of exhibitions showcasing Pakistani film posters, art and memorabilia from a bygone era.

The '''Coat of Arms of Deva''' is, since 1999, the [[coat of arms]] used by The City Government of [[Deva, Romania]] (The Local Council of Deva, The Mayor of Deva).  The ''Coat of Arms of Deva'', composed by [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|the shield]] and [[Coronet|the coronet]] (the mural crown), was modelled after the coat of arms in use during the interbelic period.

The first blazon of the city of Deva dates from 1618.  A description remains only:

The today Coat of Arms of Deva was sanctioned by The 39th Local Council Act from 17&amp;nbsp;May, 1994 (Romanian: ''Hotărârea Consiliului local nr.&amp;nbsp;39/1994'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''''Coonskin''''' is a 1975 American [[live action]]/[[animated film|animated]] [[crime film]] written and directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]], about an [[African American]] [[Br'er Rabbit|rabbit]], [[Br'er Fox|fox]], and [[Br'er Bear|bear]] who rise to the top of the [[organized crime]] racket in [[Harlem]], encountering [[Police corruption|corrupt law enforcement]], [[Confidence trick|con artists]], and the [[Mafia]]. The film, which [[Films with live action and animation|combines live-action with animation]], stars [[Philip Michael Thomas|Philip Thomas]], [[Charles Gordone]], [[Barry White]], and [[Scatman Crothers]], all of whom appear in both live-action and animated sequences.

Originally produced under the titles ''Harlem Nights'' and ''Coonskin No More...'' at [[Paramount Pictures]], ''Coonskin'' encountered controversy before its original theatrical release when the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] criticized the content as being racist. When the film was released, [[Bryanston Distributing Company|Bryanston]] gave it limited distribution and it initially received mixed reviews. Later re-released under the titles ''Bustin' Out'' and ''Street Fight'', ''Coonskin'' has since been reappraised. A ''New York Times'' review said, "[''Coonskin''] could be [Ralph Bakshi's] masterpiece."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; Bakshi has stated that he considers ''Coonskin'' to be his best film.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibson |first1=Jon M. |last2=McDonnell |first2=Chris |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |pages=106; 108–109; 114; 127 |chapter=Coonskin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In a small town in Oklahoma, Sampson and the local Preacherman plan to bust out their friend Randy from prison. As they rush to the prison, the two are stopped by a roadblock and have a shootout with the police. Meanwhile, Randy and another cellmate named Pappy escape from inside the prison and wait for Sampson and the Preacherman to help them get out. While waiting for them, Randy unwillingly listens to Pappy tell a story about three guys that resemble Randy and his friends. Pappy's story is told in [[animation]] set against live-action background photos and footage.

[[Br'er Rabbit|Brother Rabbit]], [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|Brother Bear]], and [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|Preacher Fox]] are forced to pack up and leave their Southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a [[brothel]]. The trio moves to [[Harlem]], "home to every black man". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it is not all that it is made out to be. They encounter a [[confidence trick|con man]] named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of "[[race and appearance of Jesus|Black Jesus]]", and that he gives his followers "the strength to kill [[Caucasian race|whites]]". In a flashy stage performance in his "church", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression—represented by images of [[John Wayne]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[Richard Nixon]], before asking his parishioners for "donations". Rabbit and his friends quickly realize Savior's "revolution" is merely a money making scam. Rabbit openly steals a large portion of the donation money, prompting Savior to try to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. Rabbit lays out his plan to keep all organized crime money in Harlem. But first, he has to get rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit they will join him but only if he can kill his opponents, otherwise they will kill him instead.

Rabbit first goes up against Managan, a virulently racist and [[homophobia|homophobic]] Irish police officer and [[bagman]] for the [[American Mafia|Mafia]], who demonstrates his contempt for African-Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them (he believes they are not worth it). When Managan finds out that Rabbit has been taking his payoffs, he and his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called "The Cottontail". A black [[stripper]] distracts him while an [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] sugar cube is dropped into his drink. Managan, while under the influence of his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate [[gay]] man, and then shoved into women's clothing representative of the [[mammy archetype]], adorned in [[blackface]], and shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. While recovering from being drugged, he fires his gun randomly, and is brutally shot to death by the police after shooting one of the officers. &lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Darius |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury) |year=1995 |publisher= |location= |isbn=0-312-13192-5 |chapter=Rappin' with the rib-ticklin' Ralph Bakshi |pages=117–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbit's final target is the [[Capo di tutti capi|Godfather]] who lives in the subway with his wife and his [[transvestism|cross-dressing]], gay (and possibly [[incest]]uous) sons. The [[Contract killing|contract]] for killing Rabbit is given to his only [[Heterosexual|straight]] son Sonny. Arriving outside Rabbit's nightclub in blackface and clothing representative of [[minstrel show]] stereotypes, Sonny attempts to kill Rabbit, but Bear defends Rabbit, at the cost of getting shot by Sonny several times. When Sonny then attempts to escape in his car, he is shot multiple times by Rabbit before crashing into a wall and dying the subsequent explosion. Rabbit then helps the injured Bear to safety. Sonny's body is cremated and taken back home, where his mother weeps over his ashes.  

During his recovery, Bear becomes torn between staying with Rabbit or starting a new crime-free life. Bear decides to look for Fox in order to seek his advice. Upon arriving at Fox's newly acquired brothel, Bear is "married" to a girl he, Fox, and Rabbit met during the fight with Savior's men. Under the advisement of Fox, Bear becomes a boxer for the Mafia. During one of Bear's fights, Rabbit sets up a melting imitation of himself made out of [[tar]]. As the [[Mafioso (criminal)|Mafiosos]] take turns stabbing at the "[[tar baby|tar rabbit]]", they become stuck together. Rabbit leaves a bomb next to them and then he, Bear, Fox, and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up.

The live-action story ends with Randy and Pappy escaping from the prison while being shot at by various white cops, but managing to make it out alive.

The main plot of the film is interspersed with animated [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] depicting a white, blonde, large-breasted [[Miss America]] who serves as a personification of the [[United States]]. In each of these short scenes, she seduces a black man (meant to depict the African-American populace), only to instead beat or kill him.

==Production history==
During the production of ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'', filmmaker Ralph Bakshi met and developed an instant friendship with producer [[Albert S. Ruddy]] during a screening of ''[[The Godfather]]'', and pitched ''Harlem Nights'' to Ruddy.&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"/&gt; In 1973, production of ''Harlem Nights'' began,&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Karl F |authorlink= |title=Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. |location=North Carolina |isbn=0-7864-0395-0 |chapter=''Coonskin'' |pages=84–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanfer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kanfer |first=Stefan |authorlink= |title=Serious Business: The Art and Commerce of Animation in America from Betty Boop to Toy Story |year=2001 |publisher=Da Capo |location=  |isbn=978-0-306-80918-7|page=205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Paramount Pictures]] (where Bakshi once worked as the head of its [[Famous Studios|cartoon studio]]) originally attached to distribute the film.&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibson-McDonnell-106"/&gt; Bakshi hired several black animators to work on ''Harlem Nights'', including graffiti artists, at a time when black animators were not widely employed by major animation studios.&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Best"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.waxpoetics.com/2010/04/inner-city-hues/ |title=Inner City Hues |author=Best, Tony |date= |work= |journal=[[Wax Poetics]] |accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production concluded in the same year.&lt;ref name="Best"/&gt; During production, the film went under several titles, including ''Harlem Days''&lt;ref name="Best"/&gt; and ''Coonskin No More...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Puchalski |first=Steven |title=Slimetime: A Guide to Sleazy, Mindless Movies |year=2002 |publisher=Critical Vision |isbn=1-900486-21-0 |chapter=Coonskin |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coonskin screenshot.png|thumb|A scene intended to satirize black stereotypes]]
''Coonskin'' uses a variety of racist [[caricature]]s from [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]] and darky iconography, including stereotypes featured in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films and cartoons.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; In the book ''That's Blaxploitation! Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury)'', [[Darius James]] writes that "Bakshi pukes the iconographic bile of a racist culture back in its stupid, bloated face, wipes his chin and smiles ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' style. [...] He subverts the context of Hollywood's entire catalogue of racist black iconography through a series of swift cross-edits of original and appropriated footage."&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; The film also features equally exaggerated portrayals of white [[Southern United States|Southerners]], Italians, and homosexuals.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; The depiction of Jewish characters stems from stereotypes portrayed in [[Nazi]] propaganda, including ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|The Eternal Jew]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tarantino |first1=Quentin |title=Unfiltered: The Complete Ralph Bakshi |year=2008 |publisher=Universe Publishing |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 |page=11 |chapter=Foreword }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for ''The Hollywood Reporter'', Arthur Knight wrote "''Coonskin'' is not anti-black. Nor is it anti-Jewish, anti-Italian, or anti-American, all of whom fall prey to Bakshi's wicked caricaturist's pen as intensely as any of the blacks in his movie. What Bakshi is against, as this film makes abundantly clear, is the cheats, the rip-off artists, the hypocrites, the phonies, the con men, and the organized criminals of this world, regardless of race, color, or creed."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; The film is most critical in its portrayal of the [[Mafia]]. According to Bakshi, "I was incensed at all the hero worship of those guys in ''[[The Godfather]]''; [[Al Pacino|Pacino]] and [[James Caan|Caan]] did such a great job of making you like them. [...] One thing that stunned me about ''The Godfather'' movie: here's a mother who gives birth to children, and her husband essentially gets all her sons killed. In ''Coonskin'', she gets her revenge, but also gets shot. She turns into a butterfly and gets crushed. [...] These [Mafia] guys don't give you any room."&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.27.03/bakshi-0309.html |title=''Here He Comes to Save the Day: An interview with Cinequest Maverick Spirit honoree Ralph Bakshi'' |accessdate=2007-03-25 |author=Busack, Richard von |work=[[San Jose Metro]] |authorlink= Richard von Busack }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The live-action sequences feature singers [[Barry White]] and [[Scatman Crothers]], actor and playwright [[Charles Gordone]], and actors [[Philip Michael Thomas]], Danny Rees, and Buddy Douglas. Thomas, Gordone, and White also provide the voices of the film's main animated characters. In the film's ending credits, the actors were only credited for their live-action roles, and all voice actors who did not appear in the live-action sequences were left uncredited. Among the voices featured in the film was [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]], best known for appearing as Grandpa on ''[[The Munsters]]''.&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro-2"/&gt; Bakshi also worked with Gordone on the film ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/27838/Charles-Gordone/filmography |title=Charles Gordone Filmography |accessdate=2007-06-10 |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |year= |month= |work= [[The New York Times]] |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked with Thomas again on the film ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']]''.&lt;ref name="Best"/&gt; The film's opening credits feature a long take of Scatman Crothers performing a song on vocals and guitar called "Coonskin No More".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/articles/184621-the-gods-truth-an-interview-ralph-bakshi-part-1?start=2|title=Ralph Bakshi|work=[[CraveOnline]]}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RalphBakshiJan09.jpg|thumb|left|Ralph Bakshi in January 2009]]
''Coonskin'' uses a variety of different styles of artwork, filmmaking and storytelling techniques. Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] wrote that ''Coonskin'' "remains one of [Bakshi's] most exciting films, both visually and conceptually."&lt;ref name="Metro-2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.27.03/dolemite-0309.html |title=''Monstrosious! Rudy Ray Moore and Coonskin at Cinequest: the black hero of the 1970s on the fringe'' |accessdate=2007-03-25 |author=Busack, Richard von |publisher=''[[Metro Silicon Valley|San Jose Metro]]'' |work= |authorlink= Richard von Busack }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darius James writes that ''Coonskin'' "reads like an Uncle Remus folktale rewritten by [[Chester Himes]] with all the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]-based [[surrealism]] of Nigerian author [[Amos Tutuola]]."&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; The film directly references the original African folk tales that the Uncle Remus storybooks were based on in two scenes that are directly reminiscent of the stories ''The Briar Patch'' and ''The Tar Baby''.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; Writer and former [[pimp]] [[Iceberg Slim]] is briefly referenced in the dialogue of Preacher Fox, and the [[Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston|Liston–Ali]] fights are referenced in the film's final act, in which Brother Bear, like [[Sonny Liston]], is sold out to the Mafia.&lt;ref name="Metro-2"/&gt; The film also features a pastiche of cartoonist [[George Herriman]] and columnist [[Don Marquis]]' "[[archy and mehitabel]]", in a monologue about a cockroach that leaves the woman who loves him. Bakshi has stated that Herriman, a Biracial American [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]], is his favorite cartoonist.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Coonskin Sonny.png|thumb|In order to attempt a [[contract killing]] on Brother Rabbit, [[White people|white]] [[mobster]] Sonny disguises himself in [[blackface]] and clothing representative of [[minstrel show]] [[iconography]], and uses a gun hidden in a [[banjo]]]]
When the film was finished, a showing was planned at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; The [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) surrounded the building, in a protest led by [[Elaine Parker]]. Gregg Kilday of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' interviewed Larry Kardish, a museum staff member, and Kardish recalled that "About halfway into the film about ten members of CORE showed up. They walked up and down the aisles and were very belligerent. In my estimation they were determined not to like the film. Apparently some of their friends had read the script of the movie and in their belief it was detrimental to the image of blacks [...] The question-and-answer session with Bakshi that followed quickly collapsed into the chaos of a shouting match."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; Animation historian [[Jerry Beck]] did not recall any disturbance during the screening, but said there were racist catcalls during the question-and-answer session, and Bakshi's talk was cut short. "It wasn't much of a madhouse, but it was kind of wild for the Museum of Modern Art."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;

Following the showing, the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] Building in New York City was picketed by CORE. [[Elaine Parker]], chairman of the Harlem chapter of CORE, had spoken out against the film in January 1975. She told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that the film "depicts us as slaves, hustlers and whores. It's a racist film to me, and very insulting." The Los Angeles chapter of CORE demanded that Paramount not release the film, claiming that it was "highly objectionable to the black community."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; The [[NAACP]] had written a letter describing the film as a difficult satire, but supported it.&lt;ref name="James"/&gt;

With Paramount's permission, Bakshi and Ruddy got contractually released, and the Bryanston Distributing Company was assigned the rights to the film.&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; Two weeks after the film opened, the distributor went bankrupt.&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; According to a May 1975 issue of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', [[Ben Gage]] was hired to re-record some of Barry White's voice tracks, in order to remove "racist references and vulgarity."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; ''Coonskin'' was given limited distribution, advertised as a blaxploitation film. [[Roger Ebert]] wrote in his review of the film:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Coonskin'' is said by its director to be about blacks and for whites, and by its ads to be for blacks and against whites. Its title was originally intended to break through racial stereotypes by its bluntness, but now the ads say the hero and his pals are out "to get [[the Man]] to stop calling them coonskin." The movie's original distributor, Paramount, dropped it after pressure from black groups. Now it's being sold by Bryanston as an attack on the system. [...] ''Coonskin'' is provocative, original and deserves better than being sold as the very thing it's not.&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750101/REVIEWS/501010309/1023 |title=Review of ''Coonskin'' |accessdate=2007-03-25 |last= |first= |authorlink=Roger Ebert |coauthors= |date=January 1, 1975 |year= |month= |author=Ebert, Roger |location=Chicago|work=Sun-Times |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1982 article published in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', Carol Cooper wrote "''Coonskin'' was driven out of theaters by a misguided minority, most of whom had never seen the film. CORE's pickets at Paramount's [[Gulf and Western]] headquarters and, later, a few smoke bombs lobbed into packed Broadway theaters were enough; theater owners were intimidated, and the auxiliary distributor, Bryanston, couldn't book the film. Bye-Bye ''Coonskin''."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;

==Critical response==
Initial reviews of the film were mixed. ''[[Playboy]]'' said of the film, "Bakshi seems to throw in a little of everything and he can't quite pull it together."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; A review published in ''The Village Voice'' called the film "the product of a crippled hand and a paralyzed mind."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; Arthur Cooper wrote in ''[[Newsweek]]'', "[Bakshi] doesn't have much affection for man or woman kind—black or white."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; Eventually, positive reviews appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', the ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]'' (an African American newspaper), and elsewhere, but the film died at the box office.&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; Richard Eder of ''The New York Times'' wrote, "[''Coonskin''] could be his masterpiece [...] a shattering successful effort to use an uncommon form—cartoons and live action combined—to convey the hallucinatory violence and frustration of American city life, specifically black city life [...] lyrically violent, yet in no way [does it] exploit violence."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; ''Variety'' called the film a "brutal satire from the streets. Not for all tastes [...] not avant-garde. [...] The target audience is youth who read comics in the undergrounds."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; A reviewer for ''The Los Angeles Herald Examiner'' wrote "Certainly, it will outrage some and indeed it's not Disney. I liked it. The dialogue it has obviously generated—if not the box office obstacles—seems joltingly healthy."&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;

==Legacy==
''Coonskin'' was later re-released under the title ''Bustin' Out'', but it was not a success.&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt; In 2003, the [[Online Film Critics Society]] ranked the film as the 97th greatest animated film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/pages/pr/top100animated |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ADt9yaLh?url=http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/pages/pr/top100animated |archivedate=August 27, 2012 |title=Top 100 Animated Features of All Time |accessdate=2007-03-25 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=[[Online Film Critics Society]] |pages= |quote= |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coonskin'' was released on VHS by Academy Entertainment in late 1987,&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;Solomon, Charles (1989), p. 275. ''Enchanted Drawings: The History of Animation''. {{ISBN|0-394-54684-9}}. New York City: Alfred A. Knopf. Accessed March 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Xenon Entertainment Group]] in the 1990s, both under the re-release title, ''Street Fight''.&lt;ref name="Cohen-84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James"/&gt; The 1987 edition carried the disclaimer, "Warning: This film offends everybody".&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt;

In 2010, [[Shout! Factory]] announced that ''Coonskin'' would be released on DVD in November 2010, intending to release it with a reversible cover with both titles of the film; the release was cancelled due to a legal issue involving ownership of the rights to the film, resolved with Xenon's eventual DVD release in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidepulse.com/2010/08/04/disc-news-coonskin-finally-coming-to-dvd/ |title=Disc News: ''Coonskin'' Finally Coming To DVD |author= |date=August 4, 2010 |work= |publisher=Inside Pulse |accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 release was the first official home video release to carry the film's original title. In September 2012, Bakshi incorporated animation from ''Coonskin'' into a new short film, ''Trickle Dickle Down'', criticizing Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2012/09/14/video-trickle-dickle-down-ralph-bakshis-new-short/ |title=Video: Trickle Dickle Down, Ralph Bakshi's New Short |publisher=Bleeding Cool |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|image = Cows Skull Red White and Blue.jpg}}
'''''Cow's Skull: Red, White, and Blue''''' is a [[painting]] by American artist [[Georgia O'Keeffe]].  The painting depicts a [[cow]] [[skull]] centered in front of what appears to be a cloth background.  In the center of the background is a vertical black stripe.  On either side of that are two vertical stripes of white laced with blue.  At the outside of the painting are two vertical red stripes.
==History==
O'Keeffe created the painting in 1931.  It is done in [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas and measures 39 7/8 x 35 7/8 inches. (101.3 x 91.1&amp;nbsp;cm).  It is part of the [[Alfred Stieglitz]] Collection (1952) of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web
| url =http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geok/hod_52.203.htm

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the painting's creation, American artists, musicians, and writers were interested in identifying a uniquely American style and subject matter for their work.&lt;ref name="Met"/&gt;  They sought out themes for the "[[Great American Novel]]" or "Great American Story". O'Keeffe offered a different opinion about what images could best symbolize America.
==Description==
In this case, O'Keeffe used a weathered cow's skull to represent the enduring spirit of America or depicting Jesus Christ on the cross with touches on the strong ties to Christianity.  The painting prominently displays the three colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] behind the cow skull. Although she said she made it as a joke on the concept of the "Great American Painting," the picture has become a quintessential [[icon]] of the [[American West]].&lt;ref name="Met"/&gt;

He also writes for European publications like ''[[The London Review of Books]]'', ''Frieze International'' (London), ''Situation'' (Paris), and ''Parkett'' (Zurich).

He is known for his arguments against academicism and in favor of the effects of rough-and-tumble free markets on art. His critical essays have been published in two volumes: ''The Invisible Dragon: Four Essays on Beauty'' (1993) and ''Air Guitar: Essays on Art and Democracy'' (1997). In 2009, Hickey published a revised and updated version of ''The Invisible Dragon'', adding an introduction that addressed changes in the art world since the book's original publication, as well as a new concluding essay.

"I write love songs for people who live in a democracy," he has said.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Dave (1997) [http://www.artbook.com/0963726455.html Air Guitar: Essays on Art and Democracy] The Foundation for Advanced Critical Studies, Inc., Los Angeles. {{ISBN|9780963726452}}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviews with Hickey have been published in ''The Los Angeles Times'', ''Bomb'', ''New Art Examiner'', ''Public Events'', ''The Art Newspaper'' and other magazines. He has been interviewed several times on topics like art and Las Vegas by the BBC, PBS, and National Public Radio.

In 2014, Hickey began making posts on [[Facebook]] during an illness. Eighteen months later, art historian Julia Friedman suggested a project documenting his experience. Two books resulted from the collaboration: ''Wasted Words'' and ''Dust Bunnies'', published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lasvegasweekly.com/ae/fine-art/2016/feb/10/art-critic-dave-hickey-facebook-women-artists/ |last=Peterson |first=Kristen | title=Art Critic Dave Hickey Talks About Facebook — And His Two New Books About Facebook | publisher=lasvegasweekly.com | date=10 February 2016 | accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://javamagaz.com/?p=1708 |last=Duncan |first=Jenna | title=Julia Friedman: Editor Of Dave Hickey's Online Writings | publisher=javamagaz.com | date=25 February 2016 | accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both books appeared in a lengthy review published by [[The Times Literary Supplement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/editions/may-27-2016/ |last=Hawkes |first=David | title=Everyone's a critic: ''Wasted Words'' and ''Dust Bunnies'' by Dave Hickey, compiled and edited by Julia Friedman | publisher=[[The Times Literary Supplement]] | date=27 May 2016 | accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he wrote the essay "War Is Beautiful, They Say" for the book "War is Beautiful: The New York Times Pictorial Guide to the Glamour of Armed Conflict" by [[David Shields]]. This essay described the painterly influences and inspirations behind several war photographs published by ''The New York Times''.

Hickey is married to art historian Libby Lumpkin.

'''''Die Gstettensaga: The Rise of Echsenfriedl''''' ('''''The Gstetten Saga: The Rise of Echsenfriedl''''') is a 2014 Austrian science fiction and fantasy film directed by [[Johannes Grenzfurthner]] and starring Sophia Grabner, Lukas Tagwerker and Jeff Ricketts.&lt;br /&gt;
The absurdist comedy deals with the politics and hype behind media technology and [[nerd]] culture. Grenzfurthner calls his film a contemporary way to talk about the critique of the [[spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]] and [[commodity fetishism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2014/38/50589.html Interview with Johannes Grenzfurthner in ''Jungle World'', September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was co-produced by art group [[monochrom]] and the media collective ''Traum &amp; Wahnsinn'', and created for the Austrian television channel [[ORF III]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://tv.orf.at/orf3/stories/2635002/ ORF III project page]"&lt;/ref&gt; It features music by [[Kasson Crooker]], Starpause, and many others.

==Plot==
The growing tension between the last two remaining superpowers - [[China]] and [[Google]] - escalates in the early 21st century, and results in the global inferno of the "Google Wars". But as the decades go by, radioactive dust settles on old battlegrounds, and a New World rises from the ashes of the old.

Fratt Aigner, a seedy journalist, and Alalia Grundschober, a nerdy technician, live and work in Mega City [[Schwechat]]: the biggest semi-urban sprawl in the foothills of what remained of the [[Alps]]. Thurnher von Pjölk, who invented the printing press and runs the only newspaper around, feels threatened by the rise of a new generation of tech-savvy DIY nerds, who he fears will ruin his monopoly. He gives Alalia and Fratt the task to venture into the depths of Niederpröll and conduct a tele-o-vision interview with Echsenfriedl; a mythical genius that has a large fan base among the nerds.

Pjölk sends off Alalia and Fratt equipped with a broadcasting vehicle (a wheelbarrow full of recording equipment) to live broadcast the interview with Echsenfriedl on tele-o-vision. Fratt is very skeptical of leaving the safety of the Mega City, but Alalia is a huge fan of Echsenfriedl and has investigated into his hiding place on earlier occasions. She sees this as a golden opportunity to find Echsenfriedl and boost her agenda of social change through technology.

The road to finding Echsenfriedl is not an easy task and things start to go wrong as soon as they reach the border, which is protected by the Postal Service, who try to uphold civilization and fight structurelessness. The Postal Service confiscates their recording equipment and send Alalia and Fratt away in despair. They are abducted by a group of barbarians: descendents of farmers, in a cargo cult based on relics of office material, bureaucracy and vague memories of European Union agricultural grants. Alalia and Fratt have to blast their way out and manage to escape before they end up as a sacrifice.

Aliana and Fratt wander the post-nuclear boondocks until they stumble upon a mining colony. They find shelter in a seemingly-abandoned underground structure, but discover a wondrous old lady, Philine-Codec Comtesse de Cybersdorf, who used to be married to Pjölk until he tried to killer her in a rage, which ends in her losing a leg. She tells Aliana and Fratt that it was actually Echsenfriedl who was the re-inventor of the printing press, and he the creative brain behind Pjölk's ideas and thoughts. Pjölk was the man in public only because it was impossible for Echsenfriedl. The Comtesse is about to tell them crucial information about Echsenfriedl, but then cannibalizing undead striking miners invade the room and kill her before she gets the chance to reveal the truth.

Having managed to escape the working-class zombie miners, they encounter the bearded libertarian drag queen Heinz Rand of Raiká, who leads a group of tinsel-dressed free market enthusiasts living on trading useless pre-war electronics for more useless pre-war electronics. Alalia sees that Heinz has the equipment that the Postal Service took from them and she trades it back by helping the group to get their useless electronics working again. Having helped out Heinz, he then tells them where to find Echsenfriedl and even offers his daughter Ayn as a guide to the location.

Alalia and Fratt, with the guidance of Ayn, finally reach their destination and prepare for the live broadcast. They contact Pjölk, who happily commands them to begin the transmission, then he turns off his tele-o-visor and sits down in front of his typewriter to create the headline article for tomorrow's issue of his tabloid. He fabricates an entire story based on how he is distressed for being responsible for killing the nerd viewers, and where he makes a statement saying that there should be a law banning tele-o-vision forever. Not yet aware of the danger they are putting themselves in, Alalia and Fratt start broadcasting and begin their quest through the lair, following Ayn of Raiká.

On seeing Echsenfriedl, Ayn gets turned into stone: Echsenfriedl is a basilisk. Hiding behind a corner and out of view, Echsenfriedl tells Alalia and Fratt about his life. By dating the Comtesse, he upset his greedy partner Pjölk. Pjölk's sinister plan was to murder all the early adopters of tele-o-vision with a single broadcast of Echsenfriedl's deadly eyes. The nerds can hear the audio of this broadcast, and react with repulsion and anger, attacking Pjölk's office. Echsenfriedl hires Alalia and Fratt as his crew to build a new media empire based on his marvelous new technologies. The films ends with Alalia and Fratt live broadcasting a lynch mob of book-burning nerds, who are the fervent supporters of Echsenfriedl's New World Order of technological dominance.

==Production==

===Writing===
The basic script, although many scenes were improvised, was written by Johannes Grenzfurthner and Roland Gratzer in a couple of days in November 2013, based on their theatre performance ''Campaign'' ([[Volkstheater]], 2006). Some of the ideas were brainstromed at a coffee shop in Vienna with the entire production crew. The film contains dialogues in English, German, a variety of slangs, dialects, accents, and fictitious languages. Subtitles are an integral part of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monochrom.at/gstettensaga/writing.htm Project page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
The film was commissioned by Austrian broadcasting station [[ORF III]] as part of the series "Artist-in-Residence" for a budget of approximately 5000 EUR. It can therefore be considered [[microfilmmaking]] or [[guerrilla filmmaking]].&lt;br /&gt;monochrom also used an embedded prank to raise money. The movie contains a text insert similar to watermarks used in festival viewing copies. The text insert asks the viewer to report the film as copyright infringement by calling a premium-rate phone number (1.09 EUR/minute). The film aired on Austrian national television in March 2014. Grenzfurthner co-financed the film with proceeds from the premium-rate number. According to Telepolis he calls this new strategy 'crowdratting.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/41/41478/1.html Telepolis; April 11, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Principal photography commenced on December 2, 2013 and ended January 19, 2014, but only a total of 5 days of principal photography. That left around 5 weeks for post-production and editing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3296276/ Production information on IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Due to the fast production process and the financial limitations, no film score was composed for "Die Gstettensaga: The Rise of Echsenfriedl". Grenzfurthner instead uses an assortment of 8bit, synth pop and electronica tracks. Grenzfurthner chose songs with a specific retro quality because "they may sound old-school to us, but not in the world of the Gstettensaga, where all retro electronic music is still impossible and futuristic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monochrom.at/info-monochrom/gstettensaga_fm4_interview__03102013.MP3 FM4 interview with director Johannes Grenzfurthner; March 10, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film features music by Symbion Project ([[Kasson Crooker]]), Max Beseda, Yakov, Robot City, Robert Glashüttner, Christoph Burstup Weiss, Krach der Roboter, BLEO and Starpause, Stefan Franke, Leigh Howells.

==Distribution==

The film first aired on March 10, 2014 in Austria on ORF III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.orf.at/orf3/stories/2635002/ ORF press release; March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It screens at film festivals and conventions like [[Gen Con]] 2014, [[Fright Night Film Fest]] 2014, [[Hackers on Planet Earth]] 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://x.hope.net/schedule.html#moviediegs HOPE X, 2014, schedule]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Roswell Filmfest and Cosmicon'' 2014, ''PhutureCon'' 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://monochrom.at/gstettensaga/ List of festival screenings]&lt;/ref&gt; ''NYC Independent Film Festival'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acfny.org/event/nyc-indie-film-festival-features-austrian-film/ Austrian Cultural Forum recommends Gstettensaga at NYC Independent Film Festival 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''International Filmmaker Festival of World Cinema'' 2015 (London).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmmakerfestival.com/ Official website of the International Filmmaker Festival of World Cinema, London]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film was released online on December 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2015/12/28/die-gstettensaga-a-science-fi.html Boing Boing reports about the availability of Gstettensaga online; December 28, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

===Critical response===

Amy R. Handler of [[Film Threat]] gave the film 5 (of 5) stars: "Grenzfurthner's outspoken, swiftly flying little flick is the must-see indie of 2014, as far as I'm concerned. Everyone, be they intellectuals, political-types, or simply those that love great blackly comic, sensual horror, will fall madly in love with 'Die Gstettensaga: The Rise of Echsenfriedl'.

Handler on 'Film Threat'; June 18, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Net culture magazine [[Furtherfield]] calls it a "hackploitation art house film" that reimagines "the makerspace as grindhouse", a "retro-futuristic post-cyberpunk adventure in the tradition of cinema grotesque". Gstettensaga's "fascinating cinematic pastiche is more than just a firework of rhizomatic intertextuality, a symptom of the depthlessness of postmodern aesthetics or excessive enthusiasm for experimentation in the field of form. In their infamous 1972 book ''Anti-Oedipus'', Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have identified the technique of bricolage as the characteristic mode of production under 'schizophrenic' capitalism, a facet triumphantly magnified by the filmmakers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furtherfield.org/features/reviews/die-gstetten-saga-rise-echsenfriedl-post-apocalyptic-aftermath-%E2%80%9Cgoogle-wars%E2%80%9D Stefan Lutschinger, Furtherfield; June 17, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Hacker magazine [[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]] interprets the film as a call to class consciousness for hackers: "Setting the film in the future forces hackers to confront a choice: Will we let ourselves and our ingenuity be recuperated by all-consuming market forces?

'''Eugene Abeshaus''' (also spelled ''Evgeny Abezgauz'', ''Евгений Абезгауз'' in Russian; 1939–2008) was a Jewish artist who worked in Russia (then USSR) and Israel.  

Born in Leningrad to a typical intelligentsia family, Abeshaus was educated as an electrical engineer but soon abandoned this career and enrolled in the Mukhina School for Applied Art. By the time of his graduation from the famous “Mukha” (''Fly'' in Russian), he had already developed a critical stance towards the official Soviet art dominated by the Communist ideology and began exhibiting at semi-underground exhibitions. This was culminated by his taking part in a famous 1975 exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture. Abeshaus was fired from his job and censured by the official press – which however admitted his "artistic taste, a good sense of color and form". 

Soon afterwards, Abeshaus set up, together with several Jewish artists, the Alef Group and became its leader. The group’s first exhibition in November 1975 was held at Abeshauses’ small apartment. According to the Alef Manifesto written by Alec Rappoport, “We are trying to conquer the influence of small-town Jewish art and find sources for our work in deeper, wiser, and more spiritual European culture, and from it build a bridge to today and tomorrow". 

In May 1976, some of Abeshaus’s works, clandestinely sneaked out of the country, were exhibited at the [[Berkeley Art Museum]] to much critical acclaim. Later in the same year, following some political bargain between Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Abeshaus and his family were finally permitted to leave the USSR for Israel.   

Since then Abeshaus lived and worked in [[Ein Hod]], a picturesque artists’ village near Haifa founded by [[Marcel Janco]]. His works were exhibited at numerous exhibitions, including dozens one-artist shows, in Israel, USA, Europe and, after the collapse of the USSR, in Russia. His ultimate acceptance and recognition there was culminated in a sensational memorial one-artist exhibition staged in 2009 at the famous [[Russian Museum]] in St.Petersburg - an exceptional honor for a modern artist.

The '''''Flaying of Marsyas''''' is a painting by the Italian late Renaissance artist [[Titian]], probably painted between about 1570 and his death in 1576, when in his eighties. It is now in the Archbishop's Palace in [[Kroměříž]], [[Czech Republic]] and belongs to the Archbishopric of Olomouc (administered by Olomouc Museum of Art – Archdiocesan Museum). It is one of Titian's last works, and may be unfinished, although there is a partial signature on the stone in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231; only "... NUS P" remains, presumably from "TITIANUS P[inxit]" – "Titian painted this".&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the killing by [[flaying]] or skinning alive of [[Marsyas]], a [[satyr]] who rashly challenged the god [[Apollo]] to a musical contest.  It is one of several canvases with mythological subjects from [[Ovid]] which Titian executed in his late years, mostly the ''poesie'' series for King [[Philip II of Spain]], of which this painting seems not to have been part. 

The painting has been in Kroměříž in [[Moravia]] since 1673, and was rather forgotten about, being off the beaten track as far as Venetian painting is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 717-718&lt;/ref&gt;  It  "did not enter critical literature until 1909".&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1930s it was "widely accepted as an important late work" among scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231&lt;/ref&gt; but little known by a wider public.  

On its first modern appearance abroad, it "was greeted with astonished admiration" as the "star attraction" of a major exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 718 quoted 1st; Rosand (2010), 19 quoted 2nd; Robertson is the catalogue entry&lt;/ref&gt; It was new to most viewers and was described by [[John Russell (art critic)|John Russell]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as "the most astonishing picture in the show".&lt;ref&gt;John Russell, [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/17/arts/art-venetians-of-1500-s-at-british-royal-academy.html ART: VENETIANS OF 1500'S AT BRITISH ROYAL ACADEMY], 17 December, 1983; Rosand, 1985, 295–297&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning an extended analysis, Sir [[Lawrence Gowing]] wrote that "All these months – it is not too much to say – London has been half under the spell of this masterpiece, in which the tragic sense that overtook Titian’s poesie in his seventies reached its cruel and solemn extreme. At most hours on most days there is a knot of visitors riveted and fairly perplexed in front of it. ... At the Academy people still ask, and on the radio well-meaning critics debate, how it is possible that a horribly painful subject should be the occasion of beauty or greatness in art."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and subject==
[[File:Giulio Romano - Flaying of Marsyas - WGA09622.jpg|thumb|360px|Drawing by [[Giulio Romano]], [[Louvre]], for a [[fresco]] in [[Mantua]].]]
The choice of such a violent scene was perhaps inspired by the death of [[Marcantonio Bragadin]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] commander of [[Famagusta]] in [[Cyprus]] who was flayed by the [[Ottomans]] when the city fell in August 1571, causing enormous outrage in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 715; Sohm, 97; Richard&lt;/ref&gt;  Titian's composition is undoubtedly derived from that of [[Giulio Romano]] from several decades before (see "Visual sources" below).&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Both artists follow the account in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (Book 6, lines 382–400),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses6.html www.theoi.com Text of Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' Book 6 in English]&lt;/ref&gt;, which covers the contest very quickly, but describes the flaying scene at relative length, though with few indications that would help to visualize it.&lt;ref&gt;Gowing; Richard&lt;/ref&gt; Marsyas cries out "Why do you tear me from myself?".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted, Hale, 712-713; Wind, 172, Ovid's line 385&lt;/ref&gt;  

Marsyas was a skillful player of the classical [[aulos]] or double flute, for which by Titian's time [[pan pipes]] were  usually substituted in art,&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 305 for a range of other instruments he was given, but all of them from the wind section.  The contest with Pan is also covered in ''Metamorphoses'' (XI, 146-93)&lt;/ref&gt; and his set hangs from the tree over his head. Apollo played his usual [[lyre]], which is here represented by a modern [[lira da braccio]], an ancestor of the [[violin]] with up to seven strings.  This is played by a figure of uncertain identity, who some scholars have said to be Apollo himself, perhaps appearing a second time, since Apollo is clearly the figure wearing a [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] wreath who is kneeling down and using his knife to flay Marsyas' chest.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 187; Hale, 714; Robertson, 231–232; Gowing&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that the musician is [[Orpheus]], or Olympus, a devoted pupil of Marsyas, who Apollo later converts to playing the lyre, and Ovid mentions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand (2010), 22; Sohm, 96; Gowing&lt;/ref&gt;  The mythical King [[Midas]], the seated old man on the right, is often thought to be a self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 187; Robertson, 231; Sohm, 97; Glover&lt;/ref&gt;  His downward line of gaze at Marsyas is parallel to that of the musician looking up to the heavens on the other side of the painting.  

Ovid avoids the question of who the judges of the contest were. In most Greek accounts the Three [[Muse]]s did the role, but the story early became confused with another, the "Judgement of Midas", which has happened here.  This was another musical contest, always with lyre versus pan pipes, but with [[Pan (god)|Pan]] himself on the pipes.  Of course Apollo won, but in some accounts King [[Midas]] preferred Pan, and was given the ears of a [[donkey]] as punishment, while Pan was merely humiliated.  The seated figure at right wears a [[diadem]] and is Midas, though his ears seem unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 303–305; Hall, 27–28; Robertson, 232; Hale, 713.  Whether Midas was actually supposed to be the judge, or just a spectator, varies between accounts.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Judgement of Midas" was also sometimes painted.  Both stories were set in [[Phrygia]], in modern [[Turkey]], where Midas ruled, which in the ancient world had various associations with music.  The Phrygians were not Greek, until [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] after [[Alexander the Great]], but lived on the edge of the Greek world.  The human with the knife wears a [[Phrygian cap]]. 
[[File:Titian - The Flaying of Marsyas (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The head of Marsyas, inverted]]

Apollo is assisted by a sinister "Scythian" figure on the left, working on Marsyas' leg, and a satyr with a bucket behind Midas, perhaps to collect blood, or hold the removed skin, which in some versions of the story Apollo later had nailed up in a temple.  A small boy, or boy satyr,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 714; What little can be seen of his legs seems to be furry, and he is described as a ''satirino'' by several authors&lt;/ref&gt; restrains a large dog at right, while a much smaller dog is lapping at the blood that has fallen to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Gowing&lt;/ref&gt;  As was typical in Titian's day, and especially in his works, the satyr is shown with the legs and feet of a goat, and inverting him emphasizes these, as well as giving him the position typical of mid-sized animals being slaughtered or skinned before butchering.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 303–304; Hale, 713&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of his body still seems unflayed, but Apollo holds a large flap of detached skin in the hand not holding his knife.  

Compositionally, the "V" shape made by Marsyas's legs is echoed by the highlighted "V"s of the bent arms of the four figures nearest to him, all of whom are looking at him.  Indeed, his navel is almost exactly at the centre of the canvas as it now is.&lt;ref&gt;[https://paintersonpaintings.com/john-dubrow-on-titian/ "John Dubrow on Titian"] in ''Painters on Paintings; ''Rosand (2010), 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Technical examinations have determined that two of the main differences to the Giulio Romano composition are changes made well after painting was underway; originally the musician merely held his instrument, as in the Giulio Romano composition, and the boy or small satyr and the large dog were not present.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
[[File:Titian - The Flaying of Marsyas (cropped to midas).jpg|thumb|Detail with Midas]]
Many writers have attempted to capture the meaning of the "famously savage" painting,&lt;ref&gt;Royal, 222&lt;/ref&gt; which, despite "the brutality of the treatment",&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 232&lt;/ref&gt; has been found powerfully compelling by many, and described as "the most discussed, revered and loathed of all Titian's paintings".&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 718&lt;/ref&gt;  One common suggestion has been that the painting reflects ideas in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] about the "liberation of the spirit from the body",&lt;ref&gt;Held, 187–189; Sohm, 97 quoted; Rosand (2010), 40&lt;/ref&gt; or the acquisition of higher insight or clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 171–173, on other 16th-century depictions&lt;/ref&gt;  Such ideas are usually considered to be involved in another famous treatment of flaying: the flayed skin carrying a self-portrait face of [[Michelangelo]], held by [[Saint Bartholomew]] as his attribute in ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' in the [[Sistine Chapel]].  One of Michelangelo's poems had used the metaphor of a snake shedding its old skin for his hope for a new life after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 206; Wind, 187–188; Hale, 713-714&lt;/ref&gt;

In this spirit, [[Dante]] began his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' with a prayer addressed to Apollo, who he asks to "Enter my breast, and so infuse me your spirit as you did Marsyas when you tore him from the cover of his limbs.&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 173–174, quoting ''Paradiso'' I, 13–21; Hale, 713&lt;/ref&gt;  In some other Renaissance depictions, Marsyas's furry legs appear human when flayed, so he "is redeemed from the animality that condemned him to this terrible fate".&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher-turned-novelist [[Iris Murdoch]] was especially fascinated by the painting, which she described in an interview as "the greatest in the Western canon".  It is mentioned in three of her novels, and sometimes discussed by the characters. In her portrait for the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] by [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]], a reproduction occupies most of the wall behind her head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomphillips.co.uk/images/stories/portraits/murdoch_1.jpg the painting]&lt;/ref&gt;  She said it was "something to do with human life and all its ambiguities and all its horrors and terrors and misery, and at the same time there’s something beautiful, the picture is beautiful, and something also to do with the entry of the spiritual into the human situation and the closeness of the gods ..."&lt;ref&gt;Paris Review.  The novels are ''[[A Fairly Honourable Defeat]]'' (1970), ''[[The Black Prince (novel)|The Black Prince]]'' (1973), and her last, ''[[Jackson's Dilemma]]'' (1995); Hale, 718&lt;/ref&gt;

The general interpretation of the story of Marsyas was as an illustration of the inevitable disaster that followed ''[[hubris]]'' in the form of a challenge to a god. An idea of the contest reinforcing the general moral and artistic superiority of the courtly lyre, or modern stringed instruments, over the rustic and frivolous wind family was present in much ancient discussion, and perhaps retained some relevance in the 16th-century.  Gowing comments: "It was on behalf of order and the laws of harmonious proportion, which sound in the music of strings, that Apollo claimed victory over the chaotic and impulsive sound of the pipes."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing; Rosand (2010), 19–20; Held, 190;  Hale, 713, 715-717&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Edgar Wind]] the contest determined "the relative powers of Dionysian darkness and Apollonian clarity; and if the contest ended with the flaying of Marsyas, it was because flaying was itself a Dionysian rite, a tragic ordeal of purification by which the ugliness of the outward man was thrown off and the beauty of his inward self revealed".&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, there have been suggestions that the painting has a political meaning, either general or specific, and depicts the "just punishment" of hubristic opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 190–191, 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'three ages of man' are all represented (if satyrs are allowed to count), indeed on the right they are aligned diagonally.  The boy or young satyr is looking rather vacuously out at the viewer, those in their prime are concentrating on their tasks with a variety of expressions, and Midas contemplates the scene, apparently with melancholy resignation, but making no further attempt to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 191–192; Sohm, 97–98; Rosand (2010), 22; Matthews&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Torment of Marsyas 1, Louvre May 2010.jpg|thumb|Roman version of the Hellenistic figure type, [[Louvre]]]]
It is unknown whether the painting had an intended recipient; Titian's main client in his last years was King [[Philip II of Spain]], but the picture is not mentioned in the surviving correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 711-712&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting may well be one of those still in Titian's studio at his death in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of these, including for example ''[[The Death of Actaeon]]'' in the [[National Gallery, London]] (certainly intended for Philip),&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 250–252&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a general argument as to whether they should be regarded as finished or not.  In this case the signature and areas of detailed finish may suggest that the painting had been completed.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 250–252; Robertson, 231; Jaffé, 25–28, 59, 151–152 (with both points of view expressed by different authors). The painting was in this exhibition, but not in the catalogue; Gowing, and Penny's letter in response below, which may indicate a shifted position; in 1984 Penny emphasizes unfinished aspects, in 2008 those suggesting completion.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Nothing is known of its history before it appears in an inventory of 1655 of the Arundel Collection, by then in exile from the [[English Civil War]] in [[Amsterdam]].  This was formed by [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel]] (d. 1646) and his wife [[Alethea Howard, Countess of Arundel|Alethea Howard]], and was mostly dispersed by their son after Alethea's death in 1655.  The collection had mostly been formed in the 1620s, when the Howards went on an extended visit to Italy, and it is presumed that the painting was bought there.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 233; Rosand (2010), 43 note 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was bought by Franz Imstenraed in 1655.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 233&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the nephew of (Edvard, Everard or) [[Everhard Jabach]], a banker from [[Cologne]] who was one of the greatest private collectors of the century, and also acted as an agent for [[Cardinal Mazarin]] and [[Louis XIV of France]].  In the 1650s the superb collection of Arundel's friend [[Charles I of England]] was being dispersed in London, and Jabach, acting on behalf of Louis, was one of many international buyers active, with agents on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 298–299&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1673 it was acquired by [[Karl II von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn]], [[Bishop of Olomouc]], after being a prize in a [[lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 233; [http://www.shafe.co.uk/home/art-history/early_stuart_contents/early_stuart_20_-_protectorate/ It seems the lottery was abandoned from lack of sales, and the actual purchase was by a conventional sale].&lt;/ref&gt;  He also bought most of the collection of the brothers Bernhard and Franz Imstenraed, which remains intact in [[Kroměříž Castle]], the former Archbishop's Palace, now the National Museum, in [[Kroměříž]].&lt;ref&gt; Machytka, Lubor, extract from "History of the Archbishop’s Gallery in Olomouc", 13, [http://docplayer.net/6216553-Acta-universitatis-palackianae-olomoucensis-facultas-philosophica-philologica-81-2003.html ACTA UNIVERSITATIS PALACKIANAE OLOMUCENSIS, NEERLANDICA II – 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears the painting was cut down at top and bottom, and added to at the sides, especially on the right, during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231, citing Neumann (see further reading)&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern times, the painting has been exhibited abroad in London in 1983&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231&lt;/ref&gt; and 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé, ex-catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Richard&lt;/ref&gt; and in Paris, Vienna, Venice, Rome,&lt;ref&gt;in 2013, [https://www.ft.com/content/86b1e492-a107-11e2-990c-00144feabdc0 Review of exhibition] in the ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and New York, most recently in "Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible", an exhibition of unfinished works, at [[Met Breuer]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand (2010), 19; All further sites mentioned in [https://paintersonpaintings.com/john-dubrow-on-titian/ "John Dubrow on Titian"] and [https://paintersonpaintings.com/david-molesky-on-titians-the-flaying-of-marsyas/ "David Molesky on Titian’s The Flaying of Marsyas"], in ''Painters on Paintings''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:255227-1330620655 Schiavone Midas.jpg|thumb|[[Andrea Schiavone]], ''Judgement of Midas'', [[Royal Collection]], c 1548–50]]
Marsyas, as a single figure, was a well-known subject in Roman and [[Hellenistic sculpture]], with a famous type showing him tied and hanging with his arms above his head.  This probably originated in Hellenistic [[Pergamon]],&lt;ref&gt;It was originally part of a group with the ''[[Arrotino]]'', then known as the ''Scythian'', a figure of a slave sharpening a knife, though the connection between the two was not realized until the 17th century.&lt;/ref&gt; and was well-known from various examples by the late Renaissance, followed for example by [[Raphael]] in a small scene on the ceiling of the [[Stanza della Segnatura]] in the Vatican.  But this is not a very direct influence on Titian's composition.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 27; Bull, 301–303; Gods, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Much closer is "an awkward sketch for a now damaged [[fresco]]" by [[Giulio Romano]] in the [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]] (1524–34),&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 714&lt;/ref&gt; for which there is also a drawing in the [[Louvre]]; this is clearly the main source for the composition.  It has all the same figures and elements except the boy and the dogs, in roughly the same positions, including, apparently for the first time in art, Marsyas shown tied upside down.  The standing figure at left is a servant holding a lyre, rather than Titian's lira da bracchio player.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231–232; Bull, 303–304; Rosand (2010), 19–20; Royal, 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The seated figure of Midas has donkey ears, and is more clearly distressed, holding his hands over his face, and Apollo, bending down rather than on one knee, is not cutting, but is pulling the skin off like a jacket.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrea Schiavone]]'s ''Judgement of Midas'' in the British [[Royal Collection]] (in 2017 displayed in the Gallery at [[Kensington Palace]]), is some twenty years earlier, from c. 1548–50, and is comparable to Titian, in atmosphere and some details of the composition.  Titian "must also have remembered elements of this painting: the pensive and abstracted attitudes of Apollo and Midas, and the radically free impressionistic brushwork used to heighten the dramatic mood of the story."  Apollo also plays a lira da bracchio, and Midas, as yet with normal ears, looks straight at Pan.&lt;ref&gt;Royal, 222, quoted.  Midas's ears are "barely indicated" since later overpaint was removed in the 1990s; [https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/3/collection/402862/the-judgement-of-midas  "Andrea Schiavone (c. 1510–1563), The Judgement of Midas  c. 1548–50"] Royal Collection webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

Midas or "Midas/Titian adopts the traditional melancholic's pose", which Titian would have known from Raphael's supposed portrait of [[Michelangelo]] as [[Heraclitus]] in ''[[The School of Athens]]'', and [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''[[Melencolia I]]'', not to mention the Schiavone.&lt;ref&gt;Sohm, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique and style==
The technique is characteristic of Titian's late style.  [[Nicholas Penny]] commented that there are "intense greens and blues and reds ([[vermilion]] as well as [[crimson]]) ... after 1560 Titian began to apply these colours in [[Glaze_(painting_technique)#Wall_glazing|scumbles]], often with his fingers, so that they only half belong to any of the forms and seem to float on the surface of the painting: evidently he painted them last. ... one can still see passages of smoky preliminary painting (notably the ghostly body of Apollo) but the blood, dogs' tongues and the ribbons in the trees are brilliant red."&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 251 quoted.  See also Rosand (2010), 23–27, and Sohm, 96–98&lt;/ref&gt;  

Describing a group of late works which he considers finished, including this,&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 252, but see his earlier letter in response to Gowing (below it on webpage) where he takes the opposite tack&lt;/ref&gt; and contrasting them with the ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'', which he considers unfinished, Penny notes "the impact of blurred areas of painting (... indecipherable distances, light piercing foliage) is enhanced by contrast with forms that were more fully modelled, if still often roughly painted, and, indeed, with some that were more detailed (Midas's diadem ...)".&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 252&lt;/ref&gt;  There are strong white highlights on the knife blades, the bucket, and elsewhere, comparable with those in ''[[Tarquin and Lucretia (Titian)|Tarquin and Lucretia]]'', which Titian delivered in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand (2010), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the purely technical means, many critics have tried to articulate evocations of Titian's pictorial language in this and other very late paintings.&lt;ref&gt;See Sohm, 97–98 for a further example&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|Sidney Freedburg]], "the surfaces of bodies make a silvered incanescence and the atmosphere, almost unbreathably dense, is like dulled fire.  ...There is a wry comedy within the cruelty, ugliness and strangeness within the magisterial beauty, and terror accompanies the sense of the sublime."&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 516&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[John Steer (art historian)|John Steer]] "it is not individual colours that tell, but an all-over emanation of broken touches, evoking a greenish-gold, that is splattered, appropriately to the theme, with reds like splotches of blood.  Vision and expression are here so much one that they cannot, even for the purposes of discussion, be separated.  .... Titian's intense struggle to grasp in paint, through tone and colour, the physical realities of the scene is a fundamental part of their meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Steer in Jaffé, 43.  For a longer account of Titian's late style, see [[John Steer (art historian)|Steer, John]], ''Venetian painting: A concise history'', 139–144, 1970, London: Thames and Hudson (World of Art), {{ISBN|0500201013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''idem.''''' is a [[Latin]] term meaning "the same".  It is commonly [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] as '''''id.''''',
which is particularly used in legal citations to denote the previously cited source (compare ''[[ibid.]]''). It is also used in academic citations to replace the name of a repeated author. 

''Id.'' is employed extensively in [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Law of Canada|legislation]] and in [[United states legislative branch|legal documents of the United States]] to apply a short description to a section with the same focus as the previous.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. 9th circuit appeals court|title=9th circuit appeals court - opinion of judges (9 Feb 2017) - State of Washington v. Donald J.Trump|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf|website=www.cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Id'' is masculine and neuter;  '''''ead.''''' (feminine), is the abbreviation for '''''eadem''''', which also translates to "the same". 

As an abbreviation, ''Id.'' always takes a period (or full stop) in both British and American usage (see [[Full stop#Abbreviations and personal titles of address|usage of the full stop in abbreviations]]). Its first known use dates back to the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of ''Idem'' |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idem |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary}}

==Use==
===Legal===
*''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte'', 428 U.S. 543, 545 (1976).
*''Id.'' at 547.

Here, the first citation refers to the case of ''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte.'' The volume number cited is 428 and the page on which the case begins is 543, and the page number cited to is 545.  The "U.S." between the numerical portions of the citation refers to the ''[[United States Reports]]''. 1976 refers to the year that the case was published.  The second citation references the first citation and automatically incorporates the same reporter and volume number; however, the page number cited is now 547. ''Id.'' refers to the immediately preceding citation, so if the previous citation includes more than one reference, or it is unclear which reference ''Id.'' refers to, its usage is inappropriate.

* ''"...the Executive Order declares that “the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.” Id. It asserts, “Deteriorating..."'' (from page 2 of [http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf State of Washington v. Donald J. Trump])

Here, Id. refers to the Executive Order that was mentioned in the previous sentence.&lt;ref name="trump" /&gt;

===Academic===

*''Id.'' ''Astral Labyrinth: Archaeology of the Greek Sky''. Sutton Pub, 2003.

In this example, ''Id'' in the second citation indicates that the author is identical to that of the previous citation. That is, the author of the second citation is also Macgillivray, J. A.

== Research ==
Unite's works reference mining heritage sourced from archives and museums.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This includes early geological historical maps and texts that were created during the British [[Industrial Revolution]] to guide mining the coal that fueled the engines that drove modernity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Photographs from Unite's travels and images duplicated from mining museums and archives, are as precious a resource to Unite as the site-specific sands and slimes pond tailings from the mines and industrial detritus,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and loaded with meaning that she mixes into her paints and pastels.&lt;ref name="Artslink 2016" /&gt;
 
Unite has exhibited in Germany, Beijing, Lyon and Tashkent Biennials and Art Museums internationally.&lt;ref name="Artslink 2016" /&gt;

The art of the [[Joseon]] era of [[Korea]] represent a rich and complex repository of a unique art form. Various artworks emerged with unique styles in painting, ceramics, and [[Joseon white porcelain|porcelain]]. Joseon art is characterized by influences from Buddhism and New-Confucianism in aesthetic of purity and restrained elegance, realism, and painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/3204/korean-painting-art-of-the-joseon-dynasty|title=Korean Painting: Art of the Joseon Dynasty {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|work=The Art Institute of Chicago|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In the early years of the Joseon dynasty, the elites of Korea sought to emulate the art of the Chinese heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/299242897|title=Art of the Korean Renaissance, 1400-1600|last=1971-|first=Lee, Soyoung,|date=2009|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|others=Haboush, JaHyun Kim., Hong, Sunpyo, 1949-, Chang, Chin-Sung, 1966-, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)|year=|isbn=9781588393104|location=New York|pages=15|oclc=299242897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paintings ==
[[File:MET 15 96 2.jpeg|left|thumb|Pavilion on a Lake image that shows Chinese influence]]
The Joseon dynasty painting styles moved towards increased [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in contrast to the abstract of the previous [[Goryeo]] dynasty. A national painting style of landscapes called "true view" began - moving from the traditional Chinese style of idealized general landscapes to particular locations exactly rendered. While not photographic, the style was academic enough to become established and supported as a standardized style in Korean painting.

The mid-to-late Joseon dynasty is considered the golden age of Korean painting. It coincides with the shock of the collapse of Ming dynasty links with the Manchu emperors accession in China, and the forcing of Korean artists to build new artistic models based on an inner search for particular Korean subjects. At this time China ceased to have pre-eminent influence, Korean art took its own course, and became increasingly distinctive to the traditional Chinese painting.

== Ceramics ==
[[File:Joseon Blue and white porcelain jar 2.jpg|thumb|left|15th century. Joseon dynasty, Korea. Blue and white porcelain jar with plum and bamboo design.]]
[[Ceramic art|Ceramics]] are a form of popular art during the Joseon Dynasty. Examples of ceramics include white porcelain or white porcelain decorated with cobalt, copper red [[underglaze]], blue underglaze and iron underglaze. Ceramics from the Joseon period differ from other periods because artists felt that each piece of art deserved its own uniquely cultivated personality.&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=35–39|url=http://artsbma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 10th century, white porcelain has been crafted in [[Korea]]. Historically overshadowed by the popularity of [[celadon]], it was not until the 15th and 16th centuries that white porcelain was recognized for its own artistic value. Among the most prized of Korean ceramics are large white jars. Their shape is symbolic of the moon and their color is associated with the ideals of purity and modesty of [[Confucianism]]. During this period, the bureau that oversaw the meals and court banquets of the royal family strictly controlled the production of white porcelain.&lt;ref name="BMA"/&gt;

[[File:Water Dropper in the Shape of a Peach,1993.185.3.jpg|thumb|Water Dropper in the Shape of a Peach, late 18th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
[[Blue and white porcelain]] artifacts decorating white porcelain with paintings and designs in [[underglaze]] by using natural [[cobalt]] pigment are another example of popular wares of the Joseon period. Many of these items were created by court painters employed by the royal family. During this period, the popular style of landscape paintings is mirrored in the decoration of ceramics.&lt;ref name="BMA"/&gt; Initially developed by the Chinese at the [[Jingdezhen ware|Jingdezhen kilns]] in the mid-14th century, Joseon began to produce this type of porcelain from the 15th century under Chinese influence. The first cobalt imported from China was used by Korean artists. In 1463 when sources of cobalt were discovered in [[Korea]], artists and their buyers found the material was inferior in quality and preferred the more expensive imported cobalt. Korean porcelain with imported cobalt decoration contradict the emphasis of an orderly, frugal and moderate life in [[Neo-Confucianism]].&lt;ref name="BMA"/&gt;

Strikingly different from cobalt, porcelain items with a copper-red [[underglaze]] are the most difficult to successfully craft. During production, these items require great skill and attention or will turn gray during the process of firing. While the birthplace of ceramics with copper red underglaze is widely disputed, these items originated during 12th century in [[Korea]] and became increasingly popular during the second half of the Joseon period. Some experts have pointed to the kilns of Bunwon-ri in [[Gwangju, Gyeonggi]], a city that played a significant role in the production of ceramics during the Joseon period, as a possible birthplace.&lt;ref name="BMA"/&gt;

Porcelain was also decorated with iron. These items commonly consisted of jars or other utilitarian pieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12759">'''José Hernández Delgadillo''' (1927 – December 26, 2000) was a [[List of Mexican artists|Mexican painter and muralist]] best known for carrying on the traditions of [[Mexican muralism]] in the latter 20th century.  He created over 160 murals in Mexico and the United States, with most of his work, especially after 1970, containing strong political messages. Many of these messages have been unpopular in Mexico, which has made the artist somewhat obscure and some of his murals have been destroyed. Hernández Delgadillo’s main recognition is membership in the [[Salón de la Plástica Mexicana]] honor society, but his home state has made effort to rescue and promote his life and work.

==Life==
Hernández Delgadillo was born in [[Tepeapulco]] in the [[Hidalgo (state)|Mexican state of Hidalgo]], the son of a poor rural farm worker.&lt;ref name=bancomer&gt;{{cite book |author=Guillermo Tovar de Teresa |title= Repertory of Artists in Mexico: Plastic and Decorative Arts |volume=II |year=1996  |publisher= Grupo Financiero Bancomer  |location=Mexico City |isbn=968 6258 56 6 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hidgob&gt;{{cite web  |author=Sergio Lozada  |title=José Hernández Delgadillo  |work=Artistas Plásticos  |publisher=Government of Hidalgo state  |location=Mexico 2013  |url=http://www.hidalgo.gob.mx/cultura/jose_hernandez.html  |accessdate=August 2, 2013  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412064519/http://www.hidalgo.gob.mx/cultura/jose_hernandez.html  |archivedate=April 12, 2013  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up working on farms, road construction, in a greenhouse and making furniture.&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt;

In 1945, he traveled to Mexico City and studied painting and architectural drawing at the workshop of Antonio Navarrete Tejero.&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt;&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt; To survive during this time, he made money by creating portraits.&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt;

After the first individual exhibition of his work, he decided to pursue advanced training, attending the [[Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda"]] from 1955 to 1960.&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt;&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt; According to his autobiography, at this time he met [[Pablo O'Higgins]] which inspired him to continue the ideals of Mexican muralism.&lt;ref name=reconocido&gt;{{cite news |author=Miriam Avilés |title=José Hernández Delgadillo, muralista reconocido |publisher=Criterio Hidgalo |location=Pachuca |date=August 6, 2010 |url=http://www.criteriohidalgo.com/notas.asp?id=19989 |accessdate=August 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130802182002/http://www.criteriohidalgo.com/notas.asp?id=19989 |archivedate=August 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his art career, he was also very politically active. He believed that popular organization in neighborhoods, unions and schools was necessary to exert non-violent pressure against the government.&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt; From 1980 to 1983 he wrote a weekly column for the [[Excélsior]] newspaper, which allowed him to write to present an alternate point of view and appear more neutral.&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt; In 1985, he stood for the Partido Mexicano de Trabajadores in the 38th electoral district, covering the Magdalena Contreras area and part of Alvaro Obregon.&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt; He was a pre candidate for president with the PRD in 1987, but the party chose [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]]. The artist then worked for the Cárdenas campaign creating murals.&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt;

Hernández Delgadillo died in 2000, leaving behind his wife, Beatriz Zamora and three children, Beatriz, Myriam and Francisco.&lt;ref name=colma&gt;{{cite news |author=Arturo Jiménez  |title= El arte de José Hernández Delgadillo colma el Salón de la Plástica Mexicana  |publisher= La Jornada  |location=Mexico City |date=April 18, 2009 |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/04/18/cultura/a04n1cul |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hernández Delgadillo’s first exhibition of his easel work was in 1954 in Mexico City. He returned to school afterwards but when he finished his studied, he won recognition at two biennials, the II Bienal Interamericana in Mexico and the II [[Biennale de Paris]] for his expressionistic painting called Hombres (1961). This success earned him a grant to Paris from the French government. From 1963 to 1965 he lived in the country, exhibiting his work in [[Nice]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Le Havre]] and [[Bordeaux]] as well as in the Reflets Gallery in [[Brussels]] and the Biosca Gallery in [[Madrid]].  The [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]  bought one of his works as well.&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt;&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt; He had another important individual exhibition in [[Beverly Hills]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt;

However, most of the artist’s career was dedicated to muralism, creating over 160 of them, twenty of which are on university campuses in Mexico.&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt;&lt;ref name=colma/&gt; His first mural was painted at the Escuela Primaria Belisario Dominguez in 1959.&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt; In 1969, he was named director of arte for the Centro Residencial Morelos, a housing project in Mexico City. He and students created forty murals, the largest of which consists of fifteen floors of abstract panels places among the windows. In the center of the small plaza between the apartment buildings, he created a monument highly critical of the social order, which put his career at risk. In 1973, he created the first of his militant murals. His main support was with student organizations, which invited him to paint in universities, technical schools and teachers’ colleges in various parts of the country. The artist created the designs and usually the students did the actual painting, using simple colors. Many times, the mural was done in a day, with the students using the occasion to also present musical productions, and discussion groups. From 1973 to 1976, he worked on posters which featured large powerful figures in basic colors, based on the designed for murals in also done at this time in Mexico City, [[Toluca]], [[Xalapa]], [[Pachuca]], [[Fresnillo]], [[Zacatepec de Hidalgo]], [[Tepic]] and the teachers’ colleges in [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]].  In 1975 he created a mural in the medical conference center of the former Hacienda de Cortés in [[Cuernavaca]]. He created his first mural in the United States in 1981 in [[San Fernando, California]], sponsored by a [[Chicano]] organization. He returned in 1989 to create several works for the agricultural school of [[University of California, Davis]], a Latino social service organization in [[San José, California|San José]] and the mayor’s office in [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]].  In the 1990s he created one of his major works called El Hombre Nuevo Hacia el Futuro.&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt;

Many of Hernández Delgadillo’s murals are in urgent need of restoration with a number already lost, either due to deterioration or because they were destroyed because of their political messages.&lt;ref name=reconocido/&gt;&lt;ref name=colma/&gt; In 2013 an effort was begun Pachuca to rescue and restore his murals in that city, which include Contradicciones y lucha en Hidalgo at the Jardín del Arte and Por la democracia, el trabajo y la soberanía nacional at the Miguel Alemán primary school.&lt;ref name=reconocido/&gt;&lt;ref name=impulsa&gt;{{cite news |title=Impulsa regidora de Pachuca rescate de murales del artista José Hernández |publisher=El Visto Bueno |location=Pachuca |date=May 13, 2013 |url=http://www.elvistobueno.com.mx/2013/05/13/impulsa-regidora-de-pachuca-rescate-de-murales-del-artista-jose-hernandez/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130802181945/http://www.elvistobueno.com.mx/2013/05/13/impulsa-regidora-de-pachuca-rescate-de-murales-del-artista-jose-hernandez/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2013 |accessdate=August 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other activities during his career include sculpture, receiving commissions between 1959 and 1960, and illustrating medical books in 1963 and 1972. In 1997 he organized the first competition of murals and public art called the Jornada Mundial del Arte Público y Muralismo, at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] .&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt;

His main recognition was membership in the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana (SPM), an honor society for Mexican artists, serving on its executive committee in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt; After his death, the SPM established the José Hernández Delgadillo Prize in categories such as painting, print making, sculpture, photography and art objects and held a retrospective of his work in 2009.&lt;ref name=colma/&gt;&lt;ref name=premio&gt;{{cite web |author=Santra Garcia |title= Se inaugurará imagines para un milenio, Premio José Hernández Delgadillo, in el Salón de la Plástica Mexicana |publisher= La Guirnalda Polar|location=Canada |date=November 2002  |issue=73|url=http://lgpolar.com/page/read/249|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Efrén Rebolledo Cultural Center in Pachuca has a gallery named after him.&lt;ref name=ocho&gt;{{cite news |author=Sergio Lozada  |title= Exhibirán producción artística en Galería José Hernández Delgadillo  |publisher= Milenio  |location=Pachuca |date=June 25, 2013|url=http://hidalgo.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/acb091456f57c914323ad93cfd522307 |accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his work has become obscure, mostly because they espouse unpopular and radical political ideas.&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt;&lt;ref name=reconocido/&gt; There was no biography written about him until 2008, when Hidalgo writer Guillermo Furlong Franco published a book called Muros de Insomnio, about the life and work of the artist. It was sponsored by the Fondo Estatal para la Cultura y las Artes of Hidalgo.&lt;ref name=reconocido/&gt;&lt;ref name=elsol&gt;{{cite news |title= Biografía del muralista José Hernández Delgadillo |publisher= El Sol de Hidalgo |location=Pachuca |date=March 18, 2008  |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n632712.htm|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==
Hernández Delgadillo was an artist and activist in the tradition of [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], with his work more closely related to the second state of Mexican muralism rather than his contemporary [[Generación de la Ruptura]] .&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt;&lt;ref name=reconocido/&gt;&lt;ref name=colma/&gt; This was particularly true after the [[Tlatelolco massacre|1968 student uprising in Mexico]], which inspired the artist to incorporate its ideology to reinvigorate Mexico’s traditions of murals with social and political messages. In 1975, he described himself as one of the few artists still “fighting for Mexico.” He stated that it was “… very risky to do political art now.  You put your subsistence and liberty at stake.”&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt;  He also stated “After 1970, I conceived most of my visual work in line with popular struggles, in books, periodicals, posters, films and murals; this side of my work is predictably ignored by the educated public, and negated and attacked even by critics who purport to be revolutionaries.”&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt;

He worked in oil, acrylics, mixed media, print and poster making and some sculptures in bronze. His style was mostly [[Expressionism|expressionistic]], often denouncing acts of violence.&lt;ref name=colma/&gt; Some murals, such as those done at university campuses rely on simple, basic colors but others more nuanced used of color, such as shades of reds and ochre are used to express anger at social injustices.&lt;ref name=reconocido/&gt;  Justino Fernandez wrote “In the works of Hernández Delgadillo, we find a definite sense of the monumental and certain underlying classicism combined with personal expressionism. This may seem contradictory, but is not, thanks to the synthesis to which he brings both tendencies.”&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt;  “His giants – images of men and women, entire or fragmented nudes with extraordinarily expressive heads large or small, their features barely insinuated, their eyes tiny – betray his humanist leanings.”&lt;ref name=bancomer/&gt; Similar to the artists of the Mexican muralism movement, he used indigenous cultural expression to highlight the country’s heritage, its abilities as well as how it has been exploited. Many of his figures have a primeval quality, as if they sprang from the earth.&lt;ref name=hidgob/&gt;

'''Juan Francisco González Escobar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portaldearte.cl/autores/gonzalez.htm |title=Juan Francisco González |publisher=Portaldearte.cl |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Santiago]], [[Chile]], September 25, 1853 &amp;ndash; Santiago, March 4, 1933) is known as one of the four [[Chilean art#The Great Chilean Masters|Great Chilean Masters]] and as the archetypal romantic bohemian artist of the early 20th century. He was the most prolific of the Chilean masters, leaving an estimated 4,000 works, and was also notable for being one of Chile’s first [[Modern art|modern]] painters. He was seen as a symbol of the new creative generation that appeared in 20th century Chile, with a style highly influenced by impressionism and local elements.

Right from the beginning, González worked in a free and flexible manner and did not stick rigidly to any particular techniques, giving him space to express his lively and restless personality. He took his attitude towards art as an attitude towards life and was considered by his successors as great example to follow.

As a master, González used to tell his students that to be a good painter, “first you must learn to observe and get excited about the colours and forms of nature, regardless of whether the picture and its details are accurate reflection of reality or not.”

==Biography==
Juan Francisco González,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl/biografia.aspx?itmid=323 |title=APCh www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl |publisher=Artistasplasticoschilenos.cl |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vamosviendo.cl/files/prologo-.pdf|publisher=Vamosviendo.cl|author=Isabel Cruz de Amenábar|title=Biography|language=es|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; son of José González and Mercedes Escobar, grew up in [[Recoleta, Chile|Recoleta]], a neighborhood of [[Santiago]] that runs along the side of [[Cerro Blanco]] hill, where his family ran a business importing goods from [[Ecuador]]. As a child, his parents enrolled him in art classes with Chilean artist Manuel Tapia and when he was 14, by a strange twist of fate, he met [[Pedro Lira]], who would become another of the four Chilean masters. Lira, seeing that the boy had a bright future, recommended that he continue his career at the [[Chilean art#Chilean Academy of Painting|Chilean Academy of Painting]]. In 1869, aged 16, he entered the Academy, and was taught by the painters [[Ernesto Kirchbach]] and [[Juan Mochi]].
 
[[File:Carrera por J.F.Gonzalez.jpg|thumb|left|"Los Últimos momentos del General [[José Miguel Carrera]]” (The last moments of General José Miguel Carrera]]
González’ style was initially quite similar to that of his teachers, but his work progressed during a trip to Europe. His visits to [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[England]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] instilled in him a much more modern style of art than the traditional techniques he had learned in Chile. It was in [[France]] where he discovered [[Impressionism]], a movement he identified with very much. He incorporated many elements of Impressions into his own style, such as the focus on capturing light and an appreciation for landscape and for small canvases. On his return to Chile in 1906, his name started to become well-known after giving a lecture at the [[University of Chile]] and was appointed as a lecturer at the Academy of painting, teaching sketching and freehand drawing.

[[File:Retrato de Augusto d'Halmar.jpg|thumb| Augusto d'Halmar portrait]]
After leaving his teaching job, he dedicated himself to painting again and began capturing the flowers and fruits of Chile using secure and calm brushstrokes, thick acrylic paint and rough textures that are characteristic of his work. Although some of his paintings are very small, González’ ability to communicate tastes and smells to the viewer is remarkable. He won several awards in Chile, including third prize at the 1884 Salón de Santiago exhibition, second prize at the 1890 Salón Oficial exhibition and first prize at the 1900 Salón Oficial.

González constantly sought freer expression through his painting, investigating and experimenting with his painting materials to achieve, for example, a transparency in [[oil paint]] that made it look similar to [[watercolor painting|watercolor]]. His skillful execution and sensitivity to atmosphere placed him alongside the community of young artists who revolutionized visual arts in 19th century [[Paris]]. His favorite subjects included peasants, [[adobe]] houses and flowers, handling with skill the movement and color of flowers, and his youthful spirit always kept him current. His most famous quotations include:

“Grace is not in truth itself, but in the personal expression of it. To draw is to express, drawing is like writing, so one should write as one thinks”.
“Unlike the scientific method, which proceeds by analysis, art proceeds by synthesis”.
“You must look quickly and with the eyes of the soul and heart”.

[[File:"Carretelas en la Vega".jpg|thumb|left|"Carretelas en la Vega"]]
 
The influence of González can be seen in the “[[Chilean art#The 13 Generation|Tragic Generation]]”, better known as the [[Generación del 13]], and the controversial “[[Chilean art#The Montparnasse Group|Montparnasse Group]]”. He himself was part of the literature group "Los Diez" (The Ten), who tried to live by balancing aesthetics and ethics, creative spirit and art, a philosophy which González maintained even after the group dissolved.

González died on March 4, 1933, and is considered to have changed the course of Chilean painting. Isabel Cruz González called him “the first modern Chilean painter” and said that “he left a mark like none other of his contemporaries, capturing on canvas the essence of Chilean popular life.” Throughout his career, until the day he died, he aimed for the maximum effect on the canvas, minimising and simplifying the themes, a characteristic that can be observed from his early landscapes to the still lifes he produced at the end of his life.

'''''Just Like Heaven''''' is a 2005 American [[romantic comedy]] [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Mark Waters (director)|Mark Waters]], starring [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], and [[Jon Heder]]. It is based on the French novel ''[[If Only It Were True]]'' (''Et si c'était vrai...'') written by [[Marc Levy]].

[[Steven Spielberg]] obtained the rights to produce the film from the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386887.If_Only_It_Were_True | title = If Only It Were True (Et si c'était vrai #1) | publisher =  Goodreads Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the United States and Canada on September 16, 2005.

==Plot==
Elizabeth Masterson (Witherspoon), a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott (Ruffalo), a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful [[Wiktionary:happenstance#English|happenstance]].

Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with [[ghost]]ly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself.

David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital.
 
Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl (Heder), Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a [[coma]], her body being kept on [[life support]] at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her [[living will]], she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves. One of Elizabeth's young nieces is revealed to be able to sense her presence as well.

Abby thinks David is mentally disturbed and drives him out of her house. Desperate, David decides to prevent Elizabeth's death by stealing her from the hospital. He asks his friend/therapist Jack to help him, and Jack is found to be actually Abby's former college boyfriend, who had set up a blind date for David with Elizabeth on the night of the accident - the reason David can see Elizabeth is that they were meant to meet. He then admits to Jack and Elizabeth that he loves her and that is the reason he does not want her to die; he has gotten past the death of his wife. While stealing Elizabeth, they are quickly discovered in the hospital. The security guards find them, pulling Jack away from Elizabeth, but when he is grabbed, her breathing tube is removed. David gets away from the guards a bit longer, but Elizabeth is now dying. David frantically kisses the dying Elizabeth, breathing some air into her lungs, while her spirit begins to fade away. Then, amazingly, her heartbeat returns and she miraculously awakens from the coma. However, the recovered Elizabeth does not remember anything that happened during the coma or any of the events with David, who leaves the hospital in sadness.

Sometime later, Elizabeth goes back to her apartment. She is drawn up to the roof of the building, which has been transformed into a beautiful landscaped garden. She finds David there, who has gotten in with a spare key Elizabeth's spirit had shown him. Just as he is about to leave, she asks for her key back. When their hands touch, her memory of the events during her coma are restored, and they kiss.

==Critical reception==
Critics were mixed on the film. The film achieved a 56% approval rating from 149 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and the consensus "Delightfully sweet like a lollipop, ''Just Like Heaven'' is a dreamy romantic comedy that may give you a toothache when it attempts to broach difficult end of life issues by throwing a cherry on top."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/just_like_heaven/|title=Just Like Heaven (2005)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most prominent critics – such as [[Roger Ebert]], [[Richard Roeper]], and [[A. O. Scott]] – gave it favorable reviews;&lt;ref name="RT"/&gt; they all agreed that the plot had logical flaws that were somewhat overcome by good dialogue and characterization.

The performances of Witherspoon, Ruffalo, and Heder were all generally well received. Heder's appearance helped to debunk an urban legend that the actor had died shortly after filming ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/heder.asp|title=Napoleon Die-namite | publisher=[[Snopes.com]]|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DVD release in February 2006 was given unusually strong promotional publicity.

==Theme song==
The title of this film is also that of a popular 1987 song, "[[Just Like Heaven (song)|Just Like Heaven]]" by [[The Cure]]. Singer [[Katie Melua]] recorded a cover version of the song for the soundtrack of the film. Melua's version is played over the opening titles, and has lines such as "she said" changed to "he said" to maintain a heterosexual narrative. The original version by The Cure, as well as the remainder of Melua's version, are played over the closing credits.

The orchestral score was written by [[Rolfe Kent]], and orchestrated by [[Tony Blondal]].

The text says, "''Let the whole Party mobilize its membership to practice agriculture on a large scale; let them fight to popularize Dazhai County (''sic'')!''"]] --&gt;
The "'''Learn from Dazhai in agriculture'''" Campaign ({{zh|c={{linktext|农业|学|大寨}}|p=nóngyè xué Dàzhài}}, or in [[Wade-Giles]] [[Romanization]] '''Tachai''') was a campaign organized by [[Mao Zedong]] in 1963. The campaign encouraged peasants from all over China to follow from the example of the farmers of [[Dazhai]] village, [[Shanxi]], by practicing self-sacrifice and upright political activity.

It grew in importance after the introduction of the [[Cultural Revolution]], but [[Chen Yonggui]] and its other proponents were eventually eased out of power by [[Deng Xiaoping]] following the removal of the [[Gang of Four]].

==History==

Slogans associated with Dazhai included: "Move the mountains to make farm fields," "Change the sky and alter the land," "Work bitterly, diligently, and with extra energy, and build our village into a Dazhai-like one in three years."

During the years until the downfall of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976, particularly the [[Cultural Revolution]], farmers from all over the country were organized to visit Dazhai, and well-trained tour guides took posts at important scenes to explain to visitors how the villagers in Daizhai made such achievements with their own hands. One of such scenes was the top of the [[Tiger Head Mountain]] where visitors could have a panoramic view of the farm fields, the major irrigation projects as well as the residential area of the villagers. Perhaps hundreds of millions of farmers visited the place during the period and the expenses on their trips were paid{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} by the government.

At this time, farmers throughout China were expected to show their political zeal in following [[Mao Zedong]]'s directive "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture" ("农业|学大寨"). They not only worked during the day, but at night as well, not only in the warm season, but in the depth of winter—a dramatic deviation from their age-old practice. In many places, the farmers literally—and blindly—moved hills (sometimes proclaimed as "mountains"), built reservoirs, tunnels, canals, and so on. As mental motivation, loud speakers were installed at work sites to broadcast music and songs and films were shown at night on the scene while the farmers took a break. 

Meanwhile, a number of leaders of the village made dramatic advances in their political careers. [[Chen Yonggui]], the patriarchal leader of the village, was put to the position of [[vice premier]] of the central government despite the fact that he was only semiliterate. ([[Zhou Enlai]] was the [[premier]] of the time.) [[Guo Fenglian]], the Dazhai [[party secretary]], was a favorite of [[Jiang Qing]] (the wife of [[Mao Zedong]]), and played a significant part in the Chinese political scene.

This campaign was as much political as it was agricultural, and it came to an abrupt end upon Mao's death in 1976.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} After the victory of [[Deng Xiaoping]] over [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Chen Yonggui]], and others following the removal of the [[Gang of Four]] from power, his [[economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] has caused Dazhai to become a figure of ridicule, since it was so closely linked to Maoist communal agriculture and socialist propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/0927/dazhai.html TIMEasia.com | Visions of China: Dazhai | 9/27/99&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacu.org/learntachai.html Learn from Dazhai&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Dazhai is a regional tourist attraction.

'''''Restless Natives''''' is a 1985 [[Scotland|Scottish]] cinema adventure comedy, directed by [[Michael Hoffman (American director)|Michael Hoffman]]. 

==Plot==
The story follows the adventures of two Scottish youths from the [[Wester Hailes]] district of [[Edinburgh]], played by [[Vincent Friell]] and [[Joe Mullaney (actor)|Joe Mullaney]], who, in rebellion to their drab lives in urban Scotland in the mid-1980's become modern [[highwayman|highwaymen]]. Donning masks of a clown and a wolf-man and riding a [[Honda CG125]] motorbike, for a joke they waylay and hold up with a toy gun tourist coaches in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], in the process becoming a tourist attraction themselves. Having inadvertently acquired substantial amounts of money, they proceed to become modern [[Robin Hood|Robin Hoods]], doling it out to the poor of their city by scattering it on bike rides through its streets, attracting national media attention and pursuit by the police.&lt;ref&gt;'Our Top 10 Most Scottish Films, #7 Restless Natives,' 'The Scots Magazine', 4 March 2015. https://www.scotsmagazine.com/articles//top-10-scottish-films-number-7/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Comical strivings in Restless Natives', 'The New York Times;, 12 September 1986. https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/movies/film-comical-strivings-in-restless-natives.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
'Restless Natives' - as suggested by its title - has underlying themes beyond its superficial presentation as a light social comedy film.  It was produced at a time of high unemployment in the [[United Kingdom]], with Scotland being particularly affected by post-industrial economic blight, and being governed from London by an Anglocentric radical [[Thatcherism|political order]] that the Scottish people had collectively electorally rejected in the recent [[1983 United Kingdom general election]]. The main storyline's premise reflected the frustration of mid-1980's Scottish working class youth, with limited life chances and economic prospects at home, breaking free of their constraint in the dispiriting confines of a grim cityscape of mid-20th Century [[Brutalist]] urban architecture, using the freedom facilitated by a motorcycle (in a tacit reference to a recent admonition from a [[Norman Tebbit|British Government Minister]] to the millions of unemployed in the country to "get on their bikes" to find elusive jobs)&lt;ref&gt;;Restless Natives' trailer, published on Youtube, 26 August 2014. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM9rUC18JFs&lt;/ref&gt; to escape into revitalizing open vistas of the landscape of the Scottish Highlands. The production was a part of a group of small-budget cinematic productions, along with titles such as [[Gregory's Girl]] (1981), [[Local Hero]] (1983), that brought stories of contemporary life in Scotland to a global cinema audience. The film was a commercial success on release in Scotland and acquired cult status, being regarded as a homemade expression of local Scottish cultural pride, becoming a minor media source of insurgent Scottish cultural identity, subliminally juxtaposed to [[Britishness]], and feeding into the developing proto-[[Scottish Nationalist]] movement in the arts, with its soaring distinctive soundtrack from the band [[Big Country (band)|Big Country]], whose music dealt with the same themes.&lt;ref&gt;'Cult Movie Column - Restless Natives', 'The Skinny' magazine, 15 July 2006. https://www.theskinny.co.uk/film/opinion/cult-movie-column-restless-natives&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music score==
The soundtrack features music from the band [[Big Country]]. This music was not released on an album but was combined into two lengthy tracks, each featuring various pieces of music and clips of actors from the film's audio, which appeared on limited edition formats of two Big Country 12" singles. It was released on CD for the first time on the 1998 Big Country collection 'Restless Natives &amp; Rarities', where it is presented as a single 35-minute track.

==Production==
The screenplay won a film script writing competition held by [[Lloyds Bank]] before it was optioned for production.&lt;ref&gt;'Cult Movie Column - Restless Natives', 'The Skinny' magazine, 15 July 2006. https://www.theskinny.co.uk/film/opinion/cult-movie-column-restless-natives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'On the side of the Angels', Malcolm, Derek. The Guardian 27 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film performed well at the box office in Scotland, but commercially failed in other markets.&lt;ref name="icon"/&gt;

'''Robert Studley Forrest Hughes''' [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]] (28 July 1938{{spaced ndash}}6 August 2012) was an Australian-born [[art critic]], writer, and producer of [[television documentary|television documentaries]]. His best seller ''[[The Fatal Shore]]'' (1986) is a study of the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] and [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|early history of Australia]]. He was described in 1997 by Robert Boynton of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the most famous art critic in the world."&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=6 August 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/arts/robert-hughes-art-critic-whose-writing-was-elegant-and-contentious-dies-at-74.html?pagewanted=all|title=Robert Hughes, Art Critic Whose Writing Was Elegant and Contentious, Dies at 74|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes earned widespread recognition for his book and television series on [[modern art]], ''[[The Shock of the New]]'', and for his longstanding position as art critic with ''[[TIME]]'' magazine. Known for his contentious critiques of art and artists, Hughes was generally conservative in his tastes, although he did not belong to a particular philosophical camp. His writing was noted for its power and elegance.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt;

==Early life==
Hughes was born in [[Sydney]], Australia, in 1938. His father and paternal grandfather were lawyers. Hughes's father, [[Geoffrey Forrest Hughes]], was a pilot in the [[First World War]], with later careers as a solicitor and company director. He died from lung cancer when Robert was aged 12.&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt; His mother was Margaret Eyre Sealy, née Vidal. His older brother was Australian politician [[Tom Hughes (Australian politician)|Thomas Eyre Forrest Hughes]],&lt;ref name=duggan/&gt; and the uncle of former Sydney Lord Mayor [[Lucy Turnbull]], the wife of Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]]. He had another brother Geoffrey and one sister, Constance.

Growing up in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay, Sydney]],&lt;ref name="Carey 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/robert-hughes-by-peter-carey|title='Robert Hughes was Australia's Dante,' says his friend Peter Carey|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was educated at [[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview]] before studying arts and then architecture at the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref name="The Australian obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012"/&gt; At university, he associated with the [[Sydney Push|Sydney "Push"]] – a group of artists, writers, intellectuals and drinkers. Among the group were [[Germaine Greer]] and [[Clive James]].&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=1532|title=The Lives of Robert Hughes|last=Boynton|first=Robert S.|date=12 May 1997|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==

=== As an art critic ===
Hughes, an aspiring artist and poet, abandoned his university endeavours to become first a cartoonist and then an art critic for the Sydney periodical ''[[The Bulletin|The Observer]]'', edited by [[Donald Horne]].&lt;ref name="Australian Book Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Current/Rose%20review.htm|title=Up On Stilts|last=Rose|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Rose (poet)|work=[[Australian Book Review]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022081732/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Current/Rose%20review.htm|archivedate=22 October 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was briefly involved in the original Sydney version of [[Oz (magazine)|''Oz'' magazine]] and wrote art criticism for ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[Sunday Mirror|The Sunday Mirror]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Hughes left Australia for Europe in 1964, living for a time in Italy before settling in London in 1965,&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt; where he wrote for ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and ''The Observer'', among others, and contributed to the London version of ''Oz''. In 1970 he was appointed art critic for ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine and moved to New York, where he soon became an influential voice.&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012" /&gt;

In 1966 Hughes published a history of [[Australian painting]] titled ''The Art of Australia'', still considered an important work.&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt; 

Hughes co-produced, in association with German producer Reiner Moritz and Lorna Pegram, the BBC eight-part series ''[[The Shock of the New]]'' (1980) on the development of [[modern art]] since the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]]. It was accompanied by a book with the same title. John O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Agree or disagree, you will not be bored. Mr. Hughes has a disarming way of being provocative."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/11/arts/tv-view-a-provocative-new-series-on-modern-art-by-john-o-connor.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Provocative New Series on Modern Art|last=O'Connor|first=John|date=11 January 1981|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a journalist and historian ===
Hughes and [[Harold Hayes]] were recruited in 1978 to anchor the new [[ABC News]] (US) [[newsmagazine]] ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]''. His only broadcast, on 6 June 1978, proved so controversial that, less than a week later, ABC News president [[Roone Arledge]] terminated the contracts of both men, replacing them with veteran TV host [[Hugh Downs]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt;

Hughes's book ''[[The Fatal Shore]]'' followed in 1987. A study of the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] and [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|early European settlement of Australia]], it became an international best-seller.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt; During the late 1990s, Hughes was a prominent supporter of the [[Australian Republican Movement]].&lt;ref name="BBC obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19158897|title=Australian art critic Robert Hughes dies, aged 74|publisher=BBC News|date=14 April 2003|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore'' (2000) was a series musing on modern Australia and Hughes's relationship with it. During production, Hughes was involved in a near-fatal road accident.&lt;ref name="Rothenberg 1999" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Hughes met his first wife, Danne Emerson, in London in 1967. Together they became involved in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], exploring drug use and sexual freedom.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maunder 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/robert-hughes-turned-criticism-into-an-art-20120807-23r1m.html|title=Robert Hughes turned criticism into an art|last=Maunder|first=Patricia|date=7 August 2012|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1981; she died of a brain tumor in 2003.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Things 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Robert|title=Things I Didn't Know: A Memoir|year=2006|publisher=[[Alfred A.

He had been in a long term relationship with fashion designer [[Jenny Kee]], who found his body on 15 April. Robert Hughes later wrote: "I miss Danton and always will, although we had been miserably estranged for years and the pain of his loss has been somewhat blunted by the passage of time".&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robert-hughes-forthright-critic-who-transformed-the-public-perception-of-modern-art-8015623.html|title=Robert Hughes: Forthright critic who transformed the public perception of modern art|last=Williamson|first=Marcus| authorlink =  Marcus Williamson|date=8 August 2012|work=The Independent|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes was married to his second wife, Victoria Whistler, a housewife from California, from 1981 until a divorce in 1996.&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012" /&gt;

In 1999, Hughes was involved in a near-fatal car accident south of [[Broome, Western Australia]]. He was returning from a fishing trip and driving on the wrong side of the road when he collided head on with another car carrying three occupants. He was trapped in the car for three hours before being airlifted to [[Perth]] in critical condition.&lt;ref name="Rothenberg 1999"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jackie|last=Rothenberg|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/art_critic_robert_hughes_seriously_YKMdoMNtlTcPQn04m1t6MO|title=Art Critic Robert Hughes Seriously Hurt In Crash|publisher=NYPOST.com|date=30 May 1999|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was in a coma for five weeks after the crash.&lt;ref name="BBC News April 2003"/&gt; In a 2000 court hearing, Hughes's defence barrister alleged that the occupants of the other car had been transporting illicit drugs at the time of the accident and were at fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jackie|last= Rothenberg|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/drug_link_eyed_for_men_who_struck_Iol2L0hHTHI4j3LAA7e7sO|title=Drug Link Eyed For Men Who Struck Hughes's Car| publisher=NYPOST.com|date=6 June 1999|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Hughes pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing bodily harm and was fined A$2,500.&lt;ref name="BBC News April 2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/2946409.stm|title=Art critic admits crash guilt|date=14 April 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also allegedly described the crown prosecutor, [[Lloyd Rayney]], as a "curry muncher", which resulted in a [[defamation]] action and out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref name=duggan&gt;Duggan, Paul.

In 2001, Hughes wed his third wife, the American artist and [[art director]] [[Doris Downes]]. "Apart from being a talented painter, she saved my life, my emotional stability, such as it is", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/11/09/Floridian/The_art_of_conversati.shtml|title=The art of conversation|work=St. Petersburg Times Floridian|date=9 November 2003|last=Bennett|first=Lennie|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After a long illness, Hughes died at [[Calvary Hospital, Bronx|Calvary Hospital]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City|New York]], on 6 August 2012, with his wife at his bedside. He was also survived by two stepsons from his wife's previous marriage, Freeborn Garrettson Jewett IV and Fielder Douglas Jewett; his brothers, Tom and Geoffrey Hughes; a sister, Mrs. Constance Crisp; and many nieces and nephews.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;

==Assessment==
When ''The Shock of the New'' was proposed to the BBC, television programmers were skeptical that a [[journalist]] could properly follow the aristocratic tone of [[Kenneth Clark]], whose ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' had been so successful.&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=McNay|first=Michael|date=6 August 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/robert-hughes|title=Robert Hughes obituary|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Shock of the New'' proved to be a popular and critical success: it has been assessed "much the best synoptic introduction to modern art ever written", taking as its premise the vitality gained by modern art when it ceded the need to replicate nature in favor of a more direct expression of human experience and emotion.&lt;ref name="Gopnik 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopnik|first=Adam|date=7 August 2012|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/08/postscript-robert-hughes.html|title=Postscript: Robert Hughes|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' explanations of modern art benefited from the coherence of his judgments, and were marked by his ability to summarise the essential qualities of his subject.&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;

Whether positive or negative, his judgments were enthusiastic. He championed London painters like [[Frank Auerbach]] and [[Lucian Freud]], helping to popularise the latter in the United States, and wrote with unabashed admiration for [[Francisco Goya]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lacayo|first=Richard|date=7 August 2012|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/07/the-art-of-being-critical-robert-hughes-1938-2012/|title=The Art of Being Critical: Robert Hughes (1938–2012)|work=Time magazine|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast Hughes was dismissive of much [[postmodernism]] and [[neo-expressionism]], as well as the vicissitudes of a money-fueled art market.&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012" /&gt; While his reviews expressed [[antipathy]] for the [[avant-garde]], he was beholden neither to any theory nor ideology, and managed to provoke both ends of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodward|first1=Richard B.|title=The Most Feared Art Critic of His Time?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443537404577577300626558944|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=28 February 2017|date=8 August 2012|quote=Robert Hughes, who died on Monday at the age of 74, leaves behind many admirers but few followers. The most feared art critic of his time, as learned as he was readable, he cultivated no acolytes who aped his opinions and verbal mannerisms, as did Clement Greenberg and Pauline Kael, critics of equal stature. Despite his professorial air, Hughes spurned academia and it has responded in kind.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distrusted novelty in art for its own sake, yet he was also disdainful of a conservative aesthetic that avoided risk. Hughes, according to [[Adam Gopnik]], was drawn to work that was rough-hewn, "craft attempted with passion."&lt;ref name="Gopnik 2012"/&gt;

Hughes's critical prose, vivid in both praise and indignation, has been compared to that of [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref name="Gopnik 2012"/&gt; [[Jonathan Swift]]&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"/&gt; and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"/&gt; "His prose", according to a colleague, "was lithe, muscular and fast as a bunch of fives. He was incapable of writing the jargon of the art world, and consequently was treated by its mandarins with fear and loathing."&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt; In different moods he could write that "[[Julian Schnabel|Schnabel’s]] work is to painting what [[Sylvester Stallone|Stallone’s]] is to acting: a lurching display of oily pectorals,"&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"/&gt; as well as conclude that [[Antoine Watteau]] "was a connoisseur of the unplucked string, the immobility before the dance, the moment that falls between departure and nostalgia."&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;

'''''Saint Jerome Writing''''', also called '''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' or simply '''''Saint Jerome''''', is an [[oil painting]] by [[Italians|Italian]] painter [[Caravaggio]]. Generally dated to 1605-1606, the painting is located in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in [[Rome]].

==Composition==
The painting depicts [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]], a [[Doctor of the Church]] in [[Roman Catholicism]] and a popular subject for painting, even for Caravaggio, who produced other paintings of Jerome [[Saint Jerome in Meditation (Caravaggio)|in Meditation]] and [[Saint Jerome Writing (Valletta)|engaged in writing]]. In this image, Jerome is reading intently, an outstretched arm resting with quill. It has been suggested that Jerome is depicted in the act of translating the ''Vulgate''.&lt;ref name="Bussagli2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bussagli|first=Marco|title=Italian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80DpE2Y-xlAC&amp;pg=PA346|accessdate=28 June 2010|date=April 2009|publisher=Giunti Editore Firenze Italy|isbn=978-88-09-03726-7|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is generally dated to 1605-1606, largely on the statements of 17th-century art historical biographer [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], though [[Denis Mahon]] suggests 1602-1604.&lt;ref name="GilbertCaravaggio1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton|title=Caravaggio and His Two Cardinals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WSH4BabKuUC&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=1995|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-01312-1|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibbard1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAvz9G4DhdkC&amp;pg=PA320|accessdate=28 June 2010|date=5 March 1985|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-06-430128-2|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorenoStefani2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moreno|first1=Paolo|author2=Chiara Stefani|title=The Borghese Gallery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ce2Fg7FIvFgC&amp;pg=PA192|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2000|publisher=Touring Editore|isbn=978-88-365-1946-0|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bellori, Caravaggio produced the piece at the behest of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Scipione Borghese]],&lt;ref name="BelloriWohl2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellori|first1=Giovanni Pietro|authorlink1=Giovanni Pietro Bellori|translator=Hellmut Wohl|title=The lives of the modern painters, sculptors and architects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78187-9|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a cardinal in 1605, but it is possible that Borghese acquired it later as it is not mentioned in a 1613 poem by [[Scipione Francucci]] that described the [[Borghese Collection|Borghese Caravaggio collection]].&lt;ref name="GilbertCaravaggio1995"/&gt; Whether or not the dating is accurate, the work is believed to have originated from Caravaggio's late Roman period,&lt;ref name="CaravaggioPomella2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomella|first=Andrea|title=Caravaggio: An Artist through Images|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDH4lOa8qRgC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=ATS Italia Editrice|isbn=978-88-88536-62-0|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ended with the painter's exile to [[Malta]] in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard (1985), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

That ''Saint Jerome Writing'' is the work of Caravaggio is sometimes brought into question, as it was attributed to [[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]] in the Borghese inventories from 1700 until 1893.&lt;ref name="Hibbard1985"/&gt;

'''''Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird''''' (''Autorretrato con Collar de Espinas'') is a 1940 painting by Mexican painter [[Frida Kahlo]].

Kahlo painted the self-portrait after her divorce from [[Diego Rivera]] and the end of her affair with photographer [[Nickolas Muray]]. Muray bought the portrait shortly after it was painted, and it is currently part of the Nickolas Muray collection at the Harry Ransom Center at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ditrich, "Self-portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Frida Kahlo]] was a Mexican painter active between 1925 and 1954. She began painting while bedridden due to a bus accident that left her seriously disabled. Most of her work consists of self-portraits, which deal directly with her struggle with medical issues, infertility, and her troubled marriage to Rivera. Painting self-portraits was therapeutic, allowing Kahlo to create a separate Frida on which to project her anguish and pain.&lt;ref name="Herrera"&gt;Herrera, “Kahlo, Frida".&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have interpreted her self portraits as a way for Kahlo to reclaim her body from medical issues and gender conformity. In particular, scholars have interpreted her self-portraits in the context of the tradition of male European artists using the female body as the subject of their paintings and an object of desire.&lt;ref&gt;Udall, “Frida Kahlo’s Mexican Body,” 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo, using her own image, reclaims this use from the patriarchal tradition. The autobiographical details of her life found in these works as well as her characteristic brows, elaborate hair, and vibrant Mexican clothing has made her a popular figure in Mexico and the United States.

Kahlo was a big supporter of the [[Mexican Revolution]], so much so that she attempted to change her birth date to correspond with the beginning of the Revolution in 1910.&lt;ref name="Herrera"/&gt; At the onset of this movement, a so-called “cult of Mexican femininity” gained popularity, which Jolie Olcott describes as “selflessness, martyrdom, self-sacrifice, an erasure of self and the negation of one’s outward existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Pankl and Blake, “Made in Her Image,” 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In rejection of this limited conception of femininity, Kahlo fashioned herself as a Mexican counterpart to the [[flapper]]s of the United States and Europe in the 1920s. Later, inspired by Rivera’s concept of [[Mexicanidad]], a passionate identification with Mexican pre-Hispanic indigenous roots, she donned the identity of the [[Tehuana]] woman.&lt;ref name="Herrera"/&gt; The Tehuana had a great deal of equality with their male [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] counterparts and represented strength, sensuality, and exoticism.&lt;ref name="PanklBlake8"&gt;Pankl and Blake, “Made in Her Image,” 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual analysis==
This rather small painting (approximately 24” x 18”), shows Kahlo in a frontal position and directly confronting the viewer’s gaze from the canvas. Her bold eyebrows hold the emphasis on her face, as a thorn necklace strangles her throat, trailing down her chest like the roots of a tree. A small black hummingbird with its wings outstretched hangs like a pendant from her throat. She is surrounded by insects and animals, setting the scene of a lush, but suffocatingly dense jungle. A monkey sits behind her right shoulder, its eyes focused on its hands, tugging at the thorn necklace, causing Kahlo to bleed. Above her head, two dragonflies float in mid-air, above two butterfly clips nesting in the elaborate hairstyle that crowns her head. A black panther with striking ice blue eyes peers over her left shoulder watching.

==Symbolism==
Kahlo’s identification with indigenous Mexican culture greatly affected her painting aesthetic. By using powerful iconography from indigenous Mexican culture, Kahlo situates herself in a tradition of rebellion against colonial forces and male rule.&lt;ref name="PanklBlake8"/&gt; The dead hummingbird which hangs around her neck is considered a good luck charm for falling in love in Mexican folklore.&lt;ref name="FuentesKahlo78"/&gt; An alternate interpretation is that the hummingbird pendant is a symbol of [[Huitzilopochtli]], the [[Aztec]] god of war.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, “Her Dress Hangs Here,” 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the black panther is symbolic of bad luck and death and the monkey is a symbol of evil.&lt;ref name="FuentesKahlo78"&gt;Fuentes and Kahlo, The Diary of Frida Kahlo,” 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape, which normally symbolizes fertility, contrasts with the deathly imagery in the foreground. Rivera gave Kahlo a [[spider monkey]] as a gift, thus suggesting that it could be a symbol of Rivera, especially since he inflicts pain upon Kahlo by tugging the thorn necklace hard enough to make her bleed.&lt;ref name="FuentesKahlo78"/&gt; Alternately, the thorn necklace could allude to Christ’s crown of thorns, thus likening herself to a Christian martyr, and representing the pain and anguish she felt after her failed romantic relationships. In line with this interpretation, the butterflies and dragonflies could symbolize her resurrection.&lt;ref name="PanklBlake8"/&gt;

The '''''Symphony in D Major, Op. 3, No. 2''''' is a Mannheim symphony by [[Johann Stamitz]], written sometime from 1750 to 1754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes to Johann Stamitz Symphonies Vol. 1 on Naxos|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553294&amp;catNum=553194&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a   4-movement symphonic scheme:
#Presto
#Andantino
#Menuetto
#Prestissimo
This symphony, just like the others by Stamitz, definitely influenced [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Mozart]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}  It is about 10 minutes long.

The film stars [[Chloë Grace Moretz]], [[Nick Robinson (American actor)|Nick Robinson]], [[Ron Livingston]], [[Maggie Siff]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Maika Monroe]], and [[Liev Schreiber]].

Development began in March 2012, when [[Columbia Pictures|Sony]] picked up the film rights to [[The 5th Wave (series)|the trilogy of novels]], with [[Graham King]]'s production company [[GK Films]] and [[Tobey Maguire]]'s Material Pictures. Filming took place in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] from October 2014 to January 2015. ''The 5th Wave'' was released on January 22, 2016, in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]].

==Plot==
&lt;!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words long.--&gt;
Ohio high-schooler [[Cassie Sullivan]], armed with an [[M4 carbine]], emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned [[gas station]]. Upon entering, she hears a male voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they each put their weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him. He was holding a [[Christian cross]] and the screen cuts to black to show her [[backstory]].

A city-sized alien spaceship is circling Earth, containing extraterrestrials referred to as "The Others". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that permanently destroys all electrical power. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate&lt;!--- the method is not explained in the film, but in the novel --&gt; the planet's geology and fault lines, causing [[earthquakes]] and [[megatsunamis]] that destroy coastal cities and islands. For the 3rd Wave, The Others weaponize a strain of [[Avian influenza|avian flu virus]], with birds carrying the infectant across the planet. Cassie's mother is one of the casualties.

Cassie, her father and her younger brother Sam, find a summer camp in use as a refuge in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an Army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The unit's commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 4th Wave and they will take the children to safety at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the Army massacring all the adults, her father included.

Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by an unseen shooter and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a young man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.

At the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind.

Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base.  Ben's squad is reunited and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 15% based on 131 reviews and an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "With unimpressive effects and plot points seemingly pieced together from previous dystopian YA sci-fi films, ''The 5th Wave'' ends up feeling like more of a limp, derivative wriggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_fifth_wave/ |title= The 5th Wave (2016) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 33 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-5th-wave |title=The 5th Wave reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/box-office-dirty-grandpa-the-5th-wave-the-boy-during-storm-jonas-1201688827/ |title=‘The Revenant’ No. 1, ‘Ride Along’ Skids On Ice |work=deadline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey M. Anderson of ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' said of the film, "Every plot turn and every line of dialogue has been borrowed from somewhere else, and everything is utterly, totally predictable", noting how the film "steals material from (but does not stop at) the ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|Hunger Games]]'' and ''[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]'' franchises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jeffrey M.|title=‘5th Wave’ slogs through ridiculous, predictable plot|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/5th-wave-slogs-through-ridiculous-predictable-plot/|accessdate=26 June 2017|work=The San Francisco Examiner|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' faulted the film as a "marketing wheeze dressed up as an art form, and stupendously summarized by the image of Cassie hurrying through the woods carrying both an assault rifle and a [[Teddy bear]]", adding that the film "appears to have been designed by some crazed [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] wing of the [[National Rifle Association|N.R.A.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lane|first1=Anthony|title=The Current Cinema - Tough Girls: "Jane Got A Gun" and "The Fifth Wave"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/01/tough-girls|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Vaux of the Sci-Fi Movie Page gave the film one star out of five, saying, "The YA adaptation craze hits a low point with this aimless, purposeless alien invasion story that wastes a fine cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifimoviepage.com/the-5th-wave-movie-review/|title=The 5th Wave — Movie Review|work=Sci-Fi Movie Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=June 2017}} In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] wrote, "rarely does a movie that fails so utterly start so well", falling apart ahead of the fifth wave. As to a possible trilogy, "if we’re not really vigilant, and look to the skies, and prepare, they’re going to make at least two more of these things. We’ve got to beat back the invasion now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|author-link=Mick LaSalle|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/movies/article/The-5th-Wave-at-least-the-apocalypse-6774520.php|title=''The 5th Wave'': At least the apocalypse starts well|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Cockrell of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review, saying, "''The 5th Wave'' is an effectively decent post-apocalyptic, young adult, world-in-the-balance survival thriller" with an "arrestingly original spin on trendy genre tropes", although he suggested that fans of the book may have "issues with what has been edited".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/the-5th-wave-review-chloe-grace-moretz-1201679744/|title=‘The 5th Wave’ Review: A Decent Adaptation of Rick Yancey’s Novel - Variety|author=Eddie Cockrell|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Truitt of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film a positive review, stating that it "is an inviting sci-fi invasion" and "nicely stokes the imagination of a new generation of science-fiction movie nerds". He praised Moretz and Robinson as "equally strong" co-leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/01/21/review-the-5th-wave-movie/79013726/|title=Review: '5th Wave' is an inviting sci-fi invasion|publisher=USA Today|author=Brian Truitt|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon Harvey of ''[[The West Australian]]'' also gave the film a positive review, writing, "It’s actually got a lot going for it, from acting prodigy Chloe Grace Moretz as the kind of tough but fragile heroine you can cheer for to handsome production values, several plot twists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/30601034/the-5th-wave-too-familiar-to-be-thrilling/|title=The 5th Wave too familiar to be thrilling. - The West Australian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Patterson of ''[[Moviepilot]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling it a "thrilling story of survival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/reviews/3749541|title=The 5th Wave: A Thrilling Story of  Survival!|author=Michael Patterson|date=January 23, 2016|work=moviepilot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lonely Tree''''' (German: ''Der einsame Baum'') is an 1822 oil-on-canvas painting by German painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]].  It measures {{convert|55|xx|71|cm}}.  The work depicts a panoramic view of a [[Romanticism|romantic]] landscape of plains with mountains in the background.  A solitary [[oak]] tree dominates the foreground.  

An ancient oak stands at the centre of the painting, clearly damaged but still standing.  The tree's branches, dark in silhouette, project into the largely overcast morning sky.  Banks of cloud seem to form a dome above the tree.  The crown of the tree is dead, and the top of its trunk and two truncated branches resemble a cross.  A shepherd shelters under the leaf-bearing lower branches.  His flock of sheep graze beside a pond in the wide grassy meadow around the tree.  In the middle distance, villages and a town nestle among other trees and bushes.  Tree-clad hills pile up into blue-grey mountains in the background.

The work was commissioned by banker and art collector [[Joachim Heinrich Wilhelm Wagener]], together with a second painting ''[[Moonrise by the Sea]]'' (''Mondaufgang am Meer'') to create a pair of "times of the day", depicting morning and evening landscape scenes, in a tradition of [[Claude Lorrain]].  It was completed before November 1822 and has been held by the [[Berlin National Gallery]] since 1861, donated by Wagener as part of its founding collection.  It is now in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] of the [[Staatliche Museen]] in Berlin.

Art historian [[Helmut Börsch-Supan]] has suggested that the mountains are in the [[Riesengebirge]], now in the [[Czech Republic]], which historically divided [[Silesia]] and [[Bohemia]], southeast of [[Dresden]], where Friedrich settled in 1798.  Friedrich painted the mountains several times between 1806 and 1810.   The double peak may be [[Jeschken]].

The painting has drawn a number of interpretations.  [[Ludwig Justi]] sees the old oak as a symbol of the German people, rooted in the landscape; [[Jens Christian Jensen]] sees it as a link between the past and the present; and [[Charlotte Margarethe de Prybram-Gladona]] sees it as a symbol of loneliness.

==History==

The painting was completed by Maclise in 1854. It was initially commissioned to stand in the chamber of the [[House of Lords]] in the [[Palace of Westminster]], along with other paintings celebrating the acquisition of colonies by the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=zJtEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Marriage+of+Strongbow+and+Aoife&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3xsnej5nWAhVKCsAKHUxWAZsQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Marriage+of+Strongbow+and+Aoife&amp;f=false|title=Medieval Invasions in Modern Irish Literature|first=J.|last=Ulin|date=13 November 2013|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909231045/https://books.google.ie/books?id=zJtEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Marriage+of+Strongbow+and+Aoife&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3xsnej5nWAhVKCsAKHUxWAZsQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Marriage+of+Strongbow+and+Aoife&amp;f=false|archivedate=9 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53588">The '''Theatre of the Absurd''' ({{lang-fr|théâtre de l'absurde}} {{IPA-fr|teɑtʁ(ə) də lapsyʁd|}}) is a post–World War II designation for particular [[Play (theatre)|plays]] of [[absurdist fiction]] written by a number of primarily European [[playwright]]s in the late 1950s, as well as one for the style of theatre which has evolved from their work. Their work focused largely on the idea of [[existentialism]] and expressed what happens when human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down.  Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hutchinson Encyclopedia'', Millennium Edition, Helicon 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Critic [[Martin Esslin]] coined the term in his 1960 essay "Theatre of the Absurd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theatre of the Absurd |first=Martin |last=Esslin |year=1961 |oclc=329986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He related these plays based on a broad theme of the Absurd, similar to the way [[Albert Camus]] uses the term in his 1942 essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |title=THE THEATRE OF THE ABSURD: THE WEST AND THE EAST |first=Jan |last=Culík |date=2000 |publisher=University of Glasgow |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |archivedate=2009-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. This style of writing was first popularized by the Samuel Beckett play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953). Although the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to [[vaudeville]], mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of [[Theatrical realism|realism]] and the concept of the "[[well-made play]]". These plays were shaped by the political turmoil, scientific breakthrough, and social upheaval going on in the world around the playwrights during these times.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

While absurdists believed that life is absurd, they also believed that death and the "after life" were equally absurd if not more, and that whether people live or not all of their actions are pointless and everything will lead to the same end (hence the repetitiveness in many of these absurdist plays).{{fact|date=September 2018}}

In his book ''Absurd Drama'' (1965), Esslin wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Theatre of the Absurd attacks the comfortable certainties of religious or political orthodoxy. It aims to shock its audience out of complacency, to bring it face to face with the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. It is a challenge to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity, nobly, responsibly; precisely {{em|because}} there are no easy solutions to the mysteries of existence, because ultimately man is alone in a meaningless world. The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind it a sense of freedom and relief. And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair but the laughter of liberation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Miguel Mihura]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Fernando Arrabal]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], [[Tadeusz Różewicz]], [[Sławomir Mrożek]], [[N.F. Simpson]], and [[Badal Sarkar]].{{fact|date=September 2018}}

== Origin ==
In the first edition of ''The Theatre of the Absurd'', Esslin saw the work of these playwrights as giving artistic meaning to [[Albert Camus]]'s philosophy that life is inherently without meaning, as illustrated in his work ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. In the first (1961) edition, Esslin presented the four defining playwrights of the movement as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], and [[Jean Genet]], and in subsequent editions he added a fifth playwright, [[Harold Pinter]]—although each of these writers has unique preoccupations and characteristics that go beyond the term "absurd."&lt;ref name=Esslin1961ed&gt;Martin Esslin, ''The Theatre of the Absurd'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1961). (Subsequent references to this ed. appear within parentheses in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Esslin2004ed&gt;Martin Esslin, ''The Theatre of the Absurd'', 3rd ed. (New York: Vintage [Knopf], 2004). (Subsequent references to this ed. appear within parentheses in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers associated with this group by Esslin and other critics include [[Tom Stoppard]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Hodgson.

== Significant precursors ==
Though the label "Theatre of the Absurd" covers a wide variety of playwrights with differing styles, they do have some common stylistic precursors (Esslin [1961]). These precursors include Elizabethan tragicomedy, formal experimentation, pataphysics, surrealism, Dadaism, and most importantly existentialism.

=== Elizabethan – tragicomedy ===
The mode of most "absurdist" plays is [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324"&gt;Esslin, pg. 323–324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Styan. ''Modern Drama in Theory and Practice''. Cambridge University Press, 1983 {{ISBN|0-521-29629-3}}, pg. 125&lt;/ref&gt; As Nell says in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'', "Nothing is funnier than unhappiness … it's the most comical thing in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''. Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Esslin cites [[William Shakespeare]] as an influence on this aspect of the "Absurd drama."&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 321–323&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare's influence is acknowledged directly in the titles of Ionesco's ''[[Macbett]]'' and Stoppard's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''. Friedrich Dürrenmatt says in his essay "Problems of the Theatre", "Comedy alone is suitable for us … But the tragic is still possible even if pure tragedy is not.  We can achieve the tragic out of comedy.  We can bring it forth as a frightening moment, as an abyss that opens suddenly; indeed, many of Shakespeare's tragedies are already really comedies out of which the tragic arises."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Dürrenmatt. "Problems of the Theatre". ''The Marriage of Mr. Mississippi''. Grove Press, 1964. {{ISBN|978-0-394-17198-2}}. pg. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though layered with a significant amount of tragedy, the Theatre of the Absurd echoes other great forms of comedic performance, according to Esslin, from [[Commedia dell'arte]] to [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref name="Esslin, pg. 323-324" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Styan, pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Esslin cites early film comedians and [[music hall]] artists such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], the [[Keystone Cops]] and [[Buster Keaton]] as direct influences. (Keaton even starred in Beckett's ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'' in 1965.)&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal experimentation ===
As an experimental form of theatre, many Theatre of the Absurd playwrights employ techniques borrowed from earlier innovators. Writers and techniques frequently mentioned in relation to the Theatre of the Absurd include the 19th-century nonsense poets, such as [[Lewis Carroll]] or [[Edward Lear]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; Polish playwright [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]];&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 382–385&lt;/ref&gt; the Russians [[Daniil Kharms]],&lt;ref&gt;Neil Cornwell. ''The absurd in literature.'' Manchester University Press ND, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7190-7410-X}}. pg. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Erdman]],&lt;ref&gt;John Freedman. ''The major plays of Nikolai Erdman: The warrant and The suicide''. Routledge, 1995.{{ISBN|3718655837}}. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; and others; [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Distancing effect|distancing]] techniques in his "[[Epic theatre]]";&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 365–368&lt;/ref&gt; and the "dream plays" of [[August Strindberg]].&lt;ref name="Esslin1961ed" /&gt;&lt;ref name = StyanDark&gt;J. L. Styan. ''The dark comedy: the development of modern comic tragedy.'' Cambridge University Press, 1968. {{ISBN|0-521-09529-8}}. pg. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--needs page numbers in citations throughout--&gt;

One commonly cited precursor is [[Luigi Pirandello]], especially ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''.&lt;ref name = StyanDark /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annette J. Saddik. Ed. "Experimental Innovations After the Second World War". ''Contemporary American Drama''.Edinburgh University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-7486-2494-5}}.pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Pirandello was a highly regarded theatrical experimentalist who wanted to bring down the [[fourth wall]] presupposed by the [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] of playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]].&lt;!--Page number references to citations needed throughout.--&gt; According to [[W. B. Worthen]], ''Six Characters'' and other Pirandello plays use "[[Metatheatre]]—[[roleplaying]], [[Play within a play|plays-within-plays]], and a flexible sense of the limits of stage and illusion—to examine a highly-theatricalized vision of [[Personal identity|identity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Worthen, pg. 702&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential playwright was [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] whose ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias]]'' was the first work to be called "[[Surrealism|surreal]]".&lt;ref name = Lewis260&gt;Allan Lewis. "The Theatre of the 'Absurd' – Beckett, Ionesco, Genet". ''The Contemporary Theatre: The Significant Playwrights of Our Time''. Crown Publishers, 1966. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Glasgow&gt;Rupert D. V. Glasgow. ''Madness, Masks, and Laughter: An Essay on Comedy''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-8386-3559-8}}. pg. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah B. Gaensbauer. ''The French theater of the absurd''. Twayne Publishers, 1991. {{ISBN|0-8057-8270-2}}. pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pataphysics, surrealism, and Dadaism ===
One of the most significant common precursors is [[Alfred Jarry]] whose wild, irreverent, and lascivious ''Ubu'' plays scandalized Paris in the 1890s. Likewise, the concept of [['pataphysics]]—"the science of imaginary solutions"—first presented in Jarry's ''Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien'' (''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Jill Fell. ''Alfred Jarry, an imagination in revolt''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8386-4007-9}}. pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt; was inspirational to many later Absurdists,&lt;ref name="Glasgow" /&gt; some of whom joined the Collège de 'pataphysique, founded in honor of Jarry in 1948&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pag. 346–348&lt;/ref&gt; (Ionesco,&lt;ref name = Queneau&gt;Raymond Queneau, Marc Lowenthal. ''Stories &amp; remarks''.U of Nebraska Press, 2000
{{ISBN|0-8032-8852-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8852-2}}. pg. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt; Arrabal, and Vian&lt;ref name="Queneau" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bellos. ''Georges Perec: a life in words : a biography''. David R. Godine Publisher, 1993. {{ISBN|0-87923-980-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87923-980-0}}. pg.596&lt;/ref&gt; were given the title Transcendent Satrape of the Collège de 'pataphysique). The Alfred Jarry Theatre, founded by [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Roger Vitrac]], housed several Absurdist plays, including ones by Ionesco and Adamov.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, pg.170&lt;/ref&gt;

Artaud's "[[Theatre of Cruelty|The Theatre of Cruelty]]" (presented in ''[[Theatre and its Double|The Theatre and Its Double]]'') was a particularly important philosophical treatise. Artaud claimed theatre's reliance on literature was inadequate and that the true power of theatre was in its visceral impact.&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Artaud ''The Theatre and Its Double''.  Tr. Mary Caroline Richards.  New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958., pg. 15–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Modern'' pg. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Artaud was a [[Surrealism|Surrealist]], and many other members of the Surrealist group were significant influences on the Absurdists.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 372–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow. ''Theatre on the edge: new visions, new voices''. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1998. {{ISBN|1-55783-311-7}}. pg. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Rozik. ''The roots of theatre: rethinking ritual and other theories of origin''. University of Iowa Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-87745-817-0}}. pg. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absurdism is also frequently compared to Surrealism's predecessor, [[Dadaism]] (for example, the Dadaist plays by [[Tristan Tzara]] performed at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zürich).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drain. ''Twentieth-century theatre: a sourcebook''. Routledge, 1995. {{ISBN|0-415-09619-7}}. pg. 5–7, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Absurdists had direct connections with the Dadaists and Surrealists. Ionesco,&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Present past, past present: a personal memoir''. Da Capo Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-80835-8}}. pg. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; Adamov,&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle. ''Makers of modern culture''. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}. pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and Arrabal&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Innes. ''Avant garde theatre, 1892–1992''.Routledge, 1993. {{ISBN|0-415-06518-6}}. pg. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, were friends with Surrealists still living in Paris at the time including [[Paul Eluard]] and [[André Breton]], the founder of Surrealism, and Beckett translated many Surrealist poems by Breton and others from French into English.&lt;ref&gt;James Knowlson. ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett''. London. Bloomsbury Publishing, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7475-3169-2}}., pg. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright. ''Beckett and aesthetics''.Cambridge University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-521-82908-9}}. pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with existentialism ===

Many of the Absurdists were contemporaries with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], the philosophical spokesman for existentialism in Paris, but few Absurdists actually committed to Sartre's own existentialist philosophy, as expressed in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', and many of the Absurdists had a complicated relationship with him.  Sartre praised Genet's plays, stating that for Genet, "Good is only an illusion. Evil is a Nothingness which arises upon the ruins of Good".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre. "Introduction to ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''" ''The Maids; and Deathwatch''. Grove Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8021-5056-X}}. pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly.&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Present Past, Past Present''. Da Capo Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-80835-8}}. pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ionesco accused Sartre of supporting Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'' as a criticism of blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; at the end of the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''Fragments of a Journal''. Tr. Jean Stewart. London: Faber and Faber, 1968. pg. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosette C. Lamont. ''Ionesco's imperatives: the politics of culture''. University of Michigan Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-472-10310-5}}. pg. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre criticized ''Rhinoceros'' by questioning: "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there".&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Bourgeois Theatre" 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, pg. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1966 interview, [[Claude Bonnefoy]], comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".&lt;ref&gt;Claude Bonnefoy. ''Conversations with Eugène Ionesco''. Trans. Jan Dawson. Holt, Rinehard and Winston, 1971. pg. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to Sartre's concepts of the function of literature, [[Samuel Beckett]]'s primary focus was on the ''failure'' of man to overcome "absurdity" - or the repetition of life even though the end result will be the same no matter what and everything is essentially pointless - as James Knowlson says in ''Damned to Fame'', Beckett's work focuses, "on poverty, failure, exile and loss — as he put it, on man as a 'non-knower' and as a 'non-can-er'&amp;nbsp;."&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 319&lt;/ref&gt;  Beckett's own relationship with Sartre was complicated by a mistake made in the publication of one of his stories in Sartre's journal ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlson, pg. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett said, though he liked ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'', he generally found the writing style of Sartre and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] to be "too philosophical" and he considered himself "not a philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. ''Samuel Beckett: the last modernist''. Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-306-80898-6}}. pg. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The "Absurd" or "New Theater" movement was originally a Paris-based (and a [[Rive Gauche]]) avant-garde phenomenon tied to extremely small theaters in the [[Quartier Latin]].  Some of the Absurdists, such as [[Jean Genet]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Norrish. ''New tragedy and comedy in France, 1945–1970''.Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1988. {{ISBN|0-389-20746-2}}. pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Tardieu]],&lt;ref name = Hardison438&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré, Margot Berthold.

Cambridge University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-521-57429-3}}. pg. 229&lt;/ref&gt;  As the influence of the Absurdists grew, the style spread to other countries—with playwrights either directly influenced by Absurdists in Paris or playwrights labelled Absurdist by critics.  In England some of those whom Esslin considered practitioners of the Theatre of the Absurd include [[Harold Pinter]],&lt;ref name="Hardison438" /&gt; [[Tom Stoppard]],&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle H.

=== Legacy ===
Echoes of elements of "The Theatre of the Absurd" can be seen in the work of many later playwrights, from more [[avant-garde]] or experimental playwrights like [[Suzan-Lori Parks]]—in ''[[The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World]]'' and ''[[The America Play]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Enoch Brater. "After the Absurd". ''Around the Absurd: Essays on Modern and Postmodern Drama''. Ed. Enoch Brater and Ruby Cohn. University of Michigan Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-472-10205-1}}. pg. 293–301.&lt;/ref&gt; for example—to relatively realistic playwrights like [[David Mamet]]—in ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', which Mamet dedicated to [[Harold Pinter]].&lt;ref&gt;David Mamet.

In addition, the absurd drama has also found its way in [[Urdu literature]], ''Mazaron Ke Phool'' [i.e. Graveyard Flowers] (2008) by contemporary Pakistani writer, poet and columnist Mujtaba Haider Zaidi is the first absurd drama in the history of Urdu literature. Created in the pattern of ancient Greek tragedies, the drama contains only two characters, and carries both poetry and prose in it, and hence fulfills all the requirements necessary for a perfect Absurd drama.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Theatrical features ==
Plays within this group are absurd in that they focus not on logical acts, realistic occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norrish, pg. 2–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt; According to Martin Esslin, Absurdism is "the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose"&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Absurdist drama asks its viewer to "draw his own conclusions, make his own errors".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Though Theatre of the Absurd may be seen as nonsense, they have something to say and can be understood".&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of absurd ("out of harmony" in the musical sense) and drama's understanding of the Absurd: "Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco in Esslin, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characters ===
The characters in Absurdist drama are lost and floating in an incomprehensible universe and they abandon rational devices and discursive thought because these approaches are inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Richardson 1154&lt;/ref&gt; Many characters appear as automatons stuck in routines speaking only in cliché (Ionesco called the Old Man and Old Woman in ''[[Les Chaises|The Chairs]]'' "uber-marrionettes").&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?id=85&amp;issue=3|title=Open access journal for Film and Television Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters are frequently stereotypical, [[archetype|archetypal]], or flat character types as in [[Commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Cronin, Isaac Cronin. ''Samuel Beckett: the last modernist''. Da Capo Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-306-80898-6}}. pg. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Bradby. ''Modern French Drama: 1940–1990''. Cambridge University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-521-40843-1}}. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Esslin402&gt;Esslin, pg. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

The more complex characters are in crisis because the world around them is incomprehensible.&lt;ref name ="Esslin402" /&gt;  Many of Pinter's plays, for example, feature characters trapped in an enclosed space menaced by some force the character can't understand. Pinter's first play was ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' – in which the main character, Rose, is menaced by Riley who invades her safe space though the actual source of menace remains a mystery&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual''. Ohio State University Press, 1971 {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 70–73.&lt;/ref&gt; – and this theme of characters in a safe space menaced by an outside force is repeated in many of his later works (perhaps most famously in ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]''). In [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]'s ''The Visit'' the main character, Alfred, is menaced by Claire Zachanassian; Claire, richest woman in the world with a decaying body and multiple husbands throughout the play, has guaranteed a payout for anyone in the town willing to kill Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Alan Crockett. ''Understanding Friedrich Dürrenmatt''.Univ of South Carolina Press, 1998. {{ISBN|1-57003-213-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57003-213-4}}. pg.81&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in Absurdist drama may also face the chaos of a world that science and logic have abandoned. Ionesco's recurring character Berenger, for example, faces a killer without motivation in ''[[Tueur sans gages|The Killer]]'', and Berenger's logical arguments fail to convince the killer that killing is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-garde: the experimental theater in France''. University of California Press, 1966. pg. 96–102.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinocéros]]'', Berenger remains the only human on Earth who hasn’t turned into a rhinoceros and must decide whether or not to conform.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom. ''Bloom's Major Dramatists: Eugène Ionesco''. 2003. Infobase Publishing. p106-110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Heilman. ''The Ghost on the Ramparts''. University of Georgia Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-8203-3265-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8203-3265-9}}. pg. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; Characters may find themselves trapped in a routine, or in a metafictional conceit, trapped in a story; the title characters in [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', for example, find themselves in a story (''[[Hamlet]]'') in which the outcome has already been written.&lt;ref name = Bradby59&gt;Bradby, ''Modern'' pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor L. Cahn. ''Beyond Absurdity: The Plays of Tom Stoppard''. London: Associated University Presses, 1979. pg. 36–39. Cahn asserts that though Stoppard begain writing in the Absurdist mode, in his increasing focus on order, optimism, and the redemptive power of art, Stoppard has moved "beyond" Absurdism, as the title implies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plots of many Absurdist plays feature characters in interdependent pairs, commonly either two males or a male and a female. Some Beckett scholars call this the "pseudocouple".&lt;ref&gt;Ackerley, pg. 334, 465, 508&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990
{{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87249-686-6}}. pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The two characters may be roughly equal or have a begrudging interdependence (like Vladimir and Estragon in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt; or the two main characters in ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]''); one character may be clearly dominant and may torture the passive character (like Pozzo and Lucky in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' or Hamm and Clov in ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''); the relationship of the characters may shift dramatically throughout the play (as in Ionesco's ''[[La Leçon|The Lesson]]''&lt;ref name = Hinden401&gt;Hinden, pg. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; or in many of Albee's plays, ''[[The Zoo Story]]''&lt;ref name = Kane159&gt;Leslie Kane. ''The language of silence: on the unspoken and the unspeakable in modern drama''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8386-3187-8}}. pg. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. Siefker Bailey, Bruce J. Mann. ''Edward Albee: A Casebook''. 2003. Routledge. pg. 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; for example).

=== Language ===
Despite its reputation for nonsense language, much of the dialogue in Absurdist plays is naturalistic.  The moments when characters resort to nonsense language or clichés—when words appear to have lost their denotative function, thus creating misunderstanding among the characters—make the Theatre of the Absurd distinctive.&lt;ref name="Lewis260" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Language frequently gains a certain phonetic, rhythmical, almost musical quality, opening up a wide range of often comedic playfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee, Philip C. Kolin. ''Conversations with Edward Albee''. Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1988. {{ISBN|0-87805-342-5}}. pg. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean Tardieu]], for example, in the series of short pieces ''Theatre de Chambre'' arranged the language as one arranges music.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Cabell Pronko. ''Avant-Garde''. University of California Press, 2003. pg.155–156&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctively Absurdist language ranges from meaningless clichés to vaudeville-style word play to meaningless nonsense.&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeanette R. Malkin. ''Verbal Violence in Contemporary Drama: From Handke to Shepard''. Cambridge University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-521-38335-8}}. pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Bald Soprano'', for example, was inspired by a language book in which characters would exchange empty clichés that never ultimately amounted to true communication or true connection.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, ''Dark'' pg. 221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erich Segal. ''The Death of Comedy''. Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-01247-X}} pg. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the characters in ''The Bald Soprano''—like many other Absurdist characters—go through routine dialogue full of clichés without actually communicating anything substantive or making a human connection.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guido Almansi, Simon Henderson. ''Harold Pinter''. Routledge, 1983. {{ISBN|0-416-31710-3}}. pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the dialogue is purposefully elliptical; the language of Absurdist Theater becomes secondary to the poetry of the concrete and objectified images of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 17, 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Beckett's plays devalue language for the sake of the striking tableau.&lt;ref&gt;Saddik, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Harold Pinter—famous for his "Pinter pause"—presents more subtly elliptical dialogue; often the primary things characters should address are replaced by ellipsis or dashes.  The following exchange between Aston and Davies in ''[[The Caretaker]]'' is typical of Pinter:

:ASTON. More or less exactly what you...
:DAVIES.  That's it … that's what I'm getting at is … I mean, what sort of jobs … (''Pause''.)
:ASTON. Well, there's things like the stairs … and the … the bells …
:DAVIES. But it'd be a matter … wouldn't it … it'd be a matter of a broom … isn't it?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Caretaker''. DPS, 1991.{{ISBN|0822201844}}, pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the dialogue in Absurdist drama (especially in Beckett's and Albee's plays, for example) reflects this kind of evasiveness and inability to make a connection.&lt;ref name="Kane159" /&gt;  When language that is apparently nonsensical appears, it also demonstrates this disconnection.  It can be used for comic effect, as in Lucky's long speech in ''Godot'' when Pozzo says Lucky is demonstrating a talent for "thinking" as other characters comically attempt to stop him:

:LUCKY.  Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua outside time without extension who from the heights of divine apathia divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons unknown but time will tell and suffers like the divine Miranda with those who for reasons unknown but time will tell are plunged in torment...&lt;ref&gt;David Bradby. ''Beckett, Waiting for Godot''. Camberidge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-59510-X}}, pg. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonsense may also be used abusively, as in Pinter's ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' when Goldberg and McCann torture Stanley with apparently nonsensical questions and [[non sequitur (humor)|non-sequiturs]]:

:GOLDBERG.  What do you use for pajamas?
:STANLEY.  Nothing.
:GOLDBERG.  You verminate the sheet of your birth.
:MCCANN.  What about the Albigensenist heresy?
:GOLDBERG.  Who watered the wicket in Melbourne?
:MCCANN.  What about the blessed Oliver Plunkett?
:GOLDBERG.  Speak up Webber.  Why did the chicken cross the road?&lt;ref&gt;Harold Pinter. ''The Birthday Party and The Room: Two Plays''. Grove Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8021-5114-0}}. pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the above examples, nonsense in Absurdist theatre may be also used to demonstrate the limits of language while questioning or parodying the determinism of science and the knowability of truth.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams. "''The Birthday Party'': Harold Pinter". ''Modern Critical Views: Harold Pinter''. New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1987. {{ISBN|0-87754-706-8}}. pg. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hornby. ''Drama, Metadrama and perception''. Associated University Presse, 1986 {{ISBN|0-8387-5101-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5101-5}}. pg. 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ionesco's ''The Lesson'', a professor tries to force a pupil to understand his nonsensical philology lesson:

:PROFESSOR.  … In Spanish: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic; in Latin: the roses of my grandmother are as yellow as my grandfather who is Asiatic.  Do you detect the difference?  Translate this into … Romanian
:PUPIL.  The … how do you say "roses" in Romanian?
:PROFESSOR.  But "roses", what else? … "roses" is a translation in Oriental of the French word "roses", in Spanish "roses", do you get it? In Sardanapali, "roses"...&lt;ref&gt;Eugène Ionesco. ''The Bald Soprano and Other Plays''. Grove Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-8021-3079-8}}. pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plot ===
Traditional plot structures are rarely a consideration in The Theatre of the Absurd.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Schumacher. ''Encyclopedia of Literature &amp; Criticism''. 1990. Routledge. pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plots can consist of the absurd repetition of cliché and routine, as in ''Godot'' or ''[[The Bald Soprano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Homan. ''Beckett's theaters: interpretations for performance''. Bucknell University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8387-5064-8}}. pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often there is a menacing outside force that remains a mystery; in ''The Birthday Party'', for example, Goldberg and McCann confront Stanley, torture him with absurd questions, and drag him off at the end, but it is never revealed why.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, pg. 132, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In later Pinter plays, such as ''The Caretaker''&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''The dramatic world of Harold Pinter: its basis in ritual''. Ohio State University Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-8142-0146-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8142-0146-6}}. pg. 76–89&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Homecoming'',&lt;ref&gt;Marc Silverstein. ''Harold Pinter and the language of cultural power''. Bucknell University Press, 1993.{{ISBN|0-8387-5236-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5236-4}}. pg. 76–94.&lt;/ref&gt; the menace is no longer entering from the outside but exists within the confined space. Other Absurdists use this kind of plot, as in Edward Albee's ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'': Harry and Edna take refuge at the home of their friends Agnes and Tobias because they suddenly become frightened.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen James Bottoms. ''The Cambridge Companion to Edward Albee''. Cambridge University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-521-83455-4}}. pg. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have difficulty explaining what has frightened them:

:HARRY: There was nothing … but we were very scared.

:HARRY: We were scared.  It was like being lost: very young again, with the dark, and lost.  There was no … thing … to be … frightened of, but …
:EDNA: WE WERE FRIGHTENED … AND THERE WAS NOTHING.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Albee. ''A delicate balance: a play in three acts''. Samuel French, Inc., 1994. {{ISBN|0-573-60792-3}}. pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and unresolved mysteries are central features in many Absurdist plots:&lt;ref&gt;Les Essif. ''Empty figure on an empty stage: the theatre of Samuel Beckett and his generation''. Indiana University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-253-33847-6}}. pg. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; for example, in ''The Chairs'' an old couple welcomes a large number of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all we see is empty chairs, a representation of their absence.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Rayner. ''Ghosts: death's double and the phenomena of theatre''. U of Minnesota Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8166-4544-2}}. pg. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the action of ''Godot'' is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait.  In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking slowly back and forth in ''[[Footfalls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, S. E. Gontarski, Pierre A. G. Astier. ''Samuel Beckett—humanistic perspectives''.Ohio State University Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8142-0334-5}}. pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; for example, or in ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'' only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Astro. ''Understanding Samuel Beckett''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-87249-686-4}}. pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruby Cohn. ''A Beckett Canon''. University of Michigan Press, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-472-11190-9}} pg. 298, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot may also revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis, a supernatural change, or a shift in the laws of physics.  For example, in Ionesco's ''[[Amédée ou comment s'en débarrasser|Amédée, or How to Get Rid of It]]'', a couple must deal with a corpse that is steadily growing larger and larger; Ionesco never fully reveals the identity of the corpse, how this person died, or why it's continually growing, but the corpse ultimately – and, again, without explanation – floats away.&lt;ref&gt;Lamont, pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Wintle. ''The Makers of Modern Culture''. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}. pg. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jean Tardieu's "The Keyhole" a lover watches a woman through a keyhole as she removes her clothes and then her flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Pronko, pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Pirandello, many Absurdists use meta-theatrical techniques to explore role fulfillment, fate, and the theatricality of theatre.  This is true for many of Genet's plays: for example, in ''The Maids'', two maids pretend to be their mistress; in ''The Balcony'' brothel patrons take on elevated positions in role-playing games, but the line between theatre and reality starts to blur.  Another complex example of this is ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'': it's a play about two minor characters in ''[[Hamlet]]''; these characters, in turn, have various encounters with the players who perform ''The Mousetrap'', the play-within-the-play in ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Bradby59" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June Schlueter. ''Metafictional Characters in Modern Drama''. Columbia University Press, 1979. {{ISBN|0-231-04752-5}}. pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In Stoppard's ''Travesties'', James Joyce and Tristan Tzara slip in and out of the plot of ''The Importance of Being Earnest''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter K. W. Tan, Tom Stoppard. ''A stylistics of drama: with special focus on Stoppard's Travesties''. NUS Press, 1993. {{ISBN|9971-69-182-5}}, {{ISBN|978-9971-69-182-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plots are frequently cyclical:&lt;ref name="Hinden401" /&gt; for example, ''Endgame'' begins where the play ended&lt;ref&gt;Katherine H. Burkman. ''Myth and ritual in the plays of Samuel Beckett''. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-8386-3299-8}}. pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; – at the beginning of the play, Clov says, "Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Beckett. ''Endgame: a play in one act, followed by Act without words, a mime for one player''.Grove Press, 1958. {{ISBN|0-8021-5024-1}}. pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; – and themes of cycle, routine, and repetition are explored throughout.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Karpati Kennedy|Andrew K. Kennedy]]. ''Samuel Beckett''. Cambridge University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-521-27488-5}}. pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toyo straw''' is a type of shiny smooth [[straw]] made chiefly in [[Japan]] with [[shellac]]ked [[rice paper]]. This material is commonly used for [[straw hat]]s and [[fedora]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toyo |title=toyo |publisher=Merriam-Webster |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These straws are smooth to feel and turn to a shiny, viscose white or a golden copper when the product is finished. Soft to touch and light to wear and normally finished with a plastic glaze. Hats made from Toyo straw are mostly machine-made, and so they are generally sold in the medium to low price range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ultrafino.com/hats/2017/11/types-straws-used-hat-making/|title=Types of Straws Used in Hat Making {{!}} Ultrafino|last=|first=Ultrafino|date=2017-11-30|work=Ultrafino|access-date=2017-12-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sir Tristram and la Belle Ysoude drink the potion'', [[Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.]], 1862, after a design by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. Bradford Art Galleries and Museums.]]
[[File:William Morris Guinevere and Iseult - cartoon for stained glass 1862.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Cartoon for ''Queen Guenevere and Isoude Les Blanches Mains'', [[William Morris]], 1862. Tate Britain, London.]]

The '''Tristram and Isoude stained glass panels''' are a series of 13 small [[stained-glass]] windows made in 1862 by [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulker &amp; Co.]] for Harden Grange, the house of textile merchant Walter Dunlop, near [[Bingley]] in Yorkshire, England. Depicting the legend of [[Tristan and Iseult]], they were designed by six of the leading [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] artists of the day, to an overall design by [[William Morris]]. They were acquired in 1917 by Cartwright Hall Art Gallery, which is now part of Bradford Museums &amp; Galleries.  They can be seen on display at [[Cliffe_Castle_Museum|Cliffe Castle]], Keighley.

==Details==
The 13 small&lt;ref&gt;The panels average 68 x 60.5 cm; Poulson, Christine, "'That Most Beautiful of Dreams': Tristram and Isoude in British Art of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries". In Grimbert (2002), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; stained-glass panels depict scenes from the story of [[Tristan and Iseult|Sir Tristram and la Belle Isoude]] as told in Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur|Morte d'Arthur]]''.&lt;ref name="Wroot69"&gt;Wroot (1917), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimbert338"&gt;Poulson, pp. 338-339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawson"&gt;Lawson (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; They were commissioned by Walter Dunlop, a [[Bradford]] textile merchant, for a new music room to be built at Harden Grange, his house near [[Bingley|Bingley, Yorkshire]], and were designed and executed in 1862 by [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulker &amp; Co.]], the [[decorative arts]] firm established the year before by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[William Morris]] in partnership with [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Philip Webb]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]] and [[Peter Paul Marshall]].&lt;ref name="Wroot69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimbert338" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;Harvey &amp; Press (1991), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the firm's first commission for windows for a private residence, or with a non-ecclesiastical subject, and Morris provided Dunlop with a hand-written programme for the proposed work headed "Short abstract of the Romance of Tristram", with marginal annotations suggesting the pictorial possibilities of the story.&lt;ref name="Wroot69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimbert338" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt;

To design the [[cartoon]]s or preparatory drawings for the individual panels, Morris turned to four of the artists who had worked with him in 1857 on another project based on the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]] as retold by Malory, the [[Oxford Union murals]]—Rossetti, Burne-Jones, [[Valentine Cameron Prinsep|Val Prinsep]] and [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]]—plus his partner Madox Brown.&lt;ref name="Grimbert338" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wroot73"&gt;Wroot (1917), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Morris himself designed four of the 13 panels and maintained the cohesiveness of the series through his overall design, matching text blocks, placement of the lead lines, and selection of colours, including deep ruby-reds and olive greens.&lt;ref name="Grimbert338" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wroot73"&gt;Wroot (1917), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects of the 13 panels and their designers are:&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wroot-all"&gt;Wroot (1917), pp. 69-73&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tristram and Isoude windows were acquired by the [[Cartwright Hall|Bradford Art Gallery]] in 1917, along with documentation relating to the subject matter of the panels and their installation, including the "Short abstract".&lt;ref name="Grimbert338" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt; They can be seen on display at [[Cliffe_Castle_Museum|Cliffe Castle]], Keighley.

The book received additional attention during [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump's 2016 campaign for the presidency of the United States]]. He cited it as one of his proudest accomplishments and his second-favorite book after the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/424567/art-deal-trump-shows-his-soft-side-jim-geraghty|title=In The Art of the Deal, Trump Shows His Soft Side|author=Jim Geraghty|date=September 24, 2015|work=[[The National Review]]|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/donald-trumps-favorite-book-505029187689|work=MSNBC|title=Donald Trump reveals his favorite book|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz expressed regrets about his involvement in the book, and both he and the book's publisher, [[Howard Kaminsky]], said that Trump had played no role in the actual writing of the book. Trump has given conflicting accounts on the question of authorship.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The book talks about Trump's childhood in [[Jamaica Estates, Queens]]. It then describes his early work in [[Brooklyn]] prior to moving to [[Manhattan]] and building [[The Trump Organization]], his actions and thoughts in developing the [[Grand Hyatt Hotel]] and [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (New York City)|Trump Tower]], in renovating [[Wollman Rink]], and regarding various other projects.&lt;ref&gt;Trump: The Art of the Deal Paperback&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contains an 11-step formula for business success, inspired by [[Norman Vincent Peale]]'s ''[[The Power of Positive Thinking]]''.&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axK-7t8kolQC&amp;pg=PT69 |title=TrumpNation: ''The Art of Being The Donald'' |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |author=Timothy L. O'Brien |year=2005 |pages=69–70 |accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Trump was persuaded to produce the book by [[Condé Nast]] owner [[Si Newhouse]] after the May 1984 issue of Newhouse's magazine ''[[GQ]]'' – with Trump appearing on the cover – sold well.&lt;ref name=obrien/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''GQ''. May 1984. Success Issue. Donald Trump, [[Sandra Bernhard]], [[Bobby Short]].&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz was hired to work on the book, and began working with Trump in late 1985. He interviewed Trump and – with permission from him – listened in on his phone calls.

According to Schwartz in July 2016, Trump wrote none of the book, choosing only to remove a few critical mentions of business colleagues at the end of the process.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt; Trump responded with conflicting stories, saying "I had a lot of choice of who to have write the book, and I chose [Schwartz]", but then said "[Schwartz] didn't write the book. ''I'' wrote the book."&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt; Former [[Random House]] head [[Howard Kaminsky]], the book's original publisher, said "Trump didn’t write a postcard for us!"&lt;ref name="ghost"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all|title=Donald Trump’s Ghostwriter Tells All|last=Mayer|first=Jane|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in November 1987 by Random House, with the authorship given as "Donald Trump with Tony Schwartz". 

Schwartz was the subject of a July 2016 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in which Schwartz describes Donald Trump unfavorably and relates how he came to regret writing ''The Art of the Deal''.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt; He also stated that if it were to be written today it would be very different and titled ''The Sociopath''.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt; Schwartz repeated his self-criticism on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', saying he had "put lipstick on a pig".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winsor|first1=Morgan|title=Tony Schwartz, Co-Author of Donald Trump's 'The Art of the Deal,' Says Trump Presidency Would Be 'Terrifying'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/tony-schwartz-author-donald-trumps-art-deal-trump/story?id=40662196|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these claims, Trump's attorneys have demanded that Schwartz cede all his royalties from the book to Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/us/politics/trump-tony-schwartz-book.html|title=Trump Lawyer Sends ‘Art of the Deal’ Ghostwriter a Cease-and-Desist Letter|last=Fandos|first=Nicholas|date=2016-07-21|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-threatens-the-ghostwriter-of-the-art-of-the-deal|title=Donald Trump Threatens the Ghostwriter of 'The Art of the Deal'|date=2016-07-21|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''The Art of the Deal'' was published in November 1987 by [[Random House]]. A promotional campaign was undertaken in conjunction with the release of the book. This included Trump holding a release party at [[Trump Tower]] that was hosted by [[Jackie Mason]] and featured a celebrity-filled guest list.&lt;ref name = obrien /&gt; There were a series of appearances by him on television talk shows.&lt;ref name="qiu"/&gt; Trump also appeared on a number of magazine covers as part of publicity for the book.&lt;ref name="qiu"/&gt;

Excerpts from the book were published in [[New York magazine|''New York'']] magazine.
The book has been translated into over a dozen languages.&lt;ref name = obrien /&gt;

==Royalties==
Trump and Schwartz had an agreement to split royalties from the book on a 50–50 basis.&lt;ref name="mixed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farenthold"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html|title=Trump promised millions to charity.

In 1988, Trump set up the [[Donald J. Trump Foundation]] to give away royalties from the book's sales, in Trump's words, promising four or five million dollars "To the homeless, to Vietnam veterans, for AIDS, multiple sclerosis".&lt;ref name="mixed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-book-royalties-to-charity-a-mixed-bag/|title=Donald Trump book royalties to charity?

Fahrenthold |date=October 4, 2016 |accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, Schwartz said he had received some $1.6 million in royalty payments.&lt;ref name="mixed"/&gt; In October of that year, Schwartz said the royalties he was still receiving for the book "suddenly became, for me, blood money. I didn't want to be anywhere near it. It just feels wrong".&lt;ref name="Farenthold2"/&gt; As a result, Schwartz said he would be donating the prior 6-months of royalties worth $55,000 to the [[National Immigration Law Center]] which advocates for more undocumented immigrants to remain in the USA legally. Schwartz had earlier donated royalties he received in the second half of 2015, worth $25,000, to a number of charities including the [[National Immigration Forum]]. Schwartz said he wanted to help the people Trump was attacking.&lt;ref name="Farenthold2"/&gt;

==Book sales==
Precise figures for the number of copies sold of ''The Art of the Deal'' are not available because its publication preceded the [[Nielsen BookScan]] era.&lt;ref name="qiu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/donald-trumps-art-deal-best-selling-business-book-/ |title=Is Donald Trump's ''Art of the Deal'' the best-selling business book of all time? |work=[[Politifact]]| publisher = [[Tampa Bay Times]]|author=Linda Qiu |date=July 6, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a [[Edition (book)#First edition|first printing]] of 150,000 copies. Several magazine and book accounts state that it sold over 1 million hardcover copies&lt;ref name="obrien"/&gt; or 1 million copies.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-business-philosophy-from-the-art-of-the-deal-2015-6|title=Donald Trump's core business philosophy from his bestselling 1987 book 'The Art of the Deal'|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2016 [[CBS News]] investigation reported that an unnamed source familiar with the book's sales placed the figure at 1.1 million copies sold.&lt;ref name="mixed"/&gt;

Trump said in his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential run]] that ''The Art of the Deal'' is "the No. 1 selling business book of all time." An analysis by ''[[Politifact]]'' found that other business books sold many more copies than ''The Art of the Deal''. While it was impossible to find exact sales figures, a range of possibilities based on known claims and facts were given, and when compared to six other famous business books, ''The Art of the Deal'' ranked in fifth place according to the analysis; the first place book, ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'', outsold it by a factor of 15 times.&lt;ref name="qiu"/&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
At the time of publication, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called it a "boastful, boyishly disarming, thoroughly engaging personal history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-394-55528-7|title=Trump: The Art of the Deal|author=|date=December 1987|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine gave it a mixed review.&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;

In 1988, Trump and [[Ted Turner]] announced plans for a television-film based on the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-07-04/features/8801120710_1_ted-turner-superstation-nielsen|title=Turner And Trump Team Up For A Film|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans had been largely abandoned by 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-07-19/features/1991200182_1_turner-trump-make-a-movie|title=Turner's Trump movie is on hold|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, journalist [[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]] noted Trump "appears to have ignored some of his own advice" in the book due to "well-publicized problems with his banks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/06/nyregion/art-of-the-deal-scaled-back-edition.html|title='Art of the Deal,' Scaled-Back Edition|author=John Tierney|date=March 6, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's self-promotion, best-selling book and media celebrity status led one commentator in 2006 to call him "a poster-child for the '[[greed is good]]' 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icY_SPvVBO0C&amp;pg=PA101|title=Journalism at the End of the American Century, 1965-present|author=James Brian McPherson|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|page=101|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The phrase "Greed is good" was from the movie [[Wall Street (1987 film)|''Wall Street'']], which was released a month after ''The Art of the Deal''.)

[[Jim Geraghty]] in the ''[[National Review]]'' said in 2015 that the book showed "a much softer, warmer, and probably happier figure than the man dominating the airwaves today."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

John Paul Rollert, an [[ethicist]] writing about the book in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in 2016, says Trump sees capitalism not as an economic system but a [[morality play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/an-ethicist-reads-the-art-of-the-deal/475605/|title=An Ethicist Reads The Art of the Deal|author=John Paul Rollert|date=March 30, 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Truthful hyperbole}}The book coined the phrase "truthful hyperbole" describing "an innocent form of exaggeration—and... a very effective form of promotion". Schwartz said Trump loved that phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all|title=Donald Trump's Ghostwriter Tells All|last1=Mayer|first1=Jane|date=25 July 2016|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/page/ct-alternative-facts-kellyanne-conway-trump-perspec-0125-20170124-story.html|title=Column: 'Alternative facts' play to Americans' fantasies|last=Page|first=Clarence|date=January 24, 2017|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the phrase was noted for its similarity to the phrase "[[alternative facts]]" coined by [[Counselor to the President]] [[Kellyanne Conway]] when she defended [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]]'s statements about the attendance at Trump's [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] as [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2017/01/memo_to_kellyanne_conway_-_alt.html|title=Memo to Kellyanne Conway, there is no such thing as 'alternative facts': John L.

Aspects of the book were used as the basis for the 2016 [[parody film]], ''[[Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie]]''.&lt;ref name="latimes_parody"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-trump-parody-funny-or-die-20160211-story.html|title=Funny or Die 'Donald Trump' filmmakers talk about making the viral parody with Johnny Depp|last1=Zeitchik|first1=Steven|date=February 10, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the New York Times published an investigation contradicting many of the claims made by the Book, particularly the assertion that Donald Trump is a self made billionaire. The investigation details how Trump received at least $413 million in today’s dollars from his father's real estate empire, rather than the $1 million stated in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html|title=Trump Engaged in Suspect Tax Schemes as He Reaped Riches From His Father|last=Barstow|first=David|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/trump-committed-fraud-in-tax-schemes-new-york-times-says.html|title=Trump committed 'outright fraud' in 'dubious tax schemes,' according to a big, new NYT investigation|last=Pramuk|first=Jacob|date=2018-10-02|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-tax-fraud-fred-million-1149639|title=Donald Trump committed tax fraud to make equivalent of $413 million off his father Fred, report says|date=2018-10-02|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/2/17929774/donald-trump-tax-evasion-fred-trump-new-york-times|title=A NYT investigation destroys Trump’s "self-made" image and alleges sketchy tax schemes|work=Vox|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''V-shaped passage graves'''  are a type of [[megalithic]] [[chamber tomb]] found in parts of [[Atlantic Europe]] including [[Ireland]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. They date to between 3500 and 2500BC.

They are similar to [[Wedge-shaped gallery grave]]s in that in plan they have a narrow entrance that widens out inside into a burial chamber. The entrance passage and the burial chamber are distinguished by [[sill plate|sill]] stones however meaning that they are part of the [[passage grave]] tradition. 

In some cases a small sub chamber leads off from the main chamber.

Examples include [[La Varde]] and [[Le Creux es Faies]] on [[Guernsey]].

[[File:Walkie bits.jpg|thumb|Walkie Bits toys with the tins they are packaged in]]
'''Walkie Bits''' are little plastic toy [[turtle]]s that sing, dance and walk (they can walk in the rhythm which you tap on their shell). They are made by [[Takara]], a Japanese toy company in June 2005. Walkie Bits are very small, only about five centimeters, and come in a variety of different colors and "flavors" like "blue soda" and "green pineapple".

The Walkie Bits turtles are very popular in Japan, with 300,000 units sold within just a few months of their release.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Many Japanese people collect them because there are so many colors and they are relatively inexpensive. What also makes them so appealing is that you can remove the turtle's "shell" and swap it out with a different turtle's shell. It is also very popular and common to decorate the turtles' shells with stickers, stick-on jewels and even nail polish. The Walkie Bits turtles even had a segment on Japan's Morning Musume show, where the girls raced, played and decorated their turtles. To collaborate with the release of Gamera The Brave (2006), a Walkie Bits Gamera was made.

[[Time (magazine)|Time]] named Walkie Bits one of the best inventions of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Best Inventions 2005: Bot Crazy |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1129515-2,00.html |publisher=Time |date=2005-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
