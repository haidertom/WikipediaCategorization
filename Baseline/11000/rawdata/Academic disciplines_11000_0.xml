== Background ==

In 2012, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) launched a new programme on the development of adverse outcome pathways. A guidance document describes in detail how AOPs are to be developed, reviewed, agreed and published at the OECD level.&lt;ref name="THE DEVELOPMENT OF AOPs"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF AOPs|url=http://www.oecd.org/env/ehs/testing/AOP%20process_10%20June%202013.pdf|website=oecd.org |publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AOP development and reviewing workflow is intended to take place via a web-based IT management tool: the Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base (AOP-KB)&lt;ref name=AOP-KB&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base (AOP-KB)|url=https://aopkb.oecd.org/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which  is currently still under development. It is the wiki-based, user-friendly tool providing open-source interface for collaborative sharing of established AOPs and building new AOPs. 
The AOP-KB gives the scientific community the possibility to enter, share and discuss their AOP-related knowledge at one central point of information.
The AOP-KB allows for building AOPs by entering and then linking information about MIEs, KEs, AOs and ''' Chemical Initiators'''.
Knowing that pathway elements are not necessarily unique to a single AOP, value is added to existing knowledge by facilitating the re-use of MIE, KE and AO information in multiple AOPs, which prevents redundancy and make the collective knowledge about those entities available in all AOPs in which they appear.

The AOP-KB is a combination of individually developed applications, synchronised and orchestrated in a way that gives users the possibility to capture, review, browse and comment on AOPs shared by the AOP stakeholder community.

The AOP-KB project is an [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]  initiative, which is executed as close collaboration between the [[Joint Research Centre]] of [[European Commission]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the  [[Engineer Research and Development Center]] of [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] for the purpose of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'s programme on the development of AOPs &lt;ref name="Adverse Outcome Pathways, Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse Outcome Pathways, Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics|url=http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/testing/adverse-outcome-pathways-molecular-screening-and-toxicogenomics.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Air Stripper for Wikipedia.png|thumb|right|250px|Figure 1. An air stripper]]
'''Air stripping''' is the  transferring of [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components of a liquid into an air stream. It is an [[environmental engineering]] technology used for the purification of groundwaters and wastewaters containing volatile compounds.

Volatile compounds have relatively high [[vapor pressure]] and low aqueous solubility characterized by the compound’s [[Henry's law]] coefficient, which is the ratio of the concentration in air that is in equilibrium with its concentration in water. Pollutants with relatively high Henry’s Law coefficients can be economically stripped from water. These include [[BTEX]] compounds ([[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[ethylbenzene]], and [[xylene]] found in gasoline), and solvents including [[trichloroethylene]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]]. [[Ammonia]] can also be [[ammonia stripping|stripped]] from wastewaters and liquid digestates (often requiring pH adjustment prior to stripping). Since Henry’s law coefficient increases with temperature, stripping is easier at warmer temperatures.

==Air strippers==

Although any device that promotes contact between air and water strips some volatile compounds, air strippers are usually packed towers or [[Theoretical tray|tray]] towers operated with countercurrent flow of water and air. Packed towers, such as shown in Figure 1, usually use engineered or random plastic packings. Design criteria for packed towers include surface area provided by the packing, column height and diameter, and air to water flow rates.

Since many of the compounds stripped are [[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants|hazardous air pollutants]], the air exiting a stripper may require emissions control. [[Activated carbon#Applications|Carbon adsorption]] is often used and [[catalytic oxidation]] is another option.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="942">An '''alpha strike''' is a term referring to the event when an [[alpha particle]] enters a [[computer processor]], and modifying the data contained in that processor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4038173/Intel-scans-for-soft-errors-in-processor-designs Intel scans for soft errors in processor designs, Anthony Cataldo]&lt;/ref&gt; These can cause data corruption or system shutdown, and are becoming an increasing problem as [[transistor]] sizes are reduced.

Physically, what happens in an alpha strike is that the alpha particle excites
electrons via [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|electronic stopping power]] in the material, and these may disrupt the normal electronic state of a memory component. The particle can
also leave [[Point defect|permanent defects]] in the components via [[collision cascade]]s.

'''Anacoenosis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|s|iː|ˈ|n|oʊ|s|ᵻ|s}} is a [[figure of speech]] in which the speaker poses a question to an audience in a way that demonstrates a common interest.&lt;ref name="Pogue2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kate Emery Pogue|title=Shakespeare's Figures of Speech: A Reader's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PBXW_wTwBIC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=1 June 2013|date=25 June 2009|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4401-5192-7|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==

The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνακοινοῦν}} (''anakoinoûn''), meaning "to communicate, impart".

Anacoenosis typically uses a rhetorical question, where no reply is really sought or required, thus softening what is really a statement or command. 

Asking a question that implies one clear answer is to put others in a difficult position. If they disagree with you, then they risk conflict or derision. In particular if you state the question with certainty, then it makes disagreement seem rude.

Particularly when used in a group, this uses social conformance. If there is an implied agreement by all and one person openly disagrees, then they risk isolating themselves from the group, which is a very scary prospect.

If I am in an audience and the speaker uses anacoenosis and I do not agree yet do not speak up, then I may suffer cognitive dissonance between my thoughts and actions. As a result, I am likely to shift my thinking toward the speaker's views in order to reduce this tension.

==Examples==
*Do you not think we can do this now?
*Now tell me, given the evidence before us, could you have decided any differently?
*What do you think? Are we a bit weary? Shall we stay here for a while?
*"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. What could I have done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?" Isaiah 5:3-4
*The entire speech of Marc Anthony in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Julius Caesar forms an extended example of anacoenosis. Marc Anthony begins by building common cause with the audience on stage, addressing them as "Friends, Romans, countrymen..." His speech then poses a number of rhetorical questions to them as part of his refutation of Brutus' words: "Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? / When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept: / Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: / Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;/ And Brutus is an honourable man. / You all did see that on the Lupercal / I thrice presented him a kingly crown, / Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?" (Act 3, Scene 2)

'''Break-in''' or '''breaking in''', also known as '''run-in''' or '''running in''', is the procedure of conditioning a new piece of equipment by giving it an initial period of running, usually under light load, but sometimes under heavy load or normal load. It is generally a process of moving parts wearing against each other to produce the last small bit of size and shape adjustment that will settle them into a stable relationship for the rest of their working life.

One of the most common examples of break-in is engine break-in for [[petrol engine]]s and [[diesel engine]]s.

==Engine break-in==
A new engine is broken in by following specific driving guidelines during the first few hours of its use. The focus of breaking in an engine is on the contact between the [[piston ring]]s of the engine and the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] wall. There is no universal preparation or set of instructions for breaking in an engine. Most importantly, experts disagree on whether it is better to start engines on high or low power to break them in. While there are still consequences to an unsuccessful break-in, they are harder to quantify on modern engines than on older models. In general, people no longer break in the engines of their own vehicles after purchasing a car or motorcycle, because the process is done in production. It is still common, even today, to find that an owner's manual recommends gentle use at first (often specified as the first 500 or 1000 kilometres or miles). But it is usually only normal use without excessive demands that is specified, as opposed to light/limited use. For example, the manual will specify that the car be driven normally, but not in excess of the highway speed limit.

===Goal===

The goal of modern engine break-ins is the settling of piston rings into an engine's cylinder wall. A cylinder wall is not perfectly smooth but has a deliberate slight roughness to help oil adhesion. As the engine is powered up, the piston rings between the pistons and cylinder wall will begin to seal against the wall's small ridges.&lt;ref name="aircooled.net"&gt;Aircooled.Net. [http://www.aircooled.net/gnrlsite/resource/articles/engnbrkn.htm"How to Break In a New or Rebuilt Engine - Aircooled.Net, Inc. (n.d.).”] (accessed January 21, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally older design engines had a flat lifter that was pushed by the camshaft lobes.  It needs to spin during operation to avoid excessive wear to the camshaft lobe.  At idle speeds on a new engine poor machining tolerances could prevent the lifter from spinning and destroy the camshaft.  After 20 minutes of wear, or "self machining" at higher engine speeds they would typically be able to spin freely.

In the past, the engine break-in period was very important to the overall life and durability of the engine. The break-in period required has changed over the years with improved piston ring materials and designs. In reference to small engines, the break-in period now (5-10 hours) is short in comparison with that of engines of the past. Aluminum cylinder bore engine piston rings break-in faster than those used on cast iron cylinder bores. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briggsandstratton.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/Recommended%20engine%20break-in%20procedures/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203223118/http://www.briggsandstratton.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/Recommended%20engine%20break-in%20procedures/ |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation===
There are important preparations which must be made before the actual process of running the engine. The break-in can take place either in the vehicle or on an [[engine stand]]. Each engine has specific preparation needs of its own due to factors such as the many different types of engine models, the vehicles it belongs to, and conflicting expert instructions. For example, each engine should be lubricated and run on oil specified by its designers which can be found in a manual.&lt;ref&gt;''Road &amp; Track'' 51, no. 11: 152. [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=3333174&amp;site=ehost-live "Technical correspondence."](accessed January 19, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process===
The main area of controversy among engine break-in instructions is whether to run the engine slowly or quickly to initiate the process. Those who promote raising the power settings steadily will recommend changing the engine setting from low to high powers as to not work the engine too hard and create excessive wear on the cylinder wall (which would require the pistons to be removed and wall fixed). Other experts disagree and believe that to start the engine at a high power is the best way to effectively set in the pistons. The following are examples of how the two processes can be carried out:

====Start high power====
Start with [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm) between 2500 and 4000, and run the engine for about 20 minutes while watching so that the oil pressure does not get too high, which is dangerous. After changing oil and checking that the engine functions, drive using lower power settings.&lt;ref name="aircooled.net"/&gt; A high power setting is relative to the vehicle type, so half as many rpm may be necessary if a car has a smaller cylinder wall.

====Start low power====
Revolutions per minute should be around 1500 rpm. Run for about half an hour while checking the oil pressure and begin again should there be any over-boiling of the engine's [[coolant]], which is a combination of air, oil, and water. Once this initial step is completed, drive at varying speeds on the road (or stand) by accelerating between speeds of 30 and 50 miles per hour.&lt;ref&gt;AERA. [http://www.aera.org/downloads/BIP.pdf "BREAK-IN PROCEDURES FOR REMANUFACTURED ENGINES."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917041256/http://www.aera.org/downloads/BIP.pdf |date=September 17, 2010 }} (accessed January 23, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
The following are consequences of a bad engine break-in:&lt;ref name="aircooled.net"/&gt;

* Oil will gather in the cylinder wall, and a vehicle will use much more of it than necessary.
* If a ring does not set into the grooves of the cylinder wall but creates friction against them each time an engine runs, the cylinder wall will be worn out.
* Unsuccessful setting of piston rings into a cylinder wall will result in the necessity of new engine parts, or the entire engine depending on how extensive the damage is.
* Camshaft lobes wear down and are destroyed on flat type lifters in older engine designs.

==Modern versus older break-in regimens==
For many kinds of equipment (with automotive engines being the prime example), the time it takes to complete break-in procedures has decreased significantly from a number of days to a few hours, for several reasons.

The main reason is that the factories in which they are produced are now capable of better machining and assembly. For example, it is easier to hold tighter [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]] now, and the average [[surface finish]] of a new cylinder wall has improved. Manufacturers decades ago were capable of such [[accuracy and precision]], but not with as low a [[unit cost]] or with as much ease. Therefore, the average engine made today resembles, in some technical respects, the top-end custom work of back then.&lt;ref name="MMS_2010-12-14"&gt;{{Citation | last = Zelinski | first = Peter | date = 14 December 2010 | title = Machining for Air Quality | journal = Modern Machine Shop | issue = January 2011 | url = http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/machining-for-air-quality | doi =  | id =  | postscript =. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engine design has changed and most engines use roller lifters not flat lifters. For some equipment, break-in is now done at the factory, obviating end-user break-in. This is advantageous for several reasons. It is a selling point with customers who don't want to have to worry about break-in and want full performance "right out of the box". And it also aligns with the fact that compliance rates are always uncertain in the hands of end users. As with [[compliance (medicine)|medical compliance]] or [[regulatory compliance]], an authority can give all the instructions it wants, but there is no guarantee that the end user will follow them.

The other reason for shorter break-in regimens today is that [[applied science|a greater amount of science has been applied]] to the understanding of break-in, and this has led to the realization that some of the old, long, painstaking break-in regimens were based on specious reasoning {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. People developed elaborate theories on what was needed and why, and it was hard to sift the empirical evidence in trying to test or confirm the theories. [[Anecdotal evidence]] and [[confirmation bias]] definitely played at least some part. Today engineers can confidently advise users not to put too much stock in old theories of long, elaborate break-in regimens{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. Some users will not give credence to the engineers and will stick to their own ideas anyway; but their careful break-in beliefs are still harmless and serve roughly like a placebo in allowing them to assure themselves that they've maximized the equipment's working lifespan through their due diligence.  Some manufacturers have removed break-in procedures because mechanically they are no longer useful.  Other manufacturers list procedures to avoid customer arguments the manual was incomplete because the procedures were missing.  The useful side effect of a "break-in at slower speeds" for vehicles is operator familiarization.  An overly exuberant operator crashing the new vehicle hurts people, reputation and sales.

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}
'''Christian deism''' is a standpoint in the [[philosophy of religion]], which branches from [[Christianity]]. It refers to a deist who believes in the moral teachings—but not divinity—of [[Jesus]]. Corbett and Corbett (1999) cite [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]&lt;!--Discuss on talk page before removing!--&gt; as exemplars.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Corbett and Julia Mitchell Corbett, ''Politics and religion in the United States'' (1999) p. 68
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest-found usage of the term ''Christian deism'' in print in English is in 1738 in a book by [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Thomas Morgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_fP-TKe-PwC&amp;pg=PA189 | title=The moral philosopher: In a dialogue between Philalethes a Christian deist, and Theophanes a Christian Jew | first=Thomas | last=Morgan | authorlink=Thomas Morgan (deist) | year=1738}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing about ten times by 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=%22christian+deism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lpJ0TbX-JpHmsQPxhcTQCw&amp;ved=0CCEQpwUoBA&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=bks%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3ADec+31_2+399%2Ccd_max%3A1799-12-31&amp;tbm= |title=Googlebooks.com search for "Christian Deism" before 1800.}} In most cases it was used to name a group that the author opposed.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''Christian deist'' is found as early as 1722,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | title=Christianity vindicated against infidelity | first=Daniel | last=Waterland | year=1722 | page=63 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4pbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
in ''Christianity vindicated against infidelity'' by Daniel Waterland (he calls it a misuse of language), and adopted later by [[Matthew Tindal]] in his 1730 work, ''Christianity as Old as the Creation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Christianity as Old as the Creation | first=Matthew | last=Tindal |authorlink=Matthew Tindal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aIOAAAAIAAJ | year=1730 |pages=368 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian deism is influenced by [[Christianity]], as well as both main forms of deism: classical and modern. In 1698 English writer Matthew Tindal (1653–1733) published a pamphlet "The Liberty of the Press" as a "Christian" deist.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}{{dubious|date=July 2011|reason= also vague in terms of meaning}} He believed that the state should control the Church in matters of public communication.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C.

It adopts the ethics and non-mystical teachings of Jesus, while denying that Jesus was a deity. Scholars of the founding fathers of the United States "have tended to place the founders' religion into one of three categories—non-Christian deism, Christian deism, and orthodox Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;The faiths of the founding fathers, by David Lynn Holmes, p. 163 (2006)

&lt;/ref&gt;
Possibly the most famed person to hold this position was Thomas Jefferson, who praised "nature's God" in the "Declaration of Independence" (1776) and edited the "[[Jefferson Bible]]"—a Bible with all reference to revelations and other miraculous interventions from a deity cut out.

In an 1803 letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], Jefferson states that he conceived the idea of writing his view of the "Christian system" in a conversation with [[Benjamin Rush]] during 1798–99. He proposes beginning with a review of the morals of the ancient philosophers, moving on to the "deism and ethics of the Jews", and concluding with the "principles of a pure deism" taught by Jesus, "omit[ting] the question of his divinity, and even his inspiration."&lt;ref name="Correspondence"&gt;[http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/jefferson_m_03.html Excerpts from the Correspondence of Thomas Jefferson] Retrieved 12 Jul 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian deists see no paradox in adopting the values and ideals espoused by Jesus without believing he was God. Without providing examples or citations, one author maintains, "A number of influential 17th- and 18th-century thinkers claimed for themselves the title of 'Christian deist' because they accepted both the Christian religion based on revelation and a deistic religion based on natural reason. This deistic religion was consistent with Christianity but independent of any revealed authority. Christian deists often accepted revelation because it could be made to accord with natural or rational religion."&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'', Edgar V. McKnight, p. 96 (1999)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Deism===
Deism is a [[Humanism|humanist]] theological position (though encompassing a wide variety of view-points) concerning God's relationship with the [[Nature|natural world]] which emerged during the [[scientific revolution]] of 17th-century Europe and came to exert a powerful influence during the [[Age of Enlightenment|18th-century enlightenment]].

Deists reject atheism,&lt;ref name="González1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justo L. González|title=The Reformation to the present day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWoHUb5qQccC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=14 Aug 2010|year=1984|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060633165|pages=190–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were a number of different types of deists in the 17th and 18th century.

Deism holds that God does not intervene with the functioning of the natural world in any way, allowing it to run according to the [[Physical law|laws of nature]] that he configured when he created all things. Because God does not control or interfere with his self-sustaining Creation, its component systems work in concert to achieve the balanced natural processes that make up the physical world. As such, Human beings are "free agents in a free world." A "free agent" is someone who has authority and ability to choose his/her actions and who may make mistakes. A "free world" is one which ordinarily operates as it is designed to operate and permits the consequential properties of failure and accident to be experienced by its inhabitants. God is thus conceived to be wholly [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and never [[immanent]]. For deists, human beings can only know God via [[reason]] and the observation of nature but not by revelation or supernatural manifestations (such as miracles)—phenomena which deists regard with caution if not skepticism.

Christian deism is one of several branches of deism to have come about over time:
{{quote|Over time there have been other schools of thought formed under the umbrella of deism including Christian deism, belief in deistic principles coupled with the moral teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and [[Pandeism]], a belief that God became the entire universe and no longer exists as a separate being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/what-is-deism What Is Deism?], Douglas MacGowan, ''[[Mother Nature Network]]'', May 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===History===
[[Williston Walker]], in ''A History of the Christian Church'', wrote: "In its milder form, it emerged as 'rational supernaturalism,' but in its central development it took the form of a full Christian Deism, while its radical wing turned against organized religion as anti-Christian Deism."&lt;ref name="Williston Walker 1985"/&gt; "English Deism on the whole was a cautious, Christian Deism, largely restricted in influence to the upper classes. But a radical anti-Christian Deism, militant in its attack on organized Christianity, though with few supporters, accompanied it."&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Christian church, by Williston Walker, 584 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

An early Christian deist wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For God, according to these [[Philosophers]], makes and governs a natural World that is capable of governing itself, and that might have made itself as well, had they not pass'd a needless and insignificant Compliment upon, the Creator. But I hope they will mend their Scheme, and compound this Matter for their own Honour, and not pretend to fay, that God has made a necessary World, or a self-existent System of Creatures. Yet this is the philosophical Scheme of Atheism, which its Patrons would fain call Deism, and in which the Christian Jews or Jewish Christians assist them, by joining inadvertently in the fame Cry. But if this be not a fine Scheme of Philosophy, let Christian Deism stand for an odd Sort of Religion, and let the Christian Jews be for ever orthodox, and be allow'd as the only religious Men in the World. It is certain, that if God governs moral Agents at all, he must; govern them by Hope and Fear, or by such a wise and suitable Application of Rewards and Punishments, as the different Circumstances of Persons, and the Ends of Government require. And these Rewards and Punishments must be such as are not the natural, necessary Consequences of the Actions themselves, themselves, since every one must see that this would be no Government at all, and that the Case, in this Respect, must be the very same whether we suppose any rectoral Justice, or any Presence or Operation of God in the World or not. And yet this which is really no Government at all, is all the general Providence which some seem willing to allow. But since those Gentlemen are all deep Philosophers, and above the gross Ignorance of the common Herd, I would here only ask them, What are the Laws of Nature ? What is the Law of Gravity, the Law of communicating Motion from one Body to another by Impulse, and the Law of the Vis -Inertia of Bodies ? Are these natural, essential and inherent Properties of the Bodies themselves, or are they the regular Effects of some universal, extrinsick Cause acting incessantly upon the whole material System, by such and such general Laws and Conditions of Agency?&lt;ref&gt;The moral philosopher: in a dialogue between Philalethes, a Christian deist and Theophanes a Christian Jew. By Thomas Morgan, 189-190 (1737).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This may give the Reader some Notion of this Writer's Candour and Sincerity, and what we are to think of his pretended Regard for Christianity, which in Effect amounts to this: That the Christianity revealed in the Writings of the New Testament is Jewish Christianity; that is, Christianity corrupted and adulterated with Judaism, which according to him is the worst Religion in the World. But the true and genuine Christianity is Christian Deism, to be learned not from the Writings of the New Testament, but from the Volume of Nature, from every Man's own Breast, from the Heavens, the Earth, and especially the Brute Creatures,the genuine uncorrupted Instructors in our Author's Christianity. So that the "Gentlemen that assume to themselves the Title of Deists, seem resolved that for the future they only shall be called the true Christians too. Those that look upon the New Testament to be divinely inspired, and receive it as the Rule of their Faith, and take their Religion from thence, must be called Christian Jews, who only put a strange Mixture of inconsistent Religions upon the World for Christianity : whereas these Christian Deists teach it in its Purity, and in order to propagate pure uncorrupted Christianity they do their utmost to discard.the Writings of the New Testament, that Is, the Writings that give us aft Account of the Doctrines taught by Christ and his Apostles, But since these Gentlemen will not allow; us the honorable Title of Christians, it is but fair that they should leave us that of Free-Thinkers, to which I really think the Advocates for the Gospel Revelation have a much juster Pretension than they.&lt;ref&gt;''The divine authority of the Old and New Testament asserted'', by John Leland, p viii-ix (1739)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Christian foundation===
In conjunction with deistic perspectives, Christian deism incorporates Christian tenets. Christian deists believe that [[Jesus Christ]] was a deist. Jesus taught that there are two basic laws of God governing humankind. The first law is that life comes from God and we are to use it as God intends, as illustrated in Jesus' parable of the [[Attic talent|talents]]. The second law is that God intends for human beings to live by love for each other, as illustrated in Jesus' parable of the good Samaritan.

Jesus summarized two basic "commandments" or laws of God as "love for God and love for neighbor." These two commandments through Christian deism were known to Jesus from the Hebrew scriptures but Jesus expanded the definition of "neighbor" to include everyone concerned in the natural world. "Love for God" means having appreciation for God as the creator of the world and the source of human life. "Love for neighbor" means having appreciation for the value of every human life. These are not laws or "truths" that Jesus received through some supernatural "revelation" according to Christian deism. In his "parable of the sower," Jesus taught that the "word of God" is known naturally because it is sown "in the heart" of everyone. For instance, the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], who was a Jew, recognized that God's laws are known naturally by everyone. Paul wrote, "When Gentiles (non-Jews) who do not have the (Mosaic) law do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts" (Romans 2:14-15). Christian deism is therefore based on appreciation for all creation and on appreciation for every human life.

In his teachings, Jesus used examples from the natural world and from human nature to explain basic truths about life. In his parables, Jesus spoke of mustard seeds, wheat, weeds, fishing nets, pearls, vineyards, fig trees, salt, candlelight and sheep to illustrate his points. Jesus also used illustrations from human nature to teach basic concepts such as repentance, forgiveness, justice, and love.

Jesus called for people to follow God's laws, or commandments, so the "kingdom of God" could come "on earth as it is in heaven." As Jesus preached the "gospel", or good news, that the "kingdom of God is at hand," Christians deists believe the Romans viewed Jesus as a Jewish revolutionary seeking to liberate the Jews from Roman rule. Jesus refused to stop preaching his "gospel" even though he knew that he was risking crucifixion, the usual Roman penalty for revolutionaries. Jesus called for his followers to take this same risk, "If a man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it" (Mark 8:34-35).

After his crucifixion, Jesus' cross became a symbol of commitment to establishing the "kingdom of God" on earth. Christian deists are committed to following God's natural laws, as summarized in the two "commandments" to love God and love our neighbor.

==Different schools of thought==
The broad spectrum of thought available within the idea of a Christian deism encompasses models of [[Deism#The history of classical deism|classical deism]] and [[pandeism]] with simple [[Reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the message of [[Toleration|tolerance]] claimed as espoused by the human Jesus, to belief in Jesus as a sort of naturally occurring divine figure, a mystical product of the rational processes of a rational [[universe]]. An example of the broadness attributed to Christian deism is found in this criticism of the position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christian Deist, i.e., a man who alleges that the Christian religion is nothing else than pure natural religion. The Deist, whom he introduces speaking, speaks with great presumption, as the ignorant are accustomed to do: that he neither possessed any acquaintance with the ancient languages nor with history, which he betrays in the very beginning, awakens no good anticipations in favour of Morgan, who appears in the person of the Deist. Morgan alleges with great boldness, that his religion of reason alone is divine, that the Christian is a mere invention and device of man, and through all ages since its introduction, has been regarded as such by a small but oppressed party: that the character of [[Judaism]], which is not only human, but altogether devilish, cleaves still to the followers of a blind faith': that the apostle Paul was the chief of the freethinkers who wished to have no connexion with Judaism, and alone preached Christianity in its purity, whilst the other apostles were merely the chiefs of a political party who in the spirit of Judaism had attached themselves to it.

....

The freer Paulinian party, according to Morgan's view, had been from the first always persecuted and oppressed by the others; and although the Jewish Christians had afterwards fallen asunder and separated into various hostile sects, the same intolerant Jewish spirit still, in a greater or a less degree, animated them all, and they would not consent to relinquish the service of sacrifices; this spirit has given birth to a religion of priests among all those sects, which is immeasurably removed from the true religion. In addition, Morgan will not at all admit that his opinions approach in any respect to atheism, or that his object is to defend any thing similar to it; he alone, as he alleges, is a teacher of the true moral religion. It will not therefore be a matter of surprise, that a division of his book treats of the public forms of divine worship, and especially upon prayer. On the other hand, his Christian Deist will have nothing to do with sacrifices or satisfaction,—nothing with the vicarious death of Christ,—nothing with sacrifices and ceremonies,—with grace or election, which does not depend upon the merit of the person elected.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Eighteenth Century and of the Nineteenth'', by F.C. Schlosser, p. 47 (1843)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christian deists do not worship Jesus as God. However, there are differing views concerning the exact nature of Jesus, as well as differing levels of hewing to traditional, orthodox deistic belief on this issue. There are two main theological positions.

===Jesus as the Son of God===
Of the Christian deists who look upon Jesus as the Son of God, (but not God himself), the Christian aspect of their faith is drawn from three main aspects of prior Christian thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlightenmentdeism.com/?page_id=156 |title=Christian Deism |publisher=Enlightenment Deism |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They take a modified view of [[Pelagius]], that there is no need for divine aid in performing good works and that the only "grace" necessary is the declaration of the law. They also hold a mild version of the [[moral influence theory of atonement]] philosophy. They combine these two philosophies with certain aspects of classical [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theology. Indeed, mainstream deistic thought contributed to the rise of Unitarianism itself, with people in the 19th century increasingly self-identifying as Unitarians rather than as deists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Campbell Mossner|Mossner, Ernest Campbell]] (1967). "Deism". The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Vol. 2. Collier-MacMillan. pp. 326–336&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jesus as a moral teacher===
Christian deists who do not believe in Jesus as the son of God strongly reject any theories of atonement.

Different theories receive different levels of rejection, the strongest rejection being reserved for the theory of [[penal substitution]], that claims that Jesus had to die as a sacrifice to pay the "death penalty" for humankind and save them from the "wrath" of God. And they do not view God as a whimsical tyrant who sends plagues and pestilence to punish people on earth and who plans to torture people in "[[hell]]" in the future. Christian deists reject these ideas as products of human hatred and a failure to recognize God's natural laws of love for others.

Christian deists consider themselves to be disciples, or students, of Jesus because Jesus taught the natural laws of God. But Christian deists believe that Jesus was only human.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christiandeism.com/Jesus.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925150953/http://christiandeism.com/Jesus.html |date=25 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus had to struggle with his own times of disappointment, sorrow, anger, prejudice, impatience, and despair, just as other human beings struggle with these experiences. Jesus never claimed to be perfect but he was committed to following God's natural laws of love.

==Diverging from Christianity and deism==
Christian deism can differ from both mainstream deism and orthodox Christianity. This can occasionally be on the same subject but most often, Christian deism finds itself in agreement with one on a given theological topic, only to disagree on the next theological topic.

Christian deism is opposed to the doctrine of predestination in which everything that happens is thought to be the will of God, and instead tend to believe in the concept of free will. [[John Calvin]] was a proponent of the theory of predestination in which God allegedly determines everything that happens, whether good or bad. Christian deists believe that it is never God's will for anyone to be sick or injured. In that bad things occur as a result of prior interactions that resulted in a specified outcome. These bad things may be caused by interfering with naturalistic processes that result in negative consequences to carbon-based life, or by human interaction on the surface of the Earth that leads to degrees of inhospitable conditions for others. Christians deists believe God gifted the human intellect to heal many illnesses, but God does not directly intervene to heal people on demand by some supernatural occurrence. Humans are believed to already have the endowed capacity to create synergies and contribute in some way toward the development of fairer societies on Earth, whether it be through scientific understanding or spiritual enlightenment. However, Christian deists also strongly oppose the mainstream deistic notion that sacred texts like the Bible contain no revealed truths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-deist.blogspot.com/ |title=the christian deist café |publisher=Christian-deist.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christiandeism.com/beliefs/ |title=Beliefs |publisher=Christiandeism.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The determination of the overall effectiveness of force employment during military operations. Combat assessment is composed of three major components:
*[[battle damage assessment]] (BDA)
*[[munitions effects assessment]]
*[[reattack recommendation]].

The GS-3 is normally the single point of contact for combat assessment at the joint force level, assisted by the joint force GS-2.

'''David Wilkinson''' (January 5, 1771 – February 3, 1852)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Resources/Wilkinson_David.cfm ASME.org bio&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[mechanical engineer]] who invented a [[lathe]] for cutting screw threads, which was  extremely important in the development of the machine tool industry in the early 19th century.

==Early life==
David Wilkinson was born at [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]] in 1771, the son of Oziel Wilkinson, a skilled [[blacksmith]] who moved his family to [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] in the 1780s.

About 1784, his father, Oziel began making anchors in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] for the emerging shipbuilding industry. The shop was powered by water from the [[Blackstone River]], and was located on the grounds of the present-day [[Slater Mill Historic Site]].

==Industrial career==
In 1790, [[Samuel Slater]] and his partners were interested in building a textile spinning mill in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] he sought the assistance of David Wilkinson and his father Oziel to produce the machinery for his new mill. They produced iron forgings and castings for Slater's carding and spinning machines.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“all the turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by [[Samuel Slater|Mr. Slater]] was done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand power”.  David Wilkinson&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomson|2009|pp=24|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1793 Slater's operations were moved from a clothier's shop near the Pawtucket Falls to a new mill, which today is part of the [[Slater Mill Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5659.pdf The Wilkinson Mill brochure, Gary Kulik and Patrick M. Malone, October 12, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795 Oziel Wilkinson built a rolling and slitting mill just south of Slater's cotton mill. Both mills were powered with water from the same trench.

==Wilkinson lathe==
Textile machinery manufacturer and scientific writer [[Zachariah Allen]] had the following to say about Wilkinson's lathe in 1861:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“It has to this day proved the most effective tool placed within the control of mankind for shaping refractory metals and for accomplishing the triumph of mind over matter.  The slide engine is employed in the great machine shops of America and Europe.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ross Tompson (2009) on the importance of Wilkinson's lathe:&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"&gt;{{cite book

|location= Baltimore, MD
|isbn= 978-0-8018-9141-0}}
|page=262
&lt;/ref&gt;

:'In his "Reminiscences", Wilkinson claimed his lathe was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"worth all the other tools in use, in any workshop in the world, for finishing [machining] brass and iron"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the versatility of his lathe Wilkinson said:&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The weighted side, the joint made by gravity, applies to planing, turning, and boring of metals of every kind, and in every way."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An 1848 report from the Committee on Military Affairs to the U.S. Senate highlighted the importance of Wilkinson's invention, for which the patent had expired in 1812:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Being left open to general use, an invention so vastly important in its character could not fail to be sought after, not only in the public at large, but also by agents of the government engaged in the fabrication of arms of various descriptions; and hence we find the gauge and sliding lathe was early introduced and made use of by all the arsenals and armories of the United States."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report went on to say 'Wilkinson was the "true and undisputed author" of the lathe, and that it was "indispensable" for making firearms, and that public armories used 200 lathes based on the invention.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"/&gt;  The report recommended a $10,000 reward, which he was given.

Wilkinson failed to generate much income from his lathe. Records exist for the sale of one lathe and a few parts.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"/&gt;

David Wilkinson's lathe is often compared to [[Henry Maudslay|Henry Maudslay's]] which is believed to have been invented a few years before Wilkinson's.  Maudslay's lathe used change gears which allowed it to cut threads of various pitches, without which Wilkinson's could only cut a fixed pitch.  Wilkinson's lathe could handle heavier work.&lt;ref name ="McNeil1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology |last=McNeil |first=Ian|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-14792-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilkinson Mill==
In 1810, the present-day Wilkinson Mill was built near their existing rolling and slitting mill and Slater's cotton mill. Three and one-half stories tall and constructed from field stones, it contained a machine shop on the first floor and cotton spinning mill on the upper floors.

In 1829, during a depression in the textile industry, David Wilkinson was forced to sell his mills. He left [[Rhode Island]] settling initially in [[Cohoes, New York]]. In 1831 the mill was sold to William Field and Thomas LeFavour. The mill would later be used to produce woolen and knitted textiles. Between 1873 and 1887 Lorenzo P. Bosworth operated a machine shop in the mill. He produced machinery and tools for the leather and jewelry industries. A braiding company would occupy the second and third floors between 1884 and 1901.

The Wilkinson Mill was later sold to the Pawtucket Electric Lighting Company. It was also used as a furniture warehouse during the 20th century.

==Legacy==
The Wilkinson Mill was restored in the early 1970s as part of the [[Slater Mill Historic Site]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. The [[watermill]] site currently features a working 16,000-pound breastshot [[water wheel]] that powers, via [[gear|gear systems]] and leather [[pulley]]s, various [[drive shaft]]s to operate machinery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slatermill.org/museum/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) designated the Wilkinson Mill in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/Wilkinson_Mill_1810.cfm #30 Wilkinson Mill (1810)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Destratification''' is a process in which the air or water is mixed in order to eliminate [[Lake stratification|stratified layers]] of temperature, plant, or animal life. The first example of destratification was in 1919, in a small reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lake-aeration.com/effects_of_destratification_circulation.asp Effects of Destratification] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120906100952/http://www.lake-aeration.com/effects_of_destratification_circulation.asp |date=2012-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[pond]]'s condition deteriorates when the [[Benthic zone|bottom environment]] cannot support animal life. The bottom is the area that runs out of oxygen first, it is where the most oxygen is used, and it is the farthest from the surface where it is replenished. Without oxygen a lake or pond's self-purification capability is not only reduced, it is reversed. The small animals, snails, worms, bacteria, etc., which help keep a pond clean cannot live, and the pond's nutrients are then recycled from the [[sediment]]. This forms a layer of [[Muck (soil)|muck]] at the bottom which serves as a fertilizer for weed and excessive [[algae]] growth. It can also cause large [[fish kill]]s.

==Life==
Dorra Bouzid was born in [[Sfax]]. After her father died, her mother Cherifa defied family expectation by moving to [[Nabeul]] in the early 1930s, riding a bicycle, teaching primary school and marrying the writer [[Mahmoud Messadi]]. Dorra and her sister were educated at a French [[Secondary_education_in_France#Lycée|lycée]].&lt;ref name="LorcinShepard2016"/&gt;

In the late 1940s Bouzid studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Tunis. However, her mother insisted she study [[pharmacy]] to be self-sufficient, and so she enrolled the Faculty of Pharmacy in Paris in 1951. There she joined the [[North African Muslim Students Association]] (AEMNA), and helped organize a newspaper combining nationalism and syndicalism, before returning to Tunis to practice pharmacy.&lt;ref name="LorcinShepard2016"/&gt;

The editor of the nationalist newspaper ''[[L'Action]]'' recruited Bouzid to write a women's column, which became a full page entitled "Feminine Action'. In 1955 she published there a 'Call for Emancipation Law' demanding full rights for women. The following year [[Habib Bourguiba]] promulgated the [[Code of Personal Status in Tunisia|Code of Personal Status]], modernizing the law with regard to women. In 1959 Bouzid became the head editor of the feminist magazine ''[[Faiza (magazine)|Faiza]]'', recently founded by [[Safia Farhat]]. In the early 1960s Dorra was sent by Bourguiba on an informal diplomatic mission to Morocco.&lt;ref name="LorcinShepard2016"/&gt;

Bouzid was the subject of a 2012 documentary by [[Walid Tayaa]], ''Dorra Bouzid, une Tunisienne, un combat''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maghrebdesfilms.fr/dorra-bouzid-une-tunisienne-un-combat.html Dorra Bouzid, une Tunisienne, un combat]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''double inverted pendulum''' is the combination of the [[inverted pendulum]] and the [[double pendulum]]. The double inverted pendulum is unstable, meaning that it will fall down unless it is controlled in some way. The two main methods of controlling a double inverted pendulum are moving the base, as with the inverted pendulum, or by applying a torque at the pivot point between the two pendulums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Dynamic simulation''' (or dynamic system simulation) is the use of a computer program to model the time varying behavior of a system. The systems are typically described by [[ordinary differential equations]] or [[partial differential equations]]. As [[mathematical model]]s incorporate real-world constraints, like gear [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]] and rebound from a hard stop, equations become nonlinear. This requires numerical methods to solve the equations. A [[numerical simulation]] is done by stepping through a time interval and calculating the integral of the derivatives by approximating the area under the derivative curves. Some methods use a fixed step through the interval, and others use an adaptive step that can shrink or grow automatically to maintain an acceptable error tolerance. Some methods can use different time steps in different parts of the simulation model. Industrial uses of dynamic simulation are many and range from nuclear power, steam turbines, 6 degree of freedom vehicle modeling, electric motors, econometric models, biological systems, robot arms, mass spring dampers, hydraulic systems, and drug dose migration through the human body to name a few. These models can often be run in real time to give a virtual response close to the actual system. This is useful in [[process control]] and [[mechatronic]] systems for tuning the [[automatic control]] systems before they are connected to the real system, or for human training before they control the real system.
Simulation is also used in computer games and animation and can be accelerated by using a [[physics engine]], the technology used in many powerful [[computer graphics]] [[software]] [[computer program|programs]], like [[3ds Max]], [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[Lightwave]], and many others to simulate physical characteristics. In computer animation, things like [[hair]], [[cloth]], [[liquid]], [[fire]], and [[wiktionary:particles|particles]] can be easily modeled, while the human [[animator]] animates simpler objects. Computer-based dynamic animation was first used at a very simple level in the 1989 [[Pixar]] [[short film]] ''Knick Knack'' to move the fake snow in the snowglobe and pebbles in a fish tank.

== Example of dynamic simulation ==
[[Image:TRUE_Procedural_Animation.gif|right|[[Piston motion equations]]|frame]]
This animation was made with a software system dynamics, with a 3D modeler. The calculated values are associated with parameters of the rod and crank. In this example the crank is driving, we vary both the speed of rotation, its radius and the length of the rod, the piston follows.

'''Eavesdropping''' is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private [[conversation]] or [[communication]]s of others without their consent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Garner, p. 550{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is widely regarded as unethical, and in many jurisdictions is illegal.

==Etymology==
The verb ''eavesdrop'' is a back-formation from the noun ''eavesdropper'' ("a person who eavesdrops"), which was formed from the related noun ''eavesdrop'' ("the dripping of water from the eaves of a house; the ground on which such water falls").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eavesdrop|title=eavesdrop - Definition of eavesdrop in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eavesdropper was someone who would hang from the eave of a building so as to hear what is said within. The PBS documentaries, ''Inside the Court of Henry VIII'' (April 8, 2015)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Court of Henry VIII|url=https://www.pbs.org/program/inside-court-henry-viii/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|date=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Secrets of Henry VIII’s Palace'' (June 30, 2013) include segments that display and discuss "eavedrops", carved wooden figures [[Henry VIII]] had built into the [[eaves]] (overhanging edges of the beams in the ceiling) of [[Hampton Court]] to discourage unwanted gossip or dissension from the King's wishes and rule, to foment paranoia and fear,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and demonstrate that everything said there was being overheard; literally, that the walls had ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stollznow, Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=August 7, 2014|title=Eavesdropping: etymology, meaning, and some creepy little statues|url=http://karenstollznow.com/eavesdropping/|website=KarenStollznow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Eavesdropping vectors include [[telephone]] lines, [[cellular network|cellular networks]], [[email]], and other methods of private instant messaging. [[VoIP]] communications software is also vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping via infections such as [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Network attacks==
Network eavesdropping is a network layer attack that focuses on capturing small ''packets'' from the network transmitted by other computers and reading the data content in search of any type of information. This type of network attack is generally one of the most effective as a lack of encryption services are used. It is also linked to the collection of metadata. Those who perform this type of attack are generally black hat hackers; however, government agencies, such as the [[National Security Agency]], have also been connected.

{{italic title}}
'''''Encyclopaedia Biblica: A Critical Dictionary of the Literary, Political and Religion History, the Archeology, Geography and Natural History of the Bible''''' (1899), edited by [[Thomas Kelly Cheyne]] and [[John Sutherland Black|J. Sutherland Black]], is a critical encyclopedia of the [[Bible]]. In [[theology]] and [[biblical studies]], it is often referenced as ''Enc. Bib.'', or as ''Cheyne and Black''.

==Description==
[[File:C+B-Ethiopia-Fig3-PyramidOfMeroe.PNG|thumb|right|150px|An image illustrating the article 'Ethiopia' – one of the [[Nubian pyramids]] at [[Meroe]]]]
It has an article for every single name and place both in the Bible and in its traditional [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], as well as for each of the books of these, together with many improper nouns appearing in these (such as ''nebi'im'', 'mole', 'owl') and other more general subjects (such as 'music', 'tents', etc.). Many of these articles are given in great detail, and usually include mention of the various spellings for each word as used by the [[Masoretic Text]], [[Septuagint]] (differentiating between each of the most important ancient manuscripts), and by other ancient versions; the largest article is that on the Gospels, which is over 5 MB in size, despite being almost completely plain text (and therefore over half a million words long). It is thus an extremely large work – in PDF form it constitutes a total of about 190 MB of mostly plain text (this would equate to nearly 20 million words, even at 10 characters per word).

It is frequently referenced by other respected Bible-related encyclopedias of the period, such as the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;for example, it is a source for [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05646b.htm the article 'Eve'] in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and 11th Edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref&gt;,{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hosea |volume=13 |pages=784–786 |first1=William Robertson |last1=Smith |first2=Henry Wheeler |last2=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' has some articles ('marriage' for example) which quote large sections from it nearly verbatim. It is also referenced by works such as the ''[[International Standard Bible Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibleencyclopedia.com/aaron.htm the article on Aaron], for example&lt;/ref&gt; It is hence, indirectly, also a source for some articles of the [[English Wikipedia]], mainly related to the Judaeo-Christian religion.

A measure of its importance of some of the contributors is gained from the fact that the Jewish Encyclopedia dedicates the majority of the article 'Jerahmeel' to discussing Cheyne's theory of the Jerahmeelites, despite regarding it as arbitrary.

The articles are still of value and interest to modern scholars,&lt;ref&gt;As reading material suggested by the University of Calgary, for example: [https://www.ucalgary.ca/~lipton/dict.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As a source for the archaeology department at [[Tel Aviv University]][http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/archaeology/directory/dir_anson_rainey.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]]ic writers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/2132/ e.g.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to religio-political commentators such as [[Jihad Watch]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jihadwatch.org/2008/03/blogging-the-quran-sura-17-the-night-journey-verses-2-111.html Blogging the Qur’an: Sura 17, “The Night Journey,” verses 2-111], [[Jihad Watch]], referenced as 'enc. bib.'{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}&lt;!-- Blogs are not normally considered reliable--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; however, modern archaeological research and discoveries have made portions of it obsolete, and modern interpretations are of even older material is likely to be very different. For example, the Jerahmeelite/Arabian theory (see below) has long been ignored. It is no longer restricted by [[copyright]] and has become available [[online]] ([[Wikisource:Encyclopaedia Biblica|at wikisource]], for example).

== Cheyne's 'surprising' theory about the Jerahmeelites ==

Professor Cheyne put forth a surprising&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel"&gt;[[Jewish Encyclopedia]], [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=J&amp;artid=223 Jerahmeel]&lt;/ref&gt; theory concerning the [[Jerahmeel]]ites. In his view they were a powerful north-Arabian tribe, with which the Hebrews came into conflict on their first approach to the land. A part of the Jerahmeelites was absorbed by the Hebrews, but there were many contests between the Israelites and the main body of the Jerahmeelites all through the period of [[Books of Kings|the Kings]]. Even among the post-exilic opponents of Nehemiah, the Jerahmeelites appear again. Cheyne believes that echoes of these conflicts once reverberated throughout the [[Old Testament]], but that, owing to the corruption of the Masoretic Text, they must now be reawakened by conjectural emendation of the text.

Carrying out this idea, Cheyne finds the chief elements of Israel's origin, religion, and history in Jerahmeel. Babylonia and Assyria sink into insignificance beside Jerahmeel in so far as influence on the Old Testament is concerned. "Amalekites" is a corruption of "Jerahmeelites"; "Beer-lahai-roi" (Gen. xvi. 14) is a corruption of "Well of Jerahmeel"; "Ephraim" is often a corruption of "Jerahmeel." The epithet of [[Jericho]], "city of palm-trees," is a corruption of "city of Jerahmeel"; the names of Saul, of Kish, his father, and of most of the sons of Saul are held to be corruptions of "Jerahmeel"; and Isaiah's "Maher-shalal-hash-baz" is held to be a corruption of "Jerahmeel will be deserted." "Jerahmeel" has been displaced by "Babylon" in Isa. xiii. and xiv.; and Ezekiel's three wise men were "Enoch, Jerahmeel, and Arab." This list might be continued indefinitely.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt;

By the same principle, he derives other names from "Rehoboth", "Zarephath", "Mizraim", and "Arab";  he does '''not''' equate "[[Mizraim]]" with Egypt (the usual interpretation). The vast majority of names of places and people in the bible are connected by Cheyne to Jerahmeel, or one of these.

The ingenuity of Cheyne's method may be admitted;&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt; but the thesis must be rejected as altogether arbitrary.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt; That it has received serious attention is owing solely to the great service rendered by its sponsor in other departments of Old Testament research.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopediaOnCheyneAndJerahmeel" /&gt;

Cheyne frequently mentions this theory in his Encyclopaedia articles, often appending his view to articles written by people with more mainstream interpretations. He does, however, detail the alternative (and therefore mainstream) views, while doing so. Hence the articles are respected, as long as Cheyne's theory about these names is ignored.

'''Endurance art''' is a kind of [[performance art]] involving some form of hardship, such as pain, solitude or exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;For artists in endurance performances "[q]uestioning the limits of their bodies," Tatiana A. Koroleva, ''Subversive Body in Performance Art'', ProQuest, 2008, pp. 29, 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Performances that focus on the passage of long periods of time are also known as '''durational art''' or '''durational performances'''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Allain, Jen Harvie, ''The Routledge Companion to Theatre and Performance'', Routledge, 2014, p. 221. Other terms include duration art, live art or time-based art.&lt;p&gt;
Beth Hoffmann, "The Time of Live Art," in [[Deirdre Heddon]], Jennie Klein (eds.), ''Histories and Practices of Live Art'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer Michael Fallon traces the genre to the work of [[Chris Burden]] in California in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fallon, ''Creating the Future: Art and Los Angeles in the 1970s'', Counterpoint, 2014, p. 106: "Burden's performances were so widely observed that they took on a life beyond the artist, helping create a new art genre, 'endurance art' ..." &lt;/ref&gt; Burden spent five days in a locker in ''Five-Day Locker Piece'' (1971), had himself shot in ''Shoot'' (1971), and lived for 22 days in a bed in an art gallery in ''Bed Piece'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Emily Anne Kuriyama, [http://ca.complex.com/style/2013/10/chris-burden-art-new-museum/back-to-you "Everything You Need to Know About Chris Burden's Art Through His Greatest Works"], ''Complex'', 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of endurance art include [[Tehching Hsieh]]'s ''One Year Performance 1980–1981 (Time Clock Piece)'', in which for 12 months he punched a time clock every hour, and ''Art/Life One Year Performance 1983–1984 (Rope Piece)'', in which Hsieh and [[Linda Montano]] spent a year tied to each other by an eight-foot rope.&lt;ref name=Taylor30April2014&gt;Andrew Taylor, [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/tehching-hsieh-the-artist-who-took-the-punches-as-they-came-20140429-37fri.html "Tehching Hsieh: The artist who took the punches as they came"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 30 April 2014: "Don't try this endurance art at home. That is Tehching Hsieh's advice to artists inspired to emulate the five year-long performances he began in the late 1970s."&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The House with the Ocean View'' (2003), [[Marina Abramović]] lived silently for 12 days without food or entertainment on a stage entirely open to the audience.&lt;ref name=McEvilleyApril2003&gt;Thomas McEvilley, "Performing the Present Tense – A recent piece by Marina Abramovic blended endurance art and Buddhist meditation," ''Art in America'', 91(4), April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such is the physical stamina required for some of her work that in 2012 she set up what she called a [[Fitness boot camp|"boot camp"]] in Hudson, New York, for participants in her multiple-person performances.&lt;ref name=Feiss23May2012/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7325">'''The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse''' is a term for [[internet]] [[criminal]]s, or the [[image]]ry of internet criminals.

==Popular usage==
A play on [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], it refers to types of criminals who use the internet to facilitate crime and consequently jeopardize the rights of honest internet users. There does not appear to be an exact definition for who the Horsemen are, but they are usually described as [[Terrorism|terrorist]]s, [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]]s, [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Other sources use slightly different descriptions but generally refer to the same types of criminals. The term was [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Timothy C. May]] in 1988, who referred to them as "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The term seems to be used less often in discussions about online criminal activity, but more often in discussions about the negative, or [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effects]] such activity has had on regular users' daily experiences online.
It is also used frequently to describe the political tactic "[[Think of the children]]".  A message from the [[Cypherpunk|same]] mailing list states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quotation|How to get what you want in 4 easy stages:
# Have a target "thing" you wish to stop, yet lack any moral, or practical reasons for doing so?
# Pick a fear common to lots of people, something that will evoke a gut reaction: terrorists, pedophiles, serial killers.
# Scream loudly to the media that "thing" is being used by perpetrators.  (Don't worry if this is true, or common to all other things, or less common with "thing" than with other long established systems—payphones, paper mail, private hotel rooms, lack of bugs in all houses etc.)
# Say that the only way to stop perpetrators is to close down "thing", or to regulate it to death, or to have laws forcing en masse tapability of all private communications on "thing".  Don't worry if communicating on "thing" is a constitutionally protected right, if you have done a good job in choosing and publicising the horsemen in 2, no one will notice, they will be too busy clamouring for you to save them from the supposed evils.

The four supposed threats may be used all at once or individually, depending on the circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Examples==

In 2013, the director of the Safe Internet League (a voluntary [[Internet censorship in Russia|censorship group in Russia]]) claimed that pedophiles, perverts, drug dealers “and other creeps”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia’s FSB mulls ban on ‘Tor’ online anonymity network|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/russia-tor-anonymizer-ban-571/|website=Russia Today|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; were using the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] anonymity software, as a reason why the software should be outlawed.  This list did not mention terrorists or money-launderers directly, but did use the catch-all phrase "other creeps" that potentially includes them.

In 2015, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative party]] claimed that their proposed “new communications data legislation will strengthen our ability to disrupt terrorist plots, criminal networks and organised child grooming gangs”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gayle|first1=Damien|title=Right to privacy 'could be meaningless in 10 years under Tory and Labour plans'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/22/right-to-privacy-could-be-meaningless-in-10-years-under-tory-and-labour-plans|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc." quote of Timothy C. May.

Later in 2015, [[Gamma Group]] released a statement claiming that their surveillance technology is used "against terrorist threats, drug cartels, other major organised crime, and paedophile rings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nick Hopkins|author2=Jake Morris|title=UK firm's surveillance kit 'used to crush Uganda opposition'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34529237|website=BBC News|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as justification for concerns that it was being used to target opposition politicians and media groups in [[Uganda]].  With money-laundering treated as a major organised crime, this quote matches very closely with the list given in the Cypherpunk FAQ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10679">A '''gene cassette''' is a type of [[mobile genetic element]] that contains a gene and a [[Site-specific recombination|recombination]] site. Each cassette usually contains a single gene and tend to be very small; on the order of 500–1000 base pairs. They may exist incorporated into an [[integron]] or freely as circular DNA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7783631|year=1995|last1=Hall|first1=RM|last2=Collis|first2=CM|title=Mobile gene cassettes and integrons: Capture and spread of genes by site-specific recombination|volume=15|issue=4|pages=593–600|journal=Molecular Microbiology|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02368.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene cassettes can move around within an organism's genome or be transferred to another organism in the environment via [[horizontal gene transfer]]. These cassettes often carry [[antibiotic resistance]] [[gene]]s. An example would be the ''[[Kanamycin#The KanMX marker|kanMX]]'' cassette which confers [[kanamycin]] (an [[antibiotic]]) resistance upon [[bacteria]].

== Integrons ==
{{Main article|Integron}}
Integrons are genetic structures in [[bacteria]] which express and are capable of acquiring and exchanging gene cassettes. The integron consists of a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], an attachment site, and an [[integrase]] gene that encodes a [[Site-specific recombination|site-specific]] [[recombinase]]&lt;ref name="pmid24367362"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rapa RA, Labbate M | title=The function of integron-associated gene cassettes in Vibrio species: the tip of the iceberg | journal= [[Frontiers in Microbiology]] | volume=4 | year=2013 | pages=385 | doi=10.3389/fmicb.2013.00385 | pmc=3856429 | pmid=24367362 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three classes of integrons described.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mobile units that insert into integrons are gene cassettes.&lt;ref name="pmid24367362" /&gt; For cassettes that carry a single gene without a promoter, the entire series of cassettes is [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] from an adjacent promoter within the integron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collis|first=C. M.|last2=Hall|first2=R. M.|date=1995-01-01|title=Expression of antibiotic resistance genes in the integrated cassettes of integrons|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|volume=39|issue=1|pages=155–162|issn=0066-4804|pmc=162502|pmid=7695299|via=|doi=10.1128/aac.39.1.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene cassettes are speculated to be inserted and excised via a circular intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collis|first=Christina M.|last2=Hall|first2=Ruth M.|date=1992-10-01|title=Gene cassettes from the insert region of integrons are excised as covalently closed circles|journal=Molecular Microbiology|language=en|volume=6|issue=19|pages=2875–2885|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1992.tb01467.x|issn=1365-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would involve recombination between short sequences found at their termini and known as 59 base elements (59-be)—which may not be 59 bases long. The 59-be are a diverse family of sequences that function as recognition sites for the site-specific integrase  (enzyme responsible for integrating the gene cassette into an integron) that occur downstream from the gene coding sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=R. M.|last2=Brookes|first2=D. E.|last3=Stokes|first3=H.

=== Diversity and Prevalence ===
The ability of genetic elements like gene cassettes to excise and insert into genomes results in highly similar gene regions appearing in distantly related organisms. The three classes of integrons are similar in structure and are identified by where the insertions occur and what systems they coincide with. Class 1 integrons are seen in a diverse group of bacterial genomes and likely are all descendant from one common ancestor. The prevalence of the integron has shaped bacterial evolution by allowing rapid transfer of genes that are novel to an organism, such as antibiotic resistance genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillings|first=Michael|date=Jan 2017|title=Class 1 Integrons as Invasive Species|url=|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|volume=38|pages=10–15|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2017.03.002|pmid=28414952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic engineering ==
In [[genetic engineering]], a gene cassette is a manipulable fragment of DNA carrying, and capable of expressing, one or more genes of interest between one or more sets of [[restriction site]]s. It can be transferred from one DNA sequence (usually on a [[Plasmid#Vectors|vector]]) to another by 'cutting' the fragment out using [[restriction enzyme]]s and 'pasting' it back into the new context. The vectors containing the gene of interest typically carry an antibiotic resistance gene also to easily identify cells that have successfully integrated the vector into their genome.

To introduce a vector into a target cell, a state of [[Natural competence|competence]] must be inferred on the cell. This state is induced in the lab by incubating cells with calcium chloride before a brief heat shock, or by [[electroporation]]. This makes the cells more susceptible to the plasmid that is being inserted. Once the plasmid has been added, the cells are grown in the presence of an antibiotic to confirm the uptake and expression of the new genetic elements.

The usage of CRISPR/Cas9 systems has shown success in inserting genes into eukaryotic genomes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/questions-and-answers-about-crispr Broad Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; While CRISPR modification is still in its infancy, there is significant evidence for usage in combination with other techniques to produce high throughput (HTP) genome editing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aida|first=Tomomi|last2=Nakade|first2=Shota|last3=Sakuma|first3=Tetsushi|last4=Izu|first4=Yayoi|last5=Oishi|first5=Ayu|last6=Mochida|first6=Keiji|last7=Ishikubo|first7=Harumi|last8=Usami|first8=Takako|last9=Aizawa|first9=Hidenori|date=2016-01-01|title=Gene cassette knock-in in mammalian cells and zygotes by enhanced MMEJ|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=17|issue=1|pages=979|doi=10.1186/s12864-016-3331-9|issn=1471-2164|pmc=5126809|pmid=27894274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic engineering of bacteria for production of a variety of industrial products, including biofuels and specialty chemicals/nutraceuticals is a major area of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Debkumar|last2=Gupta|first2=Gaganjot|last3=Kaur|first3=Baljinder|date=2016-12-01|title=Metabolic engineering of E. coli top 10 for production of vanillin through FA catabolic pathway and bioprocess optimization using RSM|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046592816301802|journal=Protein Expression and Purification|volume=128|pages=123–133|doi=10.1016/j.pep.2016.08.015|pmid=27591788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the transfer of genetic elements between cells other than parental inheritance.

The increasing prevalence of resistance creates challenging questions for researchers and physicians.

'''Geoinformatics''' is the science and the technology which develops and uses [[information science]] infrastructure to address the problems of [[geography]], [[cartography]], [[geosciences]] and related branches of science and engineering.

==Overview==

Geoinformatics has been described as "the science and technology dealing with the structure and character of spatial information, its capture, its classification and qualification, its storage, processing, portrayal and dissemination, including the infrastructure necessary to secure optimal use of this information"&lt;ref&gt;P.L.N. Raju, Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art, science or technology dealing with the acquisition, storage, processing production, presentation and dissemination of geoinformation".&lt;ref&gt;M. Ehlers (2008) Geoinformatics and digital earth initiatives: a German perspective, International Journal of Digital Earth, 1:1, 17-30, DOI: 10.1080/17538940701781975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geomatics]] is a similarly used term which encompasses geoinformatics, but geomatics focuses more so on [[surveying]]. Geoinformatics has at its core the technologies supporting the processes of acquiring, analyzing and visualizing spatial data. Both geomatics and geoinformatics include and rely heavily upon the theory and practical implications of [[geodesy]].

Geography and earth science increasingly rely on digital spatial data acquired from remotely sensed images analyzed by [[geographical information systems]] (GIS) and visualized on paper or the computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;Bouloucos and Brown, ITC Courses in Remote Sensing, GIS and Photogrammetry&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoinformatics combines geospatial analysis and modeling, development of geospatial databases, information systems design, human-computer interaction and both wired and wireless networking technologies. Geoinformatics uses [[geocomputation]] and [[geovisualization]] for analyzing [[geoinformation]].

Branches of geoinformatics include:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Research==

Research in this field is used to support global and local environmental, energy and security programs. The Geographic Information Science and Technology group of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] is supported by various government departments and agencies including the [[United States Department of Energy]]. It is currently the only group in the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|United States Department of Energy National Laboratory System]] to focus on advanced theory and application research in this field. There are also a lot of interdiscipline research involved in geoinformatics fields including computer science, information technology, software engineering, biogeography, geography, conservation, architecture, spatial analysis and reinformacement learning.

==Applications==

Many fields benefit from geoinformatics, including urban planning and land use management, in-car navigation systems, virtual globes, public health, local and national gazetteer management, environmental modeling and analysis, military, transport network planning and management, agriculture, meteorology and climate change, oceanography and coupled ocean and atmosphere modelling, business location planning, architecture and archeological reconstruction, telecommunications, criminology and crime simulation, aviation, biodiversity conservation and maritime transport.
The importance of the spatial dimension in assessing, monitoring and modelling various issues and problems related to sustainable management of natural resources is recognized all over the world. Geoinformatics becomes very important technology to decision-makers across a wide range of disciplines, industries, commercial sector, environmental agencies, local and national government, research, and academia, national survey and mapping organisations, International organisations, United Nations, emergency services, public health and epidemiology, crime mapping, transportation and infrastructure, information technology industries, GIS consulting firms, environmental management agencies), tourist industry, utility companies, market analysis and e-commerce, mineral exploration, etc. Many government and non government agencies started to use spatial data for managing their day-to-day activities.

The HKA test is best used to look for [[balancing selection]], recent [[selective sweeps]] or other variation-reducing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kreitman|first=Martin|title=M D                            S P                            A H|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|date=1 September 2000|volume=1|issue=1|pages=539–559|doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.1.1.539|pmid=11701640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutral Evolution==
Neutral Evolution Theory, first proposed by Kimura in a 1968 paper, and later fully defined and published in 1983, is the basis for many statistical tests that detect selection at the molecular level. Kimura noted that there was much too high of a rate of mutation within the genome (i.e. high polymorphism) to be strictly under directional evolution. Furthermore, functionally less important regions of the genome evolve at a faster rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kimura|first=Motoo|title=The Neutral theory of molecular evolution|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|isbn=0521317932|edition=1st pbk. ed., repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimura then postulated that most of the modifications to the genome are neutral or nearly neutral, and evolve by random genetic drift. Therefore, under the neutral model, polymorphism within a species and divergence between related species at homologous sites will be highly correlated. The Neutral Evolution theory has become the null model against which tests for selection are based, and divergence from this model can be explained by directional or selective evolution.

==Formulae==

The rate of mutation within a population can be estimated using the Watterson estimator formula: θ=4Ν&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;μ, where Ν&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective population size and μ is the mutation rate (substitutions per site per unit of time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watterson|first=G.A.|title=On the number of segregating sites in genetical models without recombination|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=1 April 1975|volume=7|issue=2|pages=256–276|doi=10.1016/0040-5809(75)90020-9|pmid=1145509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson et al. proposed applying these variables to a chi-squared, goodness-of-fit test.

The test statistic proposed by Hudson et al., Χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is:
:&lt;math&gt;X^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^L(S_i^A-\widehat{E}(S_i^A))^2}{\widehat{V}ar(S_i^A)}&lt;/math&gt;

This states that, for each locus (''L'') (for which there must be at least two) the sum of the difference in number of observed polymorphic sites in sample A minus the estimate of expected polymorphism squared, all of which is divided by the variance. Similarly, this formula is then applied to Sample B (from another species) and then can be applied to the divergence between two sample species. The sum of these three variables is the test statistic (X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). If the polymorphism within species A, and B, and the divergence between them are all independent, then the test statistic should fall approximately onto a chi-squared distribution.&lt;ref name ="Hudson" /&gt;

For a simple explanation, let D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = divergence between species, or the number of fixed differences in locus one. Similarly D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = divergence in locus two. Let P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = the number of polymorphic sites in loci one and two, respectively (a measure of polymorphism within species). If there is no directional evolution, then D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Example==

For these examples, the distance between two species’ loci is determined by measuring the number of substitutions per site when comparing the two species. We can then calculate the rate of mutation (changes to the DNA sequence pre unit of time) if we know the time since the two species diverged from the common ancestor.

'''A test that suggests neutral evolution:'''
Suppose that you have data from two loci (1 and 2) in two species (A and B). Locus 1 shows high divergence and high polymorphism in both species. Locus 2 shows low divergence and low polymorphism. This can be explained by a neutral difference in the rate of mutations in each loci.

[[File:HKA test example.neutral.png|thumb|Example of Neutral Evolution - No Selection|framed|center]]

'''A test that suggests selection:'''
Again suppose you have data as in the last example, only this time locus 2 has equal divergence to locus 1 and yet lower polymorphism in species B. In this case the rate of mutation in each loci is equal, so this can only be explained by a reduction in the effective population size Ne of species B, which is inferred as an act of selection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4566">The '''Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography''' or '''N.N. Miklukho-Maklai Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology''' ({{lang-ru|Институт этнологии и антропологии им. Н.Н. Миклухо-Маклая}}; abbreviated as ИЭА in Russian and IEA in English) is a [[Russia]]n institute of research, specializing in [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies of cultural and physical [[anthropology]]. The institute is a constituent institute of the History branch of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], with its main building on [[Leninsky Prospekt, Moscow|Leninsky Prospekt]], [[Moscow]].

The Institute is named after the renowned 19th century [[ethnologist]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay]].

==Institutional History==
The Institute was established in the [[Soviet Union]] by the amalgamation of the [[Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography|Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography]] (MAE) and the [[Institute for the Study of Ethnic Groups of the USSR]] (IPIN) in autumn 1933.

Its first director was [[Nikolay Matorin]]. On 23 December 1933 he was dismissed by the Presidium of the [[Russian Academy of Science|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] and replaced by [[Ivan Meshchaninov]] on 1 January 1934.

On 25 January 1935, the IAE was transformed into the Institute of Anthropology, Archaeology and Ethnography. Meshchaninov remained director until this organisation was in turn dissolved in 1937.

On 11 February 1937, the Institute was restructured with sections being replaced by several departments or cabinets:
* Europe and the Caucasus, headed by [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Zelenin|Dmitrii Zelenin]]
* [[Siberia]] and Western Central Asia, headed by Y. P. Koshkin;
* [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]], headed by [[Nikolay Kyuner]];
* [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], Australia and Oceania, headed by [[Isaak Vinnikov]];
* [[Archaeology]], headed by P. P. Efimenko;
* [[Folklore]], headed by [[Mark Azadovsky]];
* History of Religion, headed by [[Yury Frantsev]].

The Museum of Anthropology, Archaeology and Ethnography was set up as separate part of the institute under the directorship of Dmitrii Alekseevich Olderogge. It consisted of various departments:
* Europe, Caucasus and Western Central Asia, headed by [[Nikolai Kislyakov]];
* Siberia, headed by V. N. Chernetsov;
* India, Indonesia, and the Far East, headed by Nikolay Kyuner;
* The Early Stage of the Primeval Society, Australia and Oceania, headed by Isaak Vinnikov;
* North, Central and South America, headed by S. A. Sternberg;
* Africa, headed by [[Dmitrii Alekseevich Olderogge]];
* Archaeology, headed by S. N. Zamyatnin;
* Physical Anthropology, headed by B. N. Vishnevskii.

On August 5, 1937, the Institute of Anthropology, Archaeology and Ethnography was renamed the Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography.

==Activities of the IAE==
The IAE brought together [[ethnography|ethnographers]]  and [[physical anthropology|physical anthropologists]] from throughout the Soviet Union to research the physical-constitutional and socio-historic development of the population. Political leaders had set the anthropologists the task of showing that "race" from the [[Marxist-Leninist]] point of view was not a significant factor in the "historical process". This was a response to the [[Nazi]] development of a "race science" (''Rassenkunde'') which was presented as the scientific basis for political theory and practice.

==Activities of the Institute of Ethnography==
In 1966 [[Yulian Bromley]] was appointed Director of the Institute and retained that position until 1989, having a major impact on Soviet Anthropology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1700">The '''Jaffe profile''' (or Jaffe model) is a mathematical function that is used to describe the distribution of mass or light in [[elliptical galaxies]] and the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]] of [[spiral galaxies]]. It was proposed by [[Walter Jaffe]] in 1983.&lt;ref name = "JAFFE1983"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Jaffe, Walter|title = A simple model for the distribution of light in spherical galaxies|journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume = 202|pages = 995–999|date = March 15, 1983|bibcode = 1983MNRAS.202..995J|doi=10.1093/mnras/202.4.995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its usefulness derives from the fact that it accurately reproduces a [[de Vaucouleurs profile]] when projected onto the sky.

The density in the Jaffe model is given by

&lt;math&gt;
\rho (r) = {\rho_0\over 4\pi}\left({r\over r_0}\right)^{-2} \left(1+{r\over r_0}\right)^{-2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; are parameters that can be varied to fit the observed density.

Jaffe described how he arrived at his model:&lt;ref name = "JAFFE1983"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The formula] was derived heuristically from the observation that the brightness profiles of spherical galaxies seem to run as &lt;math&gt;r^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; in at least some parts of their envelopes and cores, respectively. This would imply that the spatial density runs as &lt;math&gt;r^{-4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Variations on Jaffe's law include the [[Hernquist profile]], the [[Dehnen profile]] and the [[NFW profile]], which have a similar functional form as Jaffe's law but which use different values for the two exponents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7762">'''Khutu''' was the name given to a material used by [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval]] [[Islam]]ic [[Bladesmith|cutlers]] for knife handles. The ultimate source of the material has been a matter of conjecture for more than a thousand years; Islamic [[polymath]] [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] was among the first to investigate it and debate about the material—especially its source—continues to this day. The hypothesized sources for the material have included [[narwhal]], [[Walrus ivory|walrus]], and [[mammoth]] ivory, the [[frontal bone]]s of bulls, goats, and birds, the teeth of snakes, fish, and [[hippopotamus]]es, and the root of a tree.&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; The most recent investigation, by [[natural history|natural historian]] Chris Lavers, has pointed to the frontal [[wikt:boss#Noun|boss]] of the horns of the [[muskox]].

Khutu has been ascribed properties other than those of a work material.  It was, for example, described as an [[wikt:alexipharmic|alexipharmic]]—a property that eventually was attached to [[Unicorn#Alicorn|alicorn]], the supposed horn of the [[unicorn]].

==Medieval scholarship==

===Abu Rayhan Biruni===
Islamic polymath [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|al-Biruni]] (973–1048) was among the first to investigate khutu, which he referred to as ''al-chutww''. He described it as being from the land of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirgiz]] in the northern part of the Turkish territory and mentioned that it was in great demand in Egypt. He noted that the material came in a variety of colours, with yellowish-green being best, followed by those coloured [[camphor]], [[white]], "like the sun", and dark grey.&lt;ref name="Laufer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laufer |first1=Berthold |last2=Pelliot |first2=Paul |year=1913 |title=Arabic and Chinese Trade in Walrus and Narwhal Ivory |journal=T'oung Pao (second series) |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=315–370 |doi=10.1163/156853213x00213}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned the beliefs that the material came from the forehead of the [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] (an enormous bird from Arabic and Persian myths which was said to carry off and eat elephants) or the forehead of a hippopotamus, but did not seem to attach much weight to these ideas, noting that it was much more similar to the frontal bone of a bull or goat.&lt;ref name="Lavers"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Natural History of Unicorns |last=Lavers |first=Chris |year=2009 |publisher=William Morris |location=USA |isbn=978-0-06-087414-8 |pages=112–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "It originates from an animal; it is much in demand, and preserved in the treasuries among the Chinese who assert that it is a desirable article because the approach of poison causes it to exude."&lt;ref name="Laufer"/&gt;

In another work he described it as "bigger than the hand in size"&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; and "thicker than two fingers"&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; and mentioned that "Amir Abu Ja'far bin Banu has a large box-like case made of long and broad khutu planks."&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; Because the material gave off a fishy smell when burned, he felt that it was probably a marine creature of some kind, but he specifically noted an instance where someone was able to pass off walrus ivory for proper khutu, strongly implying that the two materials were distinct – at least to him.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Lavers: "A Khwarazmian happened to find a tooth which was very white on the sides... the natural patterns described upon it were very thin, white and pale. It resembled the down of a cucumber if peeled in such a manner that the seed grains are also cut off. This Khwarazmain carried it to [Mecca], passed it off as the khutu and sold it at a high price to the Egyptians." As Lavers points out, this description could only refer to the osteodentine portion of walrus ivory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn al-Husayn Kashgari===
Writing shortly after al-Biruni, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Kashgari]] mentioned khutu in his work ''Diwan Lughat at-Turk'' (c. 1075): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Horn of a sea fish imported from China. It is (also) said that it is the root of a tree. It is used for knife handles. The presence of poison in food is put to the test by it because when broth or other dishes in the bowl are stirred with it the food cooks without fire (if poison is present in it), or if the horn is placed on a bowl it (the horn) sweats without steam."&lt;ref name="Dankoff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dankoff |first1=Robert |year=1973 |title=A Note on khutu and chatuq |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=542–543 |url= |doi=10.2307/600173}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ibn al-Akfani===
The next investigation of khutu was by [[Ibn al-Akfani]] (1286–ca. 1348-49&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4274/ |title = The Selection of Treasures Regarding Precious Stones |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1700–1800 |accessdate = 2013-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), who called the material ''chartut''. Although he cited al-Biruni's earlier work, he disagreed with a number of Al-Biruni's conclusions. For example, he favoured the theory that khutu came from the forehead of a large bird. He also offered a slightly different spectrum of possible colours for khutu (yellow, red, [[apricot (color)|apricot]], dust, black), though he did agree that the quality of the material varied with the colour.&lt;ref name="Laufer"/&gt;

==Modern scholarship==

===Berthold Laufer===
The era of modern scholarship on the identity of khutu began with the work of the [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Berthold Laufer]]. The first paper was titled "Arabic and Chinese Trade in Walrus and Narwhal Ivory" and published in the journal ''T'oung Pao'' in 1913. Laufer provided a brief overview of the medieval scholarship and provided detailed information regarding the trade of narwhal and walrus ivory on the basis that khutu referred to one or both of those items. A second paper, titled "Supplementary Notes on Walrus and Narwhal Ivory" was published in 1916 in the same journal and provided some corrections and clarifications of his earlier work.

===Richard Ettinghausen===
While Laufer had detailed the Chinese end of the narwhal and walrus [[ivory trade]], Richard Ettinghausen focused on the Arabic side. Like Laufer, he felt that khutu was probably walrus ivory, with perhaps some samples being narwhal ivory.&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt;

===Chris Lavers===
The most recent work on khutu has been done by [[Chris Lavers]]. In contrast to the early 20th century scholars, Lavers does not believe khutu to have been either walrus or narwhal ivory, but rather the frontal bone and associated horn material of the [[muskox]], with some specimens perhaps coming from mammoth ivory. His primary evidence for this was the work of al-Biruni, particularly where he mentions that knowledgeable people could differentiate walrus ivory from proper khutu (a fact that Laufer could not have known in his earlier work, as the al-Biruni text mentioning it had not yet been translated).&lt;ref name="Lavers"/&gt; In ''The Natural History of Unicorns'' he acknowledges that Asian muskoxen were supposed to have become extinct about a thousand years before al-Biruni's investigations (see [[Muskox#Habitat and range|muskox]] for information regarding their extinction and reintroduction), but points out that there could well have been an isolated [[Refugium (population biology)|refugium]] of muskoxen existing in Asia until more modern times, that it was possible that there was trade in material goods between Asian arctic and North American arctic peoples, and also that frozen or fossilized muskoxen material could have been harvested in the same way that mammoth ivory was.

'''Language acquisition''' is the process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend [[language]], as well as to produce and use [[word]]s and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s to communicate. Language acquisition is one of the quintessential human traits,&lt;ref name="Friederici 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Friederici | first1 = AD. | title = The brain basis of language processing: from structure to function | journal = Physiol Rev | volume = 91 | issue = 4 | pages = 1357–92 |date=Oct 2011 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00006.2011 | pmid = 22013214 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.385.5620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because [[Animal language|non-humans do not communicate by using language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =Kosslyn  | first1 = Stephen M.  | last2 = Osherson | first2 = Daniel N. | title = An invitation to cognitive science | year = 1995 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-262-65045-8 | oclc =  613819557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Language acquisition usually refers to '''first-language acquisition''', which studies infants' acquisition of their [[First language|native language]], whether that be spoken language or signed language as a result of [[prelingual deafness]]. This is distinguished from ''[[second-language acquisition]]'', which deals with the acquisition (in both [[Language acquisition by deaf children|children]] and adults) of additional languages.  In addition to speech, reading and writing a language with an entirely [[multiscriptualism|different script]] compounds the complexities of true foreign language [[literacy]].

Linguists who are interested in child language acquisition for many years question how language is acquired, Lidz et al. states "The question of how these structures are acquired, then, is more properly understood as the question of how a learner takes the surface forms in the input and converts them into abstract linguistic rules and representations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lidz|first=Jeffrey|last2=Waxman|date=16 April 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned:experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|url=https://unstable.nl/andreas/ai/psy/presentaties/Lidz2003.pdf|journal=Cognition 89 (2003) B65-B73|volume=|pages=|via=Elsevier science}}&lt;/ref&gt; So we know language acquisition involves structures, rules and representation. The capacity to successfully use language requires one to acquire a range of tools including [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and an extensive [[vocabulary]]. Language can be vocalized as in speech, or manual as in [[sign language|sign]]. Human language capacity is represented in the brain. Even though human language capacity is finite, one can say and understand an infinite number of sentences, which is based on a syntactic principle called [[recursion]]. Evidence suggests that every individual has three recursive mechanisms that allow sentences to go indeterminately. These three mechanisms are: ''relativization'', ''complementation'' and ''coordination''.&lt;ref name="Lightfoot, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lightfoot|first1=David|title=Language acquisition and language change|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|volume=1 |issue=5|year=2010|pages=677–684|issn=1939-5078|doi=10.1002/wcs.39|pmid=26271652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are actually two main guiding principles in first-language acquisition, that is, [[speech perception]] always precedes [[speech production]] and the gradually evolving system by which a child learns a language is built up one step at a time, beginning with the distinction between individual [[phoneme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Fry, Dennis|year=1977|title=Homo loquens, Man as a talking animal|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages= 107–108|isbn=978-0-521-29239-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Learning box.svg|thumb|Learning box for language acquisition]]
Philosophers in ancient societies were interested in how humans acquired the ability to understand and produce language well before [[empirical methods]] for testing those theories were developed, but for the most part they seemed to regard language acquisition as a subset of man's ability to acquire knowledge and learn concepts.&lt;ref name="Innateness and Language"&gt;{{cite web|title=Innateness and Language|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/innateness-language/#ChoCasAgaSki|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early observation-based ideas about language acquisition were proposed by [[Plato]], who felt that word-meaning mapping in some form was innate. Additionally, [[Sanskrit grammarians]] debated for over twelve centuries whether humans' ability to recognize the meaning of words was god-given (possibly innate) or passed down by previous generations and learned from already established conventions: a child learning the word for cow by listening to trusted speakers talking about cows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Matilal, Bimal Krishna |title=The word and the world: India's contribution to the study of language |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-562515-8 |oclc=24041690 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more modern context, empiricists, like [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]], argued that knowledge (and, for Locke, language) emerge ultimately from abstracted sense impressions. These arguments lean towards the "nurture" side of the argument: that language is acquired through sensory experience, which led to [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s Aufbau, an attempt to learn all knowledge from sense datum, using the notion of "remembered as similar" to bind them into clusters, which would eventually map into language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/82/2/understanding-human-language-an-in-depth-exploration-of-the-human-facility-for-language|title=Understanding Human Language: An In-Depth Exploration of the Human Facility for Language|author=Kendra A. Palmer|publisher=StudentPulse.com|year=2009|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of [[behaviorism]] argued that language may be learned through a form of [[operant conditioning]]. In [[B. F. Skinner]]'s ''[[Verbal Behaviour]]'' (1957), he suggested that the successful use of a sign, such as a word or [[lexical unit]], given a certain stimulus, [[reinforcement|reinforces]] its "momentary" or contextual probability. Since operant conditioning is contingent on reinforcement by rewards, a child would learn that a specific combination of sounds stands for a specific thing through repeated successful associations made between the two. A "successful" use of a sign would be one in which the child is understood (for example, a child saying "up" when he or she wants to be picked up) and rewarded with the desired response from another person, thereby reinforcing the child's understanding of the meaning of that word and making it more likely that he or she will use that word in a similar situation in the future. Some [[empiricism|empiricist]] theories of language acquisition include the [[statistical learning theory]]. Charles F. Hockett of language acquisition, [[relational frame theory]], [[functionalist linguistics]], [[social interactionist theory]], and usage-based language acquisition.

Skinner's behaviourist idea was strongly attacked by [[Noam Chomsky]] in a review article in 1959, calling it "largely mythology" and a "serious delusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noam | first1 = Chomsky  | last2 = Skinner  | first2 = B. F.  | year = 1959 | title = A Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior | url = http://cogprints.org/1148/ | journal = Language | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 26–58 | doi=10.2307/411334| jstor = 411334  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against Skinner's idea of language acquisition through operant conditioning include the fact that children often ignore language corrections from adults. Instead, children typically follow a pattern of using an irregular form of a word correctly, making errors later on, and eventually returning to the proper use of the word. For example, a child may correctly learn the word "gave" (past tense of "give"), and later on use the word "gived". Eventually, the child will typically go back to learning the correct word, "gave". The pattern is difficult to attribute to Skinner's idea of operant conditioning as the primary way that children acquire language. Chomsky argued that if language were solely acquired through behavioral conditioning, children would not likely learn the proper use of a word and suddenly use the word incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harley|first1=Trevor A.|title=Talking the Talk: Language, Psychology and Science|date=2010|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-84169-339-2|pages=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky believed that Skinner failed to account for the central role of syntactic knowledge in language competence. Chomsky also rejected the term "learning", which Skinner used to claim that children "learn" language through operant conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, Margaret |title=Language Experience and Early Language Development: From Input to Uptake |publisher=Psychology Press |location=UK |year=1992 |pages= |isbn= 978-0863772382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Chomsky argued for a mathematical approach to language acquisition, based on a study of [[Syntactic Structures|syntax]].

==General approaches==
[[File:Kituwah Academy.png|thumb|left|300px|A lesson at Kituwah Academy on the [[Qualla Boundary]] in [[North Carolina]]. The [[language immersion]] school, operated by the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], teaches the same curriculum as other [[United States|American]] [[primary schools]], but the [[Cherokee language]] is the medium of instruction from [[pre-school]] on up and students learn it as a [[first language]]. Such schools have proven instrumental in the preservation and perpetuation of the Cherokee language.]]
A major debate in understanding language acquisition is how these capacities are picked up by [[infant]]s from the linguistic input.&lt;ref name="Kennison 2013"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1=Kennison | first1=Shelia M. | title=Introduction to language development | date =2013-07-30  | publisher=SAGE Publications  | location=Los Angeles  | isbn=978-1-4129-9606-8 | oclc=830837502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Input in the linguistic [[Context (language use)|context]] is defined as "All words, contexts, and other forms of language to which a learner is exposed, relative to acquired proficiency in first or [[second language]]s". [[Psychological nativism|Nativists]] such as [[Noam Chomsky]] have focused on the hugely complex nature of human grammars, the finiteness and ambiguity of the input that children receive, and the relatively limited [[cognitive abilities]] of an infant. From these characteristics, they conclude that the process of language acquisition in infants must be tightly constrained and guided by the biologically given characteristics of the human brain. Otherwise, they argue, it is extremely difficult to explain how children, within the first five years of life, routinely master the complex, largely tacit [[Grammar|grammatical rules]] of their native language.&lt;ref name="Sakai, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sakai|first=Kuniyoshi L.|title=Language Acquisition and Brain Development |journal=Science|year=2005 |volume=310|pages=815–819 |doi=10.1126/science.1113530 |pmid=16272114|issue=5749|bibcode=2005Sci...310..815S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the evidence of such rules in their native language is all indirect—adult speech to children cannot encompass what children know by the time they've acquired their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Language Acquisition and Growth|last=Lust|first=Barbara|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780511803413|location=Cambridge|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars, however, have resisted the possibility that infants' routine success at acquiring the grammar of their native language requires anything more than the forms of learning seen with other cognitive skills, including such mundane motor skills as learning to ride a bike. In particular, there has been resistance to the possibility that human biology includes any form of specialization for language. This conflict is often referred to as the "[[nature and nurture]]" debate. Of course, most scholars acknowledge that certain aspects of language acquisition must result from the specific ways in which the human brain is "wired" (a "nature" component, which accounts for the failure of non-human species to acquire human languages) and that certain others are shaped by the particular language environment in which a person is raised (a "nurture" component, which accounts for the fact that humans raised in different societies acquire different languages). The as-yet unresolved question is the extent to which the specific cognitive capacities in the "nature" component are also used outside of language.

===Social interactionism===
{{Main|Social interactionist theory}}
Social interactionist theory is an explanation of [[language development]] emphasizing the role of social interaction between the developing child and linguistically knowledgeable adults. It is based largely on the socio-cultural theories of Soviet psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]], and made prominent in the Western world by [[Jerome Bruner]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. (1983). ''Child's Talk: Learning to Use Language''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other approaches, it emphasizes the role of feedback and reinforcement in language acquisition. Specifically, it asserts that much of a child's linguistic growth stems from modeling of and interaction with parents and other adults, who very frequently provide instructive correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moerk | first1 = E.L. | year = 1994 | title = Corrections in first language acquisition: Theoretical controversies and factual evidence | url = | journal = International Journal of Psycholinguistics | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 33–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus somewhat similar to [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] accounts of language, though it differs substantially in that it posits the existence of a social-cognitive model and other mental structures within children (a sharp contrast to the "[[black box]]" approach of classical behaviorism).

Another key idea within the theory of social interactionism is that of the [[zone of proximal development]]. Briefly, this is a theoretical construct denoting the set of tasks a child is capable of performing with guidance, but not alone.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotskii [Vygotsky], L.S. 1935. "Dinamika umstvennogo razvitiia shkol’nika v sviazi s obucheniem." In Umstvennoe razvitie detei v protsesse obucheniia, pp. 33–52. Moscow-Leningrad: Gosuchpedgiz.&lt;/ref&gt; As applied to language, it describes the set of linguistic tasks (proper syntax, suitable vocabulary usage, etc.) a child cannot carry out on their own at a given time, but can learn to carry out if assisted by an able adult.

===Relational frame theory===
{{Main|Relational frame theory}}
The [[relational frame theory]] (RFT) (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, Roche, 2001), provides a wholly selectionist/learning account of the origin and development of language competence and complexity. Based upon the principles of [[B. F. Skinner|Skinnerian]] [[behaviorism]], RFT posits that children acquire language purely through interacting with the environment. RFT theorists introduced the concept of [[functional contextualism]] in language learning, which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events, such as thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context. RFT distinguishes itself from Skinner's work by identifying and defining a particular type of [[operant conditioning]] known as derived relational responding, a learning process that, to date, appears to occur only in humans possessing a capacity for language. Empirical studies supporting the predictions of RFT suggest that children learn language via a system of inherent reinforcements, challenging the view that language acquisition is based upon innate, language-specific cognitive capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Steven C. Hayes |editor2=Dermot Barnes-Holmes |editor3=Brian Roche |title= Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian Account of Human Language and Cognition (Hardcover)|publisher= Plenum Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-306-46600-7 |oclc= 51896575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergentism===
[[Emergentism|Emergentist]] theories, such as [[Brian MacWhinney|MacWhinney's]] [[competition model]], posit that language acquisition is a [[cognitive process]] that emerges from the interaction of biological pressures and the environment. According to these theories, neither nature nor nurture alone is sufficient to trigger language learning; both of these influences must work together in order to allow children to acquire a language. The proponents of these theories argue that general cognitive processes subserve language acquisition and that the end result of these processes is language-specific phenomena, such as [[vocabulary development|word learning]] and [[syntax|grammar acquisition]]. The findings of many empirical studies support the predictions of these theories, suggesting that language acquisition is a more complex process than many believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Brian MacWhinney| title=The Emergence of Language |year=1999|isbn=978-0-8058-3010-1 |oclc=44958022 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax and morphology==
As [[syntax]] began to be studied more closely in the early 20th century, in relation to language learning, it became apparent to linguists, psychologists, and philosophers that knowing a language was not merely a matter of associating words with concepts, but that a critical aspect of language involves knowledge of how to put words together—sentences are usually needed in order to communicate successfully, not just isolated words.&lt;ref name="Innateness and Language"/&gt; A child will use short expressions such as ''Bye-bye Mummy'' or ''All-gone milk'', which actually are combinations of individual [[noun]]s and an [[operator (linguistics)|operator]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Fry, Dennis|year=1977|title=Homo loquens, Man as a talking animal|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages= 117|isbn=978-0-521-29239-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; before it begins to use gradually more complex sentences. In the 1990s within the [[Principles and Parameters]] framework, this hypothesis was extended into a maturation-based [[Structure building model of child language]] regarding the acquisition of functional categories. In this model, children are seen as gradually building up more and more complex structures, with Lexical categories (like noun and verb) being acquired before Functional-[[syntactic categories]] (like determiner and complementiser).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Radford, Andrew|year=1990|title=Syntactic Theory and the Acquisition of English Syntax|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-16358-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When acquiring a language, it is also often found, in languages such as English, that the most frequently used verbs are [[irregular verbs]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Young children first begin to learn the past tense of verbs individually; however, when they acquire a "rule", such as adding -ed to form the past tense, they begin to exhibit occasional overgeneralization errors (e.g. "runned", "hitted") alongside correct past-tense forms. One influential proposal to the origin of these errors is as follows: the adult state of grammar stores each irregular verb form in memory as well as a "block" on the use of the regular rule for forming that type of verb. In the developing child's mind, retrieval of that "block" may fail, causing the child to erroneously apply the regular rule instead of retrieving the irregular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Marcus G, Pinker S, Ullman M, Hollander M, Rosen TJ, Xu F|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Overregularization in language acquisition|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=57|issue=4|series=Serial No. 228|pmid=1518508|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.1992.tb00313.x|url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gary/marcusArticles/Marcus%20et%20al%201992%20SRCD%20Mono.pdf|pages=1–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlson, Neil  |author2=Heth, Donald|year=2007|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour|publisher=Pearson Education:New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A [[Merge (linguistics)]]-based Theory'''. In Bare-Phrase structure ([[Minimalist Program]]), since theory-internal considerations define the specifier position of an internal-merge projection (phases vP and CP) as the only type of host which could serve as potential landing-sites for  move-based elements displaced from lower down within the base-generated VP structure – e.g., A-movement such as passives (["The apple was eaten by [John (ate the apple)"]]), or raising ["Some work does seem to remain [(There) does seem to remain (some work)"]])—as a consequence, any strong version of a [[Structure building model of child language]] which calls for an exclusive "external-merge/argument structure stage" prior to an "internal-merge/scope-discourse related stage" would claim that young children's stage-1 utterances lack the ability to generate and host elements derived via movement operations. In terms of a merge-base theory of language acquisition, complements and specifiers are simply notations for first-merge (= "complement-of" [head-complement]), and later second-merge (= "specifier-of" [specifier-head], with merge always forming to a head. First-merge establishes only a set {a, b} and is not an ordered pair—e.g., an {N, N}-compound of 'boat-house' would allow the ambiguous readings of either 'a kind of house' and/or 'a kind of boat'. It is only with second-merge that order is derived out of a set {a {a, b}} which yields the [[recursive]] properties of syntax—e.g., a 'house-boat' {house {house, boat}} now reads unambiguously only as a 'kind of boat'. It is this property of recursion that allows for projection and labeling of a phrase to take place;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moro, A.  |year=2000|title=Dynamic Antisymmetry, Linguistic Inquiry Monograph Series 38|publisher=MIT Press}}).&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, that the Noun 'boat' is the Head of the compound, and 'house' acting as a kind of specifier/modifier. External-merge (first-merge) establishes substantive 'base structure' inherent to the VP, yielding theta/argument structure, and may go beyond the lexical-category VP to involve the functional-category light verb vP. Internal-merge (second-merge) establishes more formal aspects related to edge-properties of scope and discourse-related material pegged to CP. In a Phase-based theory, this twin vP/CP distinction follows the "duality of semantics" discussed within the [[Minimalist Program]], and is further developed into a dual distinction regarding a probe-goal relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miyagawa, Shigeru  |year=2010|title=Why Agree? Why Move?|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, at the "external/first-merge-only" stage, young children would show an inability to interpret readings from a given ordered pair, since they would only have access to the mental parsing of a non-recursive set. (See Roeper for a full discussion of recursion in child language acquisition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roeper, Tom  |year=2007|title=The Prism of Grammar: How child language illuminates humanism|publisher=MIT Press}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to word-order violations, other more ubiquitous results of a first-merge stage would show that children's initial utterances lack the recursive properties of inflectional morphology, yielding a strict Non-inflectional stage-1, consistent with an incremental Structure-building model of child language.

[[Generative grammar]], associated especially with the work of [[Noam Chomsky]], is currently one of the approaches to children's acquisition of syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lillo-Martin, Diane C. |author2=Crain, Stephen |title=An introduction to linguistic theory and language acquisition |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=978-0-631-19536-8 |oclc=799714148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading idea is that human biology imposes narrow constraints on the child's "hypothesis space" during language acquisition. In the [[principles and parameters]] framework, which has dominated generative syntax since Chomsky's (1980) ''[[Lectures on Government and Binding|Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures]]'', the acquisition of syntax resembles ordering from a menu: the human brain comes equipped with a limited set of choices, from which the child selects the correct options by using the parents' speech, in combination with the context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Baker, Mark Raphael |title=The atoms of language |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-860632-1 |oclc=66740160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important argument, which favors the generative approach, is the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument. The child's input (a finite number of sentences encountered by the child, together with information about the context in which they were uttered) is, in principle, compatible with an infinite number of conceivable grammars. Moreover, few, if any, children can rely on [[corrective feedback]] from adults when they make a grammatical error, due to the fact that adults generally provide feedback regardless of whether a child's utterance was grammatical or not, and children have no way of discerning if a response was intended to be a correction. Additionally, when children do understand that they are being corrected, they don't always reproduce accurate restatements.{{Dubious|More than a few children can rely on corrective feedback|reason=Children can distinguish corrective feedback from other responses|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Gary F.|year=1993|title=Negative evidence in language acquisition|journal=Cognition|volume=46|issue=1|pages=53–85|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(93)90022-n|pmid=8432090|url=http://www2.denizyuret.com/ref/marcus_gf/marcus93.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.466.3904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brown, Roger|author2=Camile Hanlon|year=1970|contribution=Derivational complexity and order of acquisition in child speech|title=Cognition and the development of language|editor=J. R. Hayes|location=New York|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet barring situations of medical abnormality or extreme privation, all the children in a given speech-community converge on very much the same grammar by the age of about five years. An especially dramatic example is provided by children who, for medical reasons, are unable to produce speech and, therefore, can never be corrected for a grammatical error but nonetheless, converge on the same grammar as their typically developing peers, according to comprehension-based tests of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lenneberg, Eric|year=1967|title=Biological Foundations of Language|location=New York|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Stromswold, Karin|title=Lessons from a mute child|conference=Rich Languages from Poor Inputs: A Workshop in Honor of Carol Chomsky|location=MIT, Cambridge, MA|date=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerations such as those have led Chomsky, [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Eric Lenneberg]] and others to argue that the types of grammar the child needs to consider must be narrowly constrained by human biology (the [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] position).&lt;ref name=Chomsky1975&gt;{{cite book|author=Chomsky, N.|title=Reflections on Language|location=New York|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; These innate constraints are sometimes referred to as [[universal grammar]], the human "language faculty", or the "language instinct".&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven |title=The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (P.S.) |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-06-133646-1 |oclc=778413074 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empiricism===

Although Chomsky's theory of a [[generative grammar]] has been enormously influential in the field of linguistics since the 1950s, many criticisms of the basic assumptions of generative theory have been put forth by cognitive-functional linguistics, who argue that language structure is created through language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomasello, Michael |title=Constructing a language: a usage-based theory of language acquisition |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2003  |isbn=978-0-674-01030-7 |oclc=62782600 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These linguists argue that the concept of a [[language acquisition device]] (LAD) is unsupported by evolutionary anthropology, which tends to show a gradual adaptation of the human brain and vocal cords to the use of language, rather than a sudden appearance of a complete set of binary parameters delineating the whole spectrum of possible grammars ever to have existed and ever to exist.&lt;ref name="Mameli 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Mameli | first1 = M. | last2 = Bateson | first2 = P. | title = An evaluation of the concept of innateness. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 366 | issue = 1563 | pages = 436–43 |date=Feb 2011 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2010.0174 | pmid = 21199847 | pmc = 3013469}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, cognitive-functional theorists use this anthropological data to show how human beings have evolved the capacity for grammar and syntax to meet our demand for linguistic symbols. (Binary parameters are common to digital computers, but may not be applicable to neurological systems such as the human brain.){{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Further, the generative theory has several constructs (such as movement, empty categories, complex underlying structures, and strict binary branching) that cannot possibly be acquired from any amount of linguistic input. It is unclear that human language is actually ''anything like'' the generative conception of it. Since language, as imagined by nativists, is unlearnably complex,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} subscribers to this theory argue that it must, therefore, be innate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Lasnik|first2=Howard|title=The Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Universal Grammar|volume=1|date=Dec 2016|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.013.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nativists hypothesize that some features of syntactic categories exist before a child is exposed to any experience - categories on which the child maps words of their language as they learn their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Child Language|last=L.|first=Bavin, Edith|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511576164|location=Cambridge|pages=15–34|oclc=798060196}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different theory of language, however, may yield different conclusions. While all theories of language acquisition posit some degree of innateness, they vary in how much value they place on this innate capacity to acquire language. Empiricism places less value on the innate knowledge, arguing instead that the input, combined with both general and language-specific learning capacities, is sufficient for acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|title=First Steps Toward a usage-based theory of language acquisition|journal=Cognitive Linguistics|date=2000|volume=11|pages=61–82|doi=10.1515/cogl.2001.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the debate surrounding the nativist position has centered on whether the inborn capabilities are language-specific or domain-general, such as those that enable the infant to visually make sense of the world in terms of objects and actions. The anti-nativist view has many strands, but a frequent theme is that language emerges from usage in social contexts, using learning mechanisms that are a part of a general cognitive learning apparatus (which is what is innate).

====Statistical learning====
{{Main|Statistical learning in language acquisition}}
Some language acquisition researchers, such as [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]], Richard Aslin, and [[Jenny Saffran]], emphasize the possible roles of general [[learning]] mechanisms, especially statistical learning, in language acquisition. The development of [[connectionist]] models that are able to successfully learn words and syntactical conventions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seidenberg |first=Mark S. |author2=J.L.

[[Statistical learning]] theory suggests that, when learning language, a learner would use the natural statistical properties of language to deduce its structure, including sound patterns, words, and the beginnings of grammar.&lt;ref name="Saffran, 2003"/&gt; That is, language learners are sensitive to how often [[syllable]] combinations or words occur in relation to other syllables.&lt;ref name="Saffran 1996 1926–1928"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny|author2=Aslin, Newport |title=Statistical learning by 8-month-old infants|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=274|issue=5294|pages=1926–1928|doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1926|pmid=8943209|bibcode=1996Sci...274.1926S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graf Estes 2007 254–260"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graf Estes|first=Katharine|author2=Evans, Alibali, Saffran|title=Can Infants Map Meaning to Newly Segmented Words?

These findings suggest that early experience listening to language is critical to vocabulary acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lany|first=Jill|author2=Saffran |title=From Statistics to Meaning: Infants' Acquisition of Lexical Categories|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=2|pages=284–91|date=January 2010|doi=10.1177/0956797609358570|pmid=20424058|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/21/2/284|pmc=3865606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistical abilities are effective, but also limited by what qualifies as input, what is done with that input, and by the structure of the resulting output.&lt;ref name="Saffran, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saffran|first1=Jenny R.|title=Statistical language learning: mechanisms and constraints| journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=12 |issue=4|year=2003 |pages=110–114 |issn=0963-7214|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01243}}&lt;/ref&gt; One should also note that statistical learning (and more broadly, distributional learning) can be accepted as a component of language acquisition by researchers on either side of the "nature and nurture" debate. From the perspective of that debate, an important question is whether statistical learning can, by itself, serve as an alternative to nativist explanations for the grammatical constraints of human language.

==== Chunking ====

Chunking theories of language acquisition constitute a group of theories related to statistical learning theories, in that they assume the input from the environment plays an essential role; however, they postulate different learning mechanisms. The central idea of these theories is that language development occurs through the incremental acquisition of meaningful [[chunking (psychology)#Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures|chunks]] of elementary [[constituent (linguistics)|constituents]], which can be words, [[phoneme]]s, or syllables. Recently, this approach has been highly successful in simulating several phenomena in the acquisition of [[syntactic category|syntactic categories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Freudenthal |first=Daniel |author2=J.M.

Researchers at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] have developed a computer model analyzing early toddler conversations to predict the structure of later conversations. They showed that toddlers develop their own individual rules for speaking with slots, into which they could put certain kinds of words. A significant outcome of the research was that rules inferred from toddler speech were better predictors of subsequent speech than traditional grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bannard C, Lieven E, Tomasello M |title=Modeling children's early grammatical knowledge |journal=Proc.

==Representation in the brain==
Recent advances in functional [[Functional neuroimaging|neuroimaging technology]] have allowed for a better understanding of how language acquisition is manifested physically in the brain. Language acquisition almost always occurs in children during a period of rapid increase in brain volume. At this point in development, a child has many more neural connections than he or she will have as an adult, allowing for the child to be more able to learn new things than he or she would be as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nadia|first=Steve|title=Kid's Brain Power|url=http://www.riggsinst.org/brainpower.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensitive period===
{{main|Sensitive periods#Language|Critical period hypothesis}}
Language acquisition has been studied from the perspective of [[developmental psychology]] and [[neuroscience]],&lt;ref name="White 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = White | first1 = EJ. | last2 = Hutka | first2 = SA. | last3 = Williams | first3 = LJ. | last4 = Moreno | first4 = S. | title = Learning, neural plasticity and sensitive periods: implications for language acquisition, music training and transfer across the lifespan. | journal = Front Syst Neurosci | volume = 7 | issue =  | pages = 90 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.3389/fnsys.2013.00090 | pmid = 24312022 | pmc = 3834520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which looks at learning to use and understand language parallel to a child's brain development. It has been determined, through empirical research on developmentally normal children, as well as through some extreme cases of language deprivation, that there is a "[[sensitive period]]" of language acquisition in which human infants have the ability to learn any language. Several findings have observed that from birth until the age of six months, infants can discriminate the phonetic contrasts of all languages. Researchers believe that this gives infants the ability to acquire the language spoken around them.  After such an age, the child is able to perceive only the phonemes specific to the language learned. The reduced phonemic sensitivity enables children to build phonemic categories and recognize stress patterns and sound combinations specific to the language they are acquiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuhl P, Stevens E, Hayashi A, Deguchi T, Kiritani S, Iverson P|title= Infants show a facilitation effect for native language phonetic perception between 6 and 12 months |journal=Developmental Science |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=F13–F21 |date=February 2006 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00468.x |pmid= 16472309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wilder Penfield noted, "Before the child begins to speak and to perceive, the uncommitted cortex is a blank slate on which nothing has been written. In the ensuing years much is written, and the writing is normally never erased. After the age of ten or twelve, the general functional connections have been established and fixed for the speech cortex." According to the sensitive or critical period models, the age at which a child acquires the ability to use language is a predictor of how well he or she is ultimately able to use language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pallier|first=Cristophe|title=Critical periods in language acquisition and language attrition|url=http://www.pallier.org/papers/Pallier.critical.period.attrition.chapter.2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there may be an age at which becoming a fluent and natural user of a language is no longer possible; Penfield and Roberts (1959) cap their sensitive period at 9 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penfield|first1=Wilder|title=Speech and Brain-mechanisms|date=1959|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our brains may be automatically wired to learn languages,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} but the ability does not last into adulthood in the same way that it exists during development.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} By the onset of puberty (around age 12), language acquisition has typically been solidified and it becomes more difficult to learn a language in the same way a native speaker would.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Just like children who speak vocally, deaf children go through the same critical period. Deaf children who acquire their first language later in life show lower performance in complex aspects of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newport|first1=Elissa|title=Maturational constraints on language learning|journal=Cognitive Science|date=1990|volume=14|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1401_2|pages=11–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, it is usually a second language that a person is trying to acquire and not a first.&lt;ref name="Sakai, 2005"/&gt;

Assuming that children are exposed to language during the critical period,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purves|first=Dale|last2=Augustine|first2=George J.|last3=Fitzpatrick|first3=David|last4=Katz|first4=Lawrence C.|last5=LaMantia|first5=Anthony-Samuel|last6=McNamara|first6=James O.|last7=Williams|first7=S.

Researchers are unable to experimentally test the effects of the sensitive period of development on language acquisition, because it would be unethical to deprive children of language until this period is over. However, case studies on abused, [[language deprivation experiments|language deprived]] [[feral child|children]] show that they were extremely limited in their language skills, even after instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Curtiss, Susan |title=Genie: a psycholinguistic study of a modern-day "wild child" |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1977  |isbn=978-0-12-196350-7 |oclc=3073433  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a very young age, children can already distinguish between different sounds but cannot produce them yet. However, during infancy, children begin to babble. Deaf babies babble in the same order when hearing sounds as non-deaf babies do, thus showing that babbling is not caused by babies simply imitating certain sounds, but is actually a natural part of the process of language development. However, deaf babies do often babble less than non-deaf babies and they begin to babble later on in infancy (begin babbling at 11 months as compared to 6 months) when compared to non-deaf babies.&lt;ref name="Schacter, 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schacter |first1=Daniel L. |authorlink1= |last2=Gilbert |first2=Daniel T. |authorlink2= |last3=Wegner |first3=Daniel M. |authorlink3=|editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=Psychology |trans-title=Second Edition |accessdate= |type= |edition=Second |series= |volume= |origyear=2009|year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=United States of America |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=351–352 |trans-chapter= |chapter=9 |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |author-mask= |display-authors=|lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prelinguistic language abilities that are crucial for language acquisition have been seen even earlier than infantry. There have been many different studies examining different modes of language acquisition prior to birth. The study of language acquisition in fetuses started back in the late 1980s when different researchers discovered that very young infants could discriminate their native language from other languages. In Mehler et al. (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehler|first1=Jacques|last2=Jusczyk|first2=Peter|last3=Lambertz|first3=Ghislaine|last4=Halsted|first4=Nilofar|last5=Bertoncini|first5=Josiane|last6=Amiel-Tison|first6=Claudine|title=A precursor to language acquisition in young infants|journal=Cognition|volume=29|issue=2|pages=143–178|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(88)90035-2|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; infants underwent discrimination tests and it was shown that infants as young as 4 days old could discriminate utterances in their native language from an unfamiliar language, but could not discriminate between two languages when neither was native to them. These results suggest there are mechanisms for fetal auditory learning, and other researchers have found further behavioral evidence to support this notion. Fetus auditory learning through environment habituation has been seen in a variety of different modes, such as: fetus learning of familiar melodies (Hepper, 1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hepper|first1=Peter|title=Fetal "Soap" Addiction|journal=Lancet|date=11 June 1988|volume=331|issue=8598|pages=1347–1348|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(88)92170-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; story fragments (DeCasper &amp; Spence, 1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeCasper|first1=Anthony|last2=Spence|first2=Melanie|title=Prenatal maternal speech influences newborns' perception of speech sounds.|journal=Infant Behavioral Development|date=1986|volume=9|issue=2|pages=133–150|doi=10.1016/0163-6383(86)90025-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognition of mother's voice (Kisilevsky, 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kisilevsky|first1=Barbara|last2=Hains|first2=Sylvia|last3=Lee|first3=Kang|last4=Xie|first4=Xing|last5=Huang|first5=Hefeng|last6=Ye|first6=Hai|last7=Zhang|first7=Ke|last8=We|first8=Zengping|title=Effects of experience on fetal voice recognition|journal=Psychological Science|date=2003|volume=14|issue=3|pages=220–224|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02435|pmid=12741744}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more evidence of fetus adaptation to native linguistic environments (Moon, Cooper &amp; Fifer, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Christine|last2=Cooper|first2=Robin|last3=Fifer|first3=William|title=Two-day-olds prefer their native language|journal=Infant Behavioral Development|date=1993|volume=16|issue=4|pages=495–500|doi=10.1016/0163-6383(93)80007-U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosody is the property of speech that conveys an emotional state of the utterance, as well as intended form of speech (whether it be a question, statement or command). Some researchers in the field of developmental neuroscience would argue that fetal auditory learning mechanisms are solely due to discrimination in prosodic elements. Although this would hold merit in an evolutionary psychology perspective (i.e. recognition of mother's voice/familiar group language from emotionally valent stimuli), some theorists argue that there is more than prosodic recognition in elements of fetal learning. Newer evidence shows that fetuses not only react to the native language differently from nonnative, but furthermore that fetuses react differently and can accurately discriminate between native and nonnative vowels (Moon, Lagercrantz, &amp; Kuhl, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Christine|last2=Lagercrantz|first2=Hugo|last3=Kuhl|first3=Patricia|title=Language experienced in utero affects vowel perception after birth: A two-country study.|journal=Acta Paediatr|date=2013|volume=102|issue=2|pages=156–160|doi=10.1111/apa.12098|pmid=23173548|pmc=3543479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a new study in 2016 showed that newborn infants encode the edges of multisyllabic sequences better than the internal components of the sequence (Ferry et al., 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferry|first1=Alissa|last2=Fló|first2=Ana|last3=Brusini|first3=Perrine|last4=Cattarossi|first4=Luigi|last5=Macagno|first5=Francesco|last6=Nespor|first6=Marina|last7=Mehler|first7=Jacques|title=On the edge of language acquisition: inherent constraints on encoding multisyllabic sequences in the neonate brain.|journal=Developmental Science|date=2016|volume=19|issue=3|pages=488–503|doi=10.1111/desc.12323|pmid=26190466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these results suggest that newborn infants have learned important properties of syntactic processing in utero, that can be seen in infant knowledge of native language vowels and the sequencing of heard multisyllabic phrases. This ability to sequence specific vowels gives newborn infants some of the fundamental mechanisms needed in order to learn the complex organization of a language. 
From a neuroscientific perspective, there are neural correlates have been found that demonstrate human fetal learning of speech-like auditory stimulus that most other studies have been analyzing (Partanen et al., 2013).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Partanen|first1=Eino|last2=Kujala|first2=Teija|last3=Näätänen|first3=Risto|last4=Litola|first4=Auli|last5=Sambeth|first5=Anke|last6=Huotilainen|first6=Minna|title=Learning-induced neural plasticity of speech processing before birth|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2013|volume=110|issue=37|pages=15145–15150|doi=10.1073/pnas.1302159110|pmid=23980148|pmc=3773755|bibcode=2013PNAS..11015145P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Partanen et al. (2013),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; researchers presented fetuses with certain word variants and saw that these fetuses exhibited higher brain activity to the certain word variants compared to controls. In this same study, there was "a significant correlation existed between the amount of prenatal exposure and brain activity, with greater activity being associated with a higher amount of prenatal speech exposure," pointing to the important learning mechanisms present before birth that is fine-tuned to features in speech (Partanen et al., 2013).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Vocabulary acquisition==

The capacity to acquire the ability to incorporate the pronunciation of new words depends upon many factors. Before anything the learner needs to be able to hear what they are attempting to pronounce. Another is the capacity to engage in [[speech repetition]].&lt;ref name="Bloom 1974"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bloom L.|author2=Hood L.|author3=Lichtbown P.|year=1974|title=Imitation in language: If, when, and why|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=6|issue=3|pages=380–420|oclc=65013247|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(74)90018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 1977"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, George A. |title=Spontaneous apprentices: children and language |publisher=Seabury Press |location=New York |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8164-9330-2 |oclc=3002566 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masur 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Masur EF|year=1995|title=Infants' early verbal imitation and their later lexical development|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|volume=41|issue=3|pages=286–306|oclc=89395784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gathercole 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gathercole SE, Baddeley AD | year = 1989 | title = Evaluation of the role of phonological STM in the development of vocabulary in children, A longitudinal study | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=7251627 | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 200–213 | doi = 10.1016/0749-596X(89)90044-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with reduced abilities to repeat nonwords (a marker of speech repetition abilities) show a slower rate of vocabulary expansion than children for whom this is easy.&lt;ref name="Gathercole 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2006|url= http://www.york.ac.uk/res/wml/Gathercole06%20Applied%20PsyLinguistics.pdf|doi= 10.1017/S0142716406060383|author= Gathercole SE|title= Nonword repetition and word learning: The nature of the relationship|journal= Applied Psycholinguistics|volume= 27|issue= 4|pages= 513–543|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110605222602/http://www.york.ac.uk/res/wml/Gathercole06%20Applied%20PsyLinguistics.pdf|archivedate= 2011-06-05|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the elementary units of speech have been selected to enhance the ease with which sound and visual input can be mapped into motor vocalization.&lt;ref name="Skoyles 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9572572|year=1998|last1=Skoyles|first1=JR|title=Speech phones are a replication code|volume=50|issue=2|pages=167–73|journal=Medical Hypotheses|doi=10.1016/S0306-9877(98)90203-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several computational models of vocabulary acquisition have been proposed so far.&lt;ref name="Prahlad"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gupta Prahlad |author2=MacWhinney Brian | year = 1997 | title = Vocabulary acquisition and verbal short-term memory: Computational and neural bases | url = | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 267–333 | doi = 10.1006/brln.1997.1819 | pmid = 9299067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Regier 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Regier Terry | year = 2003 | title = Emergent constraints on word-learning: A computational review | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 263–268 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00108-6 | pmid = 12804693 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.330.5309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Regier 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Regier | first1 = T. | title = The emergence of words: attentional learning in form and meaning | journal = Cogn Sci | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 819–65 |date=Nov 2005 | doi = 10.1207/s15516709cog0000_31 | pmid = 21702796 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.531.1228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hadzibeganovic Tarik |author2=Cannas Sergio A | year = 2009 | title = A Tsallis' statistics based neural network model for novel word learning | url = | journal = Physica A | volume = 388 | issue = 5| pages = 732–746 | doi = 10.1016/j.physa.2008.10.042 | bibcode = 2009PhyA..388..732H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roy Deb K. |author2=Pentland Alex P. | year = 2002 | title = Learning words from sights and sounds: A computational model | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 113–146 | doi = 10.1207/s15516709cog2601_4 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.61.2924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fazly Afsaneh |author2=Alishahi Afra |author3=Stevenson Suzanne | year = 2010 | title = A Probabilistic Computational Model of Cross-Situational Word Learning | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1017–1063 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01104.x | pmid = 21564243 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.639.8919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yu Chen |author2=Ballard Dana H | year = 2007 | title = A unified model of early word learning: Integrating statistical and social cues | url = | journal = Neurocomputing | volume = 70 | issue = 13–15| pages = 2149–2165 | doi = 10.1016/j.neucom.2006.01.034 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.218.7981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various studies have shown that the size of a child's vocabulary by the age of 24 months correlates with the child's future development and language skills. A lack of language richness by this age has detrimental and long-term effects on the child's cognitive development, which is why it is so important for parents to engage their infants in language. If a child knows fifty words or less by the age of 24 months, he or she is classified as a [[Language delay|late-talker]] and future language development, like vocabulary expansion and the organization of grammar, is likely to be slower and stunted.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Two more crucial elements of vocabulary acquisition are word segmentation and statistical learning (described above).  Word segmentation, or the segmentation of words and syllables from fluent speech can be accomplished by eight-month-old infants.&lt;ref name="Saffran 1996 1926–1928"/&gt; By the time infants are 17-months-old, they are able to link meaning to segmented words.&lt;ref name="Graf Estes 2007 254–260"/&gt;

Recent evidence also suggests that motor skills and experiences may influence vocabulary acquisition during infancy. Specifically, learning to sit independently between 3 and 5 months has been found to predict receptive vocabulary at both 10 and 14 months of age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Libertus Klaus |author2=Violi Dominic A | year = 2016 | title = Sit to talk: Relation between motor skills and language development in infancy | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7| issue = | pages =  475| doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00475 | pmid=27065934|pmc=4815289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independent walking skills have been found to correlate with language skills around 10 to 14 months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walle Eric A, Campos Joe J | year = 2014 | title = Infant language development is related to the acquisition of walking | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages =  336–348| doi = 10.1037/a0033238| pmid = 23750505 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/0h67063p }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=He M, Walle Eric A, Campos Joe J | year = 2015 | title = A cross-national investigation of the relationship between infant walking and language development | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/87b6p4gm| journal = Infancy | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages =  283–305| doi = 10.1111/infa.12071}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings show that language acquisition is an embodied process that is influenced by a child’s overall motor abilities and development. Studies have also shown a correlation between Socio-Economic-Status and vocabulary acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Letts|first=Carolyn|date=March 2, 2013|title=Socio-economic status and language acquisition: children's performance on the new Reynell Developmental Language Scales.|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=41069724-3b4b-44db-830b-746dedc8b229%40sessionmgr4010&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=104248595&amp;db=rzh|journal=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders|volume=48|issue=2|pages=131–143|via=Worldcat|doi=10.1111/1460-6984.12004|pmid=23472954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==

Children learn, on average, ten to fifteen new word meanings each day, but only one of these words can be accounted for by direct instruction.&lt;ref name="Landauer"/&gt; The other nine to fourteen word meanings need to be picked up in some other way. It has been proposed that children acquire these meanings with the use of processes modeled by [[latent semantic analysis]]; that is, when they meet an unfamiliar word, children can use information in its context to correctly guess its rough area of meaning.&lt;ref name="Landauer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landauer | first1 = TK | last2 = Dumais | first2 = ST.  | year = 1997 | title = A solution to Plato's problem: The latent semantic analysis theory of acquisition | url = http://www.edtechpolicy.org/AAASGW/Session2/landauer_article.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 104 | issue = 2| pages = 211–240 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.104.2.211| citeseerx = 10.1.1.184.4759 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A child may expand the meaning and use of certain words that are already part of its [[mental lexicon]] in order to denominate anything that is somehow related but for which it does not know the specific words yet. For instance, a child may broaden the use of ''mummy'' and ''dada'' in order to indicate anything that belongs to its mother or father, or perhaps every person who resembles its own parents, or say ''rain'' while meaning ''I don't want to go out''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Fry, Dennis|year=1977|title=Homo loquens, Man as a talking animal|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages= 115–116|isbn=978-0-521-29239-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also reason to believe that children use various [[heuristic]]s to properly infer the meaning of words. [[Ellen Markman|Markman]] and others have proposed that children assume words to refer to objects with similar properties ("cow" and "pig" might both be "animals") rather than to objects that are thematically related ("cow" and "milk" are probably not both "animals").&lt;ref name="Markman 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markman|first1=Ellen M.|title=Constraints Children Place on Word Meanings|journal=Cognitive Science| volume=14| issue=1| year=1990| pages=57–77| url=http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/1990v14/i01/p0057p0077/MAIN.PDF| doi=10.1207/s15516709cog1401_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children also seem to adhere to the "whole object assumption" and think that a novel label refers to an entire entity rather than one of its parts.&lt;ref name="Markman 1990" /&gt; This assumption along with other resources, such as grammar and morphological cues or lexical constraints, may help aid the child in acquiring word-meaning, but they also conflict some of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Mikkel B.|last2=Markman|first2=Ellen M.|title=Children's use of mutual exclusivity to learn labels for parts of objects.|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=592–596|doi=10.1037/a0014838|pmid=19271842|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurocognitive research==

According to several linguists, neurocognitive research has confirmed many standards of language learning, such as: "learning engages the entire person (cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains), the human brain seeks patterns in its searching for meaning, emotions affect all aspects of learning, retention and recall, past experience always affects new learning, the brain's working memory has a limited capacity, lecture usually results in the lowest degree of retention, rehearsal is essential for retention, practice [alone] does not make perfect, and each brain is unique" (Sousa, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;274). In terms of genetics, the gene [[ROBO1]] has been associated with phonological buffer integrity or length.&lt;ref name="Bates 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bates | first1 = TC. | last2 = Luciano | first2 = M. | last3 = Medland | first3 = SE. | last4 = Montgomery | first4 = GW. | last5 = Wright | first5 = MJ. | last6 = Martin | first6 = NG. | title = Genetic variance in a component of the language acquisition device: ROBO1 polymorphisms associated with phonological buffer deficits | journal = Behav Genet | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–7 |date=Jan 2011 | doi = 10.1007/s10519-010-9402-9 | pmid = 20949370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is difficult to determine without invasive measures which exact parts of the brain become most active and important for language acquisition, [[fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] technology has allowed for some conclusions to be made about where language may be centered. [[Kuniyoshi Sakai]] proposed, based on several neuroimaging studies, that there may be a "grammar center", where language is primarily processed in the left lateral [[premotor cortex]] (located near the pre central sulcus and the [[inferior frontal sulcus]]). Additionally, these studies proposed that first language and second-language acquisition may be represented differently in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]].&lt;ref name="Sakai, 2005"/&gt;
In a study conducted by Newman et al., the relationship between cognitive neuroscience and language acquisition was compared through a standardized test procedure involving native speakers of English and native Spanish speakers who have all had a similar amount of exposure to the English language(averaging about 26 years). Even the number of times an examinee blinked was taken into account during the examination process. It was concluded that the brain does in fact process languages differently, but instead of it being directly related to proficiency levels, it is more so about how the brain processes language itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newman | first1 = A. J. | last2 = Tremblay | first2 = A. | last3 = Nichols | first3 = E. S. | last4 = Neville | first4 = H. J. | last5 = Ullman | first5 = M.

During early infancy, language processing seems to occur over many areas in the brain. However, over time, it gradually becomes concentrated into two areas – [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]]. Broca's area is in the left [[frontal cortex]] and is primarily involved in the production of the patterns in vocal and sign language. Wernicke's area is in the left [[temporal cortex]] and is primarily involved in language comprehension. The specialization of these language centers is so extensive that damage to them results in a critical condition known as [[aphasia]].&lt;ref name="Schacter 2011"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Schacter | first1 = Daniel L. | last2 = Gilbert | first2 = Daniel Todd. | last3 = Wegner | first3 = Daniel M. | title = Psycholog | year = 2011 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4292-3719-2 | oclc = 696604625 | page = 357  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a typically human phenomenon==
The capacity to acquire and use language is a key aspect that distinguishes [[FOXP2 and human evolution|humans]] from other beings. Although it is difficult to pin down what aspects of language are uniquely human, there are a few design features that can be found in all known forms of human language, but that are missing from forms of [[animal communication]]. For example, many animals are able to communicate with each other by signaling to the things around them, but this kind of communication lacks the arbitrariness of human vernaculars (in that there is nothing about the sound of the word "dog" that would hint at its meaning). Other forms of animal communication may utilize arbitrary sounds, but are unable to combine those sounds in different ways to create completely novel messages that can then be automatically understood by another. [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]] called this design feature of human language "productivity". It is crucial to the understanding of human language acquisition that we are not limited to a finite set of words, but, rather, must be able to understand and utilize a complex system that allows for an infinite number of possible messages. So, while many forms of animal communication exist, they differ from human languages in that they have a limited range of vocabulary tokens, and the vocabulary items are not combined syntactically to create phrases.&lt;ref name="=Tomasello, 2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomasello, Michael |title=Origins of human communication |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-262-20177-3 |oclc=439979810 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelingual deafness==
{{Main|prelingual deafness}}{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

Prelingual deafness is defined as hearing loss that occurred at birth or before an individual has learned to speak. In the United States, 2 to 3 out of every 1000 children are born deaf or hard of hearing. Even though it might be presumed that deaf children acquire language in different ways since they are not receiving the same auditory input as hearing children, many research findings indicate that deaf children acquire language in the same way that hearing children do and when given the proper language input, understand and express language just as well as their hearing peers. Babies who learn sign language produce signs or gestures that are more regular and more frequent than hearing babies acquiring spoken language. Just as hearing babies babble, deaf babies acquiring sign language will babble with their hands, otherwise known as [[manual babbling]]. Therefore, as many studies have shown, [[language acquisition by deaf children]] parallel the language acquisition of a spoken language by hearing children because humans are biologically equipped for language regardless of the modality.

=== Signed Language Acquisition ===
Deaf children's visual-manual language acquisition not only parallel spoken language acquisition but by the age of 30 months, most deaf children that were exposed to a visual language had a more advanced grasp with subject-pronoun copy rules than hearing children. Their vocabulary bank at the ages of 12–17 months exceed that of a hearing child's, though it does even out when they reach the two-word stage. The use of space for absent referents and the more complex handshapes in some signs prove to be difficult for children between 5 and 9 years of age because of motor development and the complexity of remembering the spacial use.  Despite certain myths about deaf children signing, their acquisition of a signed language not only develops normally, it exceeds that of a hearing child's at certain points.

=== Cochlear Implants ===
Other options besides sign language for kids with prelingual deafness include the use hearing aids to strengthen remaining sensory cells or [[cochlear implant]]s to stimulate the hearing nerve directly. Cochlear Implants are hearing devices that are placed behind the ear and contain a receiver and electrodes which are placed under the skin and inside the cochlea. Despite these developments, there is still a risk that prelingually deaf children are may not develop good speech and speech reception skills. Although cochlear implants produce sounds, they are unlike typical hearing and deaf and hard of hearing people must undergo intensive therapy in order to learn how to interpret these sounds. They must also learn how to speak given the range of hearing they may or may not have. However, deaf children of deaf parents tend to do better with language, even though they are isolated from sound and speech because their language uses a different mode of communication that is accessible to them; the visual modality of language.

Although cochlear implants were initially approved for adults, now there is pressure to implant children early in order to maximize auditory skills for mainstream learning which in turn has created controversy around the topic. Due to recent advances in technology, cochlear implants allow some deaf people to acquire some sense of hearing. There are interior and exposed exterior components that are surgically implanted. Those who receive cochlear implants earlier on in life show more improvement on speech comprehension and language. Spoken language development does vary widely for those with cochlear implants though due to a number of different factors including: age at implantation, frequency, quality and type of speech training. Some evidence suggests that speech processing occurs at a more rapid pace in some prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants than those with traditional hearing aids. However, cochlear implants may not always work.

Research shows that people develop better language with a cochlear implant when they have a solid first language to rely on to understand the second language they would be learning. In the case of prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants, a signed language, like [[American Sign Language]] would be an accessible language for them to learn to help support the use of the cochlear implant as they learn a spoken language as their L2. Without a solid, accessible first language, these children run the risk of language deprivation, especially in the case that a cochlear implant fails to work. They would have no access to sound, meaning no access to the spoken language they are supposed to be learning. If a signed language was not a strong language for them to use and neither was a spoken language, they now have no access to any language and run the risk of missing their [[Critical period]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8843">'''Life skills''' are abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable humans to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Life Skills Education for Children and Adolescents in Schools"[[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is also termed as [[psychosocial]] competency.&lt;ref&gt;Best Thomas, A study on stress and its correlatives with family environment. Retrieved from [[ResearchGate]].&lt;/ref&gt; The subject varies greatly depending on [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and community expectations but skills that function for well-being and aid individuals to develop into active and productive members of their communities are considered as life skills.

==Enumeration and categorization==

The [[UNICEF]] Evaluation Office suggests that "there is no definitive list" of psychosocial skills;&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2012"&gt;
{{cite web
| url           = http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/UNICEF_GLS_Web.pdf
| title         = Global evaluation of life skills education programmes

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
nevertheless [[UNICEF]] enumerates psychosocial and interpersonal skills that are generally well-being oriented, and essential alongside literacy and [[numeracy]] skills. Since it changes its meaning from culture to culture and life positions, it is considered a concept that is elastic in nature. But UNICEF acknowledges social and emotional life skills identified by Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513044119/https://casel.org/why-it-matters/what-is-sel/skills-competencies|url=https://casel.org/why-it-matters/what-is-sel/skills-competencies|title=Skills &amp; Competencies - CASEL|archivedate=13 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life skills are a product of synthesis: many skills are developed simultaneously through practice, like [[humor]], which allows a person to feel in [[Locus of control|control]] of a situation and make it more manageable in perspective. It allows the person to release fears, anger, and stress &amp; achieve a qualitative life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/tc/humor-therapy-topic-overview|title=Do Hasya Yoga|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, decision-making often involves critical thinking ("what are my options?") and values clarification ("what is important to me?"), ("How do I ''feel'' about this?"). Ultimately, the interplay between the skills is what produces powerful behavioral outcomes, especially where this approach is supported by other strategies.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/search/search.php?q=Life-skills&amp;type=Main|title=UNICEF – Search Results|publisher=unicef.org|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life skills can vary from financial literacy,&lt;ref name="USA Funds Life Skills"&gt;[http://content.usafunds.org/financial_aid/products/ourproducts/pages/lifeskills.aspx USA Funds Life Skills] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317045654/http://content.usafunds.org/financial_aid/products/ourproducts/Pages/lifeskills.aspx |date=2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Substance abuse prevention|substance-abuse prevention]], to therapeutic techniques to deal with disabilities such as [[autism]].

===Life skills===

The [[World Health Organization]] in 1999 identified the following core cross-cultural areas of life skills:&lt;ref name="WHO 1999"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/30.pdf |title=Partners in Life Skills Education : Conclusions from a United Nations Inter-Agency Meeting |date=1999 |website=[[World Health Organization]] |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[decision-making]] and [[problem-solving]];
* [[creative thinking]] (''see also:'' [[lateral thinking]]) and [[critical thinking]];
* [[communication]] and [[interpersonal skills]]; 
* [[self-awareness]] and [[empathy]]; 
* [[assertiveness]] and [[equanimity]]; and
* [[Psychological resilience|resilience]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with emotions and coping with stress.

UNICEF listed similar skills and related categories in its 2012 report.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2012"/&gt;

Life skills curricula designed for [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] often emphasize communications and practical skills needed for successful independent living as well as for developmental-disabilities/special-education students with an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP).&lt;ref name="PSESD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psesd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=297&amp;Itemid=448 |title=Puget Sound ESD – excellence &amp;amp; equity in education &amp;#124; Pre-K-12 Life Skills Curriculum Guide |publisher=psesd.org|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parenting: a venue of life skills nourishment==
Life skills are often taught in the domain of [[Parenting#Skills|parenting]], either indirectly through the observation and experience of the child, or directly with the purpose of teaching a specific skill. Parenting itself can be considered as a set of life skills which can be taught or comes natural to a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.4135/9781412958479.n53|chapter = Behavioral parent training|title = Encyclopedia of Human Relationships|year = 2009|last1 = Prinz|first1 = Ron| isbn=9781412958462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating a person in skills for dealing with [[pregnancy]] and parenting can also coincide with additional life skills development for the child and enable the parents to guide their children in adulthood.

Many life skills programs are offered when traditional family structures and healthy relationships have broken down, whether due to parental lapses, divorce, psychological disorders or due to issues with the children (such as substance abuse or other risky behavior). For example, the [[International Labour Organization]] is teaching life skills to ex-child laborers and [[At-risk students#At-risk students|at-risk children]] in Indonesia to help them avoid and to recover from worst forms of [[child abuse]].&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/jakarta/whatwedo/eventsandmeetings/lang--en/WCMS_151750/index.htm Improving Vocational and Life Skills of Ex-Child Labourers and at Risk Children Aged 15 to 17 Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926070201/http://www.ilo.org/jakarta/whatwedo/eventsandmeetings/lang--en/WCMS_151750/index.htm |date=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models: behavior prevention vs. positive development==

While certain life skills programs focus on teaching the prevention of certain behaviors, they can be relatively ineffective. Based upon their research, the Family and Youth Services Bureau,&lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/fysb|title=Home &amp;#124; Family and Youth Services Bureau &amp;#124; Administration for Children and Families|publisher=acf.hhs.gov|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a division of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] advocates the theory of [[Positive Youth Development]] (PYD) as a replacement for the less effective prevention programs. PYD focuses on the strengths of an individual as opposed to the older decrepit models which tend to focus on the "potential" weaknesses that have yet to be shown. The Family and Youth Services Bureau has found that individuals who were trained in life skills by positive development model identified themselves with a greater sense of confidence, usefulness, sensitivity and openness rather than that of preventive model.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[File:Moon Phase and Libration, 2013.ogv|thumb|The lunar phases and [[libration]]s in 2013 at hourly intervals, with music, titles, and supplemental graphics.]]
[[File:Lunar libration with phase Oct 2007 450px.gif|thumb|right|200px|Animation of the [[Moon]] as it cycles through its phases, as seen from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] in 2007. The apparent wobbling of the Moon is known as [[libration]]. The gradual change in [[apparent size]] is due to the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the [[orbit of the Moon|lunar orbit]]. (North is up.)]]
[[File:South-Lunar libration with phase Oct 2007 450px.gif|thumb|right|200px|Another animation of the Moon as it cycles through its phases, as seen from the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in 2007. (North is down.)]]

The '''lunar phase''' or '''phase of the Moon''' is the shape of the directly [[sunlight|sunlit]] portion of the [[Moon]] as viewed from [[Earth]]. The lunar phases gradually and cyclically change over the period of a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]] (about 29.53 days), as the [[orbit]]al positions of the Moon around Earth and of Earth around the [[Sun]] shift.

The Moon's rotation is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] by Earth's [[gravity]]; therefore, most of the same lunar side always faces Earth. This [[near side of the Moon|near side]] is variously sunlit, depending on the position of the Moon in [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]]. Thus, the sunlit portion of this face can vary from 0% (at [[new moon]]) to 100% (at [[full moon]]). The [[Terminator (solar)#Lunar terminator|lunar terminator]] is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres.

Each of the four "intermediate" lunar phases (see below) is around 7.4 [[day]]s, but this [[orbital eccentricity|varies slightly]] due to the [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] shape of the Moon's orbit. Aside from some [[lunar craters|craters]] near the lunar poles, such as [[Shoemaker (lunar crater)|Shoemaker]], all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of [[daylight]], followed by 14.77 days of "[[night]]". (The [[far side of the Moon|side of the Moon]] facing away from Earth is sometimes called the "dark side of the Moon", although that is a [[misnomer]].)

==Phases of the Moon==
In [[western culture]], the four ''principal phases'' of the Moon are [[new moon]], first quarter, [[full moon]], and third quarter (also known as last quarter). These are the instances when the Moon's [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitude]] and the Sun's [[ecliptic]] longitude differ by 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, respectively.{{efn|Strictly, the quarter phases happen when the observer–Moon–Sun angle is 90°, also known as [[quadrature (astronomy)|quadrature]]. This is not exactly the same as having the Sun–observer–Moon angle a right-angle, but the difference is very slight.}} Each of these phases occur at slightly different times when viewed from different points on Earth. During the intervals between principal phases, the Moon's apparent shape is either [[crescent]] or [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]]. These shapes, and the periods when the Moon shows them, are called the ''intermediate phases'' and last one-quarter of a [[synodic month]], or 7.38 days, on average. However, their durations [[orbital eccentricity|vary slightly]] because the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]] is rather [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]], so the satellite's [[orbital speed]] is not constant. The descriptor ''waxing'' is used for an intermediate phase when the Moon's apparent shape is thickening, from new to full moon, and ''waning'' when the shape is thinning.

The eight principal and intermediate phases are given the following names, in sequential order:

Non-Western cultures may use a different number of lunar phases; for example, traditional [[Hawaiian culture]] has a total of 30 phases (one per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hawaiian Moon Names |work=Imiloa, Hilo Attractions |url=http://www.imiloahawaii.org/57/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waxing and waning===
When the Sun and Moon are [[conjunction (astronomy)|aligned on the same side]] of the Earth, the Moon is "new", and the side of the Moon facing Earth is not illuminated by the Sun. As the Moon ''waxes'' (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing), the lunar phases progress through new moon, crescent moon, first-quarter moon, [[wikt:gibbous|gibbous]] moon, and full moon. The Moon is then said to ''wane'' as it passes through the gibbous moon, third-quarter moon, crescent moon, and back to new moon. The terms ''old moon'' and ''new moon'' are not interchangeable. The "old moon" is a waning sliver (which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye) until the moment it aligns with the Sun and begins to wax, at which point it becomes new again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Free Astronomy Lesson 7 - The Phases of the Moon |url=http://www.synapses.co.uk/astro/moon2.html |website=Synapses.co.uk |accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half moon'' is often used to mean the first- and third-quarter moons, while the term ''quarter'' refers to the extent of the Moon's cycle around the Earth, not its shape.

When an illuminated hemisphere is viewed from a certain angle, the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape as defined by the intersection of an [[ellipse]] and circle (in which the ellipse's [[major axis]] coincides with the circle's diameter). If the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be gibbous (bulging outwards),&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1350–1400; Middle English &lt; Latin ''gibbōsus''  humped, equivalent to ''gibb'' "(a) hump" + ''-ōsus'' "-ous"; {{cite web |title=Gibbous |work=[[Dictionary.com]] |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gibbous}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be a [[crescent]]. When a crescent moon occurs, the phenomenon of [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] may be apparent, where the night side of the Moon dimly reflects indirect sunlight reflected from Earth.

===Orientation by latitude===
In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], if the left (east) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thickening, and the Moon is described as [[wikt:wax|waxing]] (shifting toward full moon). If the right (west) side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thinning, and the Moon is described as waning (past full and shifting toward new moon). Assuming that the viewer is in the Northern Hemisphere, the right side of the Moon is the part that is always waxing. (That is, if the right side is dark, the Moon is becoming darker; if the right side is lit, the Moon is getting brighter.)

In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the Moon is observed from a perspective inverted, or rotated 180°, to that of the Northern and to all of the images in this article, so that the opposite sides appear to wax or wane.

Closer to the [[Equator]], the [[lunar terminator]] will appear horizontal during the morning and evening. Since the above descriptions of the lunar phases only apply at [[middle latitude|middle]] or [[polar regions of Earth|high latitudes]], observers moving towards the [[tropics]] from northern or southern latitudes will see the Moon rotated anti-clockwise or clockwise with respect to the images in this article.

The lunar crescent can open upward or downward, with the "horns" of the crescent pointing up or down, respectively. When the Sun appears above the Moon in the sky, the crescent opens downward; when the Moon is above the Sun, [[wet moon|the crescent opens upward]]. The crescent Moon is most clearly and brightly visible when the Sun is below the horizon, which implies that the Moon must be above the Sun, and the crescent must open upward. This is therefore the orientation in which the crescent Moon is most often seen from the tropics. The waxing and waning crescents look very similar. The waxing crescent appears in the western sky in the evening, and the waning crescent in the eastern sky in the morning.

===Earthshine===
{{main article|Earthlight (astronomy)}}

When the Moon as seen from Earth is a narrow crescent, Earth as viewed from the Moon is almost fully lit by the Sun. Often, the dark side of the Moon is dimly illuminated by indirect sunlight reflected from Earth, but is bright enough to be easily visible from Earth. This phenomenon is called [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] and sometimes picturesquely described as "the old moon in the new moon's arms" or, as pictured here, "the new moon in the old moon's arms".

==Calendar==
{{main article|Lunar calendar}}
[[File:Moon phase calendar May2005.jpg|thumb|left|May–June 2005 calendar of lunar phases]]

The [[Gregorian calendar]] month, which is {{frac|12}} of a [[tropical year]], is about 30.44 days, while the cycle of lunar phases (the Moon's [[Orbital period#Synodic period|synodic period]]) repeats every [[Lunar month#Synodic month|29.53 days]] on average. Therefore, the timing of the lunar phases shifts by an average of almost one day for each successive month. (A [[lunar year]] lasts about 354 days.)

Photographing the Moon's phase everyday for a month (starting in the evening after [[sunset]], and repeating roughly 24 hours and 50 minutes later, and ending in the morning before [[sunrise]]) and arranging the series of photos on a calendar would create a [[composite image]] like the example calendar (May 8 &amp;ndash; June 6, 2005) shown on the left. May 20 is blank because a picture would be taken before midnight on May 19 and the next after midnight on May 21.

Similarly, on a calendar listing moonrise or moonset times, some days will appear to be skipped. When moonrise precedes [[midnight]] one night, the next moonrise will follow midnight on the next night (so too with moonset). The "skipped day" is just a feature of the Moon's [[prograde motion|eastward movement]] in relation to the Sun, which at most latitudes, causes the Moon to rise later each day. The Moon follows a predictable orbit every month.

== Calculating phase ==
[[File:BethinAZ - 10-13.002 (by).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Crescent moon over [[Kingman, Arizona]].]]
Each of the 4 lunar phases lasts approximately 7 days (~7.4 days), but varies slightly due to lunar [[apogee]] and [[perigee]].

The number of days counted from the time of the New Moon is the Moon's "age". Each complete cycle of phases is called a "[[lunation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/moon_phases.php|title=Phases of the Moon and Percent of the Moon Illuminated|website=aa.usno.navy.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approximate age of the moon, and hence the approximate phase, can be calculated for any date by calculating the number of days since a known new moon (such as January 1, 1900 or August 11, 1999) and reducing this [[modulo operation|modulo]] 29.530588853 (the length of a [[synodic month]]). The difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the [[Julian day|Julian Day Number]] of one from that of the other, or there are simpler formulae giving (for instance) the number of days since December 31, 1899. However, this calculation assumes a perfectly circular orbit and makes no allowance for the time of day at which the new moon happened, therefore may be incorrect by several hours (it also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date); it is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing moon phase, but specialist usage taking account of lunar [[apogee]] and [[perigee]] requires a more elaborate calculation.

== Effect of [[parallax]] ==
The [[Earth]] subtends an angle of about two degrees, when seen from the Moon. This means that an observer on Earth who sees the Moon when it is close to the eastern horizon sees it from an angle that is about 2 degrees different from the line of sight of an observer who sees the Moon on the [[West|western horizon]]. The Moon moves about 12 degrees around its orbit per day, so, if these observers were stationary, they would see the phases of the Moon at times that differ by about one-sixth of a day, or 4 hours. But in reality the observers are on the surface of the rotating Earth, so someone who sees the Moon on the [[East|eastern horizon]] at one moment sees it on the western horizon about 12 hours later. This adds an oscillation to the apparent progression of the lunar phases. They appear to occur more slowly when the Moon is high in the sky than when it is below the horizon. The Moon appears to move jerkily, and the phases do the same. The amplitude of this oscillation is never more than about four hours, which is a small fraction of a [[month]]. It does not have any obvious effect on the appearance of the Moon. However, it does affect accurate calculations of the times of lunar phases.

== Misconceptions ==
[[File:Orbit of the Moon in 2013.ogv|right|thumb|The ''lunar phase'' depends on the Moon's position in orbit around the Earth and the Earth's position in orbit around the sun. This animation (''not to scale'') looks down on Earth from the north pole of the ecliptic.]]

It might be expected that once every month, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun during a new moon, its shadow would fall on Earth causing a [[solar eclipse]], but this does not happen every month. Nor is it true that during every full moon, the [[Earth's shadow]] falls on the Moon, causing a [[lunar eclipse]]. Solar and lunar eclipses are not observed ''every'' month because the plane of the [[Moon's orbit]] around the Earth is tilted by about 5° with respect to the plane of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun (the plane of the [[ecliptic]]). Thus, when new and full moons occur, the Moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the Earth and Sun. Although an [[eclipse]] can only occur when the Moon is either new (solar) or full (lunar), it must also be positioned very near the intersection of Earth's orbital plane about the Sun and the Moon's orbital plane about the Earth (that is, at one of [[lunar node|its nodes]]). This happens about twice per year, and so there are between four and seven eclipses in a calendar year. Most of these eclipses are partial; total eclipses of the Moon or Sun are less frequent.

The '''Madras Institute of Development Studies''' ('''MIDS''') is a research institute based in [[Chennai]]. It is a joint undertaking of the Governments of [[Government of India|India]] and [[Government of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu]] for conducting research on development problems in [[Tamil Nadu]] and the rest of [[India]].&lt;ref name="mids1"&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
MIDS was established by [[Malcolm Adiseshiah]] and his wife Elizabeth Adiseshiah in January 1971. Malcolm Adiseshiah served as its first Director. In March 1977, MIDS was reconstituted as a National Research Institute under the sponsorship of [[Government of India]] through the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] and the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. The Adiseshiah's donated the land, buildings, furniture, equipment and made cash endowments to the newly constituted institute. Malcolm Adiseshiah resigned as MIDS' Director in 1978 and became the Chairman and Honorary fellow. Professor [[C.T. Kurien]] became the next Director of MIDS. In 1985, the [[Reserve Bank of India]] established a Chair for applied research in regional economics, which has since been converted to a fully autonomous unit in 2002.&lt;ref name="mids1"/&gt;

==Administration==
MIDS is governed by a Governing Council and an Academic Council. The Governing Council consists of the Chairperson, the Institute's Director as member-secretary, representatives of faculty, the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]], the Government of Tamil Nadu, and from the universities of the four South Indian states, trustees of the Institute, and co-opted social scientists, as members. It ordinarily meets once a year, while its Finance Committee and Executive Council meet twice a year. The Academic Council consists of the Director as chairperson, and both external and internal members. All the professors of the Institute are its members; other faculty members and the Ph.D. scholars serve on it in rotation. Five reputed social scientists from other universities and institutes are members of the Academic Council. Each of them serve for three years. The Council meets twice a year to review, and provide guidelines on, the academic activities of the Institute.&lt;ref name="mids1"/&gt;

==Academics==
MIDS' research focuses on subjects like development and planning, centre-state relationship, poverty, inequality, agrarian issues, social movements, caste and communal politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldis.org/go/home&amp;id=4394&amp;type=Organisation&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a full-time doctoral program under three classes - Indian Council of Social Science Research fellowships, RBI{{clarify|date=October 2017|reason=what is this jargon?}} fellowships and Malcolm &amp; Elizabeth Adiseshiah Ph.D. Merit Scholarship. It also offers an annual award called "The Malcolm Adiseshiah award" for mid-career academicians in the field of developmental studies. Prominent faculty members of MIDS (both past and present) include [[Kaushik Basu]], [[A R Venkatachalapathy]], Padmini Swaminathan and  K. Nagaraj. Its publication cell publishes books and academic papers (sometimes in collaboration with Kalachuvadu Pathippagam, a Tamil publishing house). It also brings out a bi-annual bulletin called "Review of Development and Change".&lt;ref name="mids2"&gt;.

The '''middle lamella''' is a [[pectin]] layer which cements the [[cell wall]]s of two adjoining [[plant cells]] together. It is the first formed layer which is deposited at the time of [[cytokinesis]].&lt;ref name="Sofradzija"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sofradžija A., Šoljan D., Hadžiselimović R. |year= 2007|title= Biologija 1.|publisher= Svjetlost, Sarajevo|isbn=9958-10-686-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cell plate that is formed during cell division itself develops into middle lamella or lamellum. The middle lamella is made up of calcium and magnesium pectates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cell Organelles|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/biology/cells-and-organelles/revise-it/organelles|work=A-level revision guide|publisher=S-cool|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mature plant cell it is the outermost layer of [[cell wall]].&lt;ref name= "Alberts"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alberts B. et al.|year=2002|title= Molecular Biology of the Cell, 4th Ed.|publisher= Garland Science|isbn=0-8153-4072-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "king"&gt;{{cite book|authors=King R.

In plants, the pectins form a unified and continuous layer between adjacent cells. Frequently, it is difficult to distinguish the middle lamella from the primary wall, especially in cells that develop thick secondary walls. In such cases, the two adjacent primary walls and the middle lamella, and perhaps the first layer of the secondary wall of each cell, may be called a compound middle lamella. When the middle lamella is degraded by enzymes, as happens during fruit ripening, the adjacent cells will separate.&lt;ref&gt;Raven P. H.,  Johnson G. B. (2001): Biology.

The '''minimum intelligent signal test''', or '''MIST''', is a variation of the [[Turing test]] proposed by [[Chris McKinstry]] in which only [[Wiktionary:boolean|boolean]] (yes/no or true/false) answers may be given to questions.  The purpose of such a test is to provide a quantitative statistical measure of ''humanness'', which may subsequently be used to optimize the performance of [[artificial intelligence]] systems intended to imitate human responses.

McKinstry gathered approximately 80,000 propositions that could be answered yes or no, e.g.:

* Is Earth a planet?
* Was Abraham Lincoln once President of the United States?
* Is the sun bigger than my foot?
* Do people sometimes lie?

He called these propositions [[Mindpixel]]s.

These questions test both specific knowledge of aspects of culture, and basic facts about the meaning of various words and concepts. It could therefore be compared with the [[SAT]], [[intelligence test]]ing and other controversial measures of mental ability. McKinstry's aim was not to distinguish between shades of intelligence but to identify whether a computer program could be considered intelligent at all.

According to McKinstry, a program able to do much better than chance on a large number of MIST questions would be judged to have some level of intelligence and understanding. For example, on a 20-question test, if a program were guessing the answers at random, it could be expected to score 10 correct on average. But the [[probability]] of a program scoring 20 out of 20 correct by guesswork is only one in 2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. one in 1,048,576; so if a program were able to sustain this level of performance over several independent trials, with no prior access to the propositions, it should be considered intelligent.

==Discussion==

McKinstry criticized existing approaches to [[artificial intelligence]] such as [[chatterbot]]s, saying that his questions could "kill" AI programs by quickly exposing their weaknesses. He contrasted his approach, a series of direct questions assessing an AI's capabilities, to the Turing test and [[Loebner Prize]] method of engaging an AI in undirected typed conversation.

Critics{{who|date=May 2013}} of the MIST have noted that it would be easy to "kill" a McKinstry-style AI too, due to the impossibility of supplying it with correct answers to all possible yes/no questions by ways of a finite set of human-generated Mindpixels: the fact that an AI can answer the question "Is the sun bigger than my foot?" correctly does not mean that it can answer variations like "Is the sun bigger than (my hand | my liver | an egg yolk | Alpha Centauri A | ...)" correctly, too.

However, the late McKinstry might have replied that a truly intelligent, knowledgeable entity (on a par with humans) would be able to work out answers such as (yes | yes | yes | don't know | ...) by applying its knowledge of the relative sizes of the objects named. In other words, the MIST was intended as a test of AI, not as a suggestion for implementing AI.

It can also be argued that the MIST is a more objective test of intelligence than the Turing test, a subjective assessment that some might consider to be more a measure of the interrogator's gullibility than of the machine's intelligence. According to this argument, a human's judgment of a Turing test is vulnerable to the [[ELIZA effect]], a tendency to mistake superficial signs of intelligence for the real thing, [[anthropomorph]]izing the program. The response, suggested by [[Alan Turing]]'s essay "Can Machines Think?", is that if a program is a convincing imitation of an intelligent being, it is in fact intelligent. The dispute is thus over what it means for a program to have "real" intelligence, and by what signs it can be detected.

A similar debate exists in the controversy over [[Great Ape language]], in which nonhuman primates are said to have learned some aspects of sign languages but the significance of this learning is disputed.

'''Noise pollution''', also known as [[environmental noise]] or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise with harmful impact on the activity of human or animal life. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport and transportation systems.&lt;ref name="Senate"&gt;Senate Public Works Committee.

Urban Transportation Division.&lt;/ref&gt; Poor [[urban planning]] may give rise to noise pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas. Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include [[loud music]], [[transportation]] noise, lawn care maintenance, nearby [[construction]], or young people yelling (sports games). Noise pollution associated with household electricity generators is an emerging environmental degradation in many developing nations. The average noise level of 97.60&amp;nbsp;dB obtained exceeded the WHO value of 50&amp;nbsp;dB allowed for residential areas.&lt;ref&gt;Menkiti  Nwasinachi U., Agunwamba Jonah C (2015), Assessment of noise pollution from electricity generators in a high-density residential area, African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development, Pages 306 –312, Volume 7, Issue 4, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20421338.2015.1082370&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that noise pollution is the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Joan A; James, Peter; Morello-Forsch, Rachel.

{{Main|Health effects from noise}}
Noise pollution affects both health and behavior. Unwanted sound (noise) can damage  physiological health. Noise pollution can cause [[hypertension]], high stress levels, [[tinnitus]], hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;S.

[[File:Sound level meter with sound waves.png|alt=|thumb|340x340px|A [[sound level meter]], is one of the main tools for measuring sounds in the environment and the workplace]]
Sound becomes unwanted when it either interferes with normal activities such as sleep or conversation, or disrupts or diminishes one's quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jefferson|first=Catrice|title=Noise Pollution|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/noise.html|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noise-induced hearing loss]] can be caused by prolonged exposure to noise levels above 85 A-weighted, [[decibel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/noise-induced-hearing-loss |title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss|last=National Institutes of Health|first=NIDCD|date=Feb 7, 2017 |website= |access-date= June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A comparison of [[Maaban]] tribesmen, who were insignificantly exposed to transportation or industrial noise, to a typical U.S. population showed that chronic exposure to moderately high levels of environmental noise contributes to hearing loss.&lt;ref name="Rosen" /&gt;

Noise exposure in the workplace can also contribute to [[noise-induced hearing loss]] and other health issues. Occupational hearing loss is one of the most common work-related illnesses in the U.S. and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise |title= NOISE and HEARING LOSS PREVENTION |last= National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |first= |date=Feb 6, 2018 |website= |access-date= June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less addressed is how humans adapt to noise subjectively. Indeed, tolerance for noise is frequently independent of decibel levels. However, Murray Schafer's soundscape research was groundbreaking in this regard. In his eponymous work, he makes compelling arguments about how humans relate to noise on a subjective level, and how such subjectivity is conditioned by culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schafer |first=Murray |title=The Soundscape |date=1977 |publisher= Destiny Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that sound is an expression of power, and as such, material culture (e.g., fast cars or Harley Davidson motorcycles with aftermarket pipes) tend to have louder engines not only for safety reasons, but for expressions of power by dominating the soundscape with a particular sound. Other key research in this area can be seen in Fong's comparative analysis of soundscape differences between Bangkok, Thailand and Los Angeles, California, US. Fong's research methodology was modeled after Schafer, and the research findings show how not only do soundscapes differ, but they also rather explicitly point to the level of urban development in the area; that is, cities in the periphery – in Immanuel Wallerstein-speak – will have different soundscapes than that of cities in the core. Fong's important findings tie not only soundscape appreciation to our subjective views of sound, but also demonstrates how different sounds of the soundscape are indicative of class differences in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fong |first1=Jack |title= Making Operative Concepts from Murray Schafer's Soundscapes Typology: A Qualitative and Comparative Analysis of Noise Pollution in Bangkok, Thailand and Los Angeles, California |journal= Urban Studies |date=2014 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=173–192 |doi= 10.1177/0042098014562333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise pollution, particularly sudden explosive noises as typified by high-performance car exhausts, poses a particular nuisance to adults and children on the [[Autism spectrum|autistic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.autismspeaks.org/expert-opinion/autism-anxiety-parents-seek-help-extreme-reaction-loud-noise-0|title=Autism &amp; Anxiety: Parents seek help for extreme reaction to loud noise {{!}} Autism Speaks|website=Autism Speaks|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wildlife===
Noise can have a detrimental effect on wild animals, increasing the risk of death by changing the delicate balance in predator or prey detection and avoidance, and interfering the use of the sounds in communication, especially in relation to reproduction and in navigation. These effects then may alter more interactions within a community through indirect (“[[domino]]”) effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Testing the AC/DC hypothesis: Rock and roll is noise pollution and weakens a trophic cascade |journal= Ecology and Evolution |doi= 10.1002/ece3.4273 |doi-broken-date= 2018-08-19 |first=Brandon T. |last=Barton |first2=Mariah E. |last2=Hodge |first3=Cori J. |last3=Speights |first4=Anna M. |last4=Autrey |first5=Marcus A. |last5=Lashley |first6=Vincent P. |last6=Klink|date=10 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acoustic overexposure can lead to temporary or permanent loss of hearing.

An impact of noise on wild animal life is the [[Habitat of usable habitat]] that noisy areas may cause, which in the case of endangered species may be part of the path to [[extinction]]. Noise pollution may have caused the death of certain species of whales that [[beached whale|beached]] themselves after being exposed to the loud sound of military [[sonar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/acoustics/bahamas_stranding.pdf Bahamas Marine Mammal Stranding Event of 15–16 March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Marine mammals and sonar]])

Noise also makes species communicate more loudly, which is called [[Lombard effect|Lombard vocal response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dosits.org/glossary/pop/lvr.htm|title=DOSITS: Page Not Found|author=[NULL]|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202711/http://www.dosits.org/glossary/pop/lvr.htm|archive-date=29 June 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists and researchers have conducted experiments that show whales' song length is longer when submarine-detectors are on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variation in humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) song length in relation to|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=113 |issue=6 |pages=3411–24 | bibcode=2003ASAJ..113.3411F|doi=10.1121/1.1573637|pmid=12822811 |year=2003 |last1=Fristrup |first1=Kurt M |last2=Hatch |first2=Leila T |last3=Clark |first3=Christopher W }}&lt;/ref&gt; If creatures do not "speak" loudly enough, their voice will be [[Sound masking|masked]] by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] sounds. These unheard voices might be warnings, finding of prey, or preparations of net-bubbling. When one species begins speaking more loudly, it will mask other species' voice, causing the whole ecosystem eventually to speak more loudly.

Marine invertebrates, such as crabs (''[[Carcinus maenas]]''), have also been shown to be negatively affected by ship noise.&lt;ref name=DeepSNcrabs&gt;{{cite web |author=McClain, Craig |title=Loud Noise Makes Crabs Even More Crabby |publisher=Deep Sea News |url=http://deepseanews.com/2013/04/load-noise-makes-crabs-edgy/ |accessdate=2013-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaleSimpson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wale|first1=M.

Repeated exposure to the sounds did lead to [[acclimatization]].&lt;ref name="WaleSimpson2013"/&gt;

[[European robin]]s living in urban environments are more likely to sing at night in places with high levels of noise pollution during the day, suggesting that they sing at night because it is quieter, and their message can propagate through the environment more clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fuller RA, Warren PH, Gaston KJ |year=2007|title=Daytime noise predicts nocturnal singing in urban robins |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |pages=368–70 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0134 |pmid=17456449 |issue=4 |pmc=2390663}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study showed that daytime noise was a stronger predictor of nocturnal singing than night-time [[light pollution]], to which the phenomenon often is attributed.

[[Zebra finch]]es become less faithful to their partners when exposed to traffic noise. This could alter a population's evolutionary trajectory by selecting traits, sapping resources normally devoted to other activities and thus leading to profound genetic and evolutionary consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Milius, S. (2007). High Volume, Low Fidelity: Birds are less faithful as sounds blare, ''Science News'' vol. 172, p. 116. ([http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070825/fob3ref.asp references])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Noise control}}

The Hierarchy of Controls concept is often used to reduce noise in the environment or the workplace. Engineering noise controls can be used to reduce noise propagation and protect individuals from overexposure. When noise controls are not feasible or adequate, individuals can also take steps to protect themselves from the harmful effects of noise pollution. If people must be around loud sounds, they can protect their ears with hearing protection (e.g., ear plugs or ear muffs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/reducenoiseexposure/noisecontrols.html|title=Noise Controls|last=NIOSH|first=|date=Feb 5, 2018|website=|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, [[Buy Quiet]] programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=CDC – Buy Quiet – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise from roadways and other urban factors can be [[Noise control|mitigated]] by [[urban planning]] and [[Roadway noise|better design of roads]].  [[Roadway noise]] can be reduced by the use of [[noise barrier]]s, limitation of vehicle speeds, alteration of roadway surface texture, limitation of [[heavy vehicle]]s, use of traffic controls that smooth vehicle flow to reduce braking and acceleration, and tire design. An important factor in applying these strategies is a [[computer model]] for [[roadway noise]], that is capable of addressing local [[topography]], [[meteorology]], traffic operations, and hypothetical mitigation. Costs of building-in mitigation can be modest, provided these solutions are sought in the planning stage of a roadway project.

[[Aircraft noise]] can be reduced by using quieter [[jet engine]]s. Altering [[flight path]]s and time of day runway has benefited residents near airports.

==Legal status==
{{Main|Noise regulation}}

Up until the 1970s governments tended to view noise as a "nuisance" rather than an environmental problem.

Many conflicts over noise pollution are handled by negotiation between the emitter and the receiver. Escalation procedures vary by country, and may include action in conjunction with local authorities, in particular the police.

===India===

In 2015, The National Green Tribunal today directed authorities in Delhi to ensure strict adherence to guidelines on noise pollution, saying noise is more than just a nuisance as it can produce serious psychological stress. However, implementation of the law continues to remain poor.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly Adhere To Supreme Court Guidelines On Noise Pollution: Green Tribunal, NDTV, https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/strictly-adhere-to-supreme-court-guidelines-on-noise-pollution-green-tribunal-1253453&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Figures compiled by rockwool, the [[mineral wool]] [[Building insulation|insulation]] manufacturer, based on responses from local authorities to a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOI) request reveal in the period April 2008 – 2009 [[county council|UK councils]] received 315,838 complaints about noise pollution from private residences. This resulted in environmental health officers across the UK serving 8,069 [[noise abatement]] notices or citations under the terms of the Anti-Social Behaviour (Scotland) Act. In the last 12 months, 524 confiscations of equipment have been authorized involving the removal of powerful speakers, stereos and televisions. [[Westminster City Council]] has received more complaints per head of population than any other district in the UK with 9,814 grievances about noise, which equates to 42.32 complaints per thousand residents. Eight of the top 10 councils ranked by complaints per 1,000 residents are located in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[Noise Control Act]] of 1972 established a U.S. national policy to promote an environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health and welfare. In the past, [[Environmental Protection Agency]] coordinated all federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] phased out the office's funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to state and local governments. However, the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in effect today, although essentially unfunded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/history/epa-history-noise-and-noise-control-act|title=EPA History: Noise and the Noise Control Act|last=EPA|first=|date=1982|website=|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) regulates [[aircraft noise]] by specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by "stage" designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 – Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22942|title=C 36-1H - Noise Levels for U.S. Certificated and Foreign Aircraft|last=FAA|first=|date=Nov 15, 2001|website=|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] also pursues a program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|last=FAA|first=|date=Jan 9, 2018|website=|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAA has set up a process to report [https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/noise/ aviation-related noise complaints] for anyone who may be impacted by Aircraft noise.

The [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) developed noise regulations to control [[Roadway noise|highway noise]] as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/|title=Highway Traffic Noise|last=FWHA|first=|date=June 6, 2017|website=|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) noise standards as described in 24 CFR part 51, Subpart B provides minimum national standards applicable to HUD programs to protect citizen against excessive noise in their communities and places of residence. For instance, all sites whose environmental or community noise exposure exceeds the day night average sound level (DNL) of 65 (dB) are considered noise-impacted areas, it defines "Normally Unacceptable" noise zones where community noise levels are between 65-75&amp;nbsp;dB, for such locations, noise abatement and noise attenuation features must be implemented. Locations where the DNL is above 75&amp;nbsp;dB are considered "Unacceptable" and require approval by the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/environmental-review/noise-abatement-and-control/|title=Noise Abatement and Control|last=HUD|first=|date=April 1, 2013|website=|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Department of transportation|Department of Transportation]]'s Bureau of Transportation Statistics has created a [https://maps.bts.dot.gov/arcgis/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a303ff5924c9474790464cc0e9d5c9fb National Transportation Noise Map] to provide access to comprehensive aircraft and road noise data on national and county-level.

States and local governments typically have very specific statutes on [[building codes]], [[urban planning]], and roadway development. Noise laws and ordinances vary widely among municipalities and indeed do not even exist in some cities. An ordinance may contain a general prohibition against making noise that is a nuisance, or it may set out specific guidelines for the level of noise allowable at certain times of the day and for certain activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nonoise.org/lawlib.htm|title=Noise Pollution Clearinghouse Law Library|last=Noise Pollution Clearinghouse|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980611020207/http://www.nonoise.org/lawlib.htm|archive-date=1998-06-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York City]] instituted the first comprehensive noise code in 1985. The [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] Noise Code includes potential fines of up to $5000 per infraction and is the basis for other major U.S. and Canadian city noise ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;City of Portland, Oregon.

'''Otto Kirchheimer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɪɐ̯çˌhaɪmɐ|lang}}; 11 November 1905, [[Heilbronn]] – 22 November 1965, [[New York City]]) was a [[Germany|German]] jurist of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish ancestry]] and political scientist of the [[Frankfurt School]] whose work essentially covered the [[State (polity)|state]] and its [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arzt |first=Donna E. |chapter=Otto Kirchheimer: Critic of the Administration of Justice |title=Der Einfluß deutscher Emigranten auf die Rechtsentwicklung in den USA und in Deutschland |editor-last=Lutter |editor-first=Marcus |year=1993 |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |isbn=3-16-146080-4 |pages=33–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchheimer worked as a research analyst at the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the forerunner of the [[CIA]], starting in [[World War II]] and continuing to 1952.&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9955.html |title=Secret Reports on Nazi Germany: The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
He is father of the concept of a "[[big tent|catch-all party]] (''Allerweltspartei'')". Otto Kirchheimer's conception of the catch-all party was part of his more comprehensive theory of party transformation, encompassing four interrelated political processes. By tracing the development of the catch-all thesis and placing it within the wider context of Kirchheimer's complete work, it is possible to reconstruct a more precise understanding of what Kirchheimer meant by the catch-all concept, which itself remains highly contested. Kirchheimer's anxiety about modern democracy originated with what he saw as the vanishing of principled opposition within parliament and society, and the reduction of politics to the mere management of the state. This leads to collusion of political parties and the state, severing of the societal links of party organisations, and erosion of the classic separation of powers. Vanishing opposition, cartelisation and professionalisation of politics pits citizens against a powerful state, which increases political cynicism and apathy. Kirchheimer's comprehensive approach remains relevant to much of the contemporary debate about the transformation of Western political systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krouwel|first=André|title=Otto Kirchheimer and the Catch-all Party|journal=West European Politics|year=2003|volume=26|issue=2|page=23|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380512331341091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Research Fund (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) is funding the research and editorial work for an edition in five volumes of the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' (Collected Writings) of Otto Kirchheimer. The project began in late 2015 at [[Greifswald University]] and is scheduled to take about three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buchstein.wordpress.com/forschung|title=Prof. Dr. Hubertus Buchstein|website=Greifswald University|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''PanCam''' (Panoramic Camera) assembly is a set of two wide angle cameras for multi-spectral stereoscopic panoramic imaging, and a high resolution camera for colour imaging that has been designed to search for textural information or shapes that can be related to the presence of microorganisms on [[Mars]]. This camera assembly is part of the science payload on board the [[European Space Agency]]{{'s}} [[ExoMars rover]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/34664-exomars-facts.html ExoMars: Searching for Life on Mars]. Elizabeth Howell, ''Space.com''. March 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked to search for [[biosignature]]s and [[biomarker]]s on Mars. The rover is planned to be launched in July 2020 and [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in March 2021.

== Overview ==

This instrument will provide stereo [[multispectral image]]s, of the terrain nearby. PanCam are the "eyes" of the rover and its primary navigation system. PanCam will also provide the geological context of the sites being explored and help support the selection of the best sites to carry out exobiology studies, as well as assist in some aspect of atmospheric studies.&lt;ref name='PanCam Home'&gt;[http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/?fbodylongid=2127 PanCam - the Panoramic Camera]. [[ESA]]. Accessed 24 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  This system will also monitor the sample from the drill before it is crushed inside the rover, where the analytical instruments will perform a detailed chemical analysis.&lt;ref name='PanCam Home'/&gt;

The Principal Investigator is Andrew Coates of the [[University College London]] in United Kingdom.

'''Qualified teacher status''' ('''QTS or QTLS''') is required in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to work as a [[teacher]] of children in [[public education|state schools]] under [[local authority]] control, and in [[special education]] schools. A similar status exists under a different name in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

==Gaining QTS==
An [[undergraduate degree]] and successful completion of a teacher training programme is compulsory for QTS recommendation.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} One of the main routes to achieving QTS, for those already in possession of a degree, involves undertaking a postgraduate teacher training course, such as the [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE), or a School Direct programme. There are also some undergraduate degree qualifications leading to QTS, such as the [[Bachelor of Education]]. In [[England]] only, candidates must also pass [[QTS Skills Tests|professional skills tests]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qtsskillstests.com/about/|title=About {{!}} QTS Skills Tests|work=QTS Skills Tests|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; All candidates must have [[GCSE]]s at grade C or above in English and mathematics, and prospective primary teachers must also be in possession of (usually) a grade C in a science subject before embarking on teacher training.

All training which leads to qualified teacher status requires trainees to train across at least two key consecutive pupil age ranges, as defined in the Secretary of State's Requirements for Initial Teacher Training.&lt;ref name="tda"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/ittstandards/guidance_08/itt/R2_7.aspx|title=ITT requirements guidance|accessdate=2008-05-07|publisher=Training &amp; Development Agency for Schools|work=TDA website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age ranges are:

*Ages 3–5    (Early years foundation stage)
*Ages 5–7    (School years 1 and 2)	
*Ages 7–9    (School years 3 and 4)
*Ages 9–11   (School years 5 and 6)
*Ages 11–14  (School years 7 to 9)	
*Ages 14–16  (School years 10 and 11)
*Ages 16–19  (School years 12 and 13)
 
The [[Teaching Regulation Agency]] in England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/teaching-regulation-agency/about|website=Teaching Regulation Agency|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Teaching Council for Wales]] maintain all registrations, as well as issuing QTS certificates.

QTS is technically recognised only in the country it was awarded (England or Wales), but teachers can normally apply for QTS in other Home Countries relatively easily. QTS is also recognised by many other countries once the relevant paperwork has been completed, though many countries place a lot of importance on the route to QTS (such as requiring a PGCE, whilst not accepting the GTP). Teachers trained outside England and Wales must also apply to be awarded QTS if they wish to teach in these countries.

After having been awarded QTS teachers must normally still pass an [[Induction (teachers)|induction period]] (previously called 'probation') &amp;ndash; normally their first year of teaching. Teachers who have gained QTS but have not yet completed the Induction period are known as [[Newly Qualified Teacher|NQT]]s. NQTs who fail the induction still retain their QTS, but cannot teach in state-run schools. The induction period normally lasts a year (three school terms).

Not all [[European Union]] qualifications have been officially recognized yet, so one should confirm with one's education establishment as to whether one's qualifications are acceptable, or whether one needs to go through the recognition process.

===Routes to QTS===
Many different qualifications and courses lead to QTS:

====Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)====
{{main|Postgraduate Certificate in Education}}
The PGCE is a one-year course for existing degree holders, and the most common postgraduate route into teaching. It is based at and coordinated by a [[university]] or other [[higher education]] institution, though students spend a large proportion of the course working in placement schools. The PGCE carries credits towards a [[master's degree]].

====School-Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT)====
{{main|School-Centred Initial Teacher Training}}
A SCITT programme enables graduates to undertake their training within a school environment, leading to QTS. Some SCITT programmes also award a PGCE qualification. It is available in England only.

====Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) ====
{{main|Graduate Teacher Programme}}
The GTP enables candidates to gain QTS while they are employed as an unqualified teacher in a school.

Both the graduate and registered teacher programmes (GTP and RTP) have been closed in England. The graduate teacher programme (GTP) has been replaced by the School Direct Training Programme (salaried).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://targetcourses.co.uk/study-areas/teaching/teacher-training-options}}{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Undergraduate QTS routes====
Students can take a three or four-year [[undergraduate degree]] course that includes QTS. This enables a candidate to gain their QTS while they study for their degree, with teaching practice being undertaken over the course of the whole programme. These are usually [[Bachelor of Education]] (BEd) degrees, though some are [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) and [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) degrees.

==Scotland and Northern Ireland==
QTS as such does not exist in Scotland or Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=J Hobson|first1=Andrew|last2=Tracey|first2=Louise|last3=Malderez|first3=Angi|title=Navigating Initial Teacher Training: Becoming a Teacher|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317723929|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as is the case in England and Wales, all teachers in Scotland and Northern Ireland are required to register with either the [[General Teaching Council for Scotland]] or the [[General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland]]; the General Teaching Councils will consider only [[graduation|graduate]]s with [[teaching qualification]]s (such as a [[Bachelor of Education|BEd]], [[Professional Graduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] or [[Professional Graduate Diploma in Education|PGDE]]) for registration.

In Northern Ireland, a one-year Induction programme (equivalent to the NQT programme in England and Wales) must be completed.

In Scotland, a one-year probation period (equivalent to induction in England and Wales) must be completed.

Those holding English or Welsh QTS (or an equivalent from another country) must apply for registration with the relevant General Teaching Council. Each case is considered individually;  even those with English or Welsh QTS are not guaranteed to be allowed to teach in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

== Schools not requiring QTS for teachers ==

There is no formal requirement for teachers at [[independent schools]] to have QTS.

As of 27 July 2012, there is no longer any requirement for teaching staff in [[Academy (English school)|academies]] to have QTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

'''The Salpa Line Museum''' (in [[Finnish language|Finnish: Salpalinja-museo]] in [[Russian language|Russian:]] Музей линии "Салпа") was established and opened in 1987 by the Miehikkälä municipality and the [[Second World War]] veteran organisations. It is the first museum established belonging to the museums of Miehikkälä. The other museum is Miehikkälän kotiseutumuseo, the Miehikkala local arts-and-crafts museum, which was established in 1989 and is in the same building as the [[Engineers Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miehikkala.fi/index.php?&amp;id=996&amp;mid=6&amp;aid=2625&amp;bid=2629 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217085124/http://www.miehikkala.fi/index.php?&amp;id=996&amp;mid=6&amp;aid=2625&amp;bid=2629 |archivedate=2012-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Salpa Line Museum is the core of the [[Salpa Centre]]. It is both the tourist information centre of the Salpa Line Museum, the Engineer Museum and the Bunker Museum and the Salpa Line Museum centre itself.

The area around was built as a defence line and the defence centre of an infantry company in 1940-1944. It was never used for defence as the front line never reached the area due to the truce of 5 September 1944 and the [[Moscow Armistice]] of 19 September 1944.

Some of the preserved Salpa Line areas are classified by Finland's National Board of Antiquities &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.fi/en/index&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Built-up cultural environments of national importance1]] (Valtakunnallisesti merkittävät rakennetut kulttuuriympäristöt – Byggda kulturmiljöer av riksintresse1). The territory of the Salpa Line Museum belongs to the one of the four such areas in [[Miehikkälä]]: Kylmälä,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/r_kohde_kartta.aspx?KOHDE_ID=2021&amp;OBJECTID=24716&lt;/ref&gt; Miehikkälä municipal cente,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/r_kohde_kartta.aspx?KOHDE_ID=2021&amp;OBJECTID=25112&lt;/ref&gt; Muurula &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/r_kohde_kartta.aspx?KOHDE_ID=2021&amp;OBJECTID=25113&lt;/ref&gt; and Myllylampi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rky.fi/read/asp/r_kohde_kartta.aspx?KOHDE_ID=2021&amp;OBJECTID=24705&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==

Due to the nature of the museum most of the collections are outside in the woods. There are some of the bunkers left. Outside the museum centre building there are anti-tank guns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7252">The '''seclusion of girls at puberty''' has been practised in societies around the world, especially prior to the early 20th century. In such cultures, girls' puberty held more significance than boys' due to [[Culture and menstruation|menstruation]], the girl's potential for giving birth, and widespread ideas of [[ritual purification]] related to the sacred power of blood.&lt;ref name=benedict &gt;{{cite book|author = Benedict, Ruth|year = 2002|title = Cultural Sociology|editor=Spillman, Lyn|chapter= The Diversity of Cultures|page = 22|publisher  = Blackwell Publishers Ltd|isbn= 0-631-21652-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These societies practised various [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], many of which lost their original forms or completely disappeared with the emergence of modern trends such as [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=Broude20051 &gt;{{cite book|author= Broude, Ruth|year = 2005|title= The Birkshire Encyclopedia of World History|editor1-first=W. H.|editor1-last=McNeill|editor2-first=Jerry H.|editor2-last=Bentley|url = http://BerkshireWorldHistory.com|chapter= Initiation and Rites of Passage|publisher = Berkshire Publishing Group|isbn= 0-9743091-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites==
[[File:Venus figurine cave of Laussel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Venus of Laussel]]]]
Two rules were common in the seclusion of adolescent girls: the girl must neither touch the ground nor see the sun. According to [[Sir James George Frazer]], these rules also applied to [[divine king]]s and priests. These divine kings were carried on shoulders by their underlings who walked upon tapestry or carpet. Scholars have speculated that the [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelureofnoma.com/?p=131|title=Seclusion of Girls – Evidence from Paleolithic Times?|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=May 2012}} are related to such puberty rites as they lack facial features (not seeing the sun), their tapered legs without feet (not touching the ground), and their [[adiposity]] (caused by seclusion).

Among puberty rites which Frazer described, many adhered to the above rules:
* Once a girl from [[Zulu people|Zulu tribes]] in [[South Africa]] showed the first signs of puberty, she had to cover her head with her blanket and hide among the reeds by the river until the sunset. Afterward, she had to stay in a hut for some time before coming back to the society.&lt;ref name=frazer&gt;{{cite book|author= Frazer, James|year = 1993|title = The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|chapter= Between Heaven and Earth|publisher  = Wordsworth Editions Ltd|isbn= 1-85326-310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and in the Kabadi District of [[New Guinea]], pubescent girls were kept indoors in seclusion for several years.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
*In many societies, including [[Brahmin]]s of [[Bengal]], girls undergoing puberty were not allowed to see any males, not even their relatives. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of [[California]] did not allow girls in their first menstruation to "look about". 
*Among the [[Tiyan]]s of [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]], such girls were not allowed to catch the sight of a cow or touch "any other person, tree or plant".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
* Among the Tukuna of the Northwest Amazon, the girl at puberty is kept in isolation for about three months while preparation for the ceremony is underway. During this time, she "is believed to be susceptible to all varieties of supernatural power"&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite book|author= Lincoln, Bruce|year = 1981|title = Emerging from the Chrysalis: Studies in Rituals of Women's Initiation|publisher  = Harvard University Press|isbn= 0-674-24840-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50–52}}
Frazer believed that the Greek myth of [[Danaë]], who was kept by her father in seclusion but was impregnated by [[Zeus]], was related to girls' puberty rites.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;{{rp|602}} Lincoln also finds parallels between the Greek myth about the abduction of Persephone and the seclusion of girls at puberty. According to him, the seclusion of Tukuna girls at puberty may be referred to as "being in the underworld".&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Reasons for the seclusion==

===Preparation for womanhood===
Such seclusion rites are linked to the social preparation of girls for womanhood and their roles as wives and mothers. During their seclusion, girls would be taught by older women about their future roles.&lt;ref name=Broude20051 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker1905 &gt;{{cite book|author= Langloh Parker,  Katherine|authorlink=K. Langloh Parker |year = 1905|title= [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe|The Euahlayi Tribe]]: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia|chapter = [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe/Chapter 7#56|Birth—Betrothal—An Aboriginal Girl From Infancy To Womanhood]]|page=56-58|publisher=Archibald Constable and Company|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superstition===
Frazer claims the reason for seclusion practises was the "deeply engrained dread" of "menstruous blood". The first appearance of menstrual blood caused more fear than subsequent menstrual cycles. These fears stemmed more from [[superstition]] related to the sacred power of blood than from hygienic issues or the possible spread of disease.

Among the [[Apache Indians]], "the adolescent girls are not segregated as sources of danger, but court is paid to them as to direct sources of supernatural blessing".&lt;ref name=benedict /&gt; A girl at her first menstruation was considered to be possessed of "a degree of supernatural power" which, though not entirely malevolent, still aroused feelings of the "power of evil".

The [[Bushmen]] of South Africa believed that making eye contact with a girl during this period would make men "fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|606}}--&gt;

In earlier societies, some pubescent girls might have shown some unusual behaviours, giving rise to superstitions. Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] episodes than boys of a similar age. Historical records also show that these girls may have been subjects of [[incest|incestuous relationships]] and [[child abuse|abuse]], triggering abnormal behaviours.&lt;ref name=Arachige2009 &gt;{{cite book|author = Arachige, Darshi|year = 2009|title  = The Lure of Noma: On the Elegance of Religion|url = http://www.boomerangbooks.com.au/Lure-of-Noma/Darshi-Arachige/book_9780980631432.htm|chapter= How did religion arise?

Winogradsky discovered the first known form of [[lithotrophy]] during his research with ''[[Beggiatoa]]'' in 1887.  He reported that ''Beggiatoa'' oxidized [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) as an energy source and formed intracellular [[sulfur]] droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Winogradsky S | title = Über Schwefelbakterien| journal = Bot. Zeitung | volume = | issue = 45 | pages = 489–610| year = 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This research provided the first example of lithotrophy, but not [[autotrophy]].

His research on [[nitrifying bacteria]] would report the first known form of [[chemotroph|chemoautotrophy]], showing how a lithotroph [[carbon fixation|fixes carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to make [[organic compound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Dworkin |first1= Martin |last2=Falkow|first2=Stanley| title= The Prokaryotes: A Handbook on the Biology of Bacteria: Proteobacteria: Gamma Subclass| year= 2006 | edition=3rd |publisher= Springer| page= 784| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r21k000qn714j380/| isbn= 978-0-387-25496-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Winogradsky was born in [[Kiev]] (then in the [[Russian Empire]]). In this early stage of his life, Winogradsky was "strictly devoted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church|orthodox faith]]", though he later became irreligious.&lt;ref&gt;[[Selman Abraham Waksman|Waksman, Selman Abraham]]. 1953. ''Sergei N. Winogradsky: His Life and Work: The Story of a Great Bacteriologist''. Rutgers University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|Imperial Conservatoire of Music in St Petersburg]] in 1875 to study piano.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; However, after two years of music training, he entered the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] in 1877 to study chemistry under [[Menshutkin reaction|Nikolai Menshchutkin]] and botany under [[Andrei Famintsyn|Andrei Sergeevich Famintzin]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

He received a diploma in 1881 and stayed at the [[St. Petersburg University]] for a degree of master of science in botany in 1884. In 1885, he began work at the [[University of Strasbourg]] under the renowned botanist [[Anton de Bary]]; Winogradsky became renowned for his work on sulfur bacteria.

In 1888, he relocated to [[Zurich]], where he began investigation into the process of nitrification, identifying the genera ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' and ''[[Nitrifying bacteria|Nitrosococcus]]'', which oxidizes [[ammonium]] to [[nitrite]], and ''[[Nitrobacter]]'', which oxidizes nitrite to [[nitrate]].

He returned to St. Petersburg for the period 1891–1905, and headed the division of general microbiology of the Institute of Experimental Medicine; during this period, he identified the obligate anaerobe ''[[Clostridium|Clostridium pasteurianum]]'', which is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen.

In 1901, he was elected honorary member of the [[Moscow Society of Naturalists]] and, in 1902, corresponding member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].

He retired from active scientific work in 1905, dividing his time between his private estate and Switzerland. In 1922, he accepted an invitation to head the division of agricultural bacteriology at the [[Pasteur Institute]] at an experimental station at [[Brie-Comte-Robert]], France, about 30&amp;nbsp;km from Paris. During this period, he worked on a number of topics, among them iron bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, [[nitrogen fixation]] by ''[[Azotobacter]]'', [[cellulose]]-decomposing bacteria, and culture methods for soil microorganisms. Winogradsky retired from active life in 1940 and died in Brie-Comte-Robert in 1953.

==Discoveries==
Winogradsky discovered various [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and parts of these cycles. These discoveries include
* His work on [[sulfur cycle|bacterial sulfate reduction]] for which he first became renowned, including the first known form of [[lithotrophy]] (in [[Beggiatoa]]).
* His work on the [[Nitrogen cycle]] including
** The identification of the [[obligate anaerobe]] ''[[Clostridium|Clostridium pasteurianum]]'' is a free living microbe capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen and not living in [[legume]] [[root nodule]]s.
** Chemosynthesis – his most noted discovery
** The [[Winogradsky column]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ogunseitan |first1= Oladele | title= Microbial Diversity: Form and Function in Prokaryotes| year= 2005 | edition=1st |publisher= Wiley| url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405144483.html| isbn= 978-1-4051-4448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|350px|[[Nitrogen cycle]]]]

===Chemosynthesis===
Winogradsky is best known for discovering chemoautotrophy, which soon became popularly known as [[chemosynthesis]], the process by which organisms derive energy from a number of different [[inorganic compound]]s and obtain [[carbon]] in the form of [[carbon dioxide]]. Previously, it was believed that autotrophs obtained their energy solely from [[light]], not from reactions of inorganic compounds.  With the discovery of organisms that oxidized inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonium as energy sources, autotrophs could be divided into two groups: [[phototroph|photoautotrophs]] and chemoautotrophs.  Winogradsky was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand [[microorganisms]] outside of the medical context, making him among the first students of [[microbial ecology]] and [[environmental microbiology]].

The [[Winogradsky column]] remains an important display of chemoautotrophy and microbial ecology, demonstrated in microbiology lectures around the world.&lt;ref name="brock"&gt;{{Cite book

In [[software engineering]], '''service virtualization''' is a method to emulate the behavior of specific components in heterogeneous component-based applications such as [[API]]-driven applications, [[Cloud computing|cloud]]-based applications and [[service-oriented architecture]]s.
It is used to provide [[software development]] and [[Software quality assurance|QA/testing]] teams access to dependent system components that are needed to exercise an application under test (AUT), but are unavailable or difficult-to-access for development and testing purposes. With the behavior of the dependent components "virtualized", testing and development can proceed without accessing the actual live components.
Service virtualization is recognized by vendors, industry analysts, and industry publications as being different than mocking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/04/Service-Virtualization Service Virtualization as an Alternative to Mocking], by Jonathan Allen, eBizQ April 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=searchsoa&gt;[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/news/2240150279/Service-virtualization-arises-to-meet-services-testing-obstacles Service virtualization arises to meet services testing obstacles], by George Lawton, SearchSOA May 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Service virtualization emulates the behavior of software components to remove dependency constraints on development and testing teams. Such constraints occur in complex, interdependent environments when a component connected to the application under test is:
* Not yet completed
* Still evolving
* Controlled by a third-party or partner
* Available for testing only in limited capacity or at inconvenient times
* Difficult to provision or configure in a test environment
* Needed for simultaneous access by different teams with varied test data setup and other  requirements
* Restricted or costly to use for load and performance testing &lt;ref name="virtual-strategy.com"&gt;[http://www.virtual-strategy.com/2010/11/28/service-virtualization-modern-applications Service Virtualization for Modern Applications] by Gaurish Hattangadi, Virtual Strategy Magazine, November 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term "service virtualization" reflects the technique's initial focus on virtualizing [[web service]]s, service virtualization extends across all aspects of composite applications: services, [[database]]s, [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], [[Enterprise service bus|ESBs]], and other components that communicate using common messaging protocols.&lt;ref name="testenvsyscon"&gt;[http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/2112838  Managing Test Environments] by Liz McMillan, Cloud Computing Journal, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abvsyscon"&gt;[http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/2110733 Application Behavior Virtualization] by Elizabeth White, Cloud Computing Journal, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stpdbvirt"&gt;[http://www.softwaretestpro.com/Item/5463/Database-Virtualization-For-Development-and-Test/STQA-Magazine-Development Database Virtualization For Development and Test] by Wayne Ariola, ST &amp; QA Magazine, March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar tools are called [[Application programming interface|API]] simulators, API mocking tools, over the wire [[Test Double|test doubles]].

Service virtualization emulates only the behavior of the specific dependent components that developers or testers need to exercise in order to complete their end-to-end transactions. 
Rather than virtualizing entire systems, it virtualizes only specific slices of dependent behavior critical to the execution of development and testing tasks. This provides just enough application logic so that the developers or testers get what they need without having to wait for the actual service to be completed and readily available. For instance, instead of virtualizing an entire database (and performing all associated test data management as well as setting up the database for every test session), you monitor how the application interacts with the database, then you emulate the related database behavior (the [[SQL]] queries that are passed to the database, the corresponding result sets that are returned, and so forth).&lt;ref name="webservices"&gt;[http://www.webservices.org/index.php/weblog/john_michelsen/an_intro_to_soa_and_virtualization An Intro to SOA and Virtualization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122114856/http://webservices.org/index.php/weblog/john_michelsen/an_intro_to_soa_and_virtualization |date=2011-11-22 }} by John Michelsen, WebServices.org, August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Service virtualization involves creating and deploying a "virtual asset" that simulates the behavior of a real component which is required to exercise the application under test, but is difficult or impossible to access for development and testing purposes.

A virtual asset stands in for a dependent component by listening for requests and returning an appropriate response—with the appropriate performance. For a database, this might involve listening for a SQL statement, then returning data source rows. For a web service, this might involve listening for an [[XML]] message over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[Java Message Service|JMS]], or [[IBM WebSphere MQ|MQ]], then returning another XML message. The virtual asset's functionality and performance might reflect the actual functionality/performance of the dependent component, or it might simulate exceptional conditions (such as extreme loads or error conditions) to determine how the application under test responds under those circumstances.

Virtual assets are typically created by:
* Recording live communication among components as the system is exercised from the application under test (AUT)
* Providing logs representing historical communication among components
* Analyzing service interface specifications (such as a [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]])
* Defining the behavior manually with various interface controls and data source values

They are then further configured to represent specific data, functionality, and response times.

Virtual assets are deployed locally or in the cloud (public or private). With development/test environments configured to use the virtual assets in place of dependent components, developers or testers can then exercise the application they are working on without having to wait for the dependent components to be completed or readily accessible.&lt;ref name="testenvsyscon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abvsyscon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abv"/&gt;

Industry analysts report that service virtualization is best suited for "IT shops with significant experience with 'skipping' integration testing due to 'dependent software', and with a reasonably sophisticated test harness.&lt;ref name="kernochan"&gt;[http://waynekernochanblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/parasoft-and-service-virtualization.html  Parasoft and "Service Virtualization" Testing: A Good Idea] by  Wayne Kernochan, Thoughts From a Software IT Analyst, February 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to stubbing and mocking==
An alternative approach to working around the test environment access constraints outlined in this article's introduction is for team members to develop [[method stub]]s or [[mock object]]s that substitute for dependent resources. The shortcoming of this approach became apparent in the early 2000s with the rise of [[Service-oriented architecture]].&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/10tr011.pdf Testing in Service-Oriented Environments] by Ed Morris et al, Software Engineering Institute, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of [[Composite applications]] that rely on numerous dependent services, plus the rise of [[Agile software development]] following the 2001 publication of the Agile Manifesto, made it increasingly difficult for developers or testers to manually develop the number, scope, and complexity of stubs or mocks required to complete development and testing tasks for modern enterprise application development.&lt;ref name="ovum"&gt;[http://www.ovum.com/service-virtualization-is-helping-organizations-realize-business-value-from-testing/ Service virtualization is helping organizations realize business value from testing] by Chandranshu Singh, ovum, March 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step in the evolution from stubbing to service virtualization was the technology packaged in SOA testing tools since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/id=356258 Parasoft's Web Service Testing Tool Should Aid Development] by Theresa Lanowitz [http://www.gartner.com Gartner], May 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;   The earliest implementations of service virtualization were designed to automate the process of developing simple stub-like emulations so that composite applications could be tested more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/news/1283954/SOA-virtualization-gets-real SOA virtualization gets real] by Rich Seeley, SearchSOA, November 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As enterprise systems continued to grow increasingly complex and distributed, software tool vendors shifted focus from stubbing to the more environment-focused service virtualization.&lt;ref name="virtual-strategy.com"/&gt; While stubbing can still be completed through manual development and management of stubs, what has become known as "service virtualization" is completed by using one of the available [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial off the shelf (COTS)]] service virtualization technologies as a platform for the development and deployment of their "service virtualization assets".&lt;ref name="ovum"/&gt;

==Agile and DevOps==
The increasing popularity&lt;ref&gt;[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=devops,agile Agile &amp; DevOps Google Trends]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Agile software development]] and [[DevOps]] has created demand for a new set of tools to deliver service virtualization to communities that work in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dzone.com/articles/the-future-of-service-virtualization-and-api-mocki Next Gen Service Virtualization Forum, 13th of September 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Practices such as [[Continuous delivery]] and moving away from [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[Monolithic application|monolith]] development to more distributed [[Microservices|microservice]]-based architectures fit well with the capabilities of service virtualization. Agile and DevOps teams prefer to work with lightweight tools that have less accumulated bloat and no cumbersome licensing restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/big-enterprise-solutions Thought Works Technology Radar: Big enterprise solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shift-share analysis''', used in [[regional science]], [[political economy]], and [[urban studies]], determines what portions of regional economic growth or decline can be attributed to national, economic [[industry]], and [[regional]] factors.  The analysis helps identify industries where a regional economy has [[competitive advantage]]s over the larger economy.  A shift-share analysis takes the change over time of an economic variable, such as [[employment]], within industries of a regional economy, and divides that change into various components.  A traditional shift-share analysis splits regional changes into just three components, but other models have evolved that expand the decomposition into additional components.

== Overview ==
A shift-share analysis attempts to identify the sources of regional economic changes.  The region can be a town, city, country, [[statistical area]], state, or any other region of the country.  The analysis examines changes in an economic variable, such as migration, a [[demographics|demographic statistic]], firm growth, or firm formations, although [[employment]] is most commonly used.&lt;ref name=Cheng&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Shaoming|title=Business cycle, industrial composition, or regional advantage? A decomposition analysis of new firm formation in the United States|journal=The Annals of Regional Science|date=2 February 2010|volume=47|issue=1|pages=147–167|doi=10.1007/s00168-009-0361-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shi|first=Chun-Yun|author2=Yang Yang |title=A Review of Shift-Share Analysis and its Application in Tourism|journal=International Journal of Management Perspectives|year=2008|volume=1|issue=1|pages=21–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shift-share analysis is performed on a set of economic industries, like those defined by the [[North American Industry Classification System|North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)]]. The analysis separates the regional economic changes within each industry into different categories.  Although there are different versions of a shift-share analysis, they all identify national, industry, and regional factors that influence the variable changes.

== Traditional model ==
The traditional form of the shift-share analysis was developed by Daniel Creamer in the early 1940s, and was later formalized by Edgar S. Dunn in 1960.&lt;ref name=Shi /&gt; Also known as the ''comparative static model'', it examines changes in the economic variable between two years.  Changes are calculated for each industry in the analysis, both regionally and nationally.  Each regional change is decomposed into three components.&lt;ref name=Leigh&gt;{{cite book|last=Leigh|first=Nancey Green|title=Planning Local Economic Development|year=2013|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=9781452242590|pages=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''National growth effect'' is the portion of the change attributed to the total growth of the national economy.  It equals the theoretical change in the regional variable had it increased by the same percentage as the national economy.  
# ''Industry mix effect'' is the portion of the change attributed to the performance of the specific economic industry. It equals the theoretical change in the regional variable had it increased by the same percentage as the industry nationwide, minus the national growth effect.
# ''Local share effect'' is the portion of the change attributed to regional influences, and is the component of primary concern to regional analysts.&lt;ref name=Leigh /&gt;  It equals the actual change in the regional variable, minus the previous two effects.

===Formula===
The regional change in the variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;}} within industry {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} between the two years {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is defined as the sum of the three shift-share effects: national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IM&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and local share effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Benjamin|author2=Craig Moore |title=A critical review of the literature on shift-share as a forecasting technique|journal=Journal of Regional Science|year=1980|volume=20|issue=4|page=419|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9787.1980.tb00660.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
e_i^{t+n} - e_i^t = NS_i + IM_i + RS_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The beginning and ending values of the economic variable within a particular industry are {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t+n&lt;/sup&gt;}}, respectively.  Each of the three effects is defined as a percentage of the beginning value of the economic variable.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
NS_i = e_i^t \left( G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IM_i = e_i^t \left( G_i-G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RS_i = e_i^t \left( g_i-G_i \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The total percent change in the economic variable nationwide for all industries combined is {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}}, while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively.

=== Example ===
As an example, a shift-share analysis might be utilized to examine changes in the construction industry of a state's economy over the past decade, using employment as the economic variable studied.  Total national employment may have increased 5% over the decade, while national construction employment increased 8%.  However, state construction employment decreased 2%, from 100,000 to 98,000 employees, for a net loss of 2,000 employees.

The national growth effect is equal to the beginning 100,000 employees, times the total national growth rate of 5%, for an increase in 5,000 employees.  The shift-share analysis implies that state construction would have increased by 5,000 employees, had it followed the same trend as the overall national economy.

The industry mix effect is equal to the original 100,000 employees times the growth in the industry nationwide, which was 8%, minus the total national growth of 5%.  This results in an increase in 3,000 employees (100,000 employees times 3%, which is the 8% industry growth minus the 5% total growth).  The analysis implies that the state construction would have increased by another 3,000 employees had it followed the industry trends, because the construction industry nationwide performed better than the national economy overall.

The local share effect in this example is equal to the beginning 100,000 employees times the state construction employment growth rate of −2% (it is ''negative'' because of the loss of employees), minus the national construction growth rate of 8%.  This results in 100,000 employees times -10%, for a loss of 10,000 employees.  However, the actual employment loss was only 2,000 employees, but that equals the sum of the three effects (5,000 gain + 3,000 gain + 10,000 loss).  The analysis implies that local factors lead to a decrease in 10,000 employees in the state construction industry, because the growth in both the national economy and the construction industry should have increased state construction employment by 8,000 employees (the 5,000 national share effect plus the 3,000 industry mix effect).

===Names and regions===

Shift-share analysts sometimes use different labels for the three effects, although the calculations are the same.  National growth effect may be referred to as ''national share''.&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;&lt;ref name=Knudesn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knudesn|first=Daniel C.|title=Shift-share analysis: further examination of models for the description of economic change|journal=Socio-Economic Planning Sciences|year=2000|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Industry mix effect may be referred to as ''proportional shift''.&lt;ref name=Knudesn /&gt;  Local share effect may be referred to as ''differential shift'',&lt;ref name=Leigh /&gt; ''regional shift'',&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt; or ''competitive share''.&lt;ref name=UGA&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia Statistics System|url=http://georgiastats.uga.edu/|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most shift-share analyses, the regional economy is compared to the national economy.  However, the techniques may be used to compare any two regions (e.g., comparing a county to its state).&lt;ref name=Mackinac&gt;{{cite web|title=The Michigan Economic Development Corporation: A Review and Analysis|url=http://www.mackinac.org/10896|publisher=Mackinac Center|accessdate=5 December 2013|author=Michael LaFaive|author2=James M. Hohman |date=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamic model ==

In 1988, Richard Barff and Prentice Knight, III, published the dynamic model shift-share analysis.&lt;ref name=Barff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barff|first=Richard|author2=Prentice L. Knight III |title=Dynamic Shift-Share Analysis|journal=Growth and Change|date=April 1988|volume=19|issue=2|pages=1–10|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2257.1988.tb00465.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the comparative static model, which only considers two years in its analysis (the beginning and ending years), the dynamic model utilizes every year in the study period.  Although it requires much more data to perform the calculations, the dynamic model takes into account continuous changes in the three shift-share effects, so the results are less affected by the choice of starting and ending years.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;  The dynamic model is most useful when there are large differences between regional and national growth rates, or large changes in the regional industrial mix.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

The dynamic model uses the same techniques as the comparative static model, including the same three shift-share effects.  However, in the dynamic model, a [[time-series]] of traditional shift-share calculations are performed, comparing each year to the previous year.  The annual shift-share effects are then totaled together for the entire study period, resulting in the dynamic model's shift-share effects.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

=== Formula ===
The regional change in the variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;}} within industry {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} between the two years {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is defined as the sum of the three shift-share effects: national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IM&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and local share effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
e_i^{t+n} - e_i^t = NS_i + IM_i + RS_i
&lt;/math&gt;

If the study period ranges from year {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} to year {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}}, then traditional shift-share effects are calculated for every year {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;}}, where {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;}} spans from {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+1}} to {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;  The dynamic model shift-share effects are then calculated as the sum of the annual effects.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
NS_i = \sum_{k=t+1}^{t+n} \left[ e_i^{k-1} \left( G^k \right) \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IM_i = \sum_{k=t+1}^{t+n} \left[ e_i^{k-1} \left( G_i^k - G^k \right) \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RS_i = \sum_{k=t+1}^{t+n} \left[ e_i^{k-1} \left( g_i^k - G_i^k \right) \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The growth rates used in the calculations are annual rates, not growth from the beginning year in the study period, so the percent change from year {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;-1}} to {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;}} in the economic variable nationwide for all industries combined is {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;}}, while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=Barff /&gt;

== Esteban-Marquillas Model ==

In 1972, J.M. Esteban-Marquillas extended the traditional model to address criticism that the regional share effect is correlated to the regional industrial mix.&lt;ref name=Esteban&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esteban-Marquillas|first=J.M.|title=A reinterpretation of shift-share analysis|journal=Regional and Urban Economics|year=1972|volume=2|issue=3|pages=249–261|doi=10.1016/0034-3331(72)90033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Esteban-Marquillas model, the regional share effect itself is decomposed into two components, isolating a regional shift component that is not correlated to the industrial mix.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt;  The model introduced a then-new concept to shift-share analyses, a [[Homothetic preferences|homothetic]] level of the economic variable within an industry.  This is the theoretical value of the variable within an industry assuming the region has the same industrial mix as the nation.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt;

In the Esteban-Marquillas model, the calculations of the national share and industrial mix effects are unchanged.  However, the regional share effect in the traditional model is separated into two effects: a new regional share effect that is not dependent on the industrial mix, and an allocation effect that is.  The allocation effect indicates the extent to which the region is specialized in those industries where it enjoys a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt;

=== Formula ===
The regional change in the variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;}} within industry {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} between the two years {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is defined as the sum of the four shift-share effects: national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IM&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), regional share effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RS&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and allocation effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;AL&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}).

:&lt;math&gt;
e_i^{t+n} - e_i^t = NS_i + IM_i + RS_i + AL_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The beginning and ending values of the economic variable within a particular industry are {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t+n&lt;/sup&gt;}}, respectively.  The beginning value of the regional homothetic variable within a particular industry is {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt;  It is based on the regional and national values of the economic variable across all industries, {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} respectively, and the industry-specific national value {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

:&lt;math&gt;
h_i^t = e^t \times { E_i^t \over E^t } 
&lt;/math&gt;

Each of the four shift-share effects is defined as a percentage of either the beginning value of the economic variable, the homothetic variable, or the difference of the two.&lt;ref name=Esteban /&gt; 
 
:&lt;math&gt;
NS_i = e_i^t \left( G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IM_i = e_i^t \left( G_i-G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RS_i = h_i^t \left( g_i-G_i \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
AL_i = \left( e_i^t-h_i^t \right) \left( g_i-G_i \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The total percent change in the economic variable nationwide for all industries combined is {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}}, while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively.

== Arcelus Model ==
In 1984, Francisco Arcelus built upon Esteban-Marquillas' use of the homothetic variables and extended the traditional model even further.&lt;ref name=Arcelus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arcelus|first=Francisco|title=An extension of shift-share analysis|journal=Growth and Change|date=January 1984|volume=15|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this method to decompose the national share and industrial mix effects into ''expected'' and ''differential'' components.  The expected component is based on the homothetic level of the variable, and is the effect not attributed to the regional specializations.  The differential component is the remaining effect, which is attributable to the regional industrial mix.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt; 
 
Arcelus claimed that, even with the Esteban-Marquillas extension, the regional share effect is still related to the regional industry mix, and that the static model assumes all regional industries operate on a national market basis, focusing too heavily on the export markets and ignoring the local markets.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt; In order to address these issues, Arcelus used a different method for separating the regional share effect, resulting in a ''regional growth effect'' and a ''regional industry mix effect''.  Both of these are decomposed into expected and differential components using the homothetic variable.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt;

=== Formula ===
The regional change in the variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;}} within industry {{math|&lt;var&gt;i&lt;/var&gt;}} between the two years {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;+&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is defined as the sum of the eight shift-share effects: expected national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NSE&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), differential national growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;NSD&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), expected industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IME&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), differential industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;IMD&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), expected regional growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RGE&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), differential regional growth effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RGD&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), expected regional industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RIE&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), and differential regional industry mix effect ({{math|&lt;var&gt;RID&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
e_i^{t+n} - e_i^t = NSE_i + NSD_i + IME_i + IMD_i + RGE_i + RGD_i + RIE_i + RID_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The eight effects are related to the three traditional shift-share effects from the comparative static model.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
NS_i = NSE_i + NSD_i
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IM_i = IME_i + IMD_i
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RS_i = RGE_i + RGD_i + RIE_i + RID_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The homothetic variable is calculated the same as in the Esteban-Marquillas model.  The beginning value of the regional homothetic variable within a particular industry is {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  It is based on the regional and national values of the economic variable across all industries, {{math|&lt;var&gt;e&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}} respectively, and the industry-specific national value {{math|&lt;var&gt;E&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_i^t = e^t \times { E_i^t \over E^t } 
&lt;/math&gt;

Each of the eight shift-share effects is defined as a percentage of either the beginning value of the economic variable, the homothetic variable, or the difference of the two.&lt;ref name=Arcelus /&gt; 
 
:&lt;math&gt;
NSE_i = h_i^t \times G 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
NSD_i = \left( e_i^t - h_i^t \right) \times G
&lt;/math&gt;
 
:&lt;math&gt;
IME_i = h_i^t \times \left( G_i - G \right) 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
IMD_i = \left( e_i^t - h_i^t \right) \times \left( G_i - G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RGE_i = h_i^t \times \left( g - G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RGD_i = \left( e_i^t - h_i^t \right) \times \left( g - G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RIE_i = h_i^t \times \left( g_i - g - G_i + G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
RID_i = \left( e_i^t - h_i^t \right) \times \left( g_i - g - G_i + G \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The total percent changes in the economic variable nationally and regionally for all industries combined are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;}} respectively, while the national and regional industry-specific percent changes are {{math|&lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, respectively.

[[Psychology]] encompasses a vast domain, and includes many different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior. Below are the major areas of inquiry that taken together constitute psychology. A comprehensive list of the sub-fields and areas within psychology can be found at the [[list of psychology topics]] and [[list of psychology disciplines]].

==Divisions==

===Abnormal===
{{Main article|Abnormal psychology}}
[[Abnormal psychology]] is the study of [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormal behavior]] in order to describe, predict, explain, and change abnormal patterns of functioning. Abnormal psychology studies the nature of [[psychopathology]] and its causes, and this knowledge is applied in [[clinical psychology]] to treat patients with [[Mental disorder|psychological disorders]].

It can be difficult to draw the line between normal and abnormal behaviors. In general, abnormal behaviors must be maladaptive and cause an individual significant discomfort in order to be of clinical and research interest. According to the DSM-IV-TR, behaviors may be considered abnormal if they are associated with disability, personal distress, the violation of social norms, or dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' DSM-IV-TR Fourth Edition (Text Revision) by the American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anomalistic ===
{{Main article|Anomalistic psychology}}

[[Anomalistic psychology]] is the study of human behaviour and experience connected with what is often called the [[paranormal]], without the assumption that there is anything paranormal involved.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Holt, Christine Simmonds-Moore, David Luke, Christopher French. (2012). ''Anomalistic Psychology (Palgrave Insights in Psychology)''. Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0230301504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers involved with anomalistic psychology try to provide plausible non-paranormal accounts, supported by empirical evidence, of how psychological and physical factors might combine to give the impression of paranormal activity when there had been none. Apart from deception or [[self-deception]] such explanations might involve [[cognitive bias]]es, anomalous psychological states, [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociative state]]s, [[hallucination]]s, personality factors, developmental issues and the nature of memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/apru/what/ What is Anomalistic Psychology?]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable researcher in the field of anomalistic psychology is the British psychologist [[Chris French]] who set up the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit (APRU) in the Department of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/weird-science/200909/anomalistic-psychology-what-is-it-and-why-bother Anomalistic psychology: What is it and why bother? by Chris French]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral Genetics===
{{Main article|Behavioral genetics}}

[[Behavioral genetics|Behavioural genetics]] uses genetically informative designs to understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior. In focusing on the causes of individual differences, behavioral genetics is distinct from [[evolutionary psychology]], which tends to focus on human universals. Behavioral genetics has thus been associated strongly with the [[diathesis stress]] model of psychopathology as well as the nature/nurture debate. Behavioral genetics research was pioneered by [[Francis Galton]] and his seminal work in family studies and [[twins|twin]] studies after falling out of favor during the [[eugenics]] movement during the first part of the 20th century up until [[World War II]]. A resurgence of behavioral genetics research began in the 1960s and rose into prominence in the 1980s and beyond. During this time [[twin studies|twin study]]  and [[adoption|adoption studies]] were conducted on a wide array of behavioral traits, including [[personality]], [[cognitive ability]], psychiatric illness, medical illness, and many others. The general conclusion of this large body of work is that every behavioral and medical trait, and indeed measures of the environment is heritable to some moderate degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v47/n7/full/ng.3285.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of the [[Human Genome Project]] more recent work in behavioral genetics uses recent technologies in array-based genotyping, genome sequencing, and other omics to measure genetic variants directly. These genetic variants can then be tested for association with behavioral traits and disorders, for example through [[genome-wide association studies]]. This approach to understanding the genetic influences on behavior have seen recent successes in, for example, schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v511/n7510/full/nature13595.html}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychiatric genetics]] is a subfield of behavioral genetics.

===Biological===
{{Main article|Biological psychology|Neuropsychology|Physiological psychology|Behavioral neuroscience|Cognitive neuroscience}}
[[File:Hypothalamus.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] depicting the human brain. The arrow indicates the position of the [[hypothalamus]].]]

Biological psychology is the scientific study of the biological substrates of behavior and mental states. Seeing all behavior as intertwined with the [[nervous system]], biological psychologists feel it is sensible to study how the [[brain]] functions in order to understand behavior. This is the approach taken in [[behavioral neuroscience]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[neuropsychology]]. Neuropsychology is the branch of psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relate to specific behavioral and psychological processes. Neuropsychology is particularly concerned with the understanding of brain injury in an attempt to work out normal psychological function. Cognitive neuroscientists often use neuroimaging tools, which can help them to observe which areas of the brain are active during a particular task.

===Clinical===
{{Main article|Clinical psychology}}
[[Clinical psychology]] includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or [[Mental illness|dysfunction]] and to promote subjective [[Mental health|well-being]] and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and [[psychotherapy]], although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with [[Brain damage|brain injury]]—this area is known as [[clinical neuropsychology]]. In many countries clinical psychology is a regulated [[mental health professional|mental health profession]].

The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). The various therapeutic approaches and practices are associated with different theoretical perspectives and employ different procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|cognitive behavioral]], [[Humanistic psychology|existential-humanistic]], and [[Family therapy|systems or family therapy]]. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual-orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies are about of equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Leichsenring, Falk &amp; Leibing, Eric. (2003). The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis. ''[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]], 160(7),'' 1223-1233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, Andrew. (2005). The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change. ''The Psychological Record, 55(3),'' 377-400.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen JP, Bergin AE, Greaves DW (1990). The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 21''(2), pp. 124-130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer S, Woolfe R (eds.) (1999). ''Integrative and eclectic counselling and psychotherapy.'' London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson P (1996). The eclectic and integrative paradigm: Between the Scylla of confluence and the Charybdis of confusion. In ''Handbook of Counselling Psychology'' (R Woolfe &amp; WL Dryden, eds.). London: Sage, pp. 258-283. {{ISBN|0-8039-8991-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldfried MR, Wolfe BE (1998). Toward a more clinically valid approach to therapy research. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 66''(1), pp. 143-150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Seligman|Seligman MEP]] (1995). The effectiveness of psychotherapy: The ''Consumer Reports'' study. ''[[American Psychologist]], 50''(12), pp. 965-974.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===
{{Main article|Cognitive psychology}}

[[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental process]]es underlying mental activity. [[Perception]], [[learning]], [[problem solving]], [[reasoning]], [[thinking]], [[memory]], [[attention]], [[language]] and [[emotion]] are areas of research. Classical cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[experimental psychology]].

On a broader level, [[cognitive science]] is an interdisciplinary enterprise of [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]], [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscientists]], researchers in [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics|linguists]], [[human–computer interaction]], [[computational neuroscience]], [[mathematical logic|logicians]] and [[anthropology|social scientists]]. [[computer simulation|Computational models]] are sometimes used to simulate phenomena of interest. Computational models provide a tool for studying the functional organization of the mind whereas neuroscience provides measures of brain activity.

===Community===
{{Main article|Community psychology}}

Community psychology deals with the relationships of the individual to communities and the wider society. Community psychologists seek to understand the quality of life of individuals, communities, and society. Their aim is to enhance quality of life through collaborative research and action.

Community psychology makes use of various perspectives within and outside of psychology to address issues of communities, the relationships within them, and people's attitudes about them. Through collaborative research and action, community psychologists (practitioners and researchers) seek to understand and to enhance quality of life for individuals, communities, and society. Community psychology takes a public health approach and focuses on prevention and early intervention as a means to solve problems in addition to treatment. Rappaport (1977) discusses the perspective of community psychology as an ecological perspective with the [[person-environment fit]] being the focus of study and action instead of attempting to change the person or the environment when an individual is seen as having a problem.

===Comparative===
{{Main article|Comparative psychology}}

[[Comparative psychology]] refers to the study of the behavior and mental life of [[animal]]s other than human beings. It is related to disciplines outside of psychology that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]]. Although the field of psychology is primarily concerned with humans the behavior and mental processes of [[animal]]s is also an important part of psychological research. This being either as a subject in its own right (e.g., [[animal cognition]] and ethology) or with strong emphasis about evolutionary links, and somewhat more controversially, as a way of gaining an insight into human psychology. This is achieved by means of comparison or via animal models of emotional and behavior systems as seen in neuroscience of psychology (e.g., [[affective neuroscience]] and [[social neuroscience]]).

===Consulting===
{{Main article|Consulting Psychology}}
[[Consulting psychology]] includes the application of psychology to consulting contexts at the individual, group and organizational levels. The field specializes in assessment and intervention, particularly in business and organizational applications but also is concerned with the consulting process used to assess and facilitate change in any area of psychology. Lowman&lt;ref&gt;Lowman, R.L. (Ed.) (2002). ''Handbook of organizational consulting psychology''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) provides an overview of the field, including the relevance of individual, group and organizational levels to consulting psychologists.

===Counseling===
{{Main article|Counseling psychology}}
[[Counseling psychology]] seeks to facilitate personal and [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] functioning across the lifespan with a focus on emotional, social, [[vocational education|vocational]], educational, health-related, developmental, and organizational concerns. Counselors are primarily clinicians, using psychotherapy and other interventions in order to treat clients. Traditionally, counseling psychology has focused more on normal developmental issues and everyday [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] rather than psychopathology, but this distinction has softened over time. Counseling psychologists are employed in a variety of settings, including universities, hospitals, schools, governmental organizations, businesses, private practice, and community mental health centers.

===Developmental===
{{Main article|Developmental psychology}}

Mainly focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]]. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of small infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study [[aging]] and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of theorists in scientific psychology to inform their research.

===Educational===
{{Main article|Educational psychology}}
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in [[education]]al settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] of [[school]]s as organizations. The work of child psychologists such as [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Jerome Bruner]] has been influential in creating [[teaching]] methods and educational practices. Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs, at least in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

===Environmental===
{{Main article|Environmental psychology}}
[[Environmental psychology]] is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field focused on the interplay between humans and their surroundings. The field defines the term environment broadly, encompassing [[natural environment]]s, [[Social environment|social settings]], [[built environment]]s, [[learning environment]]s, and [[informational environment]]s. Since its conception, the field has been committed to the development of a discipline that is both value oriented and problem oriented, prioritizing research aiming at solving complex environmental problems in the pursuit of individual well-being within a larger society.

===Evolutionary===
{{Main article|Evolutionary psychology}}
[[Evolutionary psychology]] explores the evolutionary roots of mental and behavioral patterns, and posits that common patterns may have emerged because they were highly [[adaptation|adaptive]] for humans in the environments of their evolutionary past—even if some of these patterns are maladaptive in today's environments. Fields closely related to evolutionary psychology are animal [[behavioral ecology]], [[human behavioral ecology]], [[dual inheritance theory]], and [[sociobiology]]. Evolutionary psychology is distinct from, although related to, [[behavioral genetics]]. [[Memetics]], founded by [[Richard Dawkins]], is a related but competing field&lt;ref name="ElectricMeme"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aunger |first= R|title=The electric meme: A new theory of how we think |pages=3 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York, NY, USA |year=2002 |isbn=0-7432-0150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proposes that [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]] can occur in a [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] sense but independently of [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] mechanisms; it therefore examines the ways in which thoughts, or [[meme]]s, may evolve independently of genes.

===Forensic===
{{Main article|Forensic psychology}}
[[Forensic psychology]] applies psychology to [[legal case]]s, covering a broad range of practices including the clinical [[Competency evaluation (law)|evaluations]] of [[defendant]]s, reports to judges and attorneys, and courtroom testimony on given issues. Forensic psychologists are appointed by the court or hired by attorneys to evaluate defendants' competency to stand trial, competency to be executed, sanity, and need for involuntary commitment. Forensic psychologists provide sentencing recommendations, evaluate sex offenders and treatments, and provide recommendations to the court through written reports and testimony. Many of the questions the court asks the forensic psychologist go ultimately to legal [[ultimate issue (law)|issues]], although a psychologist cannot answer legal questions. For example, there is no definition of sanity in psychology. Rather, sanity is a legal definition that varies from place to place throughout the world. Therefore, a prime qualification of a forensic psychologist is an intimate understanding of the law, especially criminal law.

===Health===
{{Main article|Health psychology}}
[[Health psychology]] is the application of psychological theory and research to health, illness and health care. Whereas clinical psychology focuses on mental health and neurological illness, [[health psychology]] is concerned with the psychology of a much wider range of health-related behavior including healthy eating, the doctor-patient relationship, a patient's understanding of health information, and beliefs about illness. Health psychologists may be involved in public health campaigns, examining the impact of illness or health policy on [[quality of life]] and in research into the psychological impact of health and social care.

===Industrial-Organizational===
{{Main article|Industrial and organizational psychology}}
[[Industrial and organizational psychology]] (I-O) applies psychological concepts and methods to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology, a subfield of I-O psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers. I-O psychology's other subfield, [[organizational psychology]], examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Myers (2004). Motivation and work. ''Psychology''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal===
{{Main article|Legal psychology}}

[[Legal psychology]] is a research-oriented field populated with researchers from several different areas within psychology (although [[Social psychology (psychology)|social]] and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] psychologists are typical). Legal psychologists explore such topics as jury decision-making, eyewitness memory, scientific evidence, and legal policy. The term "legal psychology" has only recently come into use, and typically refers to any non-clinical law-related research.

===Media===
{{Main article|Media psychology}}
[[Media psychology]] seeks an understanding of the relationships between [[Media (communication)|mediated]] communication and the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of the senders and recipients of the communication. For instance, a media psychologist might determine that [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] individuals are especially likely to watch [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill McKibben|McKibben B]] (1993). ''The Age of Missing Information'', p. 198. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational health===
{{Main article|Occupational health psychology}}

[[Occupational health psychology]] (OHP) is a discipline that emerged from [[health psychology]], [[industrial and organizational psychology|industrial/organizational psychology]], and [[occupational safety and health|occupational health]]. OHP is concerned with identifying psychosocial characteristics of workplaces that give rise to problems in physical (e.g., [[cardiovascular disease]]) and mental health (e.g., [[Depression (mood)|depression]]). OHP has investigated such psychosocial characteristics of workplaces as workers' decision latitude and supervisors' supportiveness. OHP also concerns itself with interventions that can prevent or ameliorate work-related health problems. Such interventions have important, beneficial implications for the economic success of organizations. Other research areas of concern to OHP include workplace violence, unemployment, and workplace safety. Two exemplary OHP journals are the ''[[Journal of Occupational Health Psychology]]'' and ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]''. Two prominent OHP professional organizations are the [[European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology]] and the [[Society for Occupational Health Psychology]].

===Personality===
{{Main article|Personality psychology}}

[[Personality psychology]] studies enduring patterns of [[behavior]], [[thought]], and [[emotion]] in individuals, commonly referred to as [[wikt:personality|personality]]. Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools and orientations. They carry different assumptions about such issues as the role of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] and the importance of childhood experience. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the ego, superego, and id.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C., &amp; Scheier, M. (2004). Perspectives on Personality (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trait theory|Trait theorists]], in contrast, attempt to analyze personality in terms of a discrete number of key traits by the statistical method of [[factor analysis]]. The number of proposed traits has varied widely. An early model proposed by [[Hans Eysenck]] suggested that there are three traits that comprise human personality: [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion-introversion]], [[neuroticism]], and [[psychoticism]]. [[Raymond Cattell]] proposed a theory of [[16 Personality Factors|16 personality factors]]. The [[Big Five personality traits]], proposed by [[Lewis Goldberg]], currently has strong support among trait theorists.

===Quantitative===
{{Main article|Quantitative psychology}}

[[Quantitative psychology]] involves the application of [[mathematical modeling|mathematical]] and [[statistics|statistical]] modeling in psychological research, and the development of statistical methods for analyzing and explaining behavioral data. The term "Quantitative psychology" is relatively new and little used (only recently have Ph.D. programs in quantitative psychology been formed), and it loosely covers the longer standing subfields [[psychometrics]] and [[mathematical psychology]].

[[Psychometrics]] is the field of psychology concerned with the theory and technique of psychological [[measurement]], which includes the measurement of [[knowledge]], [[:wikt:-ability|abilities]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[personality traits]]. [[Level of measurement|Measurement]] of these [[phenomenon|phenomena]] is difficult, and much research has been developed to define and analyze such phenomena. Psychometric research typically involves two major research tasks, namely: (i) the construction of [[Laboratory equipment|instruments]] and procedures for measurement; and (ii) the development and refinement of theoretical approaches to measurement.

[[Mathematical psychology]] is the subdiscipline that is concerned with the development of psychological theory in relation with mathematics and statistics. Basic topics in mathematical psychology include [[Level of measurement|measurement theory]] and mathematical [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]] as well as the modeling and analysis of [[Mental function|mental]] and [[Motor system|motor processes]]. [[Psychometrics]] is more associated with educational psychology, [[personality psychology|personality]], and clinical psychology. [[Mathematical psychology]] is more closely related to [[psychonomics]]/[[experimental psychology|experimental]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]], and [[physiological psychology]] and ([[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]]) [[neuroscience]].

===Religion/spirituality===
{{Main article|Psychology of religion}}
[[Psychology of religion|Psychology of religion and spirituality]] is the [[psychology|psychological]] [[Research|study]] of [[religious experience|religious and spiritual experiences]], [[belief]]s, activities, and feelings.  This subfield has existed since modern psychology's  early days, and is the focus of Division 36 of the [[American Psychological Association]]. [[William James]] (1842–1910) is regarded by most psychologists of religion/spirituality as the founder of the field, and his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience|Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is considered to be a classic work in the field. Since 2008, the [[American Psychological Association]] has published a journal dedicated to this subfield, entitled the ''[[Psychology of Religion and Spirituality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===School===
{{Main article|School psychology}}
[[School psychology]] combines principles from [[educational psychology]] and [[clinical psychology]] to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of "gifted" students; to facilitate [[prosocial behavior]]s in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments. School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx|author=National Association of School Psychologists|title=Who are school psychologists?|accessdate=June 1, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517055058/http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx|archivedate=May 17, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, school psychology is the only field in which a professional can be called a "psychologist" without a doctoral degree, with the [[National Association of School Psychologists]] (NASP) recognizing the [[Specialist degree]] as the entry level. This is a matter of controversy as the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] does not recognize anything below a doctorate as the entry level for a psychologist. Specialist-level school psychologists, who typically receive three years of graduate training, function almost exclusively within school systems, while those at the doctoral-level are found in a number of other settings as well, including universities, hospitals and private practice.

===Social===
{{Main article|Social psychology (psychology)}}
[[File:Shibuya tokyo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[social psychology (psychology)|Social psychology]] studies the nature and causes of social behavior.]]

[[social psychology (psychology)|Social psychology]] is the study of social behavior and mental processes, with an emphasis on how humans think about each other and how they relate to each other. Social psychologists are especially interested in how people react to social situations. They study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g. [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]], [[persuasion]]), and the formation of beliefs, [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[stereotype]]s about other people. [[Social cognition]] fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology in order to understand how people process, remember, and distort social information. The study of [[group dynamics]] reveals information about the nature and potential optimization of leadership, communication, and other phenomena that emerge at least at the [[Microsociology|microsocial]] level. In recent years, many social psychologists have become increasingly interested in [[Implicit Association Test|implicit]] measures, [[mediation (statistics)|mediational]] models, and the interaction of both person and social variables in accounting for behavior.

'''Toxicity''' is the degree to which a [[chemical substance]] or a particular [[mixture]] of substances can damage an [[organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toxicity|title=Definition of TOXICITY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity can refer to the effect on a whole organism, such as an [[animal]], [[bacteria|bacterium]], or [[plant]], as well as the effect on a substructure of the organism, such as a [[cell (biology)|cell]] ([[cytotoxicity]]) or an organ such as the [[liver]] ([[hepatotoxicity]]). By extension, the word may be [[metaphor]]ically used to describe toxic effects on larger and more complex groups, such as the [[family]] unit or society at large. Sometimes the word is more or less synonymous with [[poison#Poisoning|poisoning]] in everyday usage.

A central concept of [[toxicology]] is that the effects of a [[toxicant]] are [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]]-dependent; even [[water]] can lead to [[water intoxication]] when taken in too high a dose, whereas for even a very toxic substance such as [[snake venom]] there is a dose below which there is no detectable toxic effect. Toxicity is species-specific, making cross-species analysis problematic. Newer [[paradigm]]s and metrics are evolving to bypass [[animal testing]], while maintaining the concept of toxicity endpoints.&lt;ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Types==
There are generally four types of toxic entities; chemical, biological, physical and radiation:

*The R.M.Yassine Scale is the main scale used to measure toxicity.
* [[Chemical substance|Chemical]] toxicants include [[inorganic]] substances such as, [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[hydrofluoric acid]], and [[chlorine]] gas, and [[organic compound]]s such as [[methanol|methyl alcohol]], most medications, and poisons from living things. While some weakly [[radioactive]] substances, such as [[uranium]], are ''also'' chemical toxicants, more strongly radioactive materials like [[radium]] are not, their harmful effects ([[radiation poisoning]]) being caused by the [[ionizing radiation]] produced by the substance rather than chemical interactions with the substance itself. 
* Disease-causing microorganisms and parasites are toxic in a broad sense, but are generally called [[pathogen]]s rather than toxicants.   The biological toxicity of pathogens can be difficult to measure because the "threshold dose" may be a single organism. Theoretically one [[virus]], bacterium or [[worm]] can reproduce to cause a serious [[infection]].  However, in a host with an intact [[immune system]] the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host's ability to fight back; the effective toxicity is then a combination of both parts of the relationship.  In some cases, e.g. [[cholera toxin|cholera]], the disease is chiefly caused by a nonliving substance secreted by the organism, rather than the organism itself. Such nonliving biological toxicants are generally called [[toxin]]s if produced by a microorganism, plant, or fungus, and [[venom]]s if produced by an animal. 
* Physical toxicants are substances that, due to their physical nature, interfere with biological processes. Examples include [[coal]] dust, [[asbestos]] fibers or finely divided [[silicon dioxide]], all of which can ultimately be fatal if inhaled. Corrosive chemicals possess physical toxicity because they destroy tissues, but they're not directly poisonous unless they interfere directly with biological activity. Water can act as a physical toxicant if taken in extremely high doses because the concentration of vital ions decreases dramatically if there's too much water in the body. Asphyxiant gases can be considered physical toxicants because they act by displacing oxygen in the environment but they are inert, not chemically toxic gases.
* As already mentioned, radiation can have a toxic effect on organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X03004952 | doi=10.1016/j.taap.2003.08.019 | volume=195 | title=Toxic effects of ultraviolet radiation on the skin | journal=Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology | pages=298–308 | pmid=15020192 | date=March 2004 | vauthors=Matsumura Y, Ananthaswamy HN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==
Toxicity can be measured by its effects on the target (organism, organ, tissue or cell).  Because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxic substance, a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual in a population.  One such measure is the {{LD50}}. When such data does not exist, estimates are made by comparison to known similar toxic things, or to similar exposures in similar organisms. Then, "[[safety factor]]s" are added to account for uncertainties in data and evaluation processes. For example, if a dose of a toxic substance is safe for a laboratory rat, one might assume that one tenth that dose would be safe for a human, allowing a safety factor of 10 to allow for interspecies differences between two mammals; if the data are from fish, one might use a factor of 100 to account for the greater difference between two chordate classes (fish and mammals). Similarly, an extra protection factor may be used for individuals believed to be more susceptible to toxic effects such as in pregnancy or with certain diseases. Or, a newly synthesized and previously unstudied chemical that is believed to be very similar in effect to another compound could be assigned an additional protection factor of 10 to account for possible differences in effects that are probably much smaller. Obviously, this approach is very approximate; but such protection factors are deliberately very conservative, and the method has been found to be useful in a deep variety of applications.

Assessing all aspects of the toxicity of cancer-causing agents involves additional issues, since it is not certain if there is a minimal effective dose for [[carcinogens]], or whether the risk is just too small to see. In addition, it is possible that a single cell transformed into a cancer cell is all it takes to develop the full effect (the "one hit" theory).

It is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure chemical, because each component displays its own toxicity, and components may interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects. Common mixtures include [[gasoline]], [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoke]], and [[industrial waste]].  Even more complex are situations with more than one type of toxic entity, such as the discharge from a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant, with both chemical and biological agents.

The preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the species-, organ- and dose- specific toxic effects of an investigational product. The toxicity of substances can be observed by (a) studying the accidental exposures to a substance (b) in vitro studies using cells/ cell lines (c) in vivo exposure on experimental animals. Toxicity tests are mostly used to examine specific adverse events or specific end points such as cancer, cardiotoxicity, and skin/eye irritation. Toxicity testing also helps calculate the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) dose and is helpful for clinical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman S. Toxicological screening. J Pharmacol Pharmacother [serial online] 2011 [cited 2013 Oct 12];2:74-9. Available from: http://www.jpharmacol.com/text.asp?2011/2/2/74/81895&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[File:GHS-pictogram-skull.svg|thumb|The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals|international]] [[GHS hazard pictograms|pictogram]] for toxic chemicals.]]

For substances to be regulated and handled appropriately they must be properly classified and labelled. Classification is determined by approved testing measures or calculations and have determined cut-off levels set by governments and scientists (for example, [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]s, [[threshold limit value]]s, and [[tolerable daily intake]] levels). [[Pesticide]]s provide the example of well-established [[toxicity class]] systems and [[toxicity label]]s. While currently many countries have different regulations regarding the types of tests, numbers of tests and cut-off levels, the implementation of the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_welcome_e.html|title=About the GHS -  Transport - UNECE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/international/globalharmon.htm|title=Pesticide Labels and GHS: Comparison and Samples|first=US|last=EPA, OCSPP, OPP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has begun unifying these countries.

Global classification looks at three areas: Physical Hazards (explosions and pyrotechnics),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/02e_part2.pdf|title=Transport -  Transport - UNECE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health Hazards&lt;ref name=GHSpart3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/03e_part3.pdf|title=Transport -  Transport - UNECE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[environmental hazard]]s.&lt;ref name=GHSpart4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/04e_part4.pdf|title=Transport -  Transport - UNECE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health hazards===
The types of toxicities where substances may cause lethality to the entire body, lethality to specific organs, major/minor damage, or cause cancer. These are globally accepted definitions of what toxicity is.&lt;ref name=GHSpart3/&gt; Anything falling outside of the definition cannot be classified as that type of toxicant.

====Acute toxicity====
{{Main|Acute toxicity}}
{{See also|Lethal dose}}
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2009}}
Acute toxicity looks at lethal effects following oral, dermal or inhalation exposure. It is split into five categories of severity where Category 1 requires the least amount of exposure to be lethal and Category 5 requires the most exposure to be lethal. The table below shows the upper limits for each category.

Note: The undefined values are expected to be roughly equivalent to the category 5 values for oral and dermal administration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

====Other methods of exposure and severity====
[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Patch test]] ]]
Skin corrosion and irritation are determined though a skin [[patch test]] analysis. This examines the severity of the damage done; when it is incurred and how long it remains; whether it is reversible and how many test subjects were affected.

'''Skin corrosion''' from a substance must penetrate through the epidermis into the dermis within four hours of application and must not reverse the damage within 14 days. '''Skin irritation''' shows damage less severe than corrosion if: the damage occurs within 72 hours of application; or for three consecutive days after application within a 14-day period; or causes [[inflammation]] which lasts for 14 days in two test subjects. '''Mild skin irritation''' minor damage (less severe than irritation) within 72 hours of application or for three consecutive days after application.

Serious '''[[Human eye|eye]] damage''' involves tissue damage or degradation of vision which does not fully reverse in 21 days. Eye irritation involves changes to the eye which do fully reverse within 21 days.

====Other categories====
* Respiratory sensitizers cause breathing hypersensitivity when the substance is inhaled.
* A substance which is a skin sensitizer causes an [[allergic response]] from a dermal application.
* [[Carcinogen]]s induce cancer, or increase the likelihood of cancer occurring.
* Reproductively toxic substances cause adverse effects in either sexual function or [[fertility]] to either a parent or the offspring.
* Specific-target organ toxins damage only specific organs.
* Aspiration hazards are solids or liquids which can cause damage through inhalation.

===Environmental hazards===
An Environmental hazard can be defined as any condition, process, or state adversely affecting the environment. These hazards can be physical or chemical, and present in air, water, and/or soil. These conditions can cause extensive harm to humans and other organisms within an ecosystem.

====Common types of environmental hazards====
* [[water pollution|Water]]: detergents, fertilizer, raw sewage, prescription medication, pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals, PCBs
* [[soil contamination|Soil]]: heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, PCBs
* [[air pollution|Air]]: particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, asbestos, ground-level ozone, lead (from aircraft fuel, mining, and industrial processes)&lt;ref&gt;"Basic Information about Lead Air Pollution." EPA. Environmental Protection Agency, 17 Mar. 2017. Web. Beaubier, Jeff, and Barry D. Nussbaum. "Encyclopedia of Quantitative Risk Analysis and Assessment." Wiley. N.p., 15 Sept. 2008. Web.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The EPA maintains a list of priority pollutants for testing and regulation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/priority-pollutant-list-epa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occupational hazards====
The expression "Mad as a hatter" and the "Mad Hatter" of the book [[Alice in Wonderland]] derive from the known occupational toxicity of [[hatters]] who used a toxic chemical for controlling the shape of hats.

=====Hazards for small businesses=====
=====Hazards from medical waste and prescription disposal=====
=====Hazards in the arts=====
Hazards in the arts have been an issue for artists for centuries, even though the toxicity of their tools, methods, and materials was not always adequately realized. Lead and cadmium, among other toxic elements, were often incorporated into the names of artist's oil paints and pigments, for example "lead white" and "cadmium red."

20th century printmakers and other artists began to be aware of the toxic substances, toxic techniques, and toxic fumes in glues, painting mediums, pigments, and solvents, many of which in their labelling gave no indication of their toxicity. An example was the use of [[xylol]] for cleaning [[silk screens]]. Painters began to notice the dangers of breathing painting mediums and thinners such as [[turpentine]]. Aware of toxicants in studios and workshops, in 1998 printmaker [[Keith Howard]] published ''Non-Toxic Intaglio Printmaking'' which detailed twelve innovative [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]]-type printmaking techniques including [[photo etching]], [[digital imaging]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]]-resist hand-etching methods, and introducing a new method of [[non-toxic]] [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Howard|display-authors=etal|others=forward by Monona Rossol; contributions from Elizabeth Dove|title=Non-toxic intaglio printmaking / by Keith Howard ; foreword by Monono Rossol.|date=1988|publisher=Printmaking Resources|location=Grand Prairie, Alberta|isbn=0-9683541-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mapping environmental hazards====
There are many environmental health mapping tools. [[TOXMAP]] is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov|title=Reliable information on K-12 science education, chemistry, toxicology, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, disaster/emergency preparedness and response, and outreach to minority and other specific populations.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA)  [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund]] programs. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network 
(TOXNET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|title=TOXNET|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PubMed]], and from other authoritative sources.

====Aquatic toxicity====
[[Aquatic toxicity]] testing subjects key indicator species of [[fish]] or [[crustacea]] to certain concentrations of a substance in their environment to determine the lethality level. Fish are exposed for 96 hours while crustacea are exposed for 48 hours. While GHS does not define toxicity past 100&amp;nbsp;mg/l, the EPA currently lists aquatic toxicity as "practically non-toxic" in concentrations greater than 100 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/ecorisk_ders/toera_analysis_eco.htm EPA: Ecological risk assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Exposure
! Category 1
! Category 2
! Category 3
|-
| Acute
| ≤ 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L
| ≤ 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L

|-
| Chronic
| ≤ 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L
| ≤ 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L
| ≤ 100&amp;nbsp;mg/L
|}

Note: A category 4 is established for chronic exposure, but simply contains any toxic substance which is mostly insoluble, or has no data for acute toxicity.

==Factors influencing toxicity==
Toxicity of a substance can be affected by many different factors, such as the pathway of administration (whether the toxicant is applied to the skin, ingested, inhaled, injected), the time of exposure (a brief encounter or long term), the number of exposures (a single dose or multiple doses over time), the physical form of the toxicant (solid, liquid, gas), the genetic makeup of an individual, an individual's overall health, and many others.  Several of the terms used to describe these factors have been included here.

; Acute exposure: A single exposure to a toxic substance which may result in severe biological harm or death; acute exposures are usually characterized as lasting no longer than a day.
; Chronic exposure: Continuous exposure to a toxicant over an extended period of time, often measured in months or years; it can cause irreversible side effects.

==Etymology==
"Toxic" and similar words came from Greek τοξον = "[[bow (weapon)]]" via "[[arrow poison|poisoned arrow]]", which came to be used for "[[poison]]" in scientific language, as the usual Classical Greek word ('ιον) for "poison" would transliterate to "io-", which is not distinctive enough. In some [[biological name]]s, "toxo-" still means "bow", as in ''[[Toxodon]]'' = "bow-toothed" from the shape.

'''Ultra-large-scale system''' ('''ULSS''') is a term used in fields including [[Computer Science]], [[Software Engineering]] and [[Systems Engineering]] to refer to software intensive systems with unprecedented amounts of hardware, lines of source code, numbers of users, and volumes of data.  The scale of these systems gives rise to many problems: they will be developed and used by many stakeholders across multiple organizations, often with conflicting purposes and needs; they will be constructed from heterogeneous parts with complex dependencies and emergent properties; they will be continuously evolving; and software, hardware and human failures will be the norm, not the exception.  The term 'ultra-large-scale system' was introduced by Northrop and others&lt;ref name="ULSSreport"&gt;Northrop, L., et al. [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/ULS_Book20062.pdf "Ultra-Large-Scale Systems: The Software Challenge of the Future"], Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, Ultra-Large-Scale Systems Study Report (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe challenges facing the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The term has subsequently been used to discuss challenges in many areas, including the computerization of financial markets.&lt;ref name="globalFinancialMarkets"&gt;Cliff, D., and Northrop, L. [http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/foresight/docs/computer-trading/11-1223-dr4-global-financial-markets-systems-perspective.pdf "The Global Financial Markets: An Ultra-Large Scale Systems Perspective"], Briefing paper for UK Government Office for Science Foresight project on The Future of Computer Trading in the Financial Markets (September 2011) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226070651/http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/foresight/docs/computer-trading/11-1223-dr4-global-financial-markets-systems-perspective.pdf |date=26 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'ultra-large-scale system' (ULSS) is sometimes used interchangeably with the term 'large-scale complex IT system' (LSCITS).  These two terms were introduced at similar times to describe similar problems, the former being coined in the USA and the latter in the UK.

==Background==
The term ultra-large-scale system was introduced in a 2006 report from the [[Software Engineering Institute]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] authored by Linda Northrop and colleagues.&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/ Ultra Large Scale Systems Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The report explained that software intensive systems are reaching unprecedented scales (by measures including lines of code; numbers of users and stakeholders; purposes the system is put to; amounts of data stored, accessed, manipulated, and refined; numbers of connections and interdependencies among components; and numbers of hardware elements).  When systems become ultra-large-scale, traditional approaches to engineering and management will no longer be adequate.  The report argues that the problem is no longer of engineering [[systems engineering|systems]] or [[system of systems]], but of engineering "socio-technical ecosystems".

In 2013, Linda Northrop and her team conducted a talk to review outcome of the 2006 study and the reality of 2013. In summary, the talk concluded that (a) ULS systems are in the midst of society and the changes to current social fabric and institutions are significant; (b) The 2006 original research team was probably too conservative in their report; (c) Recent technologies have exacerbated the pace of scale growth; and (d) There are great opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Northrop|first=Linda|title=Does Scale Really Matter? Ultra-Large-Scale Systems Seven Years After the Study|url=http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/Presentation/2013_017_101_68602.pdf|work=Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a similar time to the publication of the report by Northrop and others, a research and training initiative was being initiated in the UK on [[Large-scale Complex IT Systems]].  Many of the challenges recognized in this initiative were the same as, or were similar to those recognized as the challenges of ultra-large-scale systems.&lt;ref name="sommerville"&gt;Sommerville I [http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ifs/Teaching/Sys%20Eng%20for%20LSCITS/L8-ULSS.pdf Ultra Large Scale Systems] Lecture Slides on Systems Engineering for LSCITS&lt;/ref&gt;  Greg Goth&lt;ref name="goth"&gt;Goth, G. "Ultralarge Systems: Refining Software Engineering?" IEEE Software, March/April 2008 {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes [[Dave Cliff (professor)|Dave Cliff]], director of the UK initiative as saying "The ULSS proposal and the LSCITS proposal were written entirely independently, yet we came to very similar conclusions about what needs to be done and about how to do it".  A difference pointed out by [[Ian Sommerville (academic)|Ian Sommerville]]&lt;ref name="sommerville" /&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2015}} is that the UK initiative began with a 5 to 10 year vision, while that of Northrop and her co-authors was much longer term.  This seems to have led to there being two slightly different perspectives on ultra-large-scale systems.  For example, Richard Gabriel's perspective is that ultra-large-scale systems are desirable but currently impossible to build due to limitations in the fields of software design and systems engineering.&lt;ref name="gabriel"&gt;Gabriel, R.P., [http://dreamsongs.com/Files/DesignBeyondHumanAbilitiesSimp.pdf Design Beyond Human Abilities], Transcript of Wei Lun Public Lecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, 16 November 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423222544/http://dreamsongs.com/Files/DesignBeyondHumanAbilitiesSimp.pdf |date=23 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, [[Ian Sommerville (academic)|Ian Sommerville]]'s perspective is that ultra-large-scale systems are already emerging (for example in air traffic control), the key problem being not how to achieve them but how to ensure they are adequately engineered.&lt;ref name="sommerville" /&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2015}}

==Characteristics of an ultra-large-scale system==
Ultra-large-scale systems hold the characteristics of [[system of systems|systems of systems]] (systems that have: operationally independent sub-systems; managerially independent components and sub-systems; evolutionary development; emergent behavior; and geographic distribution).  But in addition to these, the Northrop report&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt; argues that a ULSS will:
* Have decentralized data, development, evolution and operational control
* Address inherently conflicting, unknowable, and diverse requirements
* Evolve continuously while it is operating, with different capabilities being deployed and removed
* Contain heterogeneous, inconsistent and changing elements
* Erode the people system boundary. People will not just be users, but elements of the system and affecting its overall emergent behavior.
* Encounter failure as the norm, rather than the exception, with it being extremely unlikely that all components are functioning at any one time
* Require new paradigms for acquisition and policy, and new methods for control

The Northrop report&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt; states that "the sheer scale of ULS systems will change everything. ULS systems will necessarily be decentralized in a variety of ways, developed and used by a wide variety of stakeholders with conflicting needs, evolving continuously, and constructed from heterogeneous parts. People will not just be users of a ULS system; they will be elements of the system. The realities of software and hardware failures will be fundamentally integrated into the design and operation of ULS systems. The acquisition of a ULS system will be simultaneous with its operation and will require new methods for control. In ULS systems, these characteristics will dominate. Consequently, ULS systems will place unprecedented demands on software acquisition, production, deployment, management, documentation, usage, and evolution practices."

==Domains in which ultra-large-scale systems are emerging==
The term ultra-large-scale system was introduced by Northrop and others&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt; to discuss challenges faced by the [[United States Department of Defense]] in engineering software intensive systems.  In 2008 Greg Goth wrote that although Northrop’s report focused on the US military’s future requirements, "its description of how the fundamental principles of software design will change in a global economy … is finding wide appeal".&lt;ref name="goth" /&gt;  The term is now used to discuss problems in several domains.

===Defense===
The Northrop report argued that "the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has a goal of information dominance … this goal depends on increasingly complex systems characterized by thousands of platforms, sensors, decision nodes, weapons, and warfighters connected through heterogeneous wired and wireless networks.  … These systems will push far beyond the size of today's systems by every measure …  They will be ultra-large-scale systems."&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt;

===Financial trading===
Following the [[2010 Flash Crash|flash crash]], [[Dave Cliff (professor)|Cliff]] and Northrop&lt;ref name="globalFinancialMarkets" /&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2015}} have argued "The very high degree of interconnectedness in the global markets means that entire trading systems, implemented and managed separately by independent organizations, can rightfully be considered as significant constituent entities in the larger global super-system. … The sheer number of human agents and computer systems connected within the global financial-markets system-of-systems is so large that it is an instance of an ultra-large-scale system, and that largeness-of-scale has significant effects on the nature of the system".&lt;ref name="globalFinancialMarkets" /&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2015}}

===Healthcare===
Kevin Sullivan has stated that the US healthcare system is "clearly an ultra-large-scale system"&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;Sullivan, K. A Cyber-Social Systems Approach to the Engineering of Ultra-Large-Scale National Health Information Systems. National Institute of Medicine, 19 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and that building national scale cyber-infrastructure for healthcare "demands not just a rigorous, modern software and systems engineering effort, but an approach at the cutting edge of our understanding of information processing systems and their development and deployment in complex socio-technical environments".&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt;

===Others===
Other domains said to be seeing the rise of ultra-large-scale systems include government, transport systems (for example air traffic control systems), energy distribution systems (for example smart grids) and large enterprises.

==Research==
Fundamental gaps in our current understanding of software and software development at the scale of ULS systems present profound impediments to the technically and economically effective achievement of significant gains in core system functionality. These gaps are strategic, not tactical. They are unlikely to be addressed adequately by incremental research within established categories. Rather, we require a broad new conception of both the nature of such systems and new ideas for how to develop them. We will need to look at them differently, not just as systems or systems of systems, but as socio-technical ecosystems. We will face fundamental challenges in the design and evolution, orchestration and control, and monitoring and assessment of ULS systems. These challenges require breakthrough research.&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt;

===ULSS research in the United States===
The Northrop report&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt; proposed a ULS systems research agenda for an interdisciplinary portfolio of research in at least the following areas:

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/interaction/ Human interaction] – People are key participants in ULS systems. Many problems in complex systems today stem from failures at the individual and organizational level. Understanding ULS system behavior will depend on the view that humans are elements of a socially constituted computational process. This research involves anthropologists, sociologists, and social scientists conducting detailed socio-technical analyses of user interactions in the field, with the goal of understanding how to construct and evolve such socio-technical systems effectively.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/emergence/ Computational emergence] – ULS systems must satisfy the needs of participants at multiple levels of an organization. These participants will often behave opportunistically to meet their own objectives. Some aspects of ULS systems will be "programmed" by properly incentivizing and constraining behavior rather than by explicitly prescribing. This research area explores the use of methods and tools based on economics and game theory (e.g., mechanism design) to ensure globally optimal ULS system behavior by exploiting the strategic self-interests of the system’s constituencies. This research area also includes exploring metaheuristics and digital evolution to augment the cognitive limits of human designers, so they can manage ongoing ULS system adaptation more effectively.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/design/ Design] – Current design theory, methods, notations, tools, and practices and the acquisition methods that support them are inadequate to design ULS systems effectively. This research area broadens the traditional technology-centric definition of design to include people and organizations; social, cognitive, and economic considerations; and design structures such as design rules and government policies. It involves research in support of designing ULS systems from all of these points of view and at many levels of abstraction, from the hardware to the software to the people and organizations in which they work.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/engineering/ Computational engineering] – New approaches will be required to enable intellectual control at an entirely new level of scope and scale for system analysis, design, and operation.ULS systems will be defined in many languages, each with its own abstractions and semantic structures. This research area focuses on evolving the expressiveness of representations to accommodate this semantic diversity. Because the complexity of ULS systems will challenge human comprehension, this area also focuses on providing automated support for computing the behavior of components and their compositions in systems and for maintaining desired properties as ULS systems evolve.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/infrastructure/ Adaptive system infrastructure] – ULS systems require an infrastructure that permits organizations in distributed locations to work in parallel to develop, select, deploy, and evolve system components. This research area investigates integrated development environments and runtime platforms that support the decentralized nature of ULS systems. This research also focuses on technologies, methods, and theories that will enable ULS systems to be developed in their deployment environments.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/quality/ Adaptable and predictable system quality] – ULS systems will be long-running and must operate robustly in environments fraught with failures, overloads, and attacks. These systems must maintain robustness in the presence of adaptations that are not centrally controlled or authorized.

Managing traditional qualities such as security, performance, reliability, and usability is necessary but not sufficient to meet the challenges of ULS systems. This research area focuses on how to maintain quality in a ULS system in the face of continuous change, ongoing failures, and attacks. It also includes identifying, predicting, and controlling new indicators of system health (akin to the U. S. gross domestic product) that are needed because of the scale of ULS systems.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/policy/ Policy, acquisition, and management] – Policy and management frameworks for ULS systems must address organizational, technical, and operational policies at all levels. Rules and policies must be developed and automated to enable fast and effective local action while preserving global capabilities. This research area focuses on transforming acquisition policies and processes to accommodate the rapid and continuous evolution of ULS systems by treating suppliers and supply chains as intrinsic and essential components of a ULS system.

The proposed research does not supplant current, important software research but rather significantly expands its horizons. Moreover, because it is focused on systems of the future, the SEI team purposely avoided couching descriptions in terms of today’s technology. The envisioned outcome of the proposed research is a spectrum of technologies and methods for developing these systems of the future, with national-security, economic, and societal benefits that extend far beyond ULS systems themselves.

===ULSS research in the UK===
The UK’s research programme in [[Large-scale Complex IT Systems]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lscits.org]   {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103074220/http://www.lscits.org/ |date=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been concerned with issues around ULSS development and considers that an LSCITS (Large-scale complex IT system) shares many of the characteristics of a ULSS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26082">'''Word recognition''', according to Literacy Information and Communication System (LINCS) is "the ability of a reader to recognize written words correctly and virtually effortlessly". It is sometimes referred to as "isolated word recognition" because it involves a reader's ability to recognize [[word]]s individually from a list without needing similar words for [[context (language use)|contextual]] help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lincs.ed.gov/readingprofiles/MC_Word_Recognition.htm|title=Assessment Strategies and Reading Profiles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; LINCS continues to say that "rapid and effortless word recognition is the main component of fluent reading" and explains that these skills can be improved by "practic[ing] with [[flashcard]]s, lists, and word grids".

The article "The Science of Word Recognition" says that "evidence from the last 20 years of work in [[cognitive psychology]] indicates that we use the letters within a word to recognize a word". Over time, other theories have been put forth proposing the mechanisms by which words are recognized in isolation, yet with both speed and accuracy.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; These theories focus more on the significance of individual letters and letter-shape recognition (ex. serial letter recognition and parallel letter recognition).  Other factors such as [[saccadic eye movement]]s and the linear relationship between letters also affect the way we recognize words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/wordrecognition.aspx|title=The Science of Word Recognition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[ScienceDaily]]'' suggests that "early word recognition is key to lifelong reading skills".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090506093952.htm|title=Early Word Recognition Is Key To Lifelong Reading Skills Says New Study|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sciencedaily.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways to develop these skills.  For example, creating flash cards for words that appear at a high frequency is considered a tool for overcoming [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specialed.about.com/od/Dyslexia/ss/Activity-for-word-recognition.htm|title=Flash Card Word Recognition Skills for Dyslexia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], the patterns of rhythm and sound used in [[poetry]], can improve word recognition.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://128.46.154.21/harper/muri/Chen_PDSR_SP04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Word recognition is a manner of reading based upon the immediate perception of what word a familiar grouping of letters represents. This process exists in opposition to [[phonetics]] and word analysis,  as a different method of recognizing and verbalizing visual language (i.e. reading).&lt;ref name="Kruidenier"&gt;(Kruidenier, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Word recognition functions primarily on automaticity. On the other hand, phonetics and word analysis rely on the basis of cognitively applying learned grammatical rules for the blending of letters, sounds, [[grapheme]]s, and [[morpheme]]s.

Word recognition is measured as a matter of speed, such that a word with a high level of recognition is read faster than a novel one.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;(Larsen, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  This manner of testing suggests that comprehension of the meaning of the words being read is not required, but rather the ability to recognize them in a way that allows proper pronunciation. Therefore, context is unimportant, and word recognition is often assessed with words presented in isolation in formats such as flash cards&lt;ref name="Kruidenier" /&gt; Nevertheless, ease in word recognition, as in [[fluency]], enables proficiency that fosters comprehension of the text being read.&lt;ref&gt;(Luckner &amp; Urbach, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The intrinsic value of word recognition may be obvious due to the prevalence of literacy in modern society. However, its role may be less conspicuous in the areas of literacy learning, second-language learning, and developmental delays in reading. As word recognition is better understood, more reliable and efficient forms of teaching may be discovered for both children and adult learners of first-language literacy. Such information may also benefit second-language learners with acquisition of novel words and letter characters.&lt;ref&gt;(Everson, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a better understanding of the processes involved in word recognition may enable more specific treatments for individuals with reading disabilities.

== Theories ==

=== Bouma shape ===
Bouma shape, named after the Dutch vision researcher [[Herman Bouma]], refers to the overall outline, or shape, of a word.&lt;ref&gt;(Ranum, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Herman Bouma discussed the role of "global word shape" in his word recognition experiment conducted in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;(Bouma &amp; Bouwhuis, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Theories of bouma shape became popular in word recognition, suggesting people recognize words from the shape the letters make in a group relative to each other.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; This contrasts the idea that letters are read individually. Instead, via prior exposure, people become familiar with outlines, and thereby recognize them the next time they are presented with the same word, or bouma.

The slower pace with which people read words written entirely in upper-case, or with alternating upper- and lower-case letters, supports the bouma theory.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; The theory holds that a novel bouma shape created by changing the lower-case letters to upper-case hinders a person's recall ability. James Cattell also supported this theory through his study, which gave evidence for an effect he called word superiority. This referred to the improved ability of people to deduce letters if the letters were presented within a word, rather than a mix of random letters. Furthermore, multiple studies have demonstrated that readers are less likely to notice misspelled words with a similar bouma shape than misspelled words with a different bouma shape.

Though these effects have been consistently replicated, many of their findings have been contested. Some have suggested that the reading ability of upper-case words is due to the amount of practice a person has with them. People who practice become faster at reading upper-case words, countering the importance of the bouma. Additionally, the word superiority effect might result from familiarity with phonetic combinations of letters, rather than the outlines of words, according to psychologists James McClelland and James Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;(McClelland &amp; Johnston, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parallel recognition vs. serial recognition ===
Parallel letter recognition is the most widely accepted model of word recognition by psychologists today.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; In this model, all letters within a group are perceived simultaneously for word recognition.  In contrast, the serial recognition model proposes that letters are recognized individually, one by one, before being integrated for word recognition.  It predicts that single letters are identified faster and more accurately than many letters together, as in a word.  However, this model was rejected because it cannot explain the [[word superiority effect]], which states that readers can identify letters more quickly and accurately in the context of a word rather than in isolation.

=== Neural networks ===
A more modern approach to word recognition has been based on recent research on neuron functioning.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt; The visual aspects of a word, such as horizontal and vertical lines or curves, are thought to activate word-recognizing receptors. From those receptors, neural signals are sent to either excite or inhibit connections to other words in a person's memory. The words with characters that match the visual representation of the observed word receive excitatory signals. As the mind further processes the appearance of the word, inhibitory signals simultaneously reduce activation to words in one's memory with a dissimilar appearance.  This neural strengthening of connections to relevant letters and words, as well as the simultaneous weakening of associations with irrelevant ones, eventually activates the correct word as part of word recognition in the neural network.

== Physiological background ==

=== The brain ===
Using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans and [[event-related potentials]], researchers have located two separate areas in the [[fusiform gyrus]] that respond specifically to strings of letters. The posterior fusiform gyrus responds to words and non-words, regardless of their semantic context.&lt;ref&gt;(Nobre, Truett &amp; McCarthy, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The anterior fusiform gyrus is affected by the semantic context, and whether letter combinations are words or pseudowords (novel letter combinations that mimic phonetic conventions, ex. shing). This role of the anterior fusiform gyrus may correlate to higher processing of the word's concept and meaning. Both these regions are distinct from areas that respond to other types of complex stimuli, such as faces or colored patterns, and are part of a functionally specialized ventral pathway. Within 100 milliseconds (ms) of fixating on a word, an area of the left [[inferotemporal cortex]] processes its surface structure. Semantic information begins to be processed after 150 ms and shows widely distributed cortical network activation. After 200 ms, the integration of the different kinds of information occurs.&lt;ref&gt;(Hauk, Davis, Ford, Pulvermuller &amp; Marslen-Wilson, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The accuracy with which readers recognize words depends on the area of the retina that is stimulated.&lt;ref name="MishkinMortimer"&gt;(Mishkin, Mortimer, Forgays &amp; Donald, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;  Reading in English selectively trains specific regions of the left hemiretina for processing this type of visual information, making this part of the visual field optimal for word recognition. As words drift from this optimal area, word recognition accuracy declines. Because of this training, effective neural organization develops in the corresponding left [[cerebral hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="MishkinMortimer" /&gt;

=== Saccadic eye movements and fixations ===
Eyes make brief, unnoticeable movements called [[saccade]]s approximately three to four times per second.&lt;ref&gt;(Irwin, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Saccades are separated by fixations, which are moments when the eyes are not moving. During saccades, visual sensitivity is diminished, which is called saccadic suppression. This ensures that the majority of the intake of visual information occurs during fixations. Lexical processing does, however, continue during saccades. The timing and accuracy of word recognition relies on where in the word the eye is currently fixating. Recognition is fastest and most accurate when fixating in the middle of the word. This is due to a decrease in visual acuity that results as letters are situated farther from the fixated location and become harder to see.&lt;ref&gt;(Nazir, Heller &amp; Sussman, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frequency effects ==
The [[word frequency effect]] suggests that words that appear the most in printed language are easier to recognize than words that appear less frequently.&lt;ref name="Grainger"&gt;(Grainger, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of these words is faster and more accurate than other words. The word frequency effect is one of the most robust and most commonly reported effects in contemporary literature on word recognition. It has played a role in the development of many theories, such as the [[bouma shape]]. Furthermore, the neighborhood frequency effect states that word recognition is slower and less accurate when the target has an [[orthography|orthographic]] neighbor that is higher in frequency than itself. Orthographic neighbors are words of all the same length that differ by only one letter of that word.&lt;ref name="Grainger" /&gt;

== Real world applications ==

=== Inter-letter spacing ===
[[Serif font]]s, i.e.: fonts with small appendages at the end of strokes, hinder lexical access. Word recognition is quicker with [[sans-serif]] fonts by an average of 8 ms.&lt;ref name="MoretTatay"&gt;(Moret-Tatay &amp; Perea, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; These fonts have significantly more inter-letter spacing, and studies have shown that responses to words with increased inter-letter spacing were faster, regardless of word frequency and length.&lt;ref&gt;(Pereaa, Moret-Tataya &amp; Gomezc, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates an inverse relationship between fixation duration and small increases in inter-letter spacing,&lt;ref name="Perea"&gt;(Perea &amp; Gomez 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; most likely due to a reduction in lateral inhibition in the neural network.&lt;ref name="MoretTatay" /&gt; When letters are farther apart, it is more likely that individuals will focus their fixations at the beginning of words, whereas default letter spacing on word processing software encourages fixation at the center of words.&lt;ref name="Perea" /&gt;

=== Tools and measurements ===
Both PET and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) are used to study the activation of various parts of the brain while participants perform reading-based tasks.&lt;ref&gt;(Sereno &amp; Rayner, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) and [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) provide a more accurate temporal measurement by recording event-related potentials each millisecond. Though identifying where the electrical responses occur can be easier with an MEG, an EEG is a more pervasive form of research in word recognition. Event-related potentials help measure both the strength and the latency of brain activity in certain areas during readings. Furthermore, by combining the usefulness of event-related potentials with eye movement monitoring, researchers are able to correlate fixations during readings with word recognition in the brain in real-time. Since saccades and fixations are indicative of word recognition, [[electrooculography]] (EOG) is used to measure eye movements and the amount of time required for lexical access to target words. This has been demonstrated by studies in which longer, less common words induce longer fixations, and smaller, less important words may not be fixated on at all while reading a sentence.

=== Learning ===
According to the LINCS website, the role of word recognition results in differences between the habits of adults and the habits of children learning how to read.&lt;ref name="Kruidenier" /&gt; For non-literate adults learning to read, many rely more on word recognition than on phonics and word analysis. Poor readers with prior knowledge concerning the target words can recognize words and make fewer errors than poor readers with no prior knowledge.&lt;ref name="PriebeKeenan"&gt;(Priebe, Keenan &amp; Miller, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of blending sounds of individual letters, adult learners are more likely to recognize words automatically.&lt;ref name="Kruidenier" /&gt; However, this can lead to errors when a similarly spelled, yet different word, is mistaken for one the reader is familiar with.  Errors such as these are considered to be due to the learner's experiences and exposure. Younger and newer learners tend to focus more on the implications from the text and rely less on background knowledge or experience. Poor readers with prior knowledge utilize the semantic aspects of the word, whereas proficient readers rely on only graphic information for word recognition.&lt;ref name="PriebeKeenan" /&gt; However, practice and improved proficiency tend to lead to a more efficient use of combining reading ability and background knowledge for effective word recognition.&lt;ref name="Kruidenier" /&gt;

The role of the frequency effect has been greatly incorporated into the learning process.&lt;ref name="Kruidenier" /&gt; While the word analysis approach is extremely beneficial, many words defy regular grammatical structures and are more easily incorporated into the lexical memory by automatic word recognition. To facilitate this, many educational experts highlight the importance of repetition in word exposure. This utilizes the frequency effect by increasing the reader's familiarity with the target word, and thereby improving both future speed and accuracy in reading. This repetition can be in the form of flash cards, word-tracing, reading aloud, picturing the word, and other forms of practice that improve the association of the visual text with word recall.&lt;ref&gt;(Literacy Information and Communication System)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of technology ===
Improvements in technology have greatly contributed to advances in the understanding and research in word recognition.  New word recognition capabilities have made computer-based learning programs more effective and reliable.&lt;ref name="Kruidenier" /&gt; Improved technology has enabled eye-tracking, which monitors individuals' saccadic eye movements while they read. This has furthered understanding of how certain patterns of eye movement increases word recognition and processing. Furthermore, changes can be simultaneously made to text just outside the reader's area of focus without the reader being made aware. This has provided more information on where the eye focuses when an individual is reading and where the boundaries of attention lie.

With this additional information, researchers have proposed new models of word recognition that can be programmed into computers. As a result, computers can now mimic how a human would perceive and react to language and novel words.&lt;ref name="Kruidenier" /&gt;  This technology has advanced to the point where models of literacy learning can be digitally demonstrated. For example, a computer can now mimic a child's learning progress and induce general language rules when exposed to a list of words with only a limited number of explanations. Nevertheless, as no universal model has yet been agreed upon, the generalizability of word recognition models and its simulations may be limited.&lt;ref&gt;(Davis &amp; Mermelstein, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this lack of consensus regarding parameters in simulation designs, any progress in the area of word recognition is helpful to future research regarding which learning styles may be most successful in classrooms. Correlations also exist between reading ability, spoken language development, and learning disabilities. Therefore, advances in any one of these areas may assist understanding in inter-related subjects.&lt;ref&gt;(Scarborough, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the development of word recognition may facilitate the breakthrough between "learning to read" and "reading to learn".&lt;ref&gt;(Campbell, Kelly, Mullis, Martin &amp; Sainsbury, 2001, p.6)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10442">The '''Wordos''' is a [[writing circle|writing workshop]] based in [[Eugene, Oregon]], [[United States]]. Its members meet once a week to [[critic|critique]] stories and discuss the art, craft, and business of [[writing]]. It is a long-running [[speculative fiction]] critique group, and has a high concentration of [[publishing|published]] authors. However, having prior publishing credits is not a prerequisite to joining. The group has produced winners of the [[Galaxy Press]] international [[Writers of the Future]] contest six years in a row.&lt;ref name=RGMarch07&gt;{{cite news |last=McCowan |first=Karen |title=Eugene's bunch of Wordos continues to find success |url=http://www.registerguard.com/news/2007/03/21/a1.scificentral.0321.p1.php?section=cityregion |publisher=''[[The Register-Guard]]'' |date=March 21, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group promotes itself as a means to help writers produce [[fiction]] of salable quality, and to continually improve their writing abilities. The workshop's primary focus is on [[Short story|short]] speculative fiction, but members have had fiction of other lengths and genres critiqued.

==History==
Founded in 1987, "The Wordos" was originally called "The Eugene Professional Writers Workshops, Inc." The name was changed in 1995, to make it "shorter and friendlier." They kept the original name for business purposes, however.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wordos.com/faq/ |title = The Wordos FAQ |accessdate = 2007-09-20 |publisher = The Wordos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group meets weekly in a local bookstore.&lt;ref name=RGMarch07/&gt;

==Notable members==
The membership over time has included, [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] and fantasy novelist [[Nina Kiriki Hoffman]], [[Surrealism|surrealist]] short story writer and novelist [[Ray Vukcevich]], science fiction writers [[Kathy Oltion]] and [[Jerry Oltion]], [[Bruce Holland Rogers]], [[Patricia Briggs]], fiction and non-fiction writer [[Leslie What]], [[Jay Lake]], [[Eric M. Witchey]], [[Devon Monk]] and many others. Deborah Layne, a long-time member, is also the founder of [[Wheatland Press]], the award-winning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/2006.html |title = 2006 World Fantasy Awards Ballot |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |publisher = World Fantasy |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070722104054/http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/2006.html |archivedate = 2007-07-22 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; publisher of the ''Polyphony'' anthology.

==Method==
The Wordos follow the [[Clarion Workshop]] model of critiquing. A member reads a submitted story, writes comments on it, and then, on the evening of the workshop, speaks for one to three minutes offering those and other comments aloud. At the end of the evening the critiqued story is given back to the author.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

Members also report on news over the previous week, including accepted stories, rejections, and re-write requests from publishers.

==Awards==
A member of the Wordos has won or placed in the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] [[Writers of the Future]] contest consistently since 2001. There have also been several [[Nebula Award]]-winning workshop members and members who have been nominated for or won the [[Endeavour Award]], [[World Fantasy Award]], and [[Philip K. Dick Award]]. One member, Marshall Moseley, was a finalist in the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] television series "[[Project Greenlight]]".
