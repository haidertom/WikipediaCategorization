===Bachelor of Commerce===
The [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] of Commerce degree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/programmes/full-time/bachelor-of-commerce-bcom|title=Bachelor Of Commerce (Bcom) - Varsity College|website=www.varsitycollege.co.za|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831131853/https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/programmes/full-time/bachelor-of-commerce-bcom|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to provide students with a wide range of managerial skills, while building competence in a particular area of business (see aside). 
Most universities, therefore, plan the degree such that in addition to their [[academic major|major]], students are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting, finance, business management, human resources, marketing, and economics; some programs also require [[Business statistics|(business) statistics]], [[Business mathematics#University level|(introductory) calculus]] and information systems. 
Depending on the institution, a formal [[academic major]] may or may not be established. Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree requires students to take the majority of their courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others.

For a comparison with other business degrees, see [[Business education#Undergraduate education]].

===Honours Bachelor of Commerce===
The [[Honours degree|Honours]] Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com. (Hons) or B.Comm. (Hons) or H.B.Com. or H.B.Comm.) is further advanced. It may consist of a four-year program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucanwest.ca/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-commerce|title=Bachelor of Commerce Degree (Bcom)- University Canada West|website=ucanwest.ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807044341/https://ucanwest.ca/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-commerce|archivedate=2016-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoit.ca/ac-calendar/0506/EN/main/programs/103887/bcom_hons_92.html|title=Commerce - Bachelor of Commerce (Honours)|first=The University of Ontario Institute of|last=Technology|website=www.uoit.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of a one-year program taken subsequent to a three-year [[Bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/courses/Bachelor-of-Commerce-Honours |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226105318/http://sydney.edu.au/courses/Bachelor-of-Commerce-Honours |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree requires additional academic courses to be completed with higher academic performance standards and may also require a researched [[thesis]] component; the one-year program is often focused exclusively on a single subject-area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/|title=Qualifications|website=www.unisa.ac.za|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216065503/http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualifications/|archivedate=2014-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14711/honours_degree.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126230943/http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14711/honours_degree.html |archivedate=2015-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree often serves as an abridgement (or entry requirement) between the undergraduate program and postgraduate programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcom.unimelb.edu.au/about/honours|title=BCom Students - Faculty of Business and Economics|website=bcom.unimelb.edu.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316005629/http://www.bcom.unimelb.edu.au/about/honours/|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Master of Commerce]] (M.Com. or M.Comm.) and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degrees.

===Duration===
The [[curriculum]] generally lasts three years in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Malta]], [[South Africa]], some parts of [[Canada]] and [[Hong Kong]]. The curriculum requires four years of study in the [[Republic of Ireland]], the majority of [[Canada]], [[Ghana]], the [[Philippines]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In [[Nepal]], the duration of the program can be three years.

In [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and some universities in [[India]], the B.Com. (Hons) degree is considered an additional [[postgraduate]] qualification, whereas in [[Malta]], an additional year of study is not considered a postgraduate qualification. In [[Pakistan]], [http://pu.edu.pk/home/department/22/Hailey-College-of-Commerce] the B.Com. degree lasts two years, the B.Com. (Hons) degree lasts three years, and a four-year program leads to the BS (Hons) Commerce degree.

==History==
:''See: [[Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)|Birmingham Business School#History and background]].''&lt;!--{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}} --&gt;
The Bachelor of Commerce degree was first offered at the [[University of Birmingham]]. The [[Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)|University's School of Commerce]] was founded by [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]], an Englishman from [[Oxford University]], who was the first professor of Political Economy and Constitutional History in the Faculty of Arts at the [[University of Toronto]]. Ashley left Toronto in 1892, spent a few years at [[Harvard University]], and then went back to England to the new University of Birmingham where he founded the School of Commerce.  Ashley began the program which was the forerunner of many other B.Com. degree programs throughout the [[British Empire]].

Eighteenth-century economists had divided the English economy into three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Commerce included the transportation, marketing and financing of goods. The Birmingham program in Commerce included economic geography, economic history, general economics, modern languages, and accountancy.

He studied Electromechanical Engineering and Economics and Finance at the [[University of Texas]] in United States. Marinkovic is important in the Oilseeds Industry in Bolivia since 2000 and is president of the Federation of Private Entrepreneurs since 2004 and vice chairman of Banco Económico. He was also elected prefect of the Civic Committee of the [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]] in 2006.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

Marinkovic is an opponent of President [[Evo Morales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia’s Leader Says States’ Dispute Can Be Resolved|publisher=''The New York Times''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/world/americas/20bolivia.html?ref=world|date=20 December 2007|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the documentary, ''Who is Branko Marinkovic'', which aired on Bolivian national television, Marinkovic is depicted as pro- [[Ustaše]], although his father reportedly was as a member of the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. In that same documentary, Marinkovic is shown as a citzen of the [[Republic of Croatia]], which committed war crimes during both World War II and the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name=pd/&gt;

In December 2010, Bolivia's prosecutor has filed charges against 39 people, including Marinkovic, for the last year's alleged plot, whose aim was to kill Evo Morales and start an armed rebellion. Marinkovic, and other leading opposition leaders argued that in no way they are associated with the plot. Marinkovic was forced to exile in the [[United States]] while fearing for his life. He claims his innocence and has said; ''Bolivian government pursues me and forced me to live outside my beloved Bolivia, because in Bolivia my life would be threatened. I have no guarantees that I would be allowed a fair trial.''&lt;ref name=vl/&gt;

The '''Buenos Aires [[Central Business District]]''' is the main commercial centre of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], though not an official [[Barrios and Communes of Buenos Aires|city ward]]. While the ''[[Neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires|barrios]]'' of [[Puerto Madero]] and [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] house important business complexes and modern high-rise architecture, the area traditionally known as '''''Microcentro''''' (Spanish: Microcenter) is located within [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|San Nicolás]] and [[Monserrat, Buenos Aires|Monserrat]], roughly coinciding with the area around the historic center of the [[Plaza de Mayo]]. The ''Microcentro'' has a wide concentration of offices, service companies and banks, and a large circulation of pedestrians on working days. Another name given to this unofficial ''barrio'' is '''''La City''''', which refers more precisely to an even smaller sector within the ''Microcentro'', where almost all the banking headquarters of the country are concentrated.

==Overview==

The area was the site of the first [[Pedro de Mendoza|European settlement]] in what later became Buenos Aires. Its south-north axis runs along [[Leandro Alem Avenue]], from [[Avenida Belgrano|Belgrano Avenue]] in the south to [[Retiro railway station]] in the north, and its east-west axis runs from the [[Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve]] to [[Nueve de Julio Avenue|Ninth of July Avenue]]. The district is centered around the [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|San Nicolás]] ward, and includes the northern section of [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]], the section of [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] south of [[Santa Fe Avenue]], and the section of [[Puerto Madero]] west of the [[Buenos Aires Docklands]].

The district is the financial, corporate, and cultural hub of Buenos Aires, and of Argentina. The economy of Buenos Aires was the 13th largest among the world's cities in 2006 at US$245 billion in [[purchasing power parity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2005.html City Mayors]&lt;/ref&gt;  which, based on the population of that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/4/EPHcont_3trim05.pdf# |title=INDEC |access-date=2009-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325001525/http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/4/EPHcont_3trim05.pdf# |archive-date=2009-03-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; translates into US21,500 per capita. The Buenos Aires [[Human Development Index]] (0.925 in 1998) is likewise high by international standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desarrollohumano.org.ar/IDHArgentina/98_nac/98_nac.html 'Informe Argentino Sobre Desarrollo Humano'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009000000/http://www.desarrollohumano.org.ar/IDHArgentina/98_nac/98_nac.html |date=October 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Port of Buenos Aires]] is one of the busiest in South America; navigable rivers by way of the [[Río de la Plata]] connect the port to [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|northeastern Argentina]], Brazil, [[Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay]]. As a result, it serves as the distribution hub for a vast area of the south-eastern region of the South American continent. Tax collection related to the port has caused many political problems in the past.

==Geography==
Buenos Aires CBD lies in the [[Pampa|Pampa region]], except some zones like the [[Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve]], the [[Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors (football) Club]] "sports city", [[Jorge Newbery Airport]], the [[Puerto Madero]] neighborhood and the main port itself. These latter were all built on [[reclaimed land]] along the coast of the [[Rio de la Plata]] (the world's largest [[estuary]]).

The region was formerly crossed by different [[Stream|creeks]] and [[lagoon]]s, some of which were refilled and other tubed. Among the most important creeks are: Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cildañez and White. In 1908 many creeks were channeled and rectified, as floods  were damaging the city's infrastructure. Starting in 1919, most creeks were enclosed. Notably, the Maldonado was tubed in 1954, and currently runs below Juan B. Justo Avenue (north of this district).

Facing the [[Río de la Plata]] estuary, the frontage remained flood-prone, and in 1846, Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] had a contention wall six blocks long built along the existing promenade. An [[English Argentine]] investor, Edward Taylor, opened a pier along the promenade in 1855, and the flood-control walls were extended northwards to [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]], and south to [[San Telmo]], in subsequent works completed in 1865.&lt;ref name=bue&gt;[http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/ciudad/historico/calendario/destacado.php?menu_id=23203&amp;ide=216 Buenos Aires.gov: Paseo de Julio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531180343/http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/ciudad/historico/calendario/destacado.php?menu_id=23203&amp;ide=216 |date=2011-05-31 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sudden economic and population boom led the new President of Argentina, [[Julio Roca]], to commission the development in 1881 of an ambitious port to supplement the recently developed facilities at [[La Boca]], in Buenos Aires's southside. Approved by the [[Argentine Congress]] in 1882 and financed by the prominent London-based [[Barings Bank]] (the chief underwriter of Argentine bonds and investment, at the time), the project required the [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] of over 200 hectares (500 acres) of underwater land and was accompanied by the widening of the promenade into what became Leandro Alem Avenue.&lt;ref name=historia&gt;[http://www.puertomaderocancun.com/History.htm Puerto Madero: history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923162459/http://www.puertomaderocancun.com/History.htm |date=2009-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Buenos Aires Décembre 2007 - Avenida 5 de Mayo.jpg|thumb|260px|Diagonal Norte Avenue]]

[[Italian culture|Italian]] and [[French culture|French]] influences increased  after the [[Battle of Caseros|overthrow]] of strongman [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in 1852, and particularly upon the advent of the modernizing [[Generation of '80|Generation of 1880]]. [[French architecture]] inspired the area's redevelopment during the beginning of the 20th century, and [[Eclecticist architeture|eclectic designs]] that drew from [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], [[French Academy]], and [[Second Empire architecture]] were reflected by numerous historic buildings in this districts from the era, notably the headquarters for ''[[Buenos Aires House of Culture|La Prensa]]'', [[Buenos Aires City Hall|City Hall]], the [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|City Legislature]], [[Buenos Aires Customs]], [[Argentine Supreme Court|Palace of Justice]], the [[Argentine Congress|National Congress]], the [[Teatro Colón]], the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]], the [[Buenos Aires Central Post Office]], and along most of the [[Avenida de Mayo]] and [[Diagonal Norte]] Avenue.
Some of the most prominent contributors to the district's architecture from the era included [[Francesco Tamburini]], [[Vittorio Meano]], [[Julio Dormal]], [[Virginio Colombo]], [[Juan Antonio Buschiazzo]], [[Mario Palanti]], and [[Francisco Gianotti]]. Later significant additions include those by [[Alejandro Christophersen]], [[Alejandro Bustillo]] (most notably the [[Banco de la Nación Argentina|National Bank]]), [[Andrés Kalnay]], [[Eduardo Le Monnier]], and [[Francisco Salamone]].

The [[Alas Building]], commissioned by [[Juan Perón]] and built in the early 1950s, was the tallest in Argentina until 1995, and was one of numerous commercial structures built in the [[Rationalist architecture|Rationalist]] style in this area during that time. Since the 1960s, newer, high-technology buildings were designed in the district by Argentine architects [[Clorindo Testa]], Santiago Sánchez Elía, [[César Pelli]], and [[Mario Roberto Álvarez]], by firms such as [[SEPRA Arquitectos]] and [[MSGSSS]], and by Uruguayan architect [[Rafael Viñoly]]. Some of the more notable commercial developments completed since then have included the [[Catalinas Norte]] [[office park]], [[Torre Bouchard]], [[Bouchard Plaza]], [[Galicia Financial Group|Galicia Tower]], the [[Repsol-YPF tower|Repsol-YPF Tower]], the [[Banco Macro|Banco Macro Tower]], and the [[Torre BBVA (Buenos Aires)|BBVA Tower]] .

== Districts ==

=== San Nicolás===
[[File:Reconquista hacia el norte.JPG|left|thumb|200px|[[Reconquista Street]], in the area's financial center]]
'''San Nicolás''' is one of the districts that shares most of the city and national government structure with neighboring [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]], and is home of the business district's financial center. It's seldom referred to as ''San Nicolás'', but usually as '''''The Center''''' ("City Centre"), and the part east of the [[9 de Julio Avenue]] is called ''Microcentro'' ("Micro-centre").

The growing importance of the area as a financial center was highlighted by the 1854 establishment of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]]. San Nicolás remains the financial center of Argentina, something underscored by the presence of the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] and the [[Banco de la Nacion Argentina|National Bank]], Argentina's largest. The rapid development of the [[Economic history of Argentina|Argentine economy]] after 1875 made itself evident in San Nicolás with the reclaiming of riverfront land by businessmen [[Francisco Seeber]] and [[Eduardo Madero]], and the shore hitherto popular among washerwomen became the ''Paseo de Julio'' (today [[Leandro Alem Avenue]]).

The construction of [[Corrientes Avenue|Corrientes]] and [[Nueve de Julio Avenue]]s in the 1930s further modernized San Nicolás, which had hitherto been limited in its development by its colonial grid of narrow streets. [[Florida Street]], most of which is in San Nicolás, is the city's best-known [[pedestrianized street]].&lt;ref name=bnic&gt;[http://www.barriada.com.ar/sannicolas.htm Barriada: San Nicolás] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most discernible landmark is the [[Galerías Pacífico]] [[shopping arcade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buenosaires-argentina.com/neighborhoods/microcentro.html Buenos Aires Neighborhoods - Microcentro]&lt;/ref&gt;

The district is home to the [[Argentine Supreme Court]], the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]], the [[Teatro Colón|Colón Opera House]], headquarters of numerous leading Argentine firms, including [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]], the [[Bank of the City of Buenos Aires]], ''[[La Nación]]'', [[Bunge y Born]], [[Gregorio Pérez Companc|Pérez Companc]], the [[Francisco Macri|Macri Group]], and most of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]] leaders, as well as the local offices of a number of international companies, such as [[BankBoston]], [[BBVA Banco Francés|BBVA]], [[Citibank Argentina|Citibank]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[HSBC Bank Argentina|HSBC]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Banco Santander Río|Santander Bank]], and [[Techint]].&lt;ref name=bnic/&gt;

=== Retiro ===
[[File:Leandro Alem Buenos Aires 37.jpg|thumb|260px|Leandro Alem Avenue]]
Retiro is one of the largest hubs of transportation services in Argentina.  Local and long distance rail service heading to the north originate from [[Estación Retiro]] (Retiro Terminal Station), and [[Retiro bus station]] is the city's main long-distance bus terminal. [[Line C (Buenos Aires)|''Subte'' line C]] of the [[Buenos Aires Metro]] system and numerous local public bus services serve Retiro, and this area is always teeming with commuters and traffic on weekdays.

The most important avenue linking Retiro and the CBD to commuters living in residential areas to the north is [[Avenida del Libertador]], which becomes [[Leandro Alem Avenue]] past the Retiro Station. Other important thoroughfares in the Retiro section of the CBD are [[Avenida Córdoba|Córdoba]], [[Santa Fe Avenue|Santa Fe]], and [[9 de Julio Avenue]]s.

The high-rise business district of ''[[Catalinas Norte]]'', as well as the northern end of the Puerto Madero development, is located east of Leandro N. Alem Avenue. Opposite the Retiro train terminal, at the northern end of the CBD, is the leafy [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]], surrounded by great palaces and hotels. The Retiro lowlands were once the training grounds for [[José de San Martín]]'s ''[[Granaderos a caballo|Granaderos]]'' corps,  and the modern-day Plaza San Martín features an [[equestrian statue]] honoring the hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], as well as a memorial for the dead in the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. Facing the station is Argentine Air Force Square, where the ''[[Torre Monumental]]'' (formerly ''Torre de los Ingleses''), a monument donated by the [[Anglo-Argentine]] community for the 1910 centennial celebrations, is located.&lt;ref name=bret&gt;[http://www.barriada.com.ar/retiro.htm Barriada: Retiro] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant landmarks opposite the Plaza are the [[Kavanagh Building]], a [[reinforced concrete]] structure that when completed in 1936, was the tallest building in Latin America at {{convert|120|m|ft|0}}. The nearby [[Brunetta Building]] (formerly headquarters for [[Olivetti]]'s Latin American operations) was the first in Argentina to be built in the [[International style (architecture)|International style]].&lt;ref name=bret/&gt;

=== Montserrat ===
'''Montserrat''' is located south of San Nicolás. The section of the Montserrat ward within the business district includes some of the most important buildings in [[Argentine Government]] and [[Argentine history|history]], and was the site of the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]], the colonial town hall.
[[File:Buenos_Aires_Subte_station_Peru.jpg|left|thumb|260px|City Hall and the Avenue of May]]
[[Avenida de Mayo|Avenue of May]] runs through the Montserrat district, connecting [[Plaza de Mayo|May Square]] and [[Congressional Plaza]]. A block or two south of the Plaza de Mayo, the older section of Montserrat begins. This was the location of the [[Illuminated Block]], a [[Jesuit]] center of higher learning during the 18th century, and today home to the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]]. This is Buenos Aires's oldest neighborhood and even today, very little of the cityscape there is less than a hundred years old (except along Belgrano Avenue), thereby making a nearly seamless transition to the likewise historic [[San Telmo]] district to the south.&lt;ref name=bmon&gt;[http://www.barriada.com.ar/montserrat.htm Barriada: Montserrat] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district's led central location and its presence therein of much of Argentina's governmental structure led to monumental construction over the 1910s, notable among which are the [[Casa Rosada|Pink House]], [[Buenos Aires City Hall|City Hall]], the [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|City Legislature]], the [[Buenos Aires Customs|Customs building]], the offices of ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'' (today the [[Buenos Aires House of Culture]]), the art-deco [[NH City Hotel]] (off the Plaza de Mayo), the [[Libertador Building]] (Ministry of Defense), and South Diagonal Avenue. Montserrat's western half was partitioned from the rest by the southward expansion of the massive [[Nueve de Julio Avenue]] around 1950.

The area became a largely bohemian quarter popular with [[Argentine tango|tango]] performers and artists, as well as many who preferred the area's close proximity to the growing [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|financial district]] to the north and its relatively low rent scale. Its rich architectural history and quiet, narrow streets have, as in neighboring [[San Telmo]], helped lead to renewed [[Tourism in Argentina|tourist]] interest in Montserrat since around 1990.&lt;ref name=bmon/&gt;

=== Puerto Madero===
[[File:Buenos Aires - Puerto Madero 142.jpg|thumb|260px|Puerto Madero]]
'''Puerto Madero''' occupies a significant portion of the [[Maritime dock|docklands]] and, as the newest of Buenos Aires's 48 boroughs, features the latest architectural trends in Argentina.

Originally developed by local businessman [[Eduardo Madero]] and designed by British engineer Sir [[John Hawkshaw]], Puerto Madero was inaugurated in 1897. Its four docks were relegated to ancillary port functions after the 1926 completion of the New Port to the north, however, and became derelict. Beginning around 1994, however, local and foreign investment led to a massive revitalization effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side warehouses into upscale offices, [[lofts]], restaurants, private universities and luxurious hotels. State-of-the-art multiplex cinemas, theatres, cultural centres, luxurious hotels and office and corporate buildings are located mostly in the eastern side of the district.&lt;ref name=bpm&gt;[http://www.barriada.com.ar/pmadero.htm Barriada: Puero Madero] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Madero has been redeveloped with international flair, drawing interest from renown architects such as [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[César Pelli]] and [[Philippe Starck]], among others. Today one of the trendiest boroughs in Buenos Aires, it has become the preferred address for growing numbers of young professionals and retirees, alike. Increasing property prices have also generated interest in the area as a destination for foreign buyers, particularly those in the market for premium investment properties.

The neighborhood's road network has been entirely rebuilt, especially in the east side. The layout of the east side consists currently of three wide boulevards running east-west crossed by the east side's main street, Juana Manso Avenue. The layout is completed with some other avenues and minor streets, running both east-west and north-south, and by several pedestrianised streets. All the streets of Puerto Madero are named after [[Women in Argentina|women]]. The [[Puente de la Mujer]] (Women's Bridge), designed in 2001 by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], is the newest link between the east and west docks of Puerto Madero.&lt;ref name=bpm/&gt;

Puerto Madero represents the largest wide-scale urban project in the city of Buenos Aires, currently. Having undergone an impressive revival in merely a decade, it is one of the most successful recent waterfront renewal projects in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Breen and Dick Rigby, ''The New Waterfront: A Worldwide Urban Success Story'' – McGraw-Hill Professional&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous new residential high-rises of up to 50 stories have been built facing on the eastern half of Puerto Madero since 2000.  These include [[El Mirador of Puerto Madero towers]], [[Renoir Towers]], [[El Faro towers]], [[Chateau Tower of Puerto Madero]], and the [[Mulieris towers]], among others. Notable non-residential structures include the [[Repsol-YPF tower]], the [[Hilton Buenos Aires]], the [[Faena Hotel+Universe]] (one of a number of refurbished former [[Molinos Río de la Plata]] silos), and the [[Fortabat Art Collection]] museum building.

[[File:BMW RS 54, Gespann von Deubel-Hörner cropped.JPG|thumb|Dell'Orto carburettors, as used on BMW Rennsport 500cc sidecar outfit engines during the 1950s and 1960s]]'''Dell'Orto''' is an Italian company, headquartered in [[Cabiate]], specialized in the construction of [[carburetors]] and [[electronic injection]] systems. The company was founded in 1933 as "Società anonima Gaetano Dell'Orto e figli" (Gaetano Dell’Orto and Sons) but actually only founded by Gaetano's sons, Luigi Piero and Giuseppe. The first production was carburetors for motorbikes. Right before World War II the company started producing carburetors with aluminum body, for competitive racing. Under the second Dell'Orto generation, towards the end of the 60s, the company began producing [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] carburetors for the [[Fiat]] group, as well as other Italian and foreign manufacturers (i.e.Flandria, Belgium). At the end of the 1980s,
under the supervision of Luigi Dell'Orto (son of Gaetano), the company's first injection systems were released.  In 2006 the company expanded on the Indian market, opening Dell'Orto India. In September 2009  Dell’Orto India Private Limited, founded in 2006 with the cooperation of a local partner, becomes 100% Italian and fully owned by the Dell’Orto family. In 2011 Dellorto decided to establish a new technical and commercial site in China, named Dell’Orto Shanghai trading company. In 2018, Dellorto signed  a strategic joint venture with [[Varroc|VARROC]]  to develop Fuel injection systems for the Indian market and worldwide. 

After three generations, the Company is still fully owned by the Dell'Orto family, with Giuseppe Dell'Orto as President of the Company and [http://www.andrea-dell-orto.it/ Andrea Dell'Orto] as Executive Vice President and Chairman of Dellorto India Private Ltd. 

Dellorto works with the Grand Prix motorcycle racing, with Gilera, Aprilia, BMW, Kawasaki and many others. Dellorto produces mechanical throttle bodies, electronic throttle bodies, variable intake systems, compressor by-pass valves, exhaust management parts, electronic control units, carburetors, fuel systems, sensors/ actuators and after market products.

The company is today one of the worldwide leaders in its field and is present in the [[Road Racing World Championship]]. It is also used in every [[Derbi]], [[Aprilia]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] 50cc model.

The '''Department of Education and Skills''' ({{lang-ga|An Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna}}) is a [[Department of State (Ireland)|department]] of the [[Government of Ireland]]. It is led by the [[Minister for Education and Skills]] who is assisted by two [[Minister of State (Ireland)|Ministers of State]].

==Departmental team==
The official headquarters and ministerial offices of the department are at [[Marlborough Street, Dublin|Marlborough Street]], [[Dublin 1]]. The departmental team consists of the following:
*[[Minister for Education and Skills]]: [[Joe McHugh]], [[Teachta Dála|TD]]
**Minister of State for Training and Skills: [[John Halligan (politician)|John Halligan]], TD
**Minister of State for Higher Education: [[Mary Mitchell O'Connor]], TD
*Secretary General of the Department: Seán Ó Foghlú

==Departmental Overview==
The mission of the Department of Education and Skills is to provide high-quality education which will enable individuals to achieve their full potential and to participate fully as members of society, and contribute to Ireland's social, cultural and economic development.  Chief among the Department's priorities are:

*the promotion of equity and inclusion, quality outcomes and lifelong learning
*planning for education that is relevant to personal, social, cultural and economic needs
*enhancement of the capacity of the Department for service delivery, policy formulation, research and evaluation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29140">{{diamond}}
'''Diamond clarity''' is the quality of [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamonds]] that relates to the existence and visual appearance of internal characteristics of a diamond called ''inclusions'', and surface defects, called ''blemishes''. Clarity is one of the '''four Cs''' of diamond grading, the others being [[Carat (unit)|carat]], [[diamond color|color]], and [[diamond cut|cut]].

[[Inclusion (mineral)|Inclusions]] are solids, liquids, or gases that were trapped in a mineral as it formed. They may be crystals of a foreign material or even another diamond crystal, or may have produced structural imperfections, such as tiny cracks that make a diamond appear whitish or cloudy. The number, size, color, relative location, orientation, and visibility of inclusions can all affect the relative clarity of a diamond. A clarity grade is assigned based on the overall appearance of the stone under ten times magnification.

Most inclusions present in gem-quality diamonds do not affect the diamonds' performance or structural integrity and are not visible to the naked eyes. However, large clouds can affect a diamond's ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close to or breaking the surface may reduce a diamond's resistance to fracture.

Diamonds with higher clarity grades are more valued, with the exceedingly rare "Flawless" graded diamond fetching the highest price. Minor inclusions or blemishes are useful, as they can be used as unique identifying marks analogous to [[fingerprint]]s. In addition, as [[synthetic diamond]] technology improves and distinguishing between natural and synthetic diamonds becomes more difficult, inclusions or blemishes can be used as proof of natural origin.

==Inclusions and blemishes==
{{main|Diamond flaws}}
There are several types of inclusions and blemishes, which affect a diamond's clarity to varying degrees. Features resulting from [[diamond enhancement]] procedures, such as laser lines, are also considered inclusions or blemishes.

===Inclusions===
*Clouds
*Feathers
*Included crystals or minerals
*Knots
*Cavities
*Cleavage
*Bearding
*Internal graining
*Pinpoint
*Laser lines
*Twinning Wisp
*Grain center
*Laser drill hole
*Knot
*Needle
The diamond industry uses the term "internal characteristics" instead of "inclusions". For natural diamonds, the "internal characteristics" in the diamond are growth crystals that give the diamond its character and unique fingerprint. When diamonds are graded, they are magnified at 10x power.

===Blemishes===
*Polish lines
*Grain boundaries
*Naturals
*Scratches
*Nicks
*Pits
*Chips
*Breaks
*Dark spots
*Light spots
*Abrasions

==Clarity grading==

===Gemological Institute of America grading system===

====History====
In 1952, [[Richard T. Liddicoat]], along with [[Marquis Person]], Joe Phillips, [[Robert Crowningshield]] and [[Bert Krashes]] began to work on a new diamond grading system which they called the "diamond grading and evaluation appraisal".&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; In 1953, they released their new system which assessed three aspects of diamonds; make, color and clarity.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; They took terminology used in the industry at the time and refined the definitions to produce a clarity scale by which diamonds could be consistently graded.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; The system at that time contained nine grades: Flawless, VVS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, VVS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, VS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, VS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SI&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, SI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; The 'I' of the I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; grades originally stood for "Imperfect".&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

During the 1970s, two changes were made to the system. Firstly, the ''Internally Flawless'' grade was added, as GIA noticed that many diamonds were being aggressively cut to remove any surface blemishes, and thereby reducing the cutting quality ("make") of the diamonds.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; The ''Internally Flawless'' grade gave diamond manufacturers a choice to leave blemishes on the surface of the stone, and achieve a grade higher than VVS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt; The second change made to the grading system was the introduction of the I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; grade. This change was made in response to a growing number of diamonds of very low clarity being cut.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

The last change to the clarity grading system took place in the 1990s when the term "imperfect" was changed to "included".&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

The GIA diamond grading scale is divided into six categories and eleven grades.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity&gt;"Diamonds and Diamond Grading" course material - Book 11, Grading Clarity, Gemological Institute of America, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The clarity categories and grades are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Naturski|first1=Sebastian|title=Diamond Clarity|url=http://yourdiamondteacher.com/diamond-4cs/clarity/|website=Your Diamond Teacher|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Flawless''''' category (FL) diamonds have no inclusions or blemishes visible under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904001054/https://www.gia.edu/library/4286/6278/faq_detail_page.cfm |url=http://www.gia.edu/library/4286/6278/faq_detail_page.cfm |archivedate= September 4, 2006|title=What is the GIA Clarity Scale for diamonds? |work= GIA Library  |accessdate= December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Internally Flawless''''' category (IF) diamonds have no inclusions visible under 10x magnification, only small blemishes on the diamond surface.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt;
*'''''Very, Very Slightly Included''''' category (VVS) diamonds have minute inclusions that are difficult for a skilled grader to see under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt; The VVS category is divided into two grades; VVS1 denotes a higher clarity grade than VVS2. Pinpoints and needles set the grade at VVS.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;
*'''''Very Slightly Included''''' category (VS) diamonds have minor inclusions that are difficult to somewhat easy for a trained grader to see when viewed under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt; The VS category is divided into two grades; VS1 denotes a higher clarity grade than VS2. Typically the inclusions in VS diamonds are invisible without magnification; however, infrequently some VS2 inclusions may still be visible. An example would be on a large emerald cut diamond which has a small inclusion under the corner of the table.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;
*'''''Slightly Included''''' category (SI) diamonds have noticeable inclusions that are easy to very easy for a trained grader to see when viewed under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt; The SI category is divided into two grades; SI1 denotes a higher clarity grade than SI2. These may or may not be noticeable to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Pagel"/&gt;
*'''''Included''''' category (I) diamonds have obvious inclusions that are clearly visible to a trained grader under 10x magnification.&lt;ref name=GIAclarityonline/&gt; Included diamonds have inclusions that are usually visible without magnification or have inclusions that threaten the durability of the stone. The I category is divided into three grades; I1 denotes a higher clarity grade than I2, which in turn is higher than I3. Inclusions in I1 diamonds often are seen by the unaided eye. I2 inclusions are easily seen, while I3 diamonds have large and extremely easy to see inclusions that typically impact the brilliance of the diamond, as well as having inclusions that are often likely to threaten the structure of the diamond.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

=====GIA clarity grading procedure=====
GIA clarity grading is performed under 10x magnification with darkfield illumination. The GIA Laboratory uses as standard equipment binocular stereo microscopes which are able to zoom to higher magnifications. These microscopes are equipped with darkfield illumination, as well as an ultraviolet filtered overhead light. When grading is performed using a 10x handheld loupe, darkfield illumination is more difficult to achieve. The grader must use a light source in such a way that the base of the stone is lit from the side, and the crown of the stone is shielded from the light.

After thoroughly cleaning the diamond, the diamond is picked up using tweezers in a girdle-to-girdle hold. The grader views the diamond for the first time through the table, studying the culet area of the stone for inclusions. The diamond is then set down and picked up with the tweezers in a table-to-culet hold. In this position, the diamond can be studied from the pavilion side, and the crown side, examining the diamond through each facet for inclusions. Once a sector of the diamond has been thoroughly examined, the grader rotates the diamond in the tweezer, so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The grader uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both. If the grader is using a stereo microscope, she may zoom in to a higher magnification to make closer observations of an inclusion, but then return to 10x magnification to make an assessment of its impact on the clarity grade.&lt;ref name="GIAManual"/&gt;

If a stereo binocular microscope has been used, a final assessment using a 10x loupe is performed before the final judgment is made on the clarity of the stone. The grader first decides the clarity category of the diamond: none (FL, or IF for a blemish), minute (VVS), minor (VS), noticeable (SI), or obvious (I). The decision is then made on the grade of the diamond.&lt;ref name="GIAManual"&gt;''Diamond Grading: Lab Manual'' Gemological Institute of America, Carlsbad, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gia.edu/lab-reports-services/diamonds/index.html |title=How GIA Grades Diamonds|publisher=Gia.edu |date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319064538/http://www.gia.edu/lab-reports-services/diamonds/index.html|archivedate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grading systems by other organizations===
The clarity grading system developed by the GIA has been used throughout the industry as well as by other diamond grading agencies including the [[American Gemological Society]] (AGS), and the [[International Gemological Institute]] (IGI). There are other smaller labs which use the GIA system as well.  These grading agencies base their clarity grades on the characteristics of inclusions visible to a trained professional when a diamond is viewed from above under 10x [[magnification]].

The [[World Jewellery Confederation]] developed the ''International Clarity Scale'' for grading diamonds. This clarity scale mirrors the GIA grading scale, except nomenclature varies. The system names these clarity grades; Loupe Clean, Very, very small inclusions (VVS1 and VVS2), Very small inclusions (VS1 and VS2), Small inclusions (SI1 and SI2), Pique (P1, P2, and P3).

Clarity grading by WJC standards is by examination using a 10x [[achromatic lens|achromatic]], [[aplanatic]] loupe in normal light.&lt;ref name="Pagel"/&gt;

The American Gem Society grades clarity on a number scale between 0 and 10. These numbers grades correlate almost exactly with the GIA system, but with some differences. The flawless and internally flawless (0) grades are grouped together with notation defining whether the stone is free from external blemishes, the VVS through SI grades are numbered 1 through 6, and then there are four grades 7 through 10 for the included category.&lt;ref name="TheAGSWay"/&gt;

Clarity grading by AGS standards requires examination using a binocular stereo microscope equipped with adjustable zoom magnification and darkfield illumination.&lt;ref name="TheAGSWay"&gt;''The AGS Way: Diamond Grading Standards'' American Gem Society, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Gemological Laboratory]] (EGL) introduced the SI3 as a clarity grade. While intended as a range to include borderline SI2 / I1 stones, it is now commonly used to mean I1's which are "eye clean", that is, which have inclusions which are not obviously visible to the naked eye.

==Clarity grading considerations==
All grades reflect the appearance to an experienced grader when viewed from above at 10x magnification, though higher magnifications and viewing from other angles are used during the grading process. The grader studies the diamond for internal characteristics and judges them on the basis of five clarity factors: size, number, position, nature, and color or relief. The clarity grade is assessed on the basis of the most noticeable inclusions, the so-called "grade setting inclusions". Less significant inclusions are ignored for the purposes of setting the grade; however, they may still be plotted onto a diamond plot chart.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

Accurate clarity grading as with other grading steps must be done with the diamond "loose", i.e. not set into any mounting. Inclusions are often difficult to see from the crown side of the diamond, and may be concealed by the setting.

===Size===
The first clarity factor which is assessed is a clarity characteristic's size. Larger characteristics are typically more noticeable under magnification, thereby placing the diamond into a lower clarity grade.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

===Number===
The second clarity factor which is assessed is the number of clarity characteristics. Generally, the more characteristics, the lower the clarity grade. This assessment is made by judging how readily they can be seen, not by the actual number of characteristics.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

===Position===
The third clarity factor which is assessed is the characteristic's position. When an inclusion is directly under the table of the diamond it is most visible. An inclusion under the table and positioned close to a pavilion facet will reflect multiple times around the stone, giving this type of inclusion the name "reflector". Reflectors are graded as if each reflection were an inclusion (although in plotting the diamond it is only plotted once). For this reason, reflectors have a greater impact on the clarity grade. Inclusions become less visible when they are positioned under the crown facets, or near the girdle of the stone. These inclusions may often be more easily seen from the pavilion side of the diamond than from crown side of the diamond.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

Additionally, the position of large feathers, knots and included crystals positioned where they extend to the girdle or crown of the stone affect the clarity grade. Diamonds worn in jewelry typically will withstand breakage, however inclusions of this nature and in these positions can pose a risk for further extension of the break in the structure of the diamond. Inclusions that are judged to pose at least a moderate risk of breakage to the stone are graded in the ''Included'' category.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

===Nature===
The fourth clarity factor which is assessed is a characteristic's nature. The characteristic's nature determines whether it is internal (extending into the stone) or external (limited to the surface of the stone). Internal characteristics automatically exclude the diamond from the ''Flawless'', and ''Internally Flawless'' categories. External characteristics exclude the diamond from the ''Flawless'' category.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

An internal characteristic of a diamond may be classified as a(n): bruise, cavity, chip, cleavage, cloud, crystal, feather, grain center, indented natural, internal graining, knot, laser drill hole, needle, pinpoint, or twinning wisp.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

An external characteristic of a diamond may be classified as a(n): abrasion, natural, nick, pit, polish lines, polish mark, scratch, surface graining, or extra facet.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

The nature will also determine whether an inclusion poses a risk to the stone. An inclusion that may cause a break in the crystal structure (included crystal, feather, knot, and cleavage) may, depending on its position, pose a moderate level of risk for further breakage.&lt;ref name=GIAClarity/&gt;

===Color or relief===
The fifth clarity factor which is assessed is the color and relief of clarity characteristics. Characteristics that contrast with the surrounding diamond are said to have "relief". The degree to which this color and relief is noticeable affects the clarity grade of the diamond. Colored inclusions invariably show contrast and are more easily seen. An exception is a black pinpoint inclusion, which is often more difficult to see than a white pinpoint.&lt;ref    name=GIAClarity/&gt;

== Rarity and value ==
Diamonds become increasingly rare when considering higher clarity gradings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diamond Clarity |work= Blue Nile|url=http://www.bluenile.com/diamonds/diamond-clarity|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 20% of all diamonds mined have a clarity rating high enough for the diamond to be considered appropriate for use as a gemstone; the other 80% are relegated to industrial use. Of that top 20%, a significant portion contains an inclusion or inclusions that are visible to the naked eye upon close inspection.

The most expensive gem diamonds fall within the VS and SI grades with FL, IF, and even VVS stones commanding significant premiums. FL and IF stones are sometimes referred to as "museum quality" or "investment grade" to denote their rarity{{according to whom|date=November 2012}} although the term "investment grade" is misleading as diamonds have historically been [[liquidity|illiquid]] and questionable stores of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|title=Have You Ever Tried to Sell a Diamond|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/|work=The Atlantic, Feb 1982|publisher=Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many diamond purchases are infrequent (e.g. engagement rings), there is a level of concern{{clarify|date=August 2017}} by [[end consumer]]s having to pay large premiums for clarity grade differences that are important to the certificate or diamond industry, but not to the buying public, who generally cannot discern the difference with the naked eye.

== Clarity enhancement ==
{{main|Diamond enhancement}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}

Laser "drilling" involves using a laser to burn a hole to a colored inclusion, followed by acid washing to remove the coloring agent. The clarity grade is the grade after the treatment. The treatment is considered permanent.

Clarity can also be "enhanced" by filling the fracture much like a car windshield crack can be treated. Such diamonds are sometimes called "[[Diamond enhancement#Fracture filling|fracture filled]] diamonds". Reputable vendors must disclose this filling and reputable filling companies use filling agents which show a flash of color, commonly orange or pink, when viewed closely. There is a significant price discount for fracture-filled diamonds. The GIA will not grade fracture-filled diamonds, in part because the treatment is not as permanent as the diamond itself. Reputable companies often provide for repeat treatments if heat causes damage to the filling. The heat required to cause damage is that of a [[blowtorch]] used to work on settings, and it is essential to inform anyone working on a setting if the diamond is fracture-filled, so they can apply cooling agents to the diamond and use greater care while working on it.

GIA, as a matter of policy, does not grade clarity-enhanced diamonds but it will grade laser-drilled diamonds since it considers the enhancement to be permanent in nature. If a GIA report has the words "clarity enhanced" or "fracture filled", it is surely a counterfeit report.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[File:Litfass Ernő.jpg|thumb|Ernst Litfaß in 1855]]
[[File:Litfass-tomb.JPG|thumb|220px|Litfaß's grave in Berlin]]
'''Ernst Amandus Theodor Litfaß''' (or '''Litfass'''; {{IPA-de|ˈlɪtfas}};&lt;ref&gt;
''Litfaß'' is a [[proper name]] and thus not affected by the [[German spelling reform]] although the ''a'' in ''Litfaß'' is a short vowel and the following ''[[ß]]'' would otherwise have to be turned into an ''ss''. Accordingly, ''Litfaß'' is still correct, while ''Litfass'' is acceptable in non-German contexts.&lt;/ref&gt; 11 February 1816 &amp;ndash; 27 December 1874) was a German printer and publisher. He invented the free-standing cylindrical [[advertising column]] which bears his name in [[German language|German]] (''Litfaßsäule'').

==Biography==
[[File:Litfaß column Feb05.JPG|thumb|220px|A ''Litfaßsäule'' in [[Vienna]], Austria. The advertisements are for concerts with [[Ton Koopman]] and [[Kurt Masur]] respectively; at the bottom there is the weekly programme of the theatres of Vienna.]]
Born in Berlin, Litfaß took over his stepfather's business in 1845 and became the editor of a number of newspapers and pamphlets.  As publisher, he completed, in 1858, the edition of the ''[[Oekonomische Encyklopädie]]'' (in 242 volumes), which had been started by [[Johann Georg Krünitz]] in 1773.

In 1854 Litfaß proposed putting up columns in the streets of Berlin for announcement and advertising purposes. Allegedly, he was disgusted by the unsystematic and ubiquitous posting of pamphlets, notices and other materials on walls, doors, fences and trees. In December that year he was granted permission to erect such ''Annoncier-Säulen'' columns, and on 1 July 1855 the first 100 ''Litfaß-Säulen'' were presented in Berlin.

Litfaß had a monopoly on his [[advertising column]]s and grew rich fast. After his death in [[Wiesbaden]] in 1874, the idea of putting up ''Litfaßsäulen'' (''Litfaß columns'' or ''Litfaß pillars'') quickly spread to other German cities. Today, they can be found in other countries as well.

Later developments include the electrically powered slowly revolving Litfaß column; Litfaß columns that serve as vents for underground services; and the Litfaß column with a hidden door whose interior is used for storage purposes (tools for [[street sweeper|street sweeping]], electrical appliances, etc.)

Litfaß supported wounded veterans of the wars of 1864, 1866 and 1870–71 and their relatives by sponsoring concerts, fireworks, boat tours and donating the proceeds to charities.

He died during a spa in [[Wiesbaden]] and was buried in a honorary grave on the Dorotheenstadt cemetery in Berlin.

==Cultural references==
*In the movie ''[[The Third Man]]'', Harry Lime (played by [[Orson Welles]]) uses one of these columns as an escape route to the sewer system under Vienna.
*In the movie ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch|Gremlins 2]]'', Billy Peltzer (played by [[Zach Galligan]]) and Daniel Clamp (played by [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), use one of these columns as an escape route from the [[Gremlin]]-infested Clamp Building.
*In the movie ''[[Men in Black II]]'', Agent K (played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]) and Agent J (played by [[Will Smith]]), use a column as an escape route from an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]-infested [[Men in Black|MiB]] Headquarters.

In [[Business law|business or commercial law]], an '''extraordinary resolution''' or '''special resolution'''&lt;ref&gt;Some jurisdictions use both terms, but meaning slightly different things.  For example, in the United Kingdom, an extraordinary resolution is a resolution passed by not less than 75% of the members, and a special resolution is a resolution passed by the same majority, but having given then members not less than 21 days' notice of the intention to put the resolution to a vote, see section 378 of the [[Companies Act 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] passed by the [[stockholder|shareholders]] of a [[company (law)|company]] by a greater majority than is required to pass an [[ordinary resolution]]. The precise figures vary in different countries, but commonly an extraordinary resolution must be affirmed by not less than 75% of members casting votes, whereas an ordinary resolution only requires a bare majority.

Extraordinary resolutions are generally only required in certain specific situations required by statute.  For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], to [[Liquidation#Voluntary liquidation|liquidate]] a company voluntarily on the ground that it cannot by reason of its insolvency continue its business, requires an extraordinary resolution.

However, in certain circumstances a company may wish to amend its [[Company (law)#Corporate constitution|constitutional documents]] to provide that an extraordinary resolution needs to be passed prior to the company engaging in any reserved matters, purely as a matter of internal organisational control.

'''Firuz Kanatlı''' (1932 – 18 October 2017) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] businessman and founder and honorary president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Timuralp |first1=Bilgin |last2= |first2= |date=2014 |title=The innovations and accelerations in Anatolian Journal of Cardiology |url=https://www.journalagent.com/anatoljcardiol/pdfs/AnatolJCardiol_14_4_321_321.pdf |journal=Anatolian Journal of Cardiology |volume= |issue= |page=321 |doi= |access-date=20 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the well known company [[Eti (company)|Eti]].

He was born in [[Eskişehir]], Turkey in 1932. He attended primary school until the third school year, after which he went to [[Galatasaray High School]] in [[Istanbul]] and graduated from there. He studied business administration at the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland. When he returned home, he started to work in his father's flour mill, the "Gümülcineli Flour Mill". The factory would later be renamed to "Kanatlı Flour Mill".

The dream of establishing his own business lead Kanatlı to search for a work branch. His grandparent's first millstone-flour mill "[[Gümülcine]]" (Turkish for [[Komotini]], a city in  East Macedonia and Thrace of Greece) led him to reconnect with his family history, and led him to the idea to produce pasta. Because sugar was easy to find in the sugar refinery nearby, he decided to branch out into the cookie business.

In that time, there was only cookie brands "Arı", "Ülker", "Besler", "Haylayf" and "İdeal", whose factories where all in Istanbul, however, he changed that and brought cookie production to Central Anatolia. He wanted to bring his cookies onto the market under the name''Bal'' (Honey) but someone else had already claimed the rights to that trade mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yenisafak.com/yenisafakpazar/etiyi-marka-yapti-namaz-kitabi-yazdi-615292 | title = ETİ'yi marka yaptı namaz kitabı yazdı | accessdate = 2 February 2014 | publisher = [[Yeni Şafak]] | date = 5 February 2016 | website =  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205195741/http://www.yenisafak.com/yenisafakpazar/etiyi-marka-yapti-namaz-kitabi-yazdi-615292 | archivedate = 5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because of this, he created the brand "Eti" (Turkish for "[[Hittites]]") instead, and began producing under this name in 1962.

'''Guard labor''' is [[wage labor]] and other activities that are said to maintain (hence "guard") a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;"[https://lists.csuchico.edu/pipermail/ope/2010-January/005518.html Guard labor]," Michael Perelman, ''Dollars and Sense''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JDE"&gt;Jayadev, A., and Bowles, S.

'''Guido Donegani''' (26 March 1877 in Livorno – 16 April 1947 in Bordighera), was a prominent [[Italy|Italian]] engineer, businessman and politician. He was CEO and President of the Italian chemical industrial giant [[Montecatini (company)|Montecatini]] from 1910-1945. Due to his support to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime]] of [[Benito Mussolini]] he was arrested at the end of the [[Second World War]], but acquitted of charges of collaboration.

==Early life==
Donegani was born in the port city [[Livorno]]. The Donegani family was part of the Livorno business elite involved in maritime transport and import and export activities. He studied industrial engineering at the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]] where he graduated in 1901. The next year he was elected in the provincial council of Livorno.&lt;ref name=treccani&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/guido-donegani_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ Donegani, Guido], Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 41 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

After he had lost his wife, Anna Coppa, a few months after their marriage in 1904, he became the Commissioner of Public Works of the City of Livorno (1905-1908) in which capacity he helped to solve the long-standing problem of water supply in the city.&lt;ref name=traina&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.clubdonegani.it/index.php/francesco-traina Guido Donegani], profilo storico curato da Francesco Traina, Il Club Donegani, April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Montecatini==
Both his father Giovan Battista Donegani and his uncle Giulio Donegani were involved in the Montecatini Mining Company (''Società Minerarie Montecatini''), which had been founded in 1888 at [[Montecatini Val di Cecina]] in [[Tuscany]] and was active in mining [[copper pyrite]]. Through a series of complicated agreements with Italian banks and French investor groups, the Donegani’s exercised a decisive role in the ownership of Montecatini.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

In 1910, after the death of his father and the acquisition of ''Unione piriti'' – the major Italian pyrite producer – Guido Donegani became the [[CEO]] of the company.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; The same year he moved the headquarters of the company from Livorno to Milan.&lt;ref name=traina/&gt;&lt;ref name=kutney25&gt;Kutney, ''Sulfur'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=O4rzzkUQyzIC&amp;pg=PA25 pp. 25-26]&lt;/ref&gt; From that time until 1945 the fate of Donegani and Montecatini would become inseparable. He became Chairman of the Board of the company in 1918.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

Under the dynamic leadership of Donegani, Montecatini would become the largest chemical company in Italy in the [[Interbellum]].&lt;ref name=kutney25/&gt; During [[World War I]], the company acquired a decisive interest in the production of [[sulphuric acid]], an important ingredient for the production of gunpowder.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; Montecatini also diversified into power stations and acquired the two largest produces of super-phosphates in Italy to become the countries leading fertilizer producer.&lt;ref name=kutney25/&gt;&lt;ref name=aftalion&gt;Aftalion, ''A history of the international chemical industry'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=zTP1MFJw8CsC&amp;pg=PA200 pp. 200-01]&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade 1910-20 over 40 plants producing fertilizers and essential chemicals were established in Italy, controlling respectively 70 and 60% of the domestic market of super-phosphates and sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;&lt;ref name=traina/&gt;

During the war, the company expanded into explosives for their mining operations, becoming Italy’s largest supplier of munitions taking control of the country’s industry.&lt;ref name=kutney25/&gt;&lt;ref name=snowden126&gt;Snowden, ''The Fascist Revolution in Tuscany, 1919-22'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=sB6aKhCsu0gC&amp;pg=PA125 pp. 125-26]&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Donegani transformed Montecatini from a mining company into chemical one, with a primary focus on agriculture.&lt;ref name=aftalion/&gt; The company also played an important role in the industrial innovation of Italy in collaboration with the Italian chemist [[Giacomo Fauser]] who developed an innovative process for [[ammonia synthesis]] in 1920 and other pioneering chemical synthesis.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;&lt;ref name=fauser&gt;[http://www.dsch.univ.trieste.it/~kaspar/seminar/fauser A Brief Profile of Giacomo Fauser], University of Trieste&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting the Fascist regime==
Donegani strongly supported the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime]] of [[Benito Mussolini]]. In 1921 he became a member of parliament for the [[National Bloc (Italy, 1921)|National Bloc]], which aggregated the Italian political right – including Mussolini – and which was absorbed by the [[National Fascist Party]] in 1924. After the [[March on Rome]] in October 1922, Donegani proclaimed that "we industrialists rejoiced and welcomed Benito Mussolini’s government that gave back to the state and its laws the necessary authority."&lt;ref name=snowden126/&gt; He lauded the violent fascist squads for restoring the order and linked the future of sales of fertilizers to the end of [[Biennio Rosso|post-war social agitation]].&lt;ref name=snowden126/&gt;

He sided with Mussolini during the [[Matteoti Crisis]].&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; Later, he would become the president of National Fascist Federation of Industries. He was often seen with Mussolini and did not hesitate to dress in the Fascist uniform.&lt;ref name=kutney25/&gt; As Mussolini’s personal emissary, he carried out a mission abroad to reassure the international business community about the good intentions of the new fascist regime.&lt;ref name=snowden126/&gt;

The ties with the Fascist regime benefited the Montecatini company substantially, in particular during the conversion from war-time production of munitions to peace-time expansion of fertilizers and modernization of agriculture.&lt;ref name=snowden126/&gt; With the [[Battle for Grain]] (''Battaglia del grano'') launched in the summer of 1925, the company played an almost institutional role as the main supplier of fertilizers. A clear convergence of interests existed for the production of [[nitrogen]] which is the basic element for fertilizers, but also for gunpowder and explosives.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; During the 1930s the Fascist government protected the company with tariffs. In return, however, Montecatini had to keep open certain less profitable operations.&lt;ref name=kutney25/&gt;

The harmony between business and the regime reached its peak when Mussolini declared the necessity for economic [[autarky]] in a speech to the National Assembly of Corporations in March 1936. The planned chemical autarky was centered around Montecatini. This coincided with challenging achievements on the technical-scientific level, such as the foundation of the [[Azienda Nazionale Idrogenazione Combustibili]] (ANIC) jointly with the [[Agip|Azienda generale italiana petroli]] (Agip) and the State Railways, to produce fuel by [[hydrogenation]] of [[brown coal]].&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

At the end of the 1930s the company experienced an accelerated growth: the capital, more than doubled between 1936 and 1939, the number of employees reached nearly 60,000, and the consumption of electricity one tenth of the national total. The company prestige was at its peak and Donegani was appointed Senator in 1943.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

==Downfall==
Despite the relative dispersion of ownership, some constraints from major shareholders and political circumstances, Donegani nevertheless determined the entrepreneurial strategies of Montecatini and its subsidiaries. The [[Second World War]] did not represent to Montecatini the same opportunities for growth as the First World War had. If initially there was an increase in production of some minerals, explosives, pharmaceuticals, after 1941 the difficulties of supply, the scarcity of labour, the destruction of war, the ups and downs caused by the division of the country as the war prolonged, put the firm in a difficult position.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

The last years of Donegani were difficult. Accused of collaboration with the enemy he was arrested and then released by the Germans occupiers in March 1944.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; He was arrested again for the same reason by the British on 30 May 1945. After a brief inquiry he was handed over to the [[National Liberation Committee]] (''Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale'' - CLN) – the former partisan coalition that formed the provisional government – which accused him of collaboration with the Fascist regime.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;&lt;ref name=kutney25/&gt;

He had been kept in prison for over a month, but was suddenly released on 14 July 1945, sparking accusations of bribery of the local authorities by the wealthy entrepreneur in the newspapers. A new arrest warrant was issued and strikes were staged at Montecatini plants. Eventually, the scandal withered away and no charges were brought against Donegani.&lt;ref name=kutney25/&gt; Nevertheless, he had to hand over the direction of the company in November 1945,&lt;ref name="traina" /&gt; and lived in hiding for about a year, until acquittal. A few months after his exoneration he died in a state of severe mental and physical decay in [[Bordighera]] on the Italian Riviera, on 16 April 1947.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;&lt;ref name=kutney25/&gt;

After his death, the Guido Donegani Foundation (''Fondazione "Guido Donegani"'') was established, an entity created by presidential decree on 22 February 1951, with the income of the assets of Donegani and with funds provided by the Montecatini company, in order to promote the study of chemistry in Italy.&lt;ref name=treccani2&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/guido-donegani/ Donegani, Guido], Treccani enciclopedie on line&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Industrie- und Handelskammer Osnabrück – Emsland – Grafschaft Bentheim'''  (''Chamber of Industry and Commerce'' – abbreviated to '''IHK''') is one of 80 Chambers of Industry and Commerce in Germany, representing the collective interests of regional businesses. The districts of [[County of Bentheim (district)|Bentheim]], [[Emsland]] (excluding the city of [[Papenburg]], which is served by the IHK for [[East Frisia]] and Papenburg) and [[Osnabrück (district)|Osnabrück]] – including the city of [[Osnabrück]] – belong to the area covered by this IHK, which represents more than 50,000 businesses in the region. A total of 450 businesspeople are involved with the elected IHK committees; meanwhile 2,000 people are active as honorary auditors. The IHK Osnabrück – Emsland – Grafschaft Bentheim employs an additional 75 people.

== Self-management of economy ==
The IHK is a public corporation, assigned by the state with the task of self-managing the region’s economy and industry. It is jointly represented by its President, Martin Schlichter, and its managing director, Marco Graf. The basis of the IHK’s work is encouraging businesses in the region to engage themselves in an honorary capacity in committees and other forums.

== Duties ==
A key duty of the IHK is officially appointing and administering oaths to experts in particular fields. As regards the field of fiscal valuation of real estate, it has been largely absolved of these duties by EU personal certification standards pursuant to DIN ISO EN 17024.

Having formerly gone by the name of '''IHK Osnabrück-Emsland''', since 2011 the organisation has been called the '''IHK Osnabrück – Emsland – Grafschaft Bentheim'''. The renaming was carried out to emphasise the IHK’s representation of all its member regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://relaunch.osnabrueck.ihk24.de/servicemarken/aktuell/Pressemeldungen/Pressemeldungen_2011/Januar_2011/1173296/IHK_mit_neuem_Namen.html Press release from the IHK Osnabrück – Emsland – Grafschaft Bentheim] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120713194657/http://relaunch.osnabrueck.ihk24.de/servicemarken/aktuell/Pressemeldungen/Pressemeldungen_2011/Januar_2011/1173296/IHK_mit_neuem_Namen.html |date=2012-07-13 }} (last accessed 8 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4846">An '''information silo''', or a group of such silos, is an insular [[management system]] in which one [[information system]] or subsystem is incapable of reciprocal operation with others that are, or should be, related. Thus [[information]] is not adequately shared but rather remains sequestered within each system or subsystem, figuratively trapped within a container like grain is trapped within a [[silo]]: there may be a lot of it, and it may be stacked quite high and freely available within those limits, but it has no effect outside those limits. Such data silos are proving to be an obstacle for businesses wishing to use [[data mining]] to make productive use of their data. 

[[File:Information silo.png|thumb|Typical information silos in a hierarchic structured organization.]]
Information silos occur whenever a [[data system]] is incompatible or not integrated with other data systems.  This incompatibility may occur in the technical architecture, in the [[application architecture]], or in the [[data architecture]] of any data system.  However, since it has been shown that established [[data modeling]] methods are the root cause of the data integration problem &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://maxxphase.com/data-compatibility/top-benefits/data-silo-elimination/|title = Incompatible Data Silos|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, most data systems are at least incompatible in the data architecture layer.

==Silo mentality==
In management the term '''silo mentality''' often refers to information silos in organizations. Silo mentality is caused by divergent goals of different organizational units. It can also be described as a variant of the [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent problem]]. Silo mentality preferably occurs in larger organizations and can lead to a decreased performance and has a negative impact on the corporate culture. Silo mentality can be countered by the introduction of shared goals, the increase of internal networking activities and the flattening of hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.rotize.com/silo-mentality/|title = Silo mentality in companies|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = 2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Predictors for the occurrence of silos are 
* Number of employees 
* Number of organizational units within the whole organization 
* Degree of specialization 
* Number of different incentive mechanisms  

This should not be confused with a data silo in computing, like [[application virtualization]], [[operating-system-level virtualization]], or a [[separation kernel]].

== Etymology ==
The term '''functional silo syndrome''' was coined in 1988 by Phil S. Ensor (1931–2018) who worked in organizational development and employee relations for [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]], [[Eaton Corporation]], and as a consultant. "Silo" and "stovepipe" (as in "[[stovepipe (organisation)|stovepipe organization]]" and "[[stovepipe system]]") are now used interchangeably and applied broadly. Phil Ensor's use of the term "silo" reflects his rural Illinois origins and the many grain silos he would pass on return visits as he contemplated the challenges of the modern organizations with which he worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Functional Silo Syndrome|url=http://www.ame.org/sites/default/files/documents/88q1a3.pdf|first=Phil|last=Ensor|work=AME Target|page=16|date=Spring 1988|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Organizational Renewal – Tearing Down the Functional Silos|url=http://www.ame.org/sites/default/files/target_articles/88q2a1.pdf|author=AME Study Group on Functional Organization|work=AME Target|page=4-16|date=Summer 1988|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Breaking Down the Functional Silos: Motorola Paging Division "Bandit" Plant|url=http://www.ame.org/sites/default/files/documents/89Q4A5.pdf|first=James|last=Pullin|work=AME Target|date=Winter 1989|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Of Silos and Stovepipes|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002964.html|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|work=Language Log|date=2006-03-27|accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Byres''' of Tonley [[FRSE]] [[FSA(Scot)]] [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] (1733 — 1817) was a Scottish architect, [[antiquary]] and dealer in [[Old Master paintings]] and [[antiquities]].

==Biography==
[[File:JamesByres.jpg|thumb|Portrait of James Byres painted in 1810.]]
He was born in [[Aberdeenshire]] in 1733.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Byres was a member of a family of Scottish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathisers&lt;ref&gt;His father Patrick Byres went abroad after [[Battle of Culloden]]; "The Byres Family: An Eighteenth Century Portrait Group", ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs'' '''82''' No. 479 (February 1943, pp. 46-47, 49, p 48.&lt;/ref&gt; who settled in [[Rome]] in 1758, where he became a [[cicerone]] and an art dealer, mainly to Scottish and English gentlemen on the [[Grand Tour]] until his return to Scotland in 1790.&lt;ref name="Waterston"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His house was in [[Via Paolina]].

Byres was a painter and an adept designer, whose [[Luigi Vanvitelli|Vanvitellian]] design for a [[palazzo]] [[facade]] won a prize from the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;John Fleming, in ''Connoisseur Year Book'' 1959 pp 24-27 and Fleming ''Robert Adam and His Circle'' (Harvard University Press) 1962, pp 306, 378.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome members of his circle were drawn by [[Angelica Kauffman]] in a sketchbook she used from 1762 to 1764: the portraits include the English painter [[Nathaniel Dance-Holland|Nathaniel Dance]], [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], and the abbé Peter Grant.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Grant of Blairfindry, head of the Scottish Mission. Arthur S. Marks, "Angelica Kauffman and Some Americans on the Grand Tour" ''American Art Journal '' '''12'''.2 (Spring 1980, pp. 4-24) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1764 he was so well acquainted with the ancient sites and the cabinets of collectors that he took about a party of colonial Americans, including [[Samuel Powel]] of Philadelphia, who unlike his British peers, took assiduous notes.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Powel's "Short Notes on a Course of Antiquities at Rome in Company with Messers Apthorp Morgan &amp; Palmer begun May 21, 1764 under Mr Byers Antiquarian" is conserved at the [[American Philosophical Society]], Philadelphia; (Marks 1980:11 note 31).&lt;/ref&gt; Byres, as well as some others British residents in Rome such as [[Thomas Jenkins (antiquary)|Thomas Jenkins]] and [[Colin Morison]], worked as an art dealer, working with important European collectors.

William Constable purchased from Byres many of the Italian paintings and marble copies after Roman sculptures at [[Burton Constable]], Yorkshire, and Byres was responsible for introducing the artist [[Anton Maron]], who painted William Constable and his sister in the pose and dress of Cato and Marcia.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gilbert, "William Constable as Patron (1721-1791) at Hull" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''112''' No. 804 (March 1970), pp. 178, 183-184).&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the antiquities that passed through his hands, the most famous may be the [[Portland Vase]], which he sold to [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] in 1770. Among the commissions for which he acted as agent was the ''Noli me Tangere'' of [[Raphael Mengs]], 1771, for an altarpiece for [[All Souls College]], 1771.&lt;ref&gt;John Sparrow, "An Oxford altar-piece" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''102''' No. 682  (January 1960), pp 2, 4-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1783 he was one of the founder members of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"/&gt;

A clear idea of his own collection can be gleaned from a 1790 inventory made upon his return to Tonley. Though he sent many of his clients to [[Pompeo Batoni]], the only Batoni portrait hanging in his house was of his sister Isabella, Mrs Robert Sandilands.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Russell, "Batoni's Mrs Sandilands and Other Portraits from the Collection of James Byres" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''120''' No. 899 (February 1978), pp. 114, 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the [[Etruscans]] Byres formulated the hypothesis that Etruscan literature has not come down to us because it was purposely destroyed by the Romans.

Before he left Rome in 1790 he made a payment to the [[maître d'hôtel]] of [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Henry Benedict Stuart, Cardinal York]] in favour of the [[Charlotte Stuart, Duchess of Albany|Duchess of Albany]], illegitimate daughter of Bonnie Prince Charlie, so it may be inferred that his Jacobite sensibility ran deep.

He died at Tonley in [[Aberdeenshire]] on 3 September 1817&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"/&gt;

'''Jay Scott Pike''' (September 6, 1924 – September 13, 2015) was an American [[comic book artist]] and [[commercial illustrator]] known for his 1950s and 1960s work for [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]], advertising art, and as a [[good girl art]]ist. He created the DC character [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]] and co-created the Marvel character [[Jann of the Jungle]].

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, on September 6, 1924,&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; Jay Scott Pike enrolled at the [[Art Students League]] in [[Manhattan]], New York City at what he said was age 15 or 16: "I know I was partway into high school. I wasn't a junior or senior yet."&lt;ref name=stroud&gt;Pike in {{cite web|last=Stroud |first=Bryan, ed. |title=Jay Scott Pike |url=http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/pike.shtml |publisher=(Interview) The Silver Age Sage |date=2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yC5yA2Vt?url=http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/pike.shtml |archivedate=April 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After military service in the [[United States Marines]] from 1942 to 1946,&lt;ref name=stroud /&gt; he went on to study at the [[Parsons School of Design]] on [[GI Bill]] for one year, then [[Syracuse University]] for a semester, and, after his marriage in 1948, the [[Ringling School of Art]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]], for a year-and-a-half.&lt;ref name=stroud /&gt; Afterward, he and his wife moved to northern [[New Jersey]]. After meeting [[comic-book]] artist, [[Al Hartley]], "I went into drawing comics with Al, but we just didn't get along, so by the time we decided to split I'd gotten to know [editor] [[Stan Lee]]" at [[Marvel Comics]]' 1950s precursor, [[Atlas Comics]], "and Stan said that he would give me work of my own."&lt;ref name=stroud /&gt;
[[File:Showcase 79.png|thumb|left|The [[DC Comics]] character [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]], created by Pike in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #79 (Dec. 1968). Cover art by Pike.]]
His earliest confirmed comic book art is the five-page story "The Living Dead", by an unknown writer, in ''[[Adventures into Terror]]'' #3 (April 1951), from [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s forerunner of [[Marvel Comics]]. Tentative earlier credits exist,&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/jay%20scott%20pike/sort/chrono/ Jay Scott Pike] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atlastales&gt;[http://www.atlastales.com/cr/22/n:22:z:a:o:4:d:ASC:p:1 Jay Scott Pike] at AtlasTales.com. [https://www.webcitation.org/5vcuBN7lR?url=http://www.atlastales.com/cr/22/n:22:z:a:o:4:d:ASC:p:1 Archived] from the original on January 10, 2011..&lt;/ref&gt; but because it was not standard practice during this period to list complete writer/artist comic-book credits, confirmation is difficult. The interior art to "Captain Chaos" in the November 1952 issue of the magazine "Planet Stories" is credited to "J.S. Pike".

===Comic books===
Pike quickly became a regular Atlas Comics contributor, drawing in a variety of genres for such titles as the [[Western comics|Westerns]] ''[[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]]'', ''[[Red Warrior]]'', ''[[Texas Kid]]'', and ''[[Wild Western]]'';&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; such [[crime comics]] as ''All True Crime Cases Comics'', ''Amazing Detective Cases'', ''Crime Must Lose'', and ''Justice'';&lt;ref name=atlastales /&gt; [[romance comics]], including ''[[Girl Confessions]]'', ''[[Love Romances]]'', ''Love Tales'', ''My Own Romance'', ''Secret Story Romance'', and ''True Secrets'';&lt;ref name=atlastales /&gt; [[war comics]] such as ''Battle'', ''Battlefield'', ''Battlefront'', ''[[Combat Casey]]'', ''Men's Adventures'', ''Men in Action'', and ''War Action'';&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; and [[horror comics]] including ''Adventures into Weird Worlds'', ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', ''[[Mystic (Atlas Comics)|Mystic]]'', and ''[[Uncanny Tales (comics)|Uncanny Tales]]'';&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; and [[jungle]] adventure such as  ''[[Jungle Tales]]'', and ''[[Lorna, the Jungle Girl]]'',&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;&lt;ref name=atlastales /&gt; among other comics. With writer [[Don Rico]], he co-created the character [[Jann of the Jungle]] in ''Jungle Tales'' #1 (Sept. 1954),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/11556/ ''Jungle Tales'' #1 (Sept. 1954)] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; and drew her adventures in numerous issues of that title and her own series.

He recalled that soon after entering comics, the self-censorship [[Comics Code Authority]] impacted on his art. "I was drawing jungle girl comics: ''Jann of the Jungle'' and ''Lorna the Jungle Queen'' and it seems like another one, too, and I can remember I got a whole book back and had to make the bosoms smaller on the jungle girl, whichever one it was, and when she was flying through the trees on a vine or something her skirt couldn't go above her knees.

His final Atlas/Marvel works were the six-page story "When a Romance Ends" in ''[[Love Romances]]'' #87 (May 1960), and the five-page "Love or Infatuation?", written by [[Stan Lee]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlastales.com/sI/1966 ''Love Romances'' #105 (May 1963)] at AtlasTales.com&lt;/ref&gt; years later in issue #105 (May 1963).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; Many of Pike's 1950s Atlas stories were reprinted by Marvel Comics in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Pike began drawing for rival [[DC Comics]] in the mid-1960s, beginning with the 12-page story "In the Name of Love", starring Wendy Winthrop, Television Model, by an unknown writer, in ''Girls' Romances'' #99 (March 1964). He primarily drew for the publisher's romance comics, including ''[[Heart Throbs]]'', ''Our Love Story'', ''Secret Hearts'', and ''Young Love''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; For ''Heart Throbs'', Pike and inker [[Russ Jones]] illustrated the feature "3 Girls—Their Lives—Their Loves," which ran from 1966–1970.

In addition to his DC romance work, Pike as both writer and artist created the undersea superheroine [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #79 (Dec. 1968).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/22378/#158813 ''Showcase'' #79 (Dec. 1968)] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; His stories continued to appear in DC Comics through ''Girls' Love Stories'' #180 (Dec. 1973).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

After a long hiatus from comic books, Pike returned in 1993 to draw layouts for two issues and then do full [[penciler|penciling]] for an issue on the [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Scarlett (DC Comics)|Scarlett]]'' #12–14 (Dec. 1993 – Feb. 1994).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; He also penciled the 58-page story "All Good Things" in DC's [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation (comics)|Star Trek: The Next Generation The Series Finale]]'' (1994)&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7842">'''Jeremias Frederik Ziervogel''' M.L.A. (26 Apr 1802 - 2 July 1883) was a founding member of the [[Cape Parliament]], in which he represented [[Graaff-Reinet]], South Africa, and was prominent in fighting the Eastern Province Separatist League.

==Early life==
Ziervogel was an orphan, born in Cape Town, and the third son of immigrant parents of Swedish extraction Carl Ewald Ziervogel (1756-1803) and his second wife Anna Maria Auret (1778-1806). Jeremias was raised by an aunt in [[Cape Town]] and, in spite of his Swedish ancestry, he came to consider himself an [[Afrikaner]]. 

He was schooled at ''Tot Nut van t Algemeen'' before entering the civil service. He worked for a time as a translator and justice of the peace. He was later appointed civil commissioner for Somerset East and its resident magistrate. 

==Family==
In 1824, aged 21, he married the 15-year-old Anna Susanna Maré, and the couple had a total of 7 children. 
Their eldest son Carl Frederick Ziervogel (1826-1896) was magistrate of the Zoutpansberg area in 1877. Gold was found on his farm Leeuwpoort, which became the location of the Boksburg mining area from 1886. While many of his family members moved to Boksburg (Ziervogel Gold Mining Company) Carl Frederick retired to Pretoria. His only child, Thomas Ritchie Ziervogel (1859-1937), became Master of the Masonic Lodge and Boksburg Mayor. Another of their sons, Jacobus Philipus Ziervogel, was the Justice of the Peace and Market Master at Boksburg. Their third son, Dr Jeremias Frederick Ziervogel (c.1835-1905), became the Boksburg District Surgeon and the first Master of the town's Masonic Lodge (1893-1895). Their daughter Anna Susanna Ziervogel (1832-1909) married Gottfried Andreas Watermeyer in 1850, and was mother to [[Egidius Benedictus Watermeyer|Ben Watermeyer]] and [[Frederick Stephanus Watermeyer|Frank Watermeyer]], the influential Cape MPs.

==Graaff-Reinet patriarch==
Ziervogel left the civil service in 1842 and settled in [[Graaff-Reinet]] where he practiced as an attorney, managed a bank and founded a business. In 1847 he purchased the old Drostdy (town-hall) building, which he faithfully restored as the current monument.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SOUTH-AFRICA-EASTERN-CAPE/2008-11/1227766093&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://melvinresidence.blogspot.com/2012_06_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morgenthal.co.za/getperson.php?personID=I4892&amp;tree=tree1&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to become the centre of Graaff-Reinet's public life for the next quarter of a century. His involvement included serving as Commandant of the Graaff-Reinet commando in the [[Xhosa wars|7th Frontier war]], Director of the town's bank, Chair of the board of executors, member of the divisional council, on the library committee, founding member of the town's college, first grand master of the Midland Lodge, chair of the town's municipal commissioners, leader of the town's anti-convict association in 1849, and Member of Parliament for the town from 1854 until his retirement from politics in 1873.

==Parliamentary career (1854-73)==
He was elected to the Cape Parliament when it was established in 1854, and even drafted the original "Standing Rules and Orders" of the new parliament. His seat in the house famously necessitated a journey of 450 miles across the arid Karoo mountains, from Graaff-Reinet to Cape Town, for every parliamentary session.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. McCracken: ''The Cape Parliament, 1854-1910''. Clarendon Press: Oxford. p.1967. p.48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ziervogel was a vocal champion of the concerns of the Cape's Afrikaner population, to such an extent that some of the English press labelled him as "parliament's chief obstructionist". 
He was also a strong opponent of any further British imperial expansion in southern Africa. On one notorious occasion on 24 April 1856, his speech angered a pro-imperialist MP to such an extent that the MP in question, [[Augustus Joseph Tancred|Reverend Dr Tancred]], violently disrupted the parliament and challenged Ziervogel to a duel on the spot. Ziervogel abhorred violence and rejected the duel, but the incident nonetheless became famous.

Mr Ziervogel played a prominent role in fighting the 1870 move by the British Governor to weaken and reduce the Cape parliament into a powerless council. After a long and bitter struggle the move was finally defeated, and the elderly Ziervogel reportedly ran out of parliament in delight and skipped through the streets "...like a young lamb".&lt;ref&gt;R. Kilpin: ''The Old Cape House''. Cape Town: Maskew Miller. p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He also played a very prominent role in fighting the radical "[[Eastern Cape Separatist League]]", although it was partially because he abhorred the idea of a division whereby Graaff-Reinet would be ruled by jingoistic Grahamstown. His half-hearted proposal of an alternative three-way division of the country got around this objection of his, but in fact, the separatist league was soon to be quashed. 

From the early 1860s, he gave his full political influence in aid to the growing movement for "[[Responsible Government]]" in the Cape, becoming a fierce supporter of the movement's leader [[John Molteno]]. After a decade-long struggle, responsible government was attained in 1872, finally bringing the country's executive under local democratic control. 
However Ziervogel opposed the closely allied "[[Voluntaryism]]" (separation of church &amp; state) movement, led by [[Saul Solomon]], in spite of it being almost indistinguishable from the responsible government party. 

Ziervogel retired a few months after responsible government was attained, although he had been strongly favoured to be in Molteno's first cabinet. A farewell party was held in his honour by his parliamentary colleagues, and in his farewell speech he expressed contentment with the political state of the country and the hope that it would one day be united into a free "United States of Southern Africa".&lt;ref&gt;Molteno, P. A. ''The Life and Times of John Charles Molteno. Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape, Volume II''. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., Waterloo Place, 1900. p.218.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Graaff-Reinet Advertiser'' commented on his career: 

''All admired his shrewdness, knowledge and ability, but in some way he came to be looked on as some sort of mystery: no one could tell when he had spoken whether there was not as much kept back as had been uttered; and he never became the political leader his talent entitled him to become ... men could not follow a political sphinx.''&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sidney. ''Dictionary of National Biography (1st supplement) 3''. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. p.860.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After leaving parliament he immediately left the country and moved to [[Pretoria]], in the [[Transvaal Republic|Transvaal]] in 1873, where he established a branch of the Cape Commercial Bank and settled at "Oak Lodge" on Bosman street. His sons and grandchildren accompanied him and, through persistent and effective lobbying of the Transcaal government, they attained a range of influential appointments. Nonetheless, the emigration was an unexpected move for an elderly man so settled in Graaff-Reinet and central to its life. His motivations for this move are not fully known. 

He died in Pretoria, aged 80, in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;http://family.itcouncil.biz/73.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stamouers.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=642:ziervogel-carel-ewald&amp;catid=7:v-z&amp;Itemid=37&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ulysses Lee''' "'''Junior'''" '''Bridgeman''' (born September 17, 1953) is an [[Americans|American]] businessman and former professional [[basketball]] player.

==High school career==
Born in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], Bridgeman was a member of the 1971 East Chicago Washington High School Senators basketball team, which went undefeated (29-0) and won the Indiana state high school basketball championship. Among his teammates were his brother Sam, [[Pete Trgovich]] (who played at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]) and [[Tim Stoddard]] ([[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|N.C. State]]), who would go on to have success as a [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]].

==College and professional career==
A {{height|ft=6|in=5}} tall [[guard (basketball)|guard]]/[[forward (basketball)|forward]] from the [[University of Louisville]], Bridgeman was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in [[1975 NBA Draft|1975]] and immediately traded with [[Brian Winters]], [[David Meyers (basketball)|David Meyers]] and [[Elmore Smith]] to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] for [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. Bridgeman went on to have a solid 12-year NBA career, spent mostly with the Bucks, and he scored 11,517 total points. Although he was a sixth man for most of his career, he averaged double figures in scoring for nine consecutive seasons. He played in 711 games for the Bucks, still the most in franchise history, although he started only 105 times.

==Post-playing career==
During the off-seasons of his playing career, Bridgeman used to work and learn the business model of [[Wendy's]] fast food restaurant franchise. After retiring from the NBA, he started owning various Wendy's and [[Chili's]] restaurants, and then sold them in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=David |title=How A Former NBA Player Turned $350,000 into $400 Million |url=https://www.themaven.net/blackwealthchannel/investing/how-a-former-nba-player-turned-350-000-into-400-million-FyRtXUpz5E6XFmVi6NhedA/ |website=Black Wealth Channel |accessdate=September 4, 2018 |date=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schuyler |first1=David |title=Junior Bridgeman selling restaurant franchises to become Coca-Cola distributor |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2016/04/20/junior-bridgeman-selling-restaurant-franchises-to.html |website=www.bizjournals.com |accessdate=September 4, 2018 |date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Bridgeman became a bottler for [[The Coca-Cola Company]],&lt;ref name="Coca Cola"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mandel |first1=Eric |title=NBA legend, NHL entrepreneur joint venture completes Coca-Cola's bottling overhaul |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2018/03/09/nba-legend-nhl-entrepreneur-joint-venture.html |website=www.bizjournals.com |accessdate=September 4, 2018 |date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018, he signed a letter of intent to buy bottling operations in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Coca Cola" /&gt;

==Honors==
Bridgeman's no. 2 jersey was retired by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in 1988. He was inducted into the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 1999.

==Personal life==
Bridgeman is a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartfordalphas.com/alphaphialpha.php?ID=3 |title=Hartford Alphas |accessdate=October 15, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712054014/http://www.hartfordalphas.com/alphaphialpha.php?ID=3 |archivedate=July 12, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2016, Bridgeman was appointed to the University of Louisville Board of Trustees by Governor of Kentucky [[Matt Bevin]] following an administrative reorganization in which Bevin abolished the university's former governing board. The appointment of the new board, including Bridgeman, was challenged by the state's Attorney General [[Andy Beshear]] on grounds that the governor did not have the power to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/32335039/gov-matt-bevin-names-10-new-appointments-to-u-of-l-board-of-trustees |title=Gov.

'''Khalid bin Mahfouz''' (December 26, 1949 – August 16, 2009) ({{lang-ar|خالد بن محفوظ}}) was a [[Saudi Arabian]] billionaire, banker, businessman, investor and former chairman of the [[National Commercial Bank]] (NCB). Khalid is the son of Salem Bin Mahfouz, a Saudi entrepreneur who rose from being a smalltime [[moneychanger]] to becoming the founder of the NCB, the first private Saudi bank.

With a personal wealth estimated to be around $3.2 billion, Bin Mahfouz ranked 24th in Arabian Business magazine’s list of the world’s most influential Arabs in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/power100-2010|title=Power 100 2010|work=Arabian Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Bin Mahfouz ranked number 214 in Forbes Billionaires List&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/JKTG.html|title=Khalid Bin Mahfouz &amp; family, The World's Richest People -  Forbes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]] on New York and Washington, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis, considerable suspicion fell on Saudi financiers and charities as sources of financing for terrorism and Khalid Bin Mahfouz faced accusations in books, newspapers and magazines that he and his family had funneled money to Al Qaeda.

==Biography==
Khalid bin Mahfouz was the second eldest son of [[Salem Ahmed bin Mahfouz]], a Saudi who rose from being an [[illiterate]] moneychanger to the founder of the first bank in his country, the [[National Commercial Bank]] of Saudi Arabia (NCB). Salem Ahmed then became the personal banker of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]]. He handed management of NCB, the largest bank in the country, to Khalid sometime in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="sins"&gt;{{cite news  |first = Nathan |last = Vardi |url = https://www.forbes.com/global/2002/0318/047.html |title = Sins of the Father? |work = The World's Billionaires |publisher = [[Forbes]] |date = 2002-03-18 |accessdate = 2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s Khalid bin Mahfouz bought and lived in a $3.5 million chateaux-style house, later named "Versailles," in the [[River Oaks, Houston|River Oaks]] area of Houston. He also bought a four thousand acre (16&amp;nbsp;km²) ranch along the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] in [[Liberty County, Texas]], near the ranch of [[James Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;Unger, Craig.

In 1990 Khalid bin Mahfouz acquired [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] citizenship through inward-investment procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.binmahfouz.info/faqs_5.html |title=B |accessdate=2007-08-11 |author=Bin Mahfouz Information |publisher=Bin Mahfouz family }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Mahfouz was married with three children.  His personal [[net worth]] was $3.2 billion in 2006, making him one of the richest people in the world at the time; his family fortune was estimated to have been worth over $4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author1=Kroll, Luisa |author2=Fass, Allison |url = https://www.forbes.com//lists/2006/10/JKTG.html |title = Khalid Bin Mahfouz &amp; family |work = The World's Billionaires |publisher = [[Forbes]] |date = 2006-03-09 |accessdate = 2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and allegations==

===Alleged Brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden===
This allegation came from high profile people, book authors and well respected newspapers in the US and Europe such as [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[The Washington Post]]. All turned out to be based on false information. For example, [[James Woolsey]], former [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director of CIA]], testified to a [[congressional subcommittee]] that Khalid Bin Mahfouz was a brother-in-law of [[Osama Bin Laden]]. He later on told Los Angeles Times 'I don't know what to say other than there was some confusion, but I never meant to refer to Bin Mahfouz's sister'.
"&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, Ken. “Saudi Billionaire Alleges Significant Errors in Book on Terrorist Financing Linking Him to Bin Laden.” Los Angeles Times, February 26, 2003 Page A18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wall Street Journal issued a correction. “None of Khalid bin Mahfouz's sisters is, or ever has been, married to Osama bin Laden." "&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal, May 29, 2004. https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1022636498974443720
&lt;/ref&gt;

===$225 million BCCI scandal fine===
Bin Mahfouz was a non-executive director of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]], a financial conglomerate later convicted of [[money laundering]], [[bribery]], support of [[terrorism]], [[arms trafficking]], and many other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/07later.htm | title = BCCI in the United States - Part Two: Acquisition, Consolidation, and Consequences | accessdate = 2006-06-26 | author = [[John Kerry|Kerry, John]]; [[Hank Brown|Brown, Hank]] |date=December 1992  | work = The BCCI Affair, A Report to the Committee on Foreign Relations | publisher = [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahfouz personally owned a 20% stake in BCCI. He was indicted by a New York state [[grand jury]] for [[fraud]] but denied any culpability. The fraud charges were settled for [[USD|$]]225 million in lieu of fines.&lt;ref name="sins" /&gt; Mr. bin Mahfouz has claimed that he simply settled as a business decision rather than using resources to fight further.

===Donations to Osama bin Laden in 1988===
[[Craig Unger]]'s book ''House of Bush, House of Saud'' claims that bin Mahfouz donated over $270,000 to Osama bin Laden's [[Islamist]] organization at the request of Osama's brother [[Salem bin Laden]]. Bin Mahfouz's lawyer stated: "This donation was to assist the US-sponsored resistance to the Soviet occupation of [[Afghanistan]] and was never intended nor, to the best of Sheikh Khalid's knowledge, ever used to fund any 'extension' of that resistance movement in other countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Leigh |last = David |url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,1182578,00.html |title = Bush, the Saudi billionaire and the Islamists: the story a British firm is afraid to publish  |publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] |date = 2004-03-31 |accessdate = 2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged NCB funding of al-Qaeda===
Khalid bin Mahfouz has denied that NCB, his bank, was involved in funding an [[al-Qaeda]] group. According to reports, high-placed Saudi businessmen transferred millions of dollars through NCB to charities operating as fronts for al-Qaeda. Mahfouz states that he could not have been aware of every wire transfer moving through the bank, and that he would not have allowed such transactions had he known they were taking place.

Additionally, Forbes reports:
{{quotation|[I]n 1999 the [Saudi] government stepped in, buying a controlling 50% stake of NCB from Khalid for at least $1 billion, partly used to wipe Khalid's debt from the books. Khalid and his family retained 34% ownership, but he again surrendered his management positions. . . The extent of Khalid's mismanagement at NCB remains shrouded. NCB has not issued audited numbers since 1998, but it did acknowledge last year that provisions for bad loans in 1999 and 2000 reached $934 million, covering 86% of its doubtful debt.&lt;ref name="sins" /&gt;}}

NCB senior officials vehemently deny the existence of this audit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors = Jackson, David; Cohen, Laurie; Manor, Robert; Salopek, Paul |title = Money trail leads to Saudi, U.S. says  |publisher = [[Chicago Tribune]] |date = 2001-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually won a string of lawsuits against writers who had accused him of supporting terrorism, with a notable exception of [[Rachel Ehrenfeld]].  Ehrenfeld, the author of [[Funding Evil]] and a U.S. citizen based in New York, had not written or marketed her book internationally and refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the [[English court]] over her case, instead alleging that Mahfouz was using the [[High Court of Justice]] for [[libel tourism]]&lt;ref name="pallister"&gt;David Pallister, "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/15/books.usa US author mounts 'libel tourism' challenge]". ''[[The Guardian]], 15 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. Her refusal resulted in [[Justice Eady]] in the High Court awarding a default judgment against her in 2005.  Dr Ehrenfeld was ordered to apologize, destroy all copies of her book and pay him $230,000 in damages.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/world/middleeast/27mahfouz.html?pagewanted=print|title=Khalid bin Mahfouz, Saudi Banker, Dies at 60|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=27 August 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York State Legislature]], however, passed a law preventing the judgments from being enforced by providing greater protection against libel judgments in countries whose laws are inconsistent with the freedom of speech granted by the United States Constitution .&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Abady &amp; Harvey Silverglate, "[http://www.nypost.com/seven/02252008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/rachels_lawnys_libel_tourism_fix_99158.htm?page=0 Rachel's Law: NY's 'Libel-Tourism' Fix]". ''New York Post, 25 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheik Mahfouz did acknowledge making one contribution to Al Qaeda during the epoch of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

===Muwafaq Foundation===
Khalid bin Mahfouz helped set up a [[Charitable organization|charity]] organization called the [[Muwafaq Foundation]], Muwafaq being Arabic for "blessed relief". He funded this charity with $30 million, and put his eldest son, [[Abdulrahman bin Mahfouz]], on the board of directors. In October 2001, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] named Muwafaq Foundation - a charity devoted to famine relief - a [[front organization]].  Neither Khalid nor Abdulrahman were accused of funding terrorism by the United States; however [[Yasin al-Qadi]], a Saudi national hired to run the charity, was named a supporter of terrorism and had his assets frozen by the U.S. Treasury Department.&lt;ref name="sins" /&gt;

===UN designation===

There have been numerous allegations that Khalid bin Mahfouz has been named a terrorist financier by the [[United Nations]].  The controversy springs from a report prepared by French investigator [[Jean-Charles Brisard]] and his research agency, the [[JCB Consulting Group]], for the [[President of the UN Security Council|President]] of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] of the [[United Nations]] in December 2002. In this report Khalid was listed as one of seven "main individual Saudi sponsors of al Qaeda."&lt;ref name="jcb"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mowbray|first1=Joel|title=Saudis Behaving Badly|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/mowbray/mowbray122002.asp|accessdate=13 May 2016|agency=National Review|date=1 February 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030201122753/http://www.nationalreview.com/mowbray/mowbray122002.asp|archivedate=1 February 2003|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light industry''' is [[industry|industries]] that usually are less [[Capital intensity|capital-intensive]] than [[heavy industry]] and is more [[consumer]]-oriented than [[business]]-oriented, as it typically produces smaller consumer goods. Most light industry products are produced for [[end user]]s rather than as intermediates [[business-to-business|for use by other industries]]. Light industry facilities typically have less [[natural environment|environment]]al impact than those associated with [[heavy industry]]. For that reason [[zoning]] laws are more likely to permit light industry near [[residential area]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

One definition states that light industry is a "[[manufacturing]] activity that uses moderate amounts of partially processed materials to produce items of relatively high value per unit weight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/l/light-industry/|title=Light Industry Law And Legal Definition|publisher=US Legal|accessdate=26 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Characteristics==
Light industries require fewer [[Raw material|raw materials]], space and power. While light industry typically causes little pollution, particularly compared to heavy industry, some light industry can cause significant pollution or risk of contamination. For example, electronics manufacturing, itself often a light industry, can create potentially harmful levels of [[lead]] or [[chemical waste]]s in soil without proper handling of solder and waste products (such as cleaning and degreasing agents used in manufacture).

'''''Lionel Trains: On Track''''' is a [[video game]] released for the Nintendo DS on December 6, 2006, licensed by [[Lionel Corporation]]. The gameplay is very similar to [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]'' series of [[computer game]]s. In the game, you are the head of an unspecified [[railroad]], and your objective is to connect different cities together through rail, using the funds you start off with, and later earn. There are several separate modes of gameplay, with varying objectives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13567">'''Managing up and managing down''' is studied as part of management studies, and details how a [[middle management|middle manager]] should effectively deal with his or her manager and with his or her subordinates.  Additionally, managing up on its own may be a useful skill for a subordinate who in turn does not manage anyone. It is generally considered to be distinct from  "[[sucking up]]" or "[[kissing up]]" to the manager and "[[kicking down]]" to subordinates as it involves benign and straightforward [[social influence|influencing]] rather than underhand [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Turk W (2007) Defense AT&amp;L: March–April The Art of Managing Up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Johnson W (15 Dec 2014) Managing Up Without Sucking Up Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price S Ivy Exec Managing Up Without Kissing Up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Careers Group (2010) Your Academic Career: Managing Professional Relationships University of London&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managing up ==
===How to position yourself for managing up===

There are several ways to go about influencing up and they all regard appealing to your boss. Turk suggests several different guidelines for managing up including being loyal and committed, understanding your boss’s perspective and agenda, understanding your boss’s preferences, providing solutions not problems, and understanding your own management style.  Each of the different guidelines Turk provides serves an important benefit for both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Turk W (2007) Defense AT&amp;L: March–April The Art of Managing Up&lt;/ref&gt;

The Careers Group recommends “Understand where your work fits in with your manager’s goals and the wider goals of the organization”. Which comes into play when your managers have their own projects to work on in addition to managing subordinates. Considering the challenges that managers face with their projects and working to either assist or stay out of the way when those projects require more attention is a smart tactic. Putting yourself in the position to be recognized as someone who can handle the work they were assigned and assist the manager in their work can be particularly beneficial when advocating for your own projects. Figuring out where the work that you want to accomplish fits into the overall goals for the company is crucial to getting approval on those projects as well.&lt;ref&gt;The Careers Group (2010) Your Academic Career: Managing Professional Relationships University of London&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Badowski, good managing up requires going above and beyond the tasks assigned to you so that you can enhance your manager's work. Doing what you can to make your manager's job easier will not only help them do their job, but you will be considered a valuable asset to your manager and to your organization. You want to be described as indispensable.&lt;ref&gt;Badowski R (2004) Managing Up: How to Forge an Effective Relationship With Those Above You&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garone E 
(30 Oct 2008) Wall Street Journal What It Means to 'Manage Up'&lt;/ref&gt;

A very important point to remember is “Be very clear about what job you were hired to do -and do it.” this is just one of three highlighted in the article Managing Up Without Sucking Up. The importance of this is, once you have established what it is that you were hired to do within the company and you do it you have fulfilled your duties anything additional that you work on is a bonus to your managers. With this achieved you can now begin to speak with your managers about the other things that you would like to do. With the right tactics, the problems and projects that you would like to take on become available to you.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Johnson W (15 Dec 2014) Managing Up Without Sucking Up Harvard Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
Understand how your manager likes to communicate. Price suggests appealing to your managers' communication styles “If he or she likes to communicate face-to-face rather than through email updates, then set up short meetings”. When you communicate with your manager in a way that they are receptive to they feel as though time spent with you is well utilized and they will associate you and your work with productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Price S Ivy Exec Managing Up Without Kissing Up&lt;/ref&gt;
   
=== Influencing up ===
Bradford introduces the idea of ''influencing up'' where it may be possible for a subordinate without authority to influence those with authority.He delves into topics such as: creating a partnership between you and your boss and bridging the power gap. &lt;ref&gt;Bradford DL (2005) Influence Without Authority&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managing down ==
===Tendencies that negatively affect employees===
*'''Always giving and never receiving feedback'''- Receiving, analyzing, and applying feedback from a managers perspective is just as important as giving it. Neglecting to give your employees the opportunity to evaluate your performance doesn't allow them to feel like their voice matters to the person directly overseeing their work. 	
*'''Micromanaging employees'''- Constantly checking the progress of your employees can be uncomfortable and prove to be unproductive for both sides in the long run. 
*'''Being inflexible'''- Neglecting to acknowledge circumstances affecting employees outside of work when making decisions can frustrate people and create a [[hostile work environment]]. 
*'''Not taking responsibility for the team as a whole'''- When managing a group the failures and successes can be attributed to the team's leader/ manager, forfeiting the responsibility when the team fails is not good leadership. 
*'''Lack of personal motivation'''- People pick up on the habits of the people managing them, a negative attitude towards your work can spread to your subordinates and create a lack of motivation in the company.

===Tendencies that positively affect employees===
*'''Providing challenging work to stimulate employees'''- When employees are stimulated by their work they have more of an incentive to actively try to complete it versus mundane tasks that don't realize any benefits.
*'''Supporting employees’ decisions'''- Encouraging and supporting the decisions that employees make can motivate employees who have low self-esteem and don't find motivation in the same things as their peers. 
*'''Coaching and developing employees’ skills'''- Taking the time to coach and develop the skills of the people you work around benefits both sides one gets to learn these skills and the other has the opportunity to master these skills. 
*'''Encouraging good relationships'''- Encouraging employees to be vocal with each other about concerns and compliments promotes a culture where frustrations don't build up and cause delays in work.  
*'''Recognizing conflict and dealing with its causes'''- Recognizing the roots of your employees' frustrations and working to fix them before they become a company-wide issue alleviates workplace tension and can establish a good morale with employees.   
===Skills required for managing down===
It is claimed that good managing down requires the following attributes:&lt;ref&gt; nameWard ME, Zambito J (Nov 2013) The Bulletin Vol 81 Issue 6  Managing in All Directions: Up, Down, and Sideways&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Organization skills'''- Having strong organizational skills allow you to properly coordinate people and resources within your company.  
* '''Communication skills'''- The ability to express your wants and needs to your employees in a clear and coordinated manner eliminates any misinterpretations. 
* '''Motivation'''-Managers who understand that different people require types of motivation and cater their assignments toward them prove to be particularly effective.
* '''Leadership skills'''- The skills that managers and leaders require heavily overlap and the main focus in both sets is creating mutual trust and respect between you and your subordinates. 
* '''Utilizing the right management style'''- Recognizing what your management style is, allows you to utilize it in a way that matches your employees’ motivation styles. 
* '''Being authentic'''- Most adults can recognize a genuine person, and showing the people you work with that you are a trustworthy person who is reliable earns respect.
* '''Safe environments'''- Promoting a workplace culture that encourages everyone to feel comfortable with themselves and the work that they do reaps benefits for everyone. 
* '''Setting clear expectations'''- Along with communication skills comes clear expectations, vocalizing exactly what needs to be done and when leaves little room for misunderstandings and excuses for things not to be done. 
* '''Consistent feedback'''- Constantly reporting back to your employees on their performance allows you to work with them on problem areas before they become a habit and to analyze and applaud a job well done. Receiving feedback reaps the same benefits for managers as well.
* '''Accepting imperfection'''- The ability to accept limitations and work off of or around them is an important skill that is beneficial in learning how to problem solve in a bind.

==Conclusion==
===Benefits of effectively middle managing===
Both sides in every case benefit in some way when people choose to manage up and down. When you focus on creating value with the work you do for your managers and your company you benefit yourself with the skills you obtain in the process.  When you choose to manage up you create a level of trust between you and your boss by being a reliable trustworthy employee, through doing this you learn about yourself and the type of person you are. When you effectively manage down you create better relationships with your employees and in turn, you can create a work culture that makes people feel valued in turn encouraging better work.

===Key points for managing up===
*Be clear about the job you were hired to do and do it 
*Understand what job your boss was hired to do
*Remember that the people you work with are not family 
*Figure out how your project fits into the company goals
*Provide solutions not problems
*Request feedback and use it 

===Key points for managing down===
*Fine tune leadership skills
*Fine tune organization skills
*Give and receive feedback 
*Be clear about your expectations
*Recognize your employees' needs and adapt to them

Garvey was unique in advancing a philosophy to inspire a global [[mass movement]] and [[economic empowerment]] focusing on Africa known as [[Garveyism]].&lt;ref name="BackToAfrica" /&gt; Garveyism would eventually inspire others, ranging from the [[Nation of Islam]] to the [[Rastafari movement]] (which proclaim Garvey as a prophet) and the [[Black Power Movement]] of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"Overlooking his quarrel with the Emporor of Ethiopia, Marcus Garvey was revered by Rastafarians as the prophet who had foretold the coming of Haile Selassie."

Garveyism intended persons of African ancestry in the diaspora to "redeem" the continent of Africa and put an end to European colonialism. His essential ideas about Africa are stated in an editorial in the ''[[Negro World]]'' entitled "African Fundamentalism", where he wrote: "Our union must know no clime, boundary, or nationality… to let us hold together under all climes and in every country…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey or Africa for the Africans|last=Garvey|first=Marcus|authorlink=|editor=Jacques-Garvey, Amy|year=1986|publisher=Majority Press|location=Dover (Massachusetts)|isbn=978-0-912469-24-9|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. was born as the youngest of eleven children in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], to Marcus Mosiah Garvey Sr, [[masonry|mason]], and Sarah Jane Richards, a [[domestic worker]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Only he, and his sister, Indiana, survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Martin, Tony 1983"&gt;Martin, Tony.

In 1910 Garvey left Jamaica and began traveling throughout the [[Central America]]n region.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His first stop was [[Costa Rica]], where he had a maternal uncle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Martin (professor)|Tony Martin]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=MRX7n7-ZfzoC&amp;q=costa+rica#v=snippet&amp;q=costa%20rica&amp;f=false ''Marcus Garvey, Hero: A First Biography''], Dover Massachusetts: The Majority Press, 1983, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in [[Costa Rica]] for several months and worked as a time keeper on a [[banana]] [[plantation]]. He began work as editor for a daily newspaper called ''[[La Nacionale]]'' in 1911. Later that year, he moved to [[Colón, Panama]], where he edited a biweekly newspaper, before returning to Jamaica in 1912.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over time, Marcus Garvey became influenced by many civil rights activists of his time. He ultimately combined the economic nationalist ideas of [[Booker T. Washington]] and Pan-Africanists with the political possibilities and urban style of men and women living outside of plantation and colonial societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=History.com Staff|title=Marcus Garvey|url=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/marcus-garvey|website=History.com|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of working in the [[Caribbean]], Garvey left [[Jamaica]] to live in [[London]] from 1912 to 1914, where he attended [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], taking classes in [[law]] and [[philosophy]]. He also worked for the ''[[African Times and Orient Review]]'', published by [[Dusé Mohamed Ali]], an Egyptian nationalist and influential foe of racial prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Fairclough, A. (2002). Better Day Coming: Blacks and Equality, 1890-2000. Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey sometimes spoke at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]'s [[Speakers' Corner]].{{citation needed|date = February 2018}}

== Organization of UNIA ==
In 1914, Garvey returned to Jamaica, where he organized the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA)]]. In an article titled "The Negro's Greatest Enemy", published in ''Current History'' (September 1923), Garvey explained the origin of the organization's name:

{{Quote|Where did the name of the organization come from? It was while speaking to a West Indian Negro who was a passenger with me from Southampton, who was returning home to the West Indies from Basutoland with his Basuto wife, I further learned of the horrors of native life in Africa. He related to me in conversation such horrible and pitiable tales that my heart bled within me. Retiring from the conversation to my cabin, all day and the following night I pondered over the subject matter of that conversation, and at midnight, lying flat on my back, the vision and thought came to me that I should name the organization the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities (Imperial) League. Such a name I thought would embrace the purpose of all black humanity. Thus to the world a name was born, a movement created, and a man became known.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/garvey/filmmore/ps_enemy.html "Primary Sources: The Negro's Greatest Enemy"], ''Marcus Garvey: The Film &amp; More'', PBS.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After corresponding with [[Booker T. Washington]], head of the [[Tuskegee Institute]] in Alabama and a national African-American leader in the United States, Garvey traveled by ship to the U.S., arriving on 23 March 1916 aboard the SS ''Tallac''. He intended to make a lecture tour and to raise funds to establish a school in Jamaica modeled after Washington's Institute.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Garvey visited Tuskegee, and afterwards, visited with a number of black leaders. Throughout his life, Garvey and the UNIA used the organization's resources to give people of African descent opportunities in academics that he felt they wouldn't be provided otherwise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Thandeka|year=2004|title=Foundations of Multicultural Education: Marcus  Garvey and the United Negro Improvement Association|jstor=4129626|journal=The Journal of Negro Education|volume=73|issue=4|page=424|doi=10.2307/4129626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to New York, he found work as a printer by day. He was influenced by [[Hubert Harrison]]. At night he would speak on street corners, much as he did in London's Hyde Park. Garvey thought there was a leadership vacuum among African Americans. On 9 May 1916, he held his first public lecture in [[New York City]] at [[St Mark's Church in-the-Bowery]] and undertook a 38-state speaking tour.

The next year in May 1917, Garvey and thirteen others formed the first UNIA division outside Jamaica in Harlem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They began advancing ideas to promote social, political, and [[economic freedom]] for black people. On 2 July, the [[East St. Louis riot]]s broke out. On 8 July, Garvey delivered an address, entitled "The Conspiracy of the East St. Louis Riots", at [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Hall]] in [[Harlem]]. During the speech, he declared the riot was "one of the bloodiest outrages against mankind", condemning America's claims to represent democracy when black people were victimized "for no other reason than they are black people seeking an industrial chance in a country that they have laboured for three hundred years to make great". It is "a time to lift one's voice against the savagery of a people who claim to be the dispensers of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Herbert, ''White Violence and Black Response: From Reconstruction to Montgomery'', University of Massachusetts Press, 1988, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; By October, rancor within the UNIA had begun to set in. A split occurred in the Harlem division, with Garvey enlisted to become its leader; although he technically held the same position in Jamaica.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Garvey worked to develop a program to improve the conditions of ethnic Africans "at home and abroad" under UNIA auspices. On 17 August 1918, he began publishing the ''[[Negro World]]'' newspaper in New York, which was widely distributed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Garvey worked as an editor without pay until November 1920. He used ''[[Negro World]]'' as a platform for his views to encourage growth of the UNIA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mugleston, William. "Garvey, Marcus", ''American National Biography'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1919, the membership of the organization had grown to over two million, according to its records.

On 27 June 1919, the UNIA set up its first business, incorporating the [[Black Star Line]] of [[Delaware]], with Garvey as President. By September, it acquired its first ship. Much fanfare surrounded the inspection of the [[SS Yarmouth|S.S. ''Yarmouth'']] and its rechristening as the S.S. ''[[Frederick Douglass]]'' on 14 September 1919. Such a rapid accomplishment garnered attention from many.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The Black Star Line also formed a fine winery, using grapes harvested only in Ethiopia. During the first year, the Black Star Line's stock sales brought in $600,000.  They had numerous problems during the next two years: mechanical breakdowns on their ships, what was said to be a result of incompetent workers, and poor record keeping. The officers were eventually accused of mail fraud.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===Investigation, arrest, and assassination attempt===
[[Edwin P. Kilroe]], Assistant [[District Attorney]] in the District Attorney's office of the County of New York, began an investigation into the activities of the UNIA. He never filed charges against Garvey or other officers. After being called to Kilroe's office numerous times for questioning, Garvey wrote an editorial on the assistant DA's activities for the ''Negro World''. Kilroe had Garvey arrested and indicted for criminal [[libel]] but dismissed the charges after Garvey published a retraction.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

On 14 October 1919, Garvey received a visit in his Harlem office from [[George Tyler (assassin)|George Tyler]], who claimed Kilroe "had sent him" to get the leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=editor|first1=Robert A.

Garvey's secretary Amy quickly arranged to get Garvey taken to the hospital for treatment, and Tyler was arrested. The next day, Tyler committed suicide by leaping from the third tier of the Harlem jail as he was being taken to his arraignment.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Growth===
By August 1920, the UNIA claimed four million members. The number has been questioned because of the organization's poor record keeping.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; That month, the International Convention of the UNIA was held. With delegates from all over the world attending, 25,000 people filled [[Madison Square Garden]] on 1 August 1920 to hear Garvey speak.&lt;ref name="Sundiata2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sundiata|first=Ibrahim K.|title=Brothers and Strangers: Black Zion, Black Slavery, 1914–1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cVyGPF713gC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=20 May 2013|year=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-3247-3|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next couple of years, Garvey's movement was able to attract an enormous number of followers. Reasons for this included the cultural revolution of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], the large number of West Indians who immigrated to New York, and the appeal of the slogan "One God, One Aim, One Destiny," to black veterans of the [[World War I|first World War]].&lt;ref name="Mugleston"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mugleston|first=William|title=Garvey, Marcus|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00257.html?a=1&amp;n=marcus%20garvey&amp;d=10&amp;ss=0&amp;q=1|publisher=American National Biography Online|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garvey also established a business, the [[Negro Factories Corporation]]. He planned to develop the businesses to manufacture every marketable commodity in every big U.S. industrial center, as well as in [[Central America]], the [[West Indies]], and [[Africa]]. Related endeavors included a grocery chain, restaurant, publishing house, and other businesses. {{listen|filename=Marcus Garvey, speech, 1921.ogg|title="Explanation of the Objects of the Universal Negro Improvement Association"|description=Complete 1921 speech|type=speech}}

Convinced that black people should have a permanent homeland in Africa, Garvey sought to develop [[Liberia]]. It had been founded by the [[American Colonization Society]] in the 19th century as a colony to free blacks from the United States. Garvey launched the Liberia program in 1920, intended to build colleges, industrial plants, and [[railroads]] as part of an [[industrial base]] from which to operate. He abandoned the program in the mid-1920s after much opposition from European powers with interests in Liberia. In response to American suggestions that he wanted to take all ethnic Africans of the Diaspora back to Africa, he wrote, "We do not want all the Negroes in Africa. Some are no good here, and naturally will be no good there."&lt;ref name="Marcus1967"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garvey|first=Marcus|authorlink=Marcus Garvey|title=Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey: Or, Africa for the Africans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TiCoYtBtJEsC&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=1 December 2007|year=1967|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-1143-3|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marcus Garvey (1922).jpg|thumb|left|Garvey in Aug. 1922]]
The UNIA held an international convention in 1921 at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Also represented at the convention were organizations such as the Universal Black Cross Nurses, the Black Eagle Flying Corps, and the Universal African Legion. Garvey attracted more than 50,000 people to the event and in his cause. The UNIA had more than one million due paying members at its peak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The national level of support in Jamaica helped Garvey to become one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mugleston|first=William|title=Garvey, Marcus|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00257.html?a=1&amp;n=marcus%20garvey&amp;d=10&amp;ss=0&amp;q=1|publisher=American National Biography|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and family ==
At the age of 32 in 1919, Garvey married his first wife, [[Amy Ashwood Garvey]]. Amy Ashwood Garvey was also a founder of The UNIA-ACL. They divorced in 1922. Amy Ashwood was a very active Pan-Africanist, social worker and activist for women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=editor|first1=Black History Studies Ltd publisher|title=25 Facts about Marcus Mosiah Garvey|date=2009|url=http://www.blackhistorystudies.com/resources/resources/25-facts-about-marcus-mosiah-garvey/.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, he married again, to [[Amy Jacques Garvey]], who was working as his secretary general. They had two sons together, Marcus Mosiah Garvey III, who was born 17 September 1930, and Julius Winston Garvey  (born in 1933 on the same date). Amy Jacques Garvey played an important role in his career, and would become a lead worker in Garvey's movement. She was instrumental in teaching people about Marcus Garvey after he died.&lt;ref name="Correction" /&gt;

== Views on communism ==

{{quote box|width=23em|"Fundamentally what racial difference is there between a white Communist, Republican or Democrat?"|—Marcus Garvey&lt;ref name=klansman /&gt;}}
Garvey is known as a leading political figure because of his determination to fight for the unity of [[African American]]s by creating the Universal Negro Improvement Association and rallying to gather supporters to fight. With this group he touched upon many topics such as education, the economy, and independence. An important aspect of his career was his thoughts on [[communism]]. Garvey felt that communism would be more beneficial for whites by solving their own political and economic problems, but would further limit the success of blacks rising together. He believed that the Communist Party wanted to use the African-American vote "to smash and overthrow" the capitalistic white majority to "put their majority group or race still in power, not only as communists but as white men" (Jacques-Garvey, 1969). The Communist Party wanted to have as many supporters as possible, even if it meant having blacks, but Garvey discouraged this. Communists were, as he saw it, white men who wanted to manipulate blacks so they could continue to have control over them. Garvey said, "It is a dangerous theory of economic and political reformation because it seeks to put government in the hands of an ignorant white mass who have not been able to destroy their natural prejudices towards Negroes and other non-white people. While it may be a good thing for them, it will be a bad thing for the Negroes who will fall under the government of the most ignorant, prejudiced class of the white race" (Nolan, 1951).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Shawn|title=Western Journal of Black Studies|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/200342374?accountid=14068|publisher=Washington State University Press|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicts with Du Bois and others ==
On 4 October 1916, the ''[[The Daily Gleaner (Jamaica)|Daily Gleaner]]'' in Kingston published a letter written by [[Raphael Morgan]], a Jamaican-American priest of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]], together with over a dozen other like-minded Jamaican Americans, who wrote in to protest against Garvey's lectures.&lt;ref&gt;"Letter Denouncing Marcus Garvey".

University of California Press, 1983. pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey's views on  Jamaica, they felt, were damaging to both the reputation of their homeland and its people, enumerating several objections to Garvey's stated preference for the prejudice of the American whites over that of English whites.&lt;ref&gt;Fr.

While [[W. E. B.

He is either a lunatic or a traitor."&lt;ref name="The Crisis"&gt;Du Bois, ''[[The Crisis]]'', Vol. 28, May 1924, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois considered Garvey's program of complete separation a capitulation to white supremacy; a tacit admission that Blacks could never be equal to Whites. Noting how popular the idea was with racist thinkers and politicians, Du Bois feared that Garvey threatened the gains made by his own movement.&lt;ref name="The Crisis" /&gt;

Garvey suspected that Du Bois was prejudiced against him because he was a Caribbean native with darker skin. Du Bois once described Garvey as "a little, fat black man; ugly, but with intelligent eyes and a big head".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6y4hbFXFtv8C&amp;pg=PA233|title=The Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association papers|first1=Robert A.|last1=Hill|first2=Marcus|last2=Garvey|first3=Deborah|last3=Forczek|author4=Universal Negro Improvement Association|accessdate=2009-07-09|isbn=978-0-520-05817-0|publisher=University of California Press|year=1987|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey called Du Bois "purely and simply a white man's nigger" and "a little Dutch, a little French, a little Negro … a mulatto … a monstrosity".

Garvey recognized the influence of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and, after the Black Star Line was closed, sought to engage the South in his activism, since the UNIA now lacked a specific program. In early 1922, he went to Atlanta for a conference with KKK imperial giant [[Edward Young Clarke]], seeking to advance his organization in the South. Garvey made a number of incendiary speeches in the months leading up to that meeting; in some, he thanked the whites for Jim Crow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Judith|title=The world of Marcus Garvey : race and class in modern society|date=1991|publisher=Louisiana State UP|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=978-0-8071-1670-8|pages=154–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNguYqqHaQAC&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Garvey once stated: "I regard the Klan, the Anglo-Saxon clubs and White American societies, as far as the Negro is concerned, as better friends of the race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together. I like honesty and fair play.

At the National Conference of the Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1921, a Los Angeles delegate named [[Noah Thompson]] spoke on the floor complaining about the lack of transparency in the group's financial accounts. When accounts were prepared Thompson highlighted several sections with what he felt were irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-516779-5 | pages = 323‒327 | editors = Finkelman, Paul (ed.) | last = Leonard | first = Kevin Allen | title = California | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of African American History: 1896 to the Present; from the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-first Century | location = Oxford | date = 2 February 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&amp;pg=PA323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1922, charges of mail fraud were brought against Garvey. In the month following another indictment was made for mail fraud and conspiracy against him and three of his associates. The trial was postponed for another 11 months for a third indictment of an additional mail-fraud charge.&lt;ref name="Asakia 1987"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Muhammad |first1=Asakia |title=A Mistreated Black Pioneer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1987/08/16/a-mistreated-black-pioneer/f32d2785-446b-4e89-a88a-68cd76668811/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.ed6fd7a1f8dc |accessdate=10 August 2018 |publisher=Washington Post |date=16 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accusation centered on the fact that the [[corporation]] had not yet purchased a ship, which had appeared in a BSL brochure emblazoned with the name "[[Phyllis Wheatley]]" (after the African-American poet) on its [[bow (ship)|bow]]. The prosecution stated that a ship pictured with that name had not actually been purchased by the BSL and still had the name "Orion" at the time; thus the misrepresentation of the ship as a BSL-owned vessel constituted fraud. The brochure had been produced in anticipation of the purchase of the ship, which appeared to be on the verge of completion at the time. However, "registration of the Phyllis Wheatley to the Black Star Line was thrown into abeyance as there were still some clauses in the contract that needed to be agreed."&lt;ref name="col" /&gt; In the end, the ship was never registered to the BSL.&lt;ref name="Martin 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |first1=Tony |title=Race First: The Ideological and Organizational Struggles of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association |date=2001 |publisher=Majority Press, US; 2nd Revised edition edition (1 Jan. 2001) |isbn=978-0912469232 |page=160 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VhsWRMMBNdIC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were serious accounting irregularities within the Black Star Line and the claims he used to sell Black Star Line stock could be considered misleading, Garvey's supporters contend that the prosecution was a politically motivated [[miscarriage of justice]].&lt;ref name="marcusgarvey.com"&gt;[http://www.marcusgarvey.com/wmprint.php?ArtID=272 Application for Executive Clemency by Marcus Garvey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714033712/http://www.marcusgarvey.com/wmprint.php?ArtID=272 |date=14 July 2011 }}, Marcusgarvey.com.

Healy|Leo Healy]], who had been, before becoming District Attorney, an attorney with Harris McGill and Co., the sellers of the first ship, the S.S. ''Yarmouth'', to the Black Star Line Inc., was a key witness for the government during the trial. Garvey chose to defend himself. In the opinion of his biographer Colin Grant, Garvey's "belligerent" manner alienated the jury. "In Garvey’s interminable three-hour-long closing address, he portrayed himself as an unfortunate and selfless leader, surrounded by incompetents and thieves....Garvey was belligerent where perhaps grace, humility and even humour were called for".&lt;ref name="col"&gt;Grant, ''Negro with a Hat'' (2008), pp. 288; 371.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer defending one of the other charged men took a different approach, emphasising that the so-called fraud was nothing more than a naive mistake, and that no criminal conspiracy existed. "The truth is there is no such thing as any conspiracy. [But] if the indictment had been framed against the defendants for discourtesy, mismanagement or display of bad judgement they would have pleaded guilty."&lt;ref name="col" /&gt; Of the four Black Star Line officers charged in connection with the enterprise, only Garvey was found guilty of using the mail service to defraud. His supporters called the trial fraudulent.

When the trial ended on 23 June 1923, Garvey had been sentenced to five years in prison and a $1000 fine and court costs. The sentence to be served in the U.S. penitentiary in Atlanta. The transcript of the trial ran to 2,816 pages.&lt;ref name="Asakia 1987" /&gt; Garvey blamed [[Jews|Jewish]] jurors and a Jewish federal judge, [[Julian Mack]], for his conviction.&lt;ref name="marcusgarveylife"&gt;{{cite book

After numerous attempts at appeal over 18 months&lt;ref name="Asakia 1987" /&gt; were unsuccessful, he was taken into custody and began serving his sentence at the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta Federal Penitentiary]] on 8 February 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/garvey/sfeature/sf_forum_13.html|title=Online Forum: Marcus Garvey vs. United States|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he penned his well-known "First Message to the Negroes of the World From Atlanta Prison", wherein he made his famous proclamation: "Look for me in the whirlwind or the storm, look for me all around you, for, with God's grace, I shall come and bring with me countless millions of black slaves who have died in America and the West Indies and the millions in Africa to aid you in the fight for Liberty, Freedom and Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/garvey/filmmore/ps_wind.html|title=First Message to the Negroes of the World from Atlanta Prison|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Judith Stein has stated, "his politics were on trial."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Judith, "Pardon Marcus Garvey", ''New York Times'', 5 November 1983, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey's sentence was eventually commuted by President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. Upon his release in November 1927, Garvey was deported via [[New Orleans]] to [[Jamaica]], where a large crowd met him at Orrett's Wharf in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Though the popularity of the UNIA diminished greatly following Garvey's expulsion, he nevertheless remained committed to his political ideals.&lt;ref name=Skyers&gt;Skyers, Sophia Teresa (1982).

== Later years ==
In 1928, Garvey travelled to [[Geneva]] to present the Petition of the Negro Race. This petition outlined the worldwide abuse of Africans to the [[League of Nations]]. In September 1929, he founded the [[People's Political Party (Jamaica)|People's Political Party]] (PPP), Jamaica's first modern political party, which focused on [[workers' rights]], [[education]], and aid to the poor. Also in 1929, Garvey was elected councilor for the Allman Town Division of the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). In July 1929, the Jamaican property of the UNIA was seized on the orders of the [[Fiennes Barrett-Lennard|Chief Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy jacques-Garvey, [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00090030/00017/4j "The Political Activities of Marcus Garvey in Jamaica"], ''Jamaican Journal'', Vol. 6, No. 2 (June 1972), pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Garvey and his solicitor attempted to persuade people not to bid for the confiscated goods, claiming the sale was illegal and Garvey made a political speech in which he referred to corrupt judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demercado.com/Volume%205-Final--exceptno8.htm|title=Ansell Hart|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121013313/http://www.demercado.com/Volume%205-Final--exceptno8.htm|archivedate=21 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was cited for [[contempt of court]] and again appeared before the Chief Justice. He received a prison sentence, as a consequence of which he lost his seat. However, in 1930, Garvey was re-elected, unopposed, along with two other PPP candidates.

In April 1931, Garvey launched the Edelweiss Amusement Company. He set the company up to help artists earn their livelihood from their craft. Several Jamaican entertainers—[[Kidd Harold]], [[Ernest Cupidon]], [[Bim &amp; Bam]], and [[Ranny Williams]]—went on to become popular after receiving initial exposure that the company gave them. In 1935, Garvey left Jamaica for [[London]]. He lived and worked in London until his death in 1940. During these last five years, Garvey remained active and in touch with events in [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|war-torn Ethiopia]] (then known as [[Habesha|Abyssinia]]) and in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. In 1937, he wrote the poem ''Ras Nasibu Of Ogaden''&lt;ref&gt;Poem- [http://www.africawithin.com/garvey/ras_nasibu.htm Ras Nasibu of the Ogaden]&lt;/ref&gt; in honor of Ethiopian Army Commander (''[[Ras (title)|Ras]]'') [[Nasibu Emmanual]]. In 1938, he gave evidence before the [[West India Royal Commission]] on conditions there. Also in 1938 he set up the School of African Philosophy in [[Toronto]] to train UNIA leaders. He continued to work on the magazine ''The Black Man''.

While imprisoned Garvey had corresponded with [[racial segregation|segregationist]] [[Earnest Sevier Cox]] who was lobbying for legislation to "repatriate" African Americans to Africa. Garvey's philosophy of black racial self-reliance could be combined with Cox's [[White Nationalism]] – at least in sharing the common goal of an African Homeland. Cox dedicated his short pamphlet "Let My People Go" to Garvey, and Garvey in return advertised Cox' book "White America" in UNIA publications.&lt;ref name="Jackson2005p32"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Science for Segregation: Race, Law, and the Case against Brown v. Board of Education |last=Jackson |first= John P. |publisher=[[NYU Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8147-4271-6|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1936, Garvey travelled from London to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, for five days of speeches and appearances.  The Universal Negro Improvement Association had purchased a hall on [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] in that city and a convention was held, where Garvey was the principal speaker. His five-day visit was front-page news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Edwards |title=Black history looms large at busy corner |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=26 January 1998 |p=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, a group of Garvey's rivals called the [[Peace Movement of Ethiopia]] openly collaborated with the United States Senator from [[Mississippi]], [[Theodore Bilbo]], and Earnest Sevier Cox in the promotion of a repatriation scheme introduced in the US Congress as the [[Greater Liberia Act]]. Bilbo, an outspoken supporter of [[racial segregation|segregation]] and [[white supremacy]] and, attracted by the ideas of [[black separatism|black separatists]] like Garvey, proposed an amendment to the federal work-relief bill on 6 June 1938, proposing to deport 12 million black Americans to [[Liberia]] at federal expense to relieve unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography, 1943'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; He took the time to write a book entitled ''Take Your Choice, Separation or Mongrelization'', advocating the idea. Garvey praised him in return, saying that Bilbo had "done wonderfully well for the Negro".&lt;ref&gt;Sundiata, ''Brothers and Strangers'' (2003), p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Evangeline Rondon Paterson, the future grandmother of the 55th Governor of New York State, [[David Paterson]], served as his secretary.

[[File:MarcusGarveyBluePlaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 53 Talgarth Road, London]]
Garvey died in London on 10 June 1940, at the age of 52, having suffered two [[stroke]]s,  after reading a mistaken, and negative, obituary of himself in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' in January earlier that same year, which stated, in part, that Garvey died "broke, alone and unpopular." Due to travel restrictions during [[World War II]], his body was interred (no burial mentioned but preserved in a lead-lined coffin) within the lower crypt in St. Mary's Catholic cemetery in London near Kensal Green Cemetery. In 1964, his body was removed from the shelves of the lower crypt and taken to Jamaica, where the government proclaimed him Jamaica's first national hero and re-interred him at a shrine in the [[National Heroes Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jnht.com/site_monument_marcus_garvey.php|title=Jamaica National Heritage Trust - Jamaica - Monument Rt Excellent Marcus Garvey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London a [[blue plaque]] was placed outside the house where Garvey once resided at 53 [[Talgarth Road]], [[Kensington]], and a second blue plaque was placed outside 2 Beaumont Crescent, London, the offices of the UNIA where Marcus Garvey and UNIA members conducted their work. There is also a small park named after him between [[North End Road, Fulham|North End Road]] and [[Hammersmith Road]] near [[Olympia (London)|Olympia]], and a library in [[Tottenham]].

[[File:Flag of the UNIA.svg|thumb|The [[Red, black and green flag|UNIA flag]] uses three colors: red, black and green.]]

Schools, colleges, highways, and buildings in Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, and the United States have been named in his honor. The UNIA [[red, black, and green]] flag has been adopted as the Black Liberation Flag. Since 1980, Garvey's bust has been housed in the [[Organization of American States]]' Hall of Heroes in [[Washington, D.C.]]

[[Malcolm X]]'s parents, Earl and Louise Little, met at a UNIA convention in [[Montreal]].

[[Kwame Nkrumah]] named the national shipping line of [[Ghana]] the Black Star Line in honor of Garvey and the UNIA. Nkrumah also named the national [[football (soccer)|football]] team the [[Ghana national football team|Black Stars]] as well.

=== Garvey as religious symbol ===

==== Rastafari ====

[[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] consider Garvey to be a [[religious]] [[prophet]], and sometimes even the [[reincarnation]] of [[Saint John the Baptist]]. This is partly because of his frequent statements uttered in speeches throughout the 1920s, usually along the lines of "Look to Africa, when a black king shall be crowned, for the day of deliverance is at hand!"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. G., Roy Augier and Rex Nettleford, ''The Rastafari Movement in Kingston, Jamaica'', Kingston: 1960, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

His beliefs deeply influenced the Rastafari, who took his statements as a prophecy of the crowning of [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]]. Early Rastas were associated with his [[Back-to-Africa movement]] in Jamaica. This early Rastafari movement was also influenced by a separate, proto-Rasta movement known as the [[Afro-Athlican Church]] that was outlined in a religious text known as the [[Holy Piby]]—where Garvey was proclaimed to be a prophet as well. Garvey himself never identified with the Rastafari movement,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/people/marcusgarvey.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=Marcus Garvey|first=Tony|last=Martin|date=21 October 2009|accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was, in fact, raised as a [[Methodist]] who went on to become a [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Colin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CBlxVYgwwSMC&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;ots=97Z2LSOsQ6&amp;dq=marcus%20garvey%20catholicism&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=marcus%20garvey%20catholicism&amp;f=false ''Negro with a Hat: The Rise and Fall of Marcus Garvey''], OUP, 2008, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Moorish Science Temple of America ====

Members of the [[Moorish Science Temple of America]] honor Marcus Garvey as a "[[Saint John the Baptist]] like" forerunner to their organization's Prophet founder, Noble Drew Ali, as evident in Chapter 48:2-3 of their scripture:

"John the Baptist was the forerunner of Jesus in those days, to warn and stir up the nation and prepare them to receive the divine creed which was to be taught by Jesus.  In these modern days there came a forerunner, who was divinely prepared by the great God-Allah and his name is Marcus Garvey ...." &lt;ref&gt;Moorish Holy Koran - https://hermetic.com/moorish/7koran&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memorials ==

Garvey is remembered through a number of memorials worldwide. Most of them are in Jamaica, England and the United States; others are in Canada and several nations in Africa.

[[File:Jamaica 20 dollars.jpg|thumb|A Jamaican 20-dollar coin shows Garvey on its face.]]

===Jamaica===
Garvey was given major prominence as a [[National Heroes of Jamaica|national hero]] during Jamaica's move towards independence. The first major memorial of Garvey in Jamaica is statue and shrine in Kingston's [[National Heroes Park]]. Among the honors to him in Jamaica are his name upon the Jamaican Ministry of Foreign Affairs; a major highway bearing his name and the Marcus Garvey Scholarship tenable at the [[University of the West Indies]] sponsored by The National Association of Jamaican and Supportive Organizations, Inc (NAJASO) since 1988.

Garvey's birthplace, 32 Market Street, St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, has a marker signifying it as a site of importance in the nation's history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jnht.com/site_32_market_street.php 32 Market Street], 16 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His likeness is on the 20-dollar coin and 25-cent coin.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====Marcus Garvey Day====
In 2012 the Jamaica government declared August 17 as Marcus Garvey Day. The Governor General's proclamation stated “from here on every year this time, all of us here in Jamaica will be called to mind to remember this outstanding National Hero and what he has done for us as a people, and our children will call this to mind also on this day" and went on to say “to proclaim and make known that the 17th Day of August in each year shall be designated as Marcus Garvey Day and shall so be observed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gov't Declares August 17 Marcus Garvey Day |url=https://jis.gov.jm/govt-declares-august-17-marcus-garvey-day/ |website=Jamaican Information Service |publisher=Government of Jamaica |accessdate=10 July 2018 |date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
Garvey's memory is maintained in several locations in Africa. [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] and [[Enugu]], [[Nigeria]] have streets bearing his name, while the township of [[Khayelitsha]], [[Cape Town, South Africa]], put his name on an entire neighborhood. [[Yenagoa]], [[Bayelsa State]], [[Nigeria]] has a library named for him. A bust of Garvey was created and is on display at a park in the central region in [[Ghana]], along with one of [[Martin Luther King]].

=== England ===
Garvey's influence is acknowledged through a number of sites in England, most of which are in London:
* The [[Marcus Garvey Library]] is inside the [[Tottenham Green]] Leisure Centre building in [[North London]].
* There is a street named Marcus Garvey Way in [[Brixton]], London, as well as Marcus Garvey Mews in [[East Dulwich]], London.
* A [[blue plaque]] marks 53 Talgarth Road, [[Hammersmith]], London, as his residence.&lt;blockquote&gt;GARVEY, Marcus (1887–1940) Pan-Africanist Leader, died here, 53 Talgarth Road, W14. [Hammersmith and Fulham 2005]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The [[Marcus Garvey Centre]] in [[Lenton, Nottingham]], England, is named in his honour
* There is a statue of Garvey in [[Willesden Green]] Library, Brent, London.
* There is a memorial park behind Hammersmith Road, named after him called Marcus Garvey Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/marcus+garvey+park,+w14/data=!4m2!2m1!4b1?dg=dbrw&amp;newdg=1|title=Google Maps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The West Brompton train station restroom contains a street artist's rendition of a portrait of Garvey.

=== United States ===
The United States is the country where Garvey not only rose to prominence, but also cultivated many of his ideas.

The [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City, is home to Marcus Garvey Village, whose construction was completed in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/nyregion/in-marcus-garvey-village-a-housing-solution-gone-awry.html|title=In Marcus Garvey Village, a Housing Solution Gone Awry|last=Bellafante|first=Ginia|date=2013-06-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building complex is home to the first energy storage [[Microgrids|microgrid]] at an affordable housing property in the country. It will use the energy storage system to cut electricity costs, improve grid reliability, and provide backup power during extended outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cleanegroup.org/ceg-projects/resilient-power-project/featured-installations/marcus-garvey-apartments/|title=Marcus Garvey Apartments - Clean Energy Group|work=Clean Energy Group|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harlem]], in [[New York City]], was the site of the UNIA Liberty Hall and many events of significance in Garvey's life. There is a [[Marcus Garvey Park|park bearing his name]] and a [[New York Public Library]] branch dedicated to him, as well. A major street bears his name in the historically [[African-American]] [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood of [[Bedford Stuyvesant]].

A Marcus Garvey Cultural Center, [[University of Northern Colorado]] ([[Greeley, Colorado]]). The National Association of Jamaican and Supportive Organizations Inc. (NAJASO) founded on 4 July 1977 in Washington DC), based in the United States, named Annual Scholarship tenable at the University of the West Indies since 1988, the Marcus Garvey Scholarship. Marcus Garvey Festival every year on the third weekend of August at Basu Natural Farms, in Pembroke Township, Illinois. The [[Universal Hip Hop Parade]] held annually in [[Brooklyn]] on the Saturday before his birthday to carry on his use of [[popular culture]] as a tool of empowerment and to encourage the growth of [[African American culture|Black institutions]]. Since 1980, Garvey's bust has been housed in the [[Organization of American States]]' Hall of Heroes in Washington, D.C.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, Marcus Garvey Day is held annually on 17 August in [[Toronto]]; there is a Marcus Garvey Centre for Unity, in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], and the Marcus Garvey Centre for Leadership and Education in the [[Jane-Finch]] area of [[Toronto]]. His 1919 Toronto UNIA Headquarters (home to the School of African Philosophy) located at 355 College St, Toronto is today a Roots Reggae nightclub called Thymeless Bar &amp; Grill. The original UNIA markings are at the foot of the front door.

'''Mario Maccaferri''' (1900–1993) was an Italian [[luthier]], classical guitarist, businessman, and inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Maestro to Mastro: The Life, Music, and Instruments of Mario Maccaferri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hcqJShlbpJoC|year=2008|publisher=University of Memphis|isbn=978-1-109-07389-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted for designing the guitar favored by jazz musician [[Django Reinhardt]], and for inventing the plastic clothespin, plastic bath and kitchen tiles and the plastic Islander [[ukulele]] which sold millions of copies in the mid-1900s. From 1939 he lived and worked in the United States. As of 2016 his daughter Elaine still runs the family company French American Reeds Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchamericanreeds.com/historyfull/ |title=History |publisher=Frenchamericanreeds.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Maccaferri was born in [[Cento]], Emilia-Romagna. At the age of 11 he was apprenticed to luthier [[Luigi Mozzani]] and took up the classical guitar. By 1923 he had established a reputation as a player and maker of classical guitars.&lt;ref name="Button2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Button|title=Julian Bream: The Foundations of a Musical Career|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1RsKTJVTt-gC&amp;pg=PA62|date=November 2005|publisher=Bold Strummer Limited|isbn=978-1-57784-067-1|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
In 1933, Maccaferri injured his right hand in a swimming pool accident, ending his career as a concert performer, though he continued to work as a luthier and inventor.&lt;ref name="Button2005"/&gt;

==Lutherie designs==
Maccaferri is best-known for designing the [[Selmer Maccaferri guitar]] played by [[Gypsy jazz]] legend [[Django Reinhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Michael |url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/1742/maccaferri-history/ |title=Maccaferri History &amp;#124; Vintage GuitarÂŽ magazine |publisher=Vintageguitar.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maccferri's innovations extended to materials as well: he was an early adopter of laminate backs and sides for guitars, and for instruments made entirely of plastic.

===Plastic instruments===
[[File:Maccaferri G40 DeLuxe Arch-top - Plastic Mac.jpg|right|thumb|Maccaferri plastic guitar]]
In 1941, Maccaferri patented a plastic woodwind reed, in 1947 patented a plastic clothespin, and in 1949 launched his line of plastic "Islander" ukuleles in collaboration with television star [[Arthur Godfrey]], which would sell into the millions of units.&lt;ref name="Hunter2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dave Hunter|title=365 Guitars, Amps &amp; Effects You Must Play: The Most Sublime, Bizarre and Outrageous Gear Ever|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZgOo8qmQDUC&amp;pg=PA46|date=15 May 2013|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-4366-1|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Maccaferri produced a line of plastic guitars, but they had little commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgs.usd.edu/nmm/PluckedStrings/Guitars/Maccaferri/10458/G40Guitar.html |title=Maccaferri Guitars |publisher=National Music Museum |date= |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bacon2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Bacon|title=The Ultimate Guitar Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo4TQqP9lPkC&amp;pg=PA65|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Race Point Publishing|isbn=978-1-937994-04-4|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career and up until his death, Maccaferri worked on the design for a plastic violin, which in 1990 was used at a performance at [[Carnegie Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Experimental Musical Instruments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAowAQAAIAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Experimental Musical Instruments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summerfield1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice J.

'''Mikhail Ivanovich Tereshchenko''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Ива́нович Тере́щенко}}; {{lang-uk|Михайло Іванович Терещенко}}) (18 March 1886, in [[Kiev]] – 1 April 1956, in [[Monaco]]) was the [[foreign minister]] of [[Russia]] from 18 May 1917 to 7 November 1917 {{small|([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]])}}. He was also a major Ukrainian landowner, the proprietor of several [[sugar]] factories, and a [[financier]].

==Biography==
Born to a rich [[Tereshchenko family]] of a sugar factory owners, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and art patrons of [[Ivan Tereshchenko|Ivan Nikolaevich]] (1854–1903) and [[Elizabeth Sarancheva|Elizabeth Mikhailovna]]. Mikhail had a younger brother Mykola (1894-?). His uncle Aleksandr Tereshchenko (1856–1911) worked in [[Saint-Petersburg]]. Mikhail Tereshchenko graduated from [[Kiev University]] and [[Leipzig University]]. In 1910, he joined the [[Freemasonry]] and became one of the five prominent Masons in [[Russia]] (the other four being [[Aleksandr Konovalov (politician, born 1875)|Aleksandr Konovalov]], [[Alexander Kerensky]], [[Nikolai Vissarionovich Nekrasov|Nikolai Nekrasov]], and [[Ivan Nikolayevich Yefremov|Ivan Yefremov]]). Mikhail Tereshchenko was a member of the Fourth [[State Duma of the Russian Empire#Fourth Duma|State Duma]] (he shared the views of the [[Russian Progressive Party]]). In 1912&amp;ndash;1914, Tereshchenko was the owner of a private [[publishing house]] ''Sirin'' in [[St Petersburg]], which published [[Andrey Bely]]'s pioneering novel [[Petersburg (novel)|Petersburg]] in three installments in 1913-14. During [[World War I]], he took part in organizing the [[Red Cross]] hospitals. In 1915&amp;ndash;1917, Mikhail Tereshchenko was the chairman of the [[Military Industry Committee]] of the Kiev district and deputy chairman of the All-Russian Military Industry Committee.

After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Mikhail Tereshchenko was appointed Minister of Finance of the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Kerensky Government]]. In April 1917, Tereshchenko (together with Kerensky and Nekrasov) was actively seeking to create a governmental interparty coalition with the Socialists. On 5 May 1917, he was appointed minister of foreign affairs after the resignation of [[Pavel Milyukov]]. Tereshchenko continued his foreign policy course, which led to his conflict with [[Minister of War]] [[Alexander Verkhovsky]], who had considered Russia to be unable to continue the war. He was a member of the [[Directorate (Russia)|Directorate]] in September 1917. Tereshchenko was known to support the Ukrainian government that led to the establishment and recognition of the [[General Secretariat of Ukraine|General Secretariat]] in Ukraine 1917.

On the night of 26 October, Mikhail Tereshchenko was arrested in the [[Winter Palace]] with other ministers of the Provisional Government and placed into the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] while his office was temporarily held by [[Anatoly Neratov]]. In the spring of 1918, Tereshchenko escaped from prison and fled to [[Norway]] with the [[Tereshchenko diamond|Tereshchenko blue diamond]], sold in 1984 for $4.6 million, by Christie's later on, to Robert Mouawad, a famous Lebanese jeweller. Tereshchenko was one of the supporters of [[Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War|allied intervention]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. In 1920s and 1930s, he was engaged in financial activities in [[France]] and [[Madagascar]].

==Personal life==
Tereshenko was an active member of the irregular [[freemasonic]] lodge, the [[Grand Orient of Russia’s Peoples]].&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;

'''NIRAS''' A/S is an international consulting group, with 38 offices in 26 countries in Europe, Asia and Africa, specialising in engineering and professional services, headquartered in Alleroed, Denmark. NIRAS provides engineering, planning, project management and other services for all aspects of the built environment, focusing on traditional construction projects like railroads, harbours, complex buildings, such as large hospitals, as well as environment, [[climate and energy]] – traditional energy as well as renewable and green energy – and sustainable development consulting.

Nielsen (born 1924) and Konrad Rauschenberger (1924-2015). Rauschenberg, originally
from Hungary, fled to Denmark under dramatic circumstances as a blind passenger
on a transport train for troops during WW2. In 1956 he, now a Danish citizen, together
with Danish engineer Jørgen Kristian Nielsen founded the consulting engineering
firm Nielsen and Rauschenberger. Later it was renamed N &amp; R Gruppen A/S -
now NIRAS.

'''Ownership'''

NIRAS is a
private limited group with NIRAS Fonden (The NIRAS Trust) as majority
shareholder (73 percent) in the operational group holding company NIRAS Gruppen
A/S, which holds shares in all other NIRAS-companies. The rest of the shares in
NIRAS Gruppen A/S are owned by employees.

'''Activities'''

NIRAS has been involved in

· renewable and green energy, e.g. more than 70 wind energy projects since 1986 in Northern Europe and Asia. Most projects offshore

· improving public utilities and water network management systems, and improvement of water supply and sanitation services in Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa

· helping more than 150 companies in different parts of the world to identify their potential for industrial symbioses and improved utilization of resources

The '''Paddington Waterside''' Partnership is the body coordinating regeneration of the Paddington Special Policy Area around [[Paddington Station]] in [[London]]. The project covers an area almost the size of [[Soho]], creating about {{convert|10000000|sqft|m2}} of space between 1998 and 2018.

It consists of 13 individual projects in the triangle of land between [[Praed Street]], Westbourne Terrace and the A40 [[Westway (London)|Westway]], most notably PaddingtonCentral&lt;!-- no space --&gt; and [[Paddington Basin]]. In 2000, the ''Independent'' described it as "the largest central London redevelopment scheme since the Second World War".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Paddington project given green light | first=Saeed | last=Shah | date=18 October 2000 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/paddington-project-given-green-light-635682.html | location=London | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:One-three-kingdom-street.jpg|thumb|One and Three Kingdom Street from the south.]]
The Paddington Arm of the [[Grand Junction Canal]] opened on 10 July 1801,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=The Union magazine, and imperial register, Volume 2 | publisher =J. Walker | year=1801 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWcAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA67 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; linking Paddington to the Bull's Bridge junction near the future site of [[Heathrow Airport]]. The Grand Junction (now part of the [[Grand Union Canal]]) was the final link in a chain of canals that reduced the distance from London to Birmingham from {{convert|269.5|mi|km|0}} in 1789 to {{convert|138.5|mi|km|0}} in 1805;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Transport in the industrial revolution | first1=Derek Howard  | last1= Aldcroft | first2=Michael J. | last2=Freeman | publisher = Manchester University Press | year=1983 | isbn=978-0-7190-0839-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tX27AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA108 | page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; terminating the canal at Paddington gave easy access to main roads into London and the level route meant no [[lock (water transport)|locks]] were needed on its {{convert|13.5|mi|km|0|adj=on}} length. In contrast the [[Regent's Canal]] needed 12 locks for the {{convert|86|ft|m|adj=on}} descent from Paddington to the Thames at Limehouse.

The canal was an instant success, with warehouses and housing springing up around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Victoria history of the county of Middlesex | year=1911 | first=William | last=Page | volume=2 | publisher=Constable | location=London | url=https://archive.org/details/middlesexhistory02univuoft | page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canal traffic increased further when the Regent's Canal linked Paddington to the [[Port of London]] in 1820, but Paddington Basin was "practically killed" as a port&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=London's Coats of Arms and the Stories They Tell | first=Richard | last=Crosley | year=1928 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqSQ9K1gN4C&amp;pg=PA164 | page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; as business was lost to wharves such as [[City Road Basin]] that were closer to the docks and the [[City of London]]. Paddington regained importance as a transport interchange with the arrival of the railway in 1838.

Canal traffic transferred to the railways during the nineteenth century and fell away completely after World War II; the closure of the [[Regent's Canal Dock]] in 1969 marked the [[coup de grâce]]. A similar switch from rail to road [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948–1994|in the second half of the twentieth century]] left the Paddington goods yards redundant by the early 1980s. The land became derelict, with no public access to the canal land until 1987.&lt;ref name=McGhie&gt;{{cite news | title=The new arrivals at Paddington | first=Caroline | last=McGhie | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/4814516/The-new-arrivals-at-Paddington.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=13 May 2001 | accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paddington Special Policy Area was designated in 1988.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web | title=Paddington Special Policy Area Factsheet | url=http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/Paddington_Area_Factsheet_May_2009.pdf | publisher=Planning &amp; City Development Department, City of Westminster | date=May 2009 | accessdate=29 October 2010 | format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paddington Regeneration Partnership, later the Paddington Waterside Partnership, was formed in 1998 to coordinate the regeneration of the area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Paddington Waterside Partnership | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/ | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | year=2008 | accessdate=29 October 2010}} (Official website)&lt;/ref&gt; now designated as the Paddington Special Policy Area. This followed the establishment of the King's Cross Partnership in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=King's Cross Canal Action Plan | url=http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/media/documents/Kings_Cross_Canal_Action_Plan.pdf | format=pdf | publisher=British Waterways | accessdate=29 October 2010 | page=6 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215173351/http://britishwaterways.co.uk/media/documents/Kings_Cross_Canal_Action_Plan.pdf | archivedate=15 December 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a similar mix of railway and canal land around [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]], a project that became known as [[King's Cross Central]].

==Projects==
===PaddingtonCentral=== &lt;!-- the developers put no space between Paddington and Central, although secondary sources often insert one --&gt;
[[File:Paddington-central.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Kingdom Street from the north]]
Bishop's Bridge station, the original London passenger terminus of the [[Great Western Railway]] was on this site west of [[Bishop's Bridge]] Road. After Paddington was built, it was used for the railway's [[goods shed]]s until the 1980s. It is now a [[mixed-use development]], with offices, flats and retail units. Phase I is Sheldon Square which is named after Sir Joseph Sheldon, a Lord Mayor of London who in 1678 rebuilt what became the church of [[List of churches in the Diocese of London#Deanery of Westminster Paddington|St Mary's]] on Paddington Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=C R Elrington |first1=T F T | last1=Baker | first2=Diane K | last2=Bolton | first3=Patricia E C |last3=Croot | year=1989 | pages=252–259 | title=Paddington: Churches | series=A History of the County of Middlesex, Hampstead, Paddington | volume=9 | accessdate=18 October 2010 | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheldon Square has {{convert|630000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of built space&lt;ref name=PaddingtonCentral&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddingtoncentral/default.aspx | title=PaddingtonCentral | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | accessdate=18 October 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719022905/http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddingtoncentral/default.aspx | archivedate=19 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; built around a grass [[amphitheatre]] which features live music in summer.

=== Paddington Basin and Merchant Square ===
[[File:PaddBasin.jpg|thumb|Paddington Basin]]
{{main|Paddington Basin}}
Most of the land north of the canal basin is being developed under the banner of Merchant Square by European Land and Property as part of a joint venture between Simon and David Reuben (the [[Reuben brothers]]) and the Jarvis family. In all, the development around Paddington Basin will create {{convert|2000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of offices, homes, shops and leisure facilities,&lt;ref name=Basin&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddington-basin/default.aspx | title=Paddington Basin / Merchant Square | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | accessdate=29 October 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719023011/http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddington-basin/default.aspx | archivedate=19 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the western end being developed first.

A large square by the canal is planned for Merchant Square, along with business and retail barges moored alongside.&lt;ref name=Basin /&gt; The basin is known for its ingenious pedestrian bridges, such as [[The Rolling Bridge]] and the Fan Bridge, which has been operational since autumn 2014 and opens with the motion of a Japanese hand fan.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/4146/the-fan-bridge-paddingtons-new-landmark.html |title=The 'Fan Bridge': Paddington's new landmark |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 May 2013 | first= John| last=O'Cealleigh | accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Wharf Gardens===
[[File:North Wharf Gardens Site 1.png|thumbnail|View down Hermitage Street of North Wharf Gardens Site 1]]
Sandwiched between the Westway and the canal basin, the 1.5-hectare site of the former North Westminster Community School was omitted from the Paddington Special Policy Area as it was expected to remain in use for education.&lt;ref name=schoolplanning2010&gt;{{cite web | title=Adopted Planning Brief for the North Westminster Community School, North Wharf Road, W2 | url=http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/NWCS_Adopted_Planning_brief_with_appendices_March2010.pdf | publisher=City of Westminster | date=17 March 2010 | accessdate=29 October 2010 | format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.13}}  The decision to build the [[Paddington Academy]] and [[Westminster Academy (London)|Westminster Academy]] left the site available for redevelopment when the [[City of Westminster College]] moved to a new campus at the end of 2010.

In April 2012 [[Westminster City Council]] sold the site to Amwaj Property Limited, of [[Bahrain]], which commissioned London-based [[Assael Architecture]] to design a residentially-oriented [[mixed-use]] development, the first phase of which was scheduled for completion in 2015 at an estimated cost of £71 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assael.co.uk/content/north-wharf-gardens-paddington New neighbourhood in Paddington Basin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105073235/http://www.assael.co.uk/content/north-wharf-gardens-paddington |date=5 November 2013 }} Assael official website.

===Paddington Health Campus and St Mary's Hospital===
[[File:StMarysOldSection.jpg|right|thumb|[[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]]]]
{{main|St Mary's Hospital, London}}
St Mary's is a major teaching hospital with a long tradition of biomedical research, from the first synthesis of [[heroin]] to the discovery of [[penicillin]]. It is housed in buildings dating back to 1845 between Praed Street and Paddington Basin. In October 2000, the London Regional Office of the NHS approved a plan for a Paddington Health Campus that would replace three run-down hospitals - St Marys, the [[Royal Brompton Hospital|Royal Brompton]] and [[Harefield Hospital|Harefield]].&lt;ref name=nao&gt;{{cite web | title=Department of Health - The Paddington Health Campus scheme | url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0506/department_of_health_-_the_pad.aspx | publisher=National Audit Office | date= 19 May 2006 | accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial cost was estimated at £411m at 2005 prices with completion in 2006,&lt;ref name=nao /&gt; to be financed by [[private finance initiative|PFI]],&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4994254.stm | title='Super-hospital' failure slammed | publisher=BBC News | date=19 May 2006 | accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it became apparent that the scheme was too big for the original St Mary's site.&lt;ref name=nao /&gt; Various locations north of the canal basin were investigated but the scheme was finally abandoned in May 2005 after costs had spiralled to £894m and the completion date put back to 2013.&lt;ref name=nao /&gt; £15m was spent on the project, leading [[Richard Bacon (politician)|a member]] of the Commons [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] to describe it as "an object lesson in how not to build hospitals....a shambles of the first order",&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; and [[Steve Webb|a colleague]] called it "incompetence on a massive scale".&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

The land north of the canal that had been earmarked for the Health Campus became the Merchant Square development in Paddington Basin (see above).&lt;ref name=merchant/&gt;  The planning application was formally withdrawn in May 2008&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt; but St Mary's remains part of the Paddington Waterside Partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/st-marys-hospital/default.aspx | title=St Mary's Hospital/Imperial College | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | accessdate=29 October 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719023223/http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/st-marys-hospital/default.aspx | archivedate=19 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only recent development work has been a £15m upgrade of the QEQM Wing.&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt;

'''Paolo Barilla''' (born 20 April 1961 in [[Milan]], Italy) is a former [[Formula One]] driver who raced for the [[Minardi]] team. He is one of the heirs of the vast [[Barilla Group|Barilla]] pasta empire and, as of January 2017, had a net worth of US$1.39 billion.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Billionaires: Paolo Barilla|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/paolo-barilla/|website=Forbes|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barilla started racing in 1975 and won the Italian 100cc [[karting]] title the following year. He entered [[Formula Fiat Abarth]] in 1980 and the next year moved up to [[Formula 3]], in which he won some races and finished third in the [[Italian F3|Italian Championship]]. He then entered [[Formula 2]] in 1982 with Minardi, but between 1983 and 1988 he concentrated in [[sports car racing]], winning [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] by a three-lap margin in 1985, among other victories, in the [[Joest Racing]] [[Porsche 956]], co-driven at various times with [[Klaus Ludwig]], [[Paul Belmondo]], [[Marc Duez]] and [[Louis Krages]] (also known at the time as John Winter).

In 1987 Barilla returned to single-seaters and raced in the Japanese [[Formula 3000]] Championship, before returning to Minardi in 1989 for a test. This test gave him the chance to replace [[Pierluigi Martini]] at [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Suzuka]] that year and afterwards was signed to drive for the team in 1990. Barilla wasn't quick enough to qualify regularly and was replaced before the end of the year by [[Gianni Morbidelli]].

Barilla then retired from racing and joined his family's businesses, where he and his two brothers own a 51 percent stake in the company. Upon his return to the corporation, he briefly filled in as the [[CEO]] before taking a more permanent position as a [[Vice-President]]. He has remained connected to motorsports, in part due to Barilla's sponsorship of [[Alex Zanardi]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Barilla was featured in a 2017 [[imdbtitle:7017474|documentary]] about the restoration of a [[Ferrari 312B]] historic Formula 1 race car.

'''Pol-Clovis, Baron Boël''' (2 August 1868 &amp;ndash; 13 July 1941) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrialist, Director of the ''[[Usines Gustave Boël]]'' in [[La Louvière]], and [[liberalism|liberal]] politician.

Born in [[La Louvière|Saint-Vaast]], he was a son of [[Gustave Boël]]. He married [[Marthe de Kerchove de Denterghem]].  They had 4 children (3 boys and 1 girl): [[René Boël]] (1899–1990) married first Yvonne Solvay (1896–1930) and later Mathilde de Jonghe d'Ardoye (1909 - 2008); [[Max Boël]] (1901 - 1975) married Anne Guinotte); [[Lucien Boël]] (1903 - ) married Micheline Mallet; and their daughter [[Marie-Anne Boël]] (1909 - 1996) married [[Charles-Emmanuel Janssen]].  
Pol-Clovis youngest sister [[Eva Ernestine Boël]] (1883–1956) married [[Felix Goblet d'Alviella]].

==Career==
When Gustave Boël died in 1912, his son Pol-Clovis carried on the diversification of the family business. One of his most prominent successes in this area was in chemicals with the ''Société anonyme de fabrication des engrais azoté'' (Safea) ([[nitrate]] [[fertilizers]]). Pol-Clovis also invested in [[UCB (company)|Union Chimique Belge (UCB)]], founded by [[Emmanuel Janssen]] (the father of his son-in-law Charles-Emmanuel Janssen), and in [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]], founded by [[Ernest Solvay]], the grandfather of his daughter-in-law [[Yvonne Solvay]].

In 1928, Pol-Clovis Boël founded a financial entity: ''l'Union financière Boël'', ancestor of several financial holdings, such as [[Sofina]], [[Henex]], [[Glaces de Moustier-sur-Sambre]]. After World War I, \Boël entered the world of Belgian finance, taking part in the creation of the [[Bank of Brussels]] and the [[Société Générale de Belgique]]. In 1929, he was granted the title of baron by King [[Albert I of Belgium]].

Pol Clovis died in [[Brussels]] in 1941.

&lt;!-- Don't mess with this line! --&gt;&lt;!-- Write your article below this line --&gt;
'''StoredIQ''' was a company founded for [[information lifecycle management]] (ILM) of unstructured data. Founded in 2001 as Deepfile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deepfile Comes to the Surface|url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/storage/deepfile-comes-surface/865316998|publisher=Network Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Austin, Texas]] by Jeff Erramouspe, Jeff Bone, Russell Turpin, Rudy Rouhana, Laura Arbilla and Brett Funderburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enterprise file management made easy|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2332452/wireless/deepfile.html|publisher=Network World}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company changed its name in 2005 to StoredIQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deep file Becomes StoredIQ|url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/storage/deepfile-becomes-storediq/1788209585|publisher=Network Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to operate successfully for over a decade until it was acquired in 2012 by IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM Extends ILG Suite and Big Data Governance with StoredIQ Acquisition|url=http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ecm-programs/Parity_Research_StoredIQ_Whitepaper.pdf|website=IBM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now serves as a platform for IBM's information life cycle governance, [[big data]] governance and [[enterprise content management]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=StoredIQ is now an IBM Company|url=https://www-01.ibm.com/software/info/storediq/|website=IBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

StoredIQ was awarded five patents by the USPTO. The first, originally filed in 2003, enabled unstructured data in file systems to be manipulated in a similar way to information stored in databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Method and apparatus for managing file systems and file-based data storage|url=http://patents.justia.com/assignee/storediq-inc|website=JUSTIA Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent patents only added to StoredIQ's market dominance by building upon the patented actionable file system with further enhancements specific to Enterprise Policy Management  and expanding the reach of StoredIQ's management capability all the way to individual desktops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patents by Assignee Storediq, Inc.|url=http://patents.justia.com/assignee/storediq-inc|website=JUSTIA Patents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 StoredIQ was recognized as "Best in Compliance" by Network Products Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=StoredIQ Wins Network Products Guide Award For Best In Compliance|url=http://www.datastorageconnection.com/doc/storediq-network-products-best-in-compliance-0001|publisher=Data Storage Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, StoredIQ was being recognized as a "Top 5 Provider" by the prestigious Socha-Gelbmann eDiscovery survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=StoredIQ Recognized With "Top 5 Provider" Rating In Socha-Gelbmann eDiscovery Survey|url=http://www.datastorageconnection.com/doc/torediq-ediscovery-survey-storage-0001|publisher=Data Storage Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incredible breath of information governance capability is what originally drew the attention of [[EMC Corporation]], StoredIQ's first potential acquirer. Initially a strategic investor in StoredIQ, many experts{{Who|date=August 2016}} predicted an inevitable acquisition. However, the company shunned their first suitor; leaving EMC to acquire a competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMC Acquires Kazeon, Stiffs StoredIQ|url=http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/emc-acquires-kazeon-stiffs-storediq/d/d-id/1082836?|publisher=Information Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company published a whitepaper titled ''The Truth About Big Data''. This promotion combined with StoredIQ's patented, technology led to [[IBM]] selecting StoredIQ as the basis for some products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butta|first1=Tom|title=The Truth Behind IBM’s Plans to Acquire Big Data Company, StoredIQ|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ibm-storediq_b_2377339|publisher=Huffington Post|date=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2096">'''Structured What If Technique''' (SWIFT) is a prospective hazards analysis method that uses structured brainstorming with guide words and prompts to identify risks,&lt;ref name="ward2012"&gt;Card AJ, Ward JR, Clarkson PJ: "Beyond FMEA: the structured what-if technique (SWIFT)." ''J Healthcare Risk Manage'' 2012, '''31''': 23–29&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of being quicker than more intensive methods like [[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA).&lt;ref name="crawley2003"&gt;Crawley F, Tyler B: ''Hazard identification methods.''

Final report, Patient Safety Research Portfolio (Research Project PS/035)."] Cambridge, UK: Engineering Design Centre, University of Cambridge; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
As with other methods, SWIFT may not be comprehensive and the approach has some limitations. In a healthcare context, SWIFT was found to reveal significant risks, but like similar methods (including healthcare failure mode and effects analysis) it may have limited validity when used in isolation.&lt;ref name="potts2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7897">'''Task management''' is the process of managing a [[Task (project management)|task]] through its life cycle. It involves planning, testing, tracking, and reporting. Task management can help either individual achieve goals, or groups of individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the accomplishment of collective goals.&lt;ref name="Journal of UKM"&gt;Maus, Heiko, M.P. van der Aalst, Wil, Rickayzen, Alan, Riss, Uwe. V. “Challenges for Business Processes and Task Management,” Journal of Universal Knowledge Management. Volume 0, Issue 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks are also differentiated by complexity, from low to high.&lt;ref name="Journal of UKM"/&gt;

Effective task management requires managing all aspects of a task, including its status, priority, time, human and financial resources assignments, recurrence, dependency, notifications and so on. These can be lumped together broadly into the basic activities of task management.

Managing multiple individuals or team tasks may be assisted by specialized software, for example [[workflow management system|workflow]] or [[project management software]]. In fact, many people{{who?|date=August 2018}} believe that task management should serve as a foundation for [[project management]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;Bianchi, Rich. “6 key elements for better Task Management,” Tech Republic. January 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Task management may form part of project management and [[process management]] and can serve as the foundation for efficient [[workflow]] in an organization. Project managers adhering to task-oriented management have a detailed and up-to-date project schedule, and are usually good at directing team members and moving the project forward.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Cutting "Relationship vs. Task Oriented Management". 3 March 2010 http://www.pmhut.com/relationship-vs-task-oriented-management&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task life cycle==
The status of tasks can be described by the following states:
* Ready
* Assigned
* Terminated
* Expired
* Forwarded
* Started
* Finished
* Verified
* Failed

The following state machine diagram describes different states of a task over its life cycle. This diagram is referenced from IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Cycle of Human Tasks|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQH9M_7.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.bpc.doc/doc/bpc/ctasklifecycle_todo.html|work=IBM WebSphere Process Server documentation|publisher=IBM|accessdate=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more up to date task's state machine diagram applicable to the new [[continuous delivery]] method could be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.binfire.com/blog/2018/02/anatomy-of-a-task/|title=Anatomy of a task|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TaskLifeCycle.png]]

==Activities supported by tasks==
As a discipline, task management embraces several key activities. Various conceptual breakdowns exist, and these, at a high-level, always include creative, functional, project, performance and service activities.
* Creative activities pertain to task creation. In context, these should allow for task planning, brainstorming, creation, elaboration, clarification, organization, reduction, targeting and preliminary prioritization.
* Functional activities pertain to personnel, sales, quality or other management areas, for the ultimate purpose of ensuring production of final goods and services for delivery to customers. In context these should allow for planning, reporting, tracking, prioritizing, configuring, delegating, and managing of tasks.
* Project activities pertain to planning and time and costs reporting. These can encompass multiple functional activities but are always greater and more purposeful than the sum of its parts. In context, project activities should allow for project task breakdown also known as [[work breakdown structure]], task allocation, inventory across projects, and concurrent access to task databases.
* Service activities pertain to client and internal company services provision, including customer relationship management and knowledge management. In context, these should allow for file attachment and links to tasks, document management, access rights management, inventory of client &amp; employee records, orders &amp; calls management, and annotating tasks.
* Performance activities pertain to tracking performance and fulfillment of assigned tasks. In context these should allow for tracking by time, cost control, stakeholders, and priority; charts, exportable reports, status updates, deadline adjustments, and activity logging.
* Report activities pertain to the presentation of information regarding the other five activities listed, including the graphical display.

==Task management software==
{{See also|:Category:Task management software}}
Task management software tools abound in the marketplace. Some are free; others intended for enterprise-wide deployment purposes. Some are simple to-do lists, while others boast enterprise-wide task creation, visualization, and notification capabilities - among others. Task management is used by small to Fortune 100 size companies. It does support simple individual projects to corporate task management activities.

[[Project management software]], [[calendaring software]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ganttic.com/tour/customized-data-in-scheduling-software |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407093014/http://www.ganttic.com/tour/customized-data-in-scheduling-software |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[workflow management system|workflow software]]&lt;ref name="ceiton"&gt;http://www.ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/introduction.html#Task_Management&lt;/ref&gt; also often provide task management software with advanced support for task management activities and corresponding software environment dimensions, reciprocating the myriad project and performance activities built into most good enterprise-level task management software products.

Software dimensions crisscrossing nearly all lines of task management products include task creation, task visualization, notifications, assign resources, compatibility, [[configurability]], [[scalability]], and [[report]]ing
* Task creation encompasses collaborative capabilities for turning ideas into actions (tasks). This includes activities involved in defining the task and encompasses the collaboration needed in the planning process.
* Task visualization encompasses presentation of tasks, most often through time and list forms. Priority visualization encompasses classification (e.g., budget, time, stakeholder) and mechanism (e.g., color code or text). Calendaring covers scheduling (e.g., availability, meetings, appointments and other potential conflicts) and notifications.
* Notifications encompass configurable settings for informing past, present and pending deadlines.
* Assigning resources encompasses the ability to delegate tasks and tools to single or multiple people.
* Compatibility encompasses the ability of a task management environment to connect to other systems, software and environments. It includes setting a structure and restrictions on communication going from the task management environment to other software, systems, and environments.
* Configurability encompasses the ability to add, remove and manage functionality and usability in task management environments.
* Scalability encompasses ability to perform a task properly when a change in the quantity of users is done to meet the specific task requirements.
* Reporting encompasses presentation of information by displaying either in tabular or graphical display.

'''''Invisible Bankers: Everything the Insurance Industry Never Wanted You to Know''''' is a 1982 book on the insurance industry. It was written by the financial journalist [[Andrew Tobias]] who became famous for his earlier book ''[[The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need]]''. It covers the financial details of life, auto, health and fire [[insurance]]—the types consumers normally buy.

Because insurers are frequently the victims of [[insurance fraud]], insurance companies need to be on their guard. In addition, an unscrupulous insurer could, in theory, make more profits if it could either induce their insureds into settling for less than they are entitled to or from outright wrongly denying valid claims in hopes that a small yet significant percentage would either get discouraged or wrongly believe that their claims were invalid. This makes dealings with insurers difficult. This book was the first guide to ordinary consumers into both the math and the business side of insurance.

[[China Railway Corporation]] in 1950 restarted the construction of the [[Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway]] (354&amp;nbsp;km), now part of [[Longhai Railway]] between [[Lianyungang]] and [[Lanzhou]], and gathered 300 [[Japanese people|Japanese]] former [[South Manchuria Railway]] engineers and others with their families in [[Tianshui]], [[Gansu Province]], to work under [[forced labor]] for this project. The railway was completed in 1952 and those Japanese workers, who were repatriated to Japan in 1953, formed Tianshui Association, a mutual assistance association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.jst.go.jp/experiences/exchange/exchange_1408.html Tianshui Association: China's Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway and Our Recent Activities] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinanews.com/cul/news/2010/04-16/2230505.shtml Japanese Enjineers Were Given Special Food and Other Preferential Treatment] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5131">A '''two-tier system''' is a type of [[payroll]] system in which one group of workers receives lower [[wage]]s and/or [[employee benefit]]s than another.&lt;ref name="Sherman"&gt;Sherman, Arthur W.; Bohlander, George W.; and Snell, Scott. ''Managing Human Sesources.'' Cincinnati, Ohio: South-Western College Pub., 1996, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-tier system of wages is usually established for one of three reasons: 
*The employer wishes to better compensate more [[seniority|senior]], ostensibly more experienced and [[productivity|productive]] workers without increasing overall wage costs.
*The employer wishes to establish a [[performance-related pay|pay for performance]] or [[merit pay]] wage scheme that compensates more productive employees without increasing overall wage costs.
*The employer wishes to reduce overall wage costs by hiring new employees at a wage less than the wage of incumbent workers.&lt;ref name="Sherman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garibaldi, Pietro. ''Personnel Economics in Imperfect Labour Markets''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 115; ''Symposium on the Social and Labour Consequences of Technological Developments, Deregulation and Privatization of Transport''. Bert Essenberg, ed. Geneva: International Labour Organisation, 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

A much less common system is the two-tier benefit system, which extends certain benefits to new employees only if they receive a promotion or are hired into the incumbent wage structure.&lt;ref name="Holley303"&gt;Holley, William H.; Jennings, Kenneth M.; and Wolters, Roger S. ''The Labor Relations Process''. Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning, 2009, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cappelli, Peter. ''Employment Relationships: New Models of White-Collar Work''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison42" /&gt;

That can be distinguished from traditional benefit structures, which permit employees to access a benefit, such a retirement [[pension]] or [[sabbatical]] leave, after they have achieved certain time-in-position levels.

Two-tier systems became more common in most industrialized economies in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Labor"&gt;McConnell, Campbell R.; Brue, Stanley L.; and Macpherson, David A. ''Contemporary Labor Economics''. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1999, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Paul, Gilles. ''Dual Labor Markets: A Macroeconomic Perspective''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1996, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; They are particularly attractive to companies with high rates of [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] for new hires, such as in retail, or with many high-wage, high-skilled employees about to retire.&lt;ref name="Harrison43"&gt;Harrison, Bennett and Bluestone, Barry. ''The Great U-Turn: Corporate Restructuring and the Polarizing of America''. New York: Basic Books, 1990, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
[[Trade union]]s generally seek to reduce [[wage dispersion]], the differences in wages between workers doing the same job.&lt;ref name="Holley303" /&gt; Not all unions are successful, however. A 2008 study of [[collective bargaining]] agreements in the [[United States]] found that 25% of the union contracts surveyed included a two-tier wage system.&lt;ref name="Holley303" /&gt; Such two-tier wage systems are often economically attractive to both employers and unions. Employers see immediate reductions in the cost of hiring new workers.&lt;ref name="Holley303" /&gt; Existing union members see no wage reduction, and the number of new union members with lower wages is a substantial minority within the union and so is too small to prevent ratification.&lt;ref name="Holley303" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Labor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison43" /&gt; Unions also find two-tier wage systems attractive because they encourage the employer to hire more workers.&lt;ref name="Holley303" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Labor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bewley147"&gt;Bewley, Truman F. ''Why Wages Don't Fall During a Recession''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some collective bargaining agreements contain "catch-up" provisions which allow newer hires to advance more rapidly on the wage scale than existing workers so that they reach wage and benefit parity after a specified number of years, or they provide wage and benefit increases to new hires to bring them up to party with existing workers if the company meets specified financial goals.&lt;ref name="Harrison42"&gt;Harrison, Bennett and Bluestone, Barry. ''The Great U-Turn: Corporate Restructuring and the Polarizing of America''. New York: Basic Books, 1990, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Some studies have found problems with two-tier systems like higher turnover for newer, lower-paid employees and a demoralized workforce.&lt;ref name="Harrison43" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, Truman F. ''Why Wages Don't Fall During a Recession''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; After enough time, a two-tier wage system can permanently lower wages in an entire industry.&lt;ref name="Harrison43" /&gt; Lowering productivity expectations for new hires seems to alleviate some of the problems.&lt;ref name="Bewley147" /&gt;

'''Ulrich Dietz''' (born 25 January 1958 in [[Pforzheim]]) is a German Manager. He used to be the [[CEO]] of [[GFT Technologies|GFT Technologies SE]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gft.com/int/en/index/company/newsroom/press-releases/2017/new-ceo-at-gft-marika-lulay-places-focus-on-international-expansion/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ulrich Dietz studied mechanical engineering and product engineering at the [[Reutlingen University|universities of Reutlingen]] and [[Furtwangen University of Applied Sciences|of Furtwangen]] and graduated as a certified [[engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gft-solutions.com/emagine/en/start/company/management/dietz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The GFT (Gesellschaft für Technologietransfer) was founded on March 19, 1987, by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Schönemann, the sole shareholder at that time.

The company name derives from the name TZI (Transferzentrum für Informationstechnologie, Steinbeis-Stiftung), where Prof. Dr.-Ing. Michael Schoenemann had previously been the director, and which he founded in 1985.

In 1999, Dietz took GFT public, listing it on the [[German stock exchange]]. Since then, Ulrich Dietz has been [[CEO]] of [[GFT Technologies|GFT Technologies AG]].&lt;ref&gt;http://russia.bitkom.dyndns.org/files/documents/Vita_UDZ_2007_engl_Pic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
In the years that followed he has continued to expand the company, taking it to an international level. Under his leadership, the GFT Group currently employs around  4,493  full-time and around 1,500 freelance employees at locations in 11 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://gisweb.vwd.com/mel/nachrichten_detail.htn?u=128&amp;id=31622673&amp;aktiv=nachrichten&amp;kunde=10100ext&lt;/ref&gt; Dietz holds 26.3% of all GFT shares.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gft.com/dam/jcr:e2f2bbf0-fb05-49bd-8a57-3b912d9e2188/gft_quartalsbericht_q2%202016_de.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gft.com, Website of GFT Technologies AG, accessed 30 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workers' self-management''' (also referred to as '''self-management''', '''labor management''', '''autogestión,''' '''[[workers' control]]''', '''[[industrial democracy]]''', '''[[Workplace democracy|democratic management]]''', and '''[[worker cooperative]]''') is a form of organizational [[management]] based on self-directed work processes on the part of an organization's workforce. Self-management is a characteristic of many forms of [[socialism]], with proposals for self-management having appeared many times throughout the history of the socialist movement, advocated variously by [[Market socialism|market socialists]], [[communists]], and [[anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steele |first= David |title= From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court Publishing Company |year= 1992|month= |isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 323|quote=The proposal that all the workers in a workplace should be in charge of the management of that workplace has appeared in various forms throughout the history of socialism…among the labels attached to this form of organization are ‘self-management’, ‘labor management’, ‘workers’ control’, ‘worker control’, ‘industrial democracy’ and ‘producers’ co-operatives’.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variations of self-management. In some variants, all the worker-members manage the enterprise directly through assemblies; in other forms, workers exercise management functions indirectly through the election of specialist managers. Self-management may include worker supervision and oversight of an organization by elected bodies, the election of specialized managers, or self-directed management without any specialized managers as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Steele |first= David |title= From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation |publisher= Open Court Publishing Company |year= 1992|month= |isbn= 978-0875484495|page = 323|quote=The self-management idea has many variants. All the workers may manage together directly, by means of an assembly, or indirectly by electing a supervisory board. They may manage in co-operation with a group of specialized managers or they may do without them.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of self-management are to improve performance by granting workers greater autonomy in their day-to-day operations, boosting morale, reducing [[Social alienation|alienation]], and when paired with employee ownership, eliminating exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= O'Hara|first= Phillip |title= Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher= Routledge|date=September 2003|isbn= 0-415-24187-1|pages = 9|quote=In eliminating the domination of capital over labour, firms run by workers eliminate capitalist exploitation and reduce alienation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An enterprise that is self-managed is referred to as a ''labour-managed firm''. Self-management refers to control rights within a productive organization, being distinct from the questions of ownership and what [[economic system]] the organization operates under.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Prychito|first= David L. |title= Markets, Planning, and Democracy: Essays After the Collapse of Communism |publisher= Edward Elgar Pub|date=July 31, 2002|isbn= 978-1840645194|pages = 71|quote=
The labor-managed firm is a productive organization whose ultimate decision making rights rest in the workers of the firm...In this sense workers’ self-management – as a basic principle – is about establishing control rights within a productive organization, while it leaves open the issue of de jure ownership (that is, who enjoys legal title to the physical and financial assets of the firm) and the type of economic system in which the firm is operating.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-management of an organization may coincide with [[employee ownership]] of that organization, but self-management can also exist in the context of organizations under [[public ownership]], and to a limited extent within [[Private property|private companies]] in the form of [[co-determination]] and worker representation on the board of directors.

== Economic theory ==
An [[economic system]] consisting of self-managed enterprises is sometimes referred to as a ''participatory economy'', ''self-managed economy'', or ''cooperative economy''. This economic model is a major version of market socialism and decentralized planned economy, stemming from the notion that people should be able to participate in making the decisions that affect their well-being. The major proponents of self-managed market socialism in the 20th century include the economists [[Benjamin Ward]], [[Jaroslav Vanek]], and Branko Horvat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gregory and Stuart|first= Paul and Robert |title= Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition |publisher=George Hoffman|year= 2004 |isbn= 0-618-26181-8|pages = 145–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ward-Vanek model of self-management involves the diffusion of entrepreneurial roles amongst all the partners of the enterprise.

Branko Horvat notes that participation is not simply more desirable but also more economically viable than traditional hierarchical and authoritarian management as demonstrated by econometric measurements, which indicate an increase in efficiency with greater participation in decision-making. According to Horvat, these developments are moving the world toward a self-governing socialistic mode of organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Horvat|first= Branko |title= The Political Economy of Socialism: A Marxist Social Theory |publisher=M.E Sharpe Inc|year= 1983 |isbn= 978-0873322560|page = 173|quote = Participation is not only more desirable, it is also economically more viable than traditional authoritarian management. Econometric measurements indicate that efficiency increases with participation...There is little doubt that the world is moving toward a socialist, self-governing society at an accelerated pace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the economic theory of self-management, workers are no longer employees but partners in the administration of their enterprise. Management theories in favor of greater self-management and self-directed activity cite the importance of autonomy for productivity in the firm, and economists in favor of self-management argue that cooperatives are more efficient than centrally-managed firms because every worker receives a portion of the profit, thereby directly tying their productivity to their level of compensation.

Historical economic figures who supported cooperatives and self-management of some kind include the anarchist [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], classical economist [[John Stuart Mill]], and the neoclassical economist [[Alfred Marshall]]. Contemporary proponents of self-management include the American [[Marxist]] economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[philosopher]] [[Noam Chomsky]].

=== Labor managed firm ===

The theory of the labor manager firm explains the behavior, performance and nature of self-managed organizational forms. Although self-managed (or labor-managed) firms can coincide with worker ownership (employee ownership), the two are distinct concepts, and one need not imply the other. According to traditional neoclassical economic theory, in a competitive market economy, ownership of capital assets by labor (the workforce of a given firm) should have no significant impact on firm performance.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Samuelson, Wages and Interest: A Modern Dissection of Marxian Economic Models, 47 AM.ECON.REV. 884, 894 (1957): "In a perfectly competitive market it really doesn’t matter who hires whom: so have labor hire ‘capital’...”)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[classical liberal]] philosopher John Stuart Mill believed that worker-run and owned cooperatives would eventually displace traditional capitalist (capital-managed) firms in the competitive market economy due to their superior efficiency and stronger incentive structure. While both Mill and Karl Marx thought that democratic worker management would be more efficient in the long run compared with hierarchical management, Marx was not hopeful about the prospects of labor-managed and owned firms as a means to displace traditional capitalist firms in the market economy.&lt;ref name="Market Economies 2011"&gt;''Where Did Mill Go Wrong?: Why the Capital-Managed Firm Rather than the Labor-Managed Enterprise Is the Predominant Organizational Form in Market Economies'', by Schwartz, Justin. 2011. Ohio State Law Journal, vol. 73, no. 2, 2012: "Why, then, is the predominant form of industrial organization in market societies the traditional capital-owned and managed firm (the capitalist firm) rather than the labor-managed enterprise owned and managed by the workers (the cooperative)? This is exactly the opposite of the result predicted by John Stuart Mill over 150 years ago. He thought that such worker-run cooperative associations would eventually crowd capitalist firms out of the market because of their superior efficiency and other advantages for workers."&lt;/ref&gt; In Western market economies, despite their advantages in efficiency, the labor-managed firm is comparatively rare.&lt;ref&gt;''Where Did Mill Go Wrong?: Why the Capital-Managed Firm Rather than the Labor-Managed Enterprise Is the Predominant Organizational Form in Market Economies'', by Schwartz, Justin. 2011. Ohio State Law Journal, vol. 73, no. 2, 2012: "Mill was mistaken, and Marx correct, at least about the tendency for labor-managed firms to displace capital-managed firms in the ordinary operation of the market."&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin Ward critiqued the labor managed firm's objective function. According to Ward, the labor-managed firm strives to maximize net income for all its members, as contrasted with the traditional capitalist firms' objective function of maximizing profit for external owners. The objective function of the labor managed firm creates an incentive to limit employment in order to boost the net income of the firm's existing members. An economy consisting of labor-managed firms would thus have a tendency to under-utilize labor and tend toward high rates of unemployment.

=== Classical economics ===
In the 19th century, the idea of a self-managed economy was first fully articulated by the [[anarchist]] philosopher and economist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon|first=Pierre-Joseph|title='Oeuvres Complètes', volume 17|year=1866–1876|publisher=Lacroix|location=Paris|pages=188–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This economic model was called ''[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]'' to highlight the mutual relationship among individuals in this system (in contrast to the "parasitism" of capitalist society) and involved cooperatives operating in a [[free-market]] economy.

The [[classical liberal]] philosopher John Stuart Mill argued worker-run cooperatives would eventually displace traditional capitalist (capital-managed) firms in the competitive market economy due to their superior efficiency.&lt;ref name="Market Economies 2011"/&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] championed the idea of a "[[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]]" as a characteristic of [[communist society]], where self-management processes replaced the traditional notion of the centralized state. This concept is related to the Marxist idea of transcending [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= O'Hara|first= Phillip |title= Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher= Routledge|date=September 2003|isbn= 0-415-24187-1|pages = 836|quote=it influenced Marx to champion the ideas of a "free association of producers" and of self-management replacing the centralized state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet-type economies ===
The [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economic model]] as practiced in the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern bloc]] is criticized by socialists for its lack of widespread self-management and management input on the part of workers in [[Enterprises in the Soviet Union|enterprises]]. However, according to both the Bolshevik view and Marx's own perspective, a full transformation of the work process can only occur after technical progress has eliminated dreary and repetitive work - a state of affairs that had not yet been achieved even in the advanced Western economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellman |first=Michael |title=Socialist Planning |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-521-35866-3 |page=312 |quote=In general, it seems reasonable to say that the state socialist countries have made no progress whatsoever towards organizing the labour process so as to end the division between the scientist and the process workers. This is scarcely surprising, both in view of the Bolshevik attitude toward Taylorism and in view of Marx’s own thesis that a society in which the labour process has been transformed would be one in which technical progress had eliminated dreary, repetitive, work. Such a state of affairs has not yet been reached in even the most advanced countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management science ==
In his book ''[[Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]]'', [[Daniel H. Pink]] argues on the basis of empirical evidence that self-management/self-directed processes, mastery, worker autonomy and purpose (defined as intrinsic rewards) are much more effective incentives than [[Money|monetary]] gain (extrinsic rewards). According to Pink, for the vast majority of work in the 21st century, self-management and related intrinsic incentives are far more crucial than outdated notions of hierarchical management and an over-reliance on monetary compensation as reward.

Worker self-management became a primary component of some [[trade unions|trade union]] organizations, in particular [[anarcho-syndicalism|revolutionary syndicalism]] which was introduced in late 19th century France, and [[guild socialism]] in early 20th century Britain, although both movements collapsed in the early 1920s. French trade-union [[Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail|CFDT]] (''Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail'') included worker self-management in its 1970 program, before later abandoning it. The philosophy of workers' self-management has been promoted by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) since its founding in the United States in 1905.

Critics of workers' self-management from the left such as [[Gilles Dauvé]] and [[Jacques Camatte]] do not admonish the model as [[reactionary]], but simply as not [[progressivism|progressive]] in the context of developed [[capitalism]]. Such critics suggest that capitalism is more than a relationship of management. Rather, they suggest capitalism should be considered as a social totality which workers' self-management in and of itself only perpetuates and does not challenge – despite its seemingly radical content and activity. This theory is used to explain why self-management in Yugoslavia never advanced beyond the confines of the larger state monopoly economy, or why many modern worker-owned facilities tend to return to hiring managers and accountants after only a few years of operation.

[[Guild socialism]] is a political movement advocating [[workers' control]] of industry through the medium of trade-related [[guilds]] "in an implied contractual relationship with the public".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism "Guild Socialism".  Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 31 May. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in the [[United Kingdom]] and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century. It was strongly associated with [[G. D. H. Cole]] and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Rocker said in his book ''[[Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)|Anarcho-Syndicalism]]'' (1938): &lt;blockquote&gt;{{quotation|"But by taking the land and the industrial plants under their own management they have taken the first and most important step on the road to Socialism. Above all, they (the Workers' and peasants self-management) have proved that the workers, even without the capitalists, are able to carry on production and to do it better than a lot of profit-hungry [[entrepreneurs]].|[[Rudolf Rocker]]|''[[Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)|Anarcho-Syndicalism]]'', page 69}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1950s, at the height of the [[Cold War]], [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] advocated what was officially called ''socialist self-management'' in distinction from the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, all of which practiced [[central planning]] and centralized management of their economies. The [[economy of SFRY|economy of Yugoslavia]] was organized according to the theories of [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] and &amp;ndash; more directly &amp;ndash; [[Edvard Kardelj]]. [[Croatia]]n scientist [[Branko Horvat]] also made a significant contribution to the theory of workers' self-management (''radničko samoupravljanje'') as practiced in Yugoslavia. Due to Yugoslavia's neutrality and its leading role in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], Yugoslav companies exported to both Western and Eastern markets. Yugoslav companies carried out construction of numerous major infrastructural and industrial projects in Africa, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Liotta|first=P.H.|title=Paradigm Lost :Yugoslav Self-Management and the Economics of Disaster|url=http://balkanologie.revues.org/index681.html|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yugoslavia: Introduction of Socialist Self-Management|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14787.html|publisher=Country Data|accessdate=18 August 2010|date=December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[May 1968 in France|May 68]] in [[France]], [[LIP factory]], a clockwork factory based in [[Besançon]], became self-managed starting in 1973 after the management's decision to liquidate it. The LIP experience was an emblematic social conflict of post-68 in France. [[Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail|CFDT]] (the CCT as it was referred to in Northern Spain), trade-unionist [[Charles Piaget]] led the strike in which workers claimed the [[means of production]]. The [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU), which included former [[Radical and Socialist Party (France)|Radical]] [[Pierre Mendès-France]], was in favour of ''autogestión'' or self-management.&lt;ref name=Halimi&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/carnet/2007-03-20-LIP LIP, l'imagination au pouvoir], article by [[Serge Halimi]] in ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', 20 March 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] of Spain, the [[Mondragon Cooperative Corporation]] represents perhaps the longest lasting and most successful example of workers' self-management in the world.  It has been touted by a diverse group of people, such as the [[Marxian economics|Marxian economist]] [[Richard D. Wolff]] and the research book "Capital and the Debt Trap"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanchez Bajo|first1=Claudia|last2=Roelants|first2=Bruno|title=Capital and the Debt Trap: learning from cooperatives in the global crisis|url=http://www.capital-and-the-debt-trap.com/|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an example of how the economy can be organized on an alternative to the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D.

Retrieved 15 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, due to the [[Eurocrisis|economic crisis]] in [[Greece]], a number of factories have been occupied and have become self-managed along the lines of autogestión.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenation.com/blog/172960/greek-workers-take-over-factory-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===

During the [[Great Depression]], worker and utility cooperatives flourished to the point that more than half of U.S. farmers belonged to a cooperative.  In general worker cooperatives and cooperative banking institutions were formed across the country and became a thriving alternative for workers and customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newdeal.feri.org/tva/tva10.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130133336/http://newdeal.feri.org/tva/tva10.htm# |archive-date=2009-01-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jonathanrowe.org/money-cooperative-economy-in-the-great-depression&lt;/ref&gt; Now,{{when|date=September 2014}} due to the economic downturn and stagnation in the [[rustbelt]], worker cooperatives such as the [[Evergreen Cooperatives]] have been formed in response, inspired by Mondragon.

In October 2005 the first ''Encuentro Latinoamericano de Empresas Recuperadas'' ("Latin American  Encounter of Recovered Companies") took place in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], with representatives of 263 such companies from different countries living through similar economical and social situations. The meeting had, as its main outcome, the ''Compromiso de Caracas'' (Caracas' Commitment); a vindicating text of the movement.

====The ''fábricas recuperadas'' movement====
[[File:Autogestion.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the Movimiento Nacional de Empresas Recuperadas (MNER), at a worker-recovered print shop, Chilavert Artes Gráficas in [[Buenos Aires]]]]

English-language discussions of this phenomenon may employ several different translations of the original Spanish expression other than ''recovered factory''. For example, ''worker-recuperated enterprise'', ''recuperated factory/business'',''worker-recovered factory/business'', ''reclaimed factory'', and ''worker-run factory'' have been noted. The phenomenon is also known as "autogestión," which comes from the French word for self-management (applied to factories, [[popular education]] systems, and other uses). Worker self-management may coincide with [[employee ownership]].

Argentina's ''fábricas recuperadas'' movement, which emerged in response to Argentine's [[Argentine economic crisis|2001 economic crisis]],&lt;ref name="Galafassi2004p222"/&gt; is the current most significant workers' self-management phenomenon in the world. Workers took over control of the factories in which they had worked, commonly after [[bankruptcy]], or after a [[Occupation of factories|factory occupation]] to circumvent a [[lockout (industry)|lockout]].

''Fábricas recuperadas'' means "reclaimed/recovered factories." The Spanish verb ''recuperar'' means not only "to get back", "to take back" or "to reclaim" but also "to put back into good condition". Although initially referring to industrial facilities, the term may also apply to businesses other than factories (e.g. [[Hotel Bauen]] in [[Buenos Aires]]).

Throughout the 1990s in [[History of Argentina|Argentina]]'s southern province of [[Neuquén Province|Neuquén]], drastic economic and political events occurred where the citizens ultimately rose up.  Although the first shift occurred in a single factory, bosses were progressively fired throughout the province so that by 2005 the workers of the province controlled most of the factories.

The movement emerged as a response to Argentine's [[Argentine economic crisis|2001 economic crisis]],&lt;ref name="Galafassi2004p222"&gt;Guido Galafassi, Paula Lenguita, Robinson Salazar Perez (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLTEMYfB4bEC&amp;pg=PA239 ''Nuevas Practicas Politicas Insumisas En Argentina''] pp.222, 238&lt;/ref&gt; and about 200 Argentine companies were "recovered" by their workers and turned into co-operatives. Prominent examples include the [[Brukman factory]], the [[Hotel Bauen]] and [[FaSinPat]] (formerly known as Zanon). As of 2005, about 15,000 Argentine workers run recovered factories.

The phenomenon of ''fabricas recuperadas'' ("recovered factories") is not new in Argentina. Rather, such [[social movement]]s were completely dismantled during the so-called "[[Dirty War]]" in the 1970s. Thus, during [[Héctor Cámpora]]'s first months of government (May–July 1973), a rather moderate and left-wing [[Peronist]], approximately 600 social conflicts, strikes and factory occupations had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Moreno, ''Le désastre argentin. Péronisme, politique et violence sociale (1930–2001)'', [[Editions Syllepses]], Paris, 2005, p. 109 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many recovered factories are run co-operatively and all workers receive the same [[wage]]. Important management decisions are taken [[direct democracy|democratically]] by an assembly of all workers, rather than by professional managers.

The proliferation of these "recoveries" has led to the formation of a '''recovered factory movement''', which has ties to a diverse political network including [[socialists]], [[Peronists]], [[anarchists]] and [[communists]]. Organizationally, this includes two major federations of recovered factories, the larger [https://web.archive.org/web/20070219083133/http://www.mnerweb.com.ar/ Movimiento Nacional de Empresas Recuperadas] (or National Movement of Recuperated Businesses, or MNER) on the left and the smaller National Movement of Recuperated Factories (MNFR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fabricasrecuperadas.org.ar/ Movimiento Nacional de Fabricas Recuperadas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218152458/http://www.fabricasrecuperadas.org.ar/ |date=2007-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Trigona, [https://zcomm.org/zblogs/reversing-the-logic-of-capitalism-by-marie-trigona/ Recuperated Enterprises in Argentina – Reversing the Logic of Capitalism], Znet, March 27, 2006 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[labor union]]s, unemployed protestors (known as [[piquetero]]s), traditional [[worker cooperative]]s and a range of political groups have also provided support for these take-overs. In March 2003, with the help of the MNER, former employees of the luxury [[Hotel Bauen]] occupied the building and took control of it.

One of the highest difficulties such a movement faces is its relation towards the classic [[economic]] system, as most classically managed firms refused,{{Verify source|date=June 2010}} for various reasons (among which ideological hostility to the very principle of autogestión) to work and deal with recovered factories. Thus, isolated recovered factories find it easier to work together in building an alternative, more [[economic democracy|democratic economic system]] and thus manage to reach a critical size and power which enables it to negotiate with the ordinary capitalistic firms.

The movement led in 2011 to a new [[bankruptcy]] law that facilitates take over by the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Pagina12: [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/cash/35-5106-2011-04-17.html ''Nueva Ley de Quiebras''] (April 2011), [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-169306-2011-06-02.html ''Fábricas recuperadas y también legales''] (June 2nd 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was signed into law by President [[Cristina Kirchner]] on June 29, 2011.&lt;ref name="Pagina1220110629"&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/ultimas/20-171094-2011-06-29.html ''CFK promulgó la reforma de la Ley de Quiebras''] in ''[[Página/12]]'', June 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
