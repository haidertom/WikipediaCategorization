'''ANSI/ISA-95''', or '''ISA-95''' as it is more commonly referred, is an [[international standard]] from the [[International Society of Automation]] for developing an automated interface between enterprise and control systems. This standard has been developed for global manufacturers. It was developed to be applied in all industries, and in all sorts of processes, like batch processes, continuous and repetitive processes.

The objectives of ISA-95 are to provide consistent terminology that is a foundation for supplier and manufacturer communications, provide consistent information models, and to provide consistent operations models which is a foundation for clarifying application functionality and how information is to be used.

There are 5 parts of the ISA-95 standard.

'''ANSI/ISA-95.00.01-2000, Enterprise-Control System Integration Part 1: Models and Terminology''' consists of standard terminology and  object models, which can be used to decide which information should be exchanged.

The models help define boundaries between the enterprise systems and the control systems. They help address questions like which tasks can be executed by which function and what information must be exchanged between applications. Here is a [http://www.isa.org/uploadedImages/Content/Standards_and_Publications/ISA_Publications/InTech_Magazine/Issues/2001/October/20011048.gif graphical representation of the Functional enterprise-control model].

**Data Flows
*Object Models
**Objects
**Object Relationships
**Object Attributes
*Operations Activity Models
**Operations Elements: PO, MO, QO, IO
**Operations Data Flow Model
***Operations Functions
***Operations Flows

'''ANSI/ISA-95.00.02-2001, Enterprise-Control System Integration Part 2: Object Model Attributes''' consists of attributes for every object that is defined in part 1. The objects and attributes of Part 2 can be used for the exchange of information between different systems, but these objects and attributes can also be used as the basis for relational databases.

'''ANSI/ISA-95.00.03-2005, Enterprise-Control System Integration, Part 3: Models of [[Manufacturing Operations Management]]''' focuses on the functions and activities at level 3 (Production / MES layer). It provides guidelines for describing and comparing  the production levels of different sites in a standardized way.

'''ISA-95.04 Object Models &amp; Attributes Part 4 of ISA-95: "Object models and attributes for Manufacturing Operations Management"''' 
The SP95 committee is yet developing part 4 of ISA-95, which is entitled "Object Models and Attributes of Manufacturing Operations Management". This technical specification defines object models that determine which information is exchanged between MES activities (which are defined in part 3 by ISA-95). The models and attributes from part 4 are the basis for the design and the implementation of interface standards and make sure of a flexible lapse of the cooperation and information-exchange between the different MES activities.

'''ISA-95.05 B2M Transactions Part 5 of ISA-95: "Business to manufacturing transactions"''' Also part 5 of ISA-95 is yet in development. This technical specification defines operation between office and production automations-systems, which can be used together with the object models out part 1 &amp; 2. The operations connect and organise the production objects and activities that are defined through earlier parts of the standard. Such operations take place on all levels within a business, but the focus of this technical specification lies on the interface between enterprise- and control systems. On the basis of models, the operation will be described and becomes the operation processing logically explained.

Within production areas activities are executed and information is passed back and forth. The standard provides reference models for production activities, quality activities, maintenance activities and inventory activities.

'''Advanced Placement (AP) Physics 1''', along with [[AP Physics 2]], is a year-long [[Advanced Placement|AP]] course whose first exam was given in 2015. The course is intended to proxy a one-semester algebra-based university course.  Topics covered include forces and motion, conservation laws, waves, and electricity. &lt;ref&gt;[http://jacobsphysics.blogspot.com/2011/07/ap-physics-1-and-2-redesign-as-it.html Jacobs Physics: AP Physics 1 and 2 Redesign (as it stands now) and Honors Physics I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The heavily computational AP Physics B course served for four decades as the College Board's algebra-based offering.  As part of the College Board's redesign of science courses, AP Physics B was discontinued and AP Physics 1 and 2 were created with guidance from the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/math-and-science/physics AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 | Advances in AP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The course covers material of a first-[[semester]] [[university]] [[undergraduate]] [[physics]] course offered at American universities that use best practices of physics pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Greg|title=What does a 5 on the AP Physics 1 Exam mean?

==Curriculum==
AP Physics 1 is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course that includes topics such as Newtonian mechanics; work, energy, and power; mechanical waves and sound; and introductory, simple circuits.  The College Board published a curriculum framework that includes seven big ideas on which the new AP Physics courses are based, along with "enduring understandings" students will be expected to acquire within each of the big ideas.:&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/2012advances/11b_4615_AP_Physics_CF_WEB_120910.pdf AP Physics 1: Algebra-based and AP Physics 2: Algebra-based Curriculum Framework 2014–2015] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927033758/http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/2012advances/11b_4615_AP_Physics_CF_WEB_120910.pdf |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions for the exam are constructed with direct reference to items in the curriculum framework.  Student understanding of each topic is tested with reference to multiple skills -- that is, questions require students to use quantitative, semi-quantitative, qualitative, and experimental reasoning in each content area.

'''Aalto University''' ({{lang-fi|Aalto-yliopisto}}, {{lang-sv|Aalto-universitetet}}) is a [[university]] primarily located in [[Greater Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. It was established in 2010 as a merger of three major Finnish universities: the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (established 1849), the [[Helsinki School of Economics]] (established 1904), and the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] (established 1871). The close collaboration between the scientific, business and arts communities is intended to foster multi-disciplinary education and research. The Finnish government, in 2010, set out to create a university that fosters innovation, merging the three institutions into one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |title=EU Policy Blog |publisher=Microsoft |work=EU Policy Blog |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810170729/http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is composed of six schools with close to 17,500 students and 4,000 staff members, making it Finland's second largest university. The main campus of Aalto University is located in [[Otaniemi]], [[Espoo]], where the engineering schools as well as the bachelor programs of the School of Business operate. Other functions of the [[Aalto University School of Business|School of Business]] are located in [[Töölö]]. The [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|School of Arts, Design and Architecture]] is mainly located in [[Arabianranta]]. All of the university's activities will be located in the Otaniemi campus by 2020. In addition to the Greater Helsinki area, the university also operates in [[Mikkeli]] and [[Pori]].

Aalto University's operations showcase Finland’s experiment in higher education. The Aalto Design Factory, Aalto Ventures Program and Aalto Entrepreneurship Society (Aaltoes), among others, drive the university's mission for a radical shift towards multidisciplinary learning and have contributed substantially to the emergence of Helsinki as a hotbed for startups.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Aaltoes is Europe’s largest and most active student run entrepreneurship community that has founded major concepts such as the Startup Sauna accelerator program and [[Slush|Slush (event)]] startup event.

The university is named in honour of [[Alvar Aalto]], a prominent Finnish architect, designer and [[alumnus]] of the former Helsinki University of Technology, who was also instrumental in designing a large part of the university's main campus in Otaniemi.

== History ==
In 2004, a workgroup led by Anne Brunila of the Finnish Ministry of Finance concluded that Finland had too many universities and other institutes of tertiary education which should be consolidated. Following this, [[Yrjö Sotamaa]], president of the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] at the time, proposed the merger of Aalto University's founding schools in his president's opening speech in 2005. Sotamaa's line of reasoning was that this move would create a unique interdisciplinary university that was needed to create new innovative thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The idea received attention within the Finnish Ministry of Education, which appointed Raimo Sailas, a leading official at the Ministry of Finance, to investigate the possibility of a merger. After Sailas' group reported that it considered the merger to be beneficial to the Finnish academic world and economy, the Finnish government decided to go on with the project on November 11, 2007.

On May 29, 2008, the government announced that the new university would be named after the Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]] in honor of his achievements in technology, economics and art. The Finnish Minister of Education at the time, Ms. [[Sari Sarkomaa]], together with representatives of Finnish industries and professional organisations, signed the Aalto University charter on June 25, 2008 in [[Helsinki]]. On December 19, 2008, Prof. [[Tuula Teeri]] was selected by the Board to be the first President of Aalto University.

Aalto University started operating on January 1, 2010. In the process of creating the university the university law of Finland was rewritten for the university to be allowed to collect endowment. The university managed to reach its goal of collecting 200 million euros in private donations. The sum was augmented by 2.5 times by the Finnish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123144055/https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-11-23|title=Aalto AlumniNET|author=Mira Network AB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Helsinki University of Technology ===
[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|thumb|Surveying students with professor in the early days of the university of technology.]]
{{main|Helsinki University of Technology}}

As the Aalto University was founded the four schools of science and engineering were formed out of the departments of the '''[[Helsinki University of Technology]]''' (TKK), founded in 1849 by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas I]]. It received university status in 1908. In 1966, the University of Technology moved from [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Hietalahti]] in downtown Helsinki to its current Otaniemi campus, designed by [[Alvar Aalto]]. At the time of creation of Aalto University, TKK had about 250 professors and approximately 15,000 students. This means the largest part of the Aalto University is formed from the former Helsinki University of Technology.

In 2011, the former University of Technology (then known as ''Aalto University School of Science and Technology'') was split up into four schools, corresponding to the former TKK faculties: [[Aalto University School of Chemical Technology|School of Chemical Technology]] (CHEM), [[Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering|School of Electrical Engineering]] (ELEC), [[Aalto University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] (ENG), and [[Aalto University School of Science|School of Science]] (SCI).

=== Helsinki School of Economics ===
{{main|Helsinki School of Economics}}

The '''Helsinki School of Economics''' ('''HSE''') was established in [[Helsinki]] in 1904 by the business community and was given the status of a university in 1911. It operated as a private university until 1974, when the state of Finland was given the financial responsibility of the university.

Following the merger, the university was briefly renamed ''Aalto University School of Economics'', and is currently known as ''Aalto University School of Business'' (Aalto BIZ).

=== University of Art and Design Helsinki ===
{{main|University of Art and Design Helsinki}}
[[File:Leo Mechelin (cropped).png|thumb|[[Leo Mechelin]] served as one of the first presidents of the school of art and design.]]

The '''University of Art and Design Helsinki''' has been the largest [[art university]] in the [[Nordic countries]]. It was founded in 1871. Media Centre Lume - the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media - is also located in the university. The university awarded the following academic degrees: [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Arts]].

The university has been active in establishing research projects and industrial collaborations via the private sector. During the rectorship of [[Yrjö Sotamaa]] the university was active in integrating design into Finnish innovation networks.

Following the merger, the university was briefly renamed Aalto University School of Art and Design. In 2012, the Department of Architecture, which historically has been a part of the Helsinki University of Technology, was moved to the school, and the name was changed to ''Aalto University School of Art, Design and Architecture'' (Aalto ARTS).

== Administration and organisation ==

=== Governance ===
The university, which is incorporated as ''Aalto University Foundation'', is governed by the seven-member Aalto University Foundation Board. The Board decides on the Foundation's strategy, operation and financial issues, is responsible for any far-reaching plans and appoints the University president and vice rectors. Formerly working as the Provost of Aalto University, Ilkka Niemelä was elected President of Aalto University in 2017. The first President of Aalto University was [[Tuula Teeri]]. The university is organized into six schools with their respective deans and administrative structures.

=== Schools ===
The university is organized since the beginning of 2011 into six schools formed out of the three merged universities. Each school has several departments and separate laboratories as well as a number of separate research and other units.

=== Studies ===

==== Study in Science and Technology ====
{{main|Aalto University School of Chemical Technology|Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering|Aalto University School of Engineering|Aalto University School of Science}}

[[File:Mathematics lecture at the Helsinki University of Technology.jpg|thumb|A lecture of mathematics for undergraduates inside the main building.]]

All engineering programmes offered by the schools of science and technology lead to the degree of ''[[diplomi-insinööri]]'' (M.Sc.(Tech.), Master of Science in Technology), a five-year taught master's degree, which is fairly similar to the German {{Interlanguage link multi|Diplom-Ingenieur|de}} degrees. From 2005, according to the [[Bologna process]], all students must also complete a bachelor's degree (B.Sc.(Tech), [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science in Technology]]), in Finnish ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' or ''TkK'', before the DI or architect's degree. However, the schools of science and technology do not offer programs terminating in a bachelor's degree; a student may only be accepted to study for the Master's level degree. The schools of science and technology require a bachelor's degree from foreign students studying in English, because only Master's studies are offered completely in English.

Undergraduate studies are generally quite similar in between different programs with a considerable part being taken by a tuition of a solid base in mathematics and physics.

Apart from numerous programs in Finnish/Swedish, various international Master's programs are offered exclusively for studies in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/programs/technology/|title=Aalto Game Changers. Change the world.|author=|date=11 July 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[postgraduate]] degrees given are ''tekniikan lisensiaatti'' (Lic.Sc.(Tech.), [[Licentiate (degree)|Licenciate of Science in Technology]]) and ''tekniikan tohtori'' (D.Sc.(Tech.), [[Doctor of Science|Doctor of Science in Technology]]).

Finnish students are accepted mainly on the basis of result in the national DIA entrance exam. The exam variant taken by most entrants mainly tests quantitative ability in mathematics, physics and chemistry, but specialized tests are available for students applying to a number of programs. The score required for entry to the Aalto University varies much depending on the intended field of study, however, in general the scores required for the Aalto University are higher than for any other university granting entry through the DIA exam. For example, the mean sum of mathematics and physics DIA exam scores was 7.2 in the year 2010, whereas the mean minimum sum of mathematics and physics exam scores for gaining admission to an Aalto program was 17.1-20.1, depending on the priority point distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Valintaopas|url = http://dia.fi/media/4005/dia_hakuopas270111_fi_fk_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aalto also contains five of the most selective programs with respect to the matriculation exam scores, out of approximately total of 50 [[Diplomi-insinööri|university technology programs]] in the nation, of which approximately 30 are outside of Aalto, and the three most selective programs with respect to entrance exam and combined scores. The minimum scores required for these top programs are in the 95th-99th percentile range of the whole applicant pool, and approximately 98th-99.8th percentile of what would be the score distribution of the whole age group.

==== Study in Arts, Design and Architecture ====
{{main|Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture}}
The School of Arts, Design and Architecture has been a leader in art and design education in Finland for over 138 years. It is an international postgraduate university institution with students from over 50 countries. It offers doctorate, master and bachelor's degrees in a wide range of disciplines - fine art, design, new media, art education, visual culture, motion picture and production design. School of Arts, Design and Architecture is a pioneer in research and in developing interdisciplinary study programmes.

The school received its current name in the beginning of 2012 when the architecture department moved in from the School of Engineering (previously part of Helsinki University of Technology).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.aalto.fi/en/current/news/view/2012-01-02/|title=School of Arts, Design and Architecture began operations at the start of the year|publisher=Aalto University|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture programmes lead to the Master of Science degrees in architecture and landscape architecture.

==== Study in Business ====
{{main|Aalto University School of Business}}
The School of Business offers degrees in economics and business administration at the Bachelor, Master, Licentiate and Doctoral levels, along with MBA programs targeted to business professionals. Many of the degrees and programs are offered in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/programs/business/|title=Aalto University Gets You More Than a Degree|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its degree programs, the school has a two-step program structure with a three-year bachelor's degree followed by a two-year master's degree. A doctoral degree normally takes four additional years. Financial Times ranked Aalto University School of Business 29th in the European Business school rankings in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/helsinki-school-of-economics/european-business-school-rankings-2013#european-business-school-rankings-2013|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus of the Aalto University School of Business is located in Töölö, in the center of Helsinki. The school offers two Bachelor of Science Programs (one in Finnish at the Otaniemi campus and the other in English at the Mikkeli campus) and 13 Master of Science Programs (12 are offered in English).

The Aalto University School of Business is the first business school in Finland and the first business school in the Nordic countries to have received all three labels of excellence from the world’s leading business school accreditation bodies: [[AACSB]], [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]], [[EQUIS]]. This Triple Crown status is an honor held by only few business schools worldwide. The school is also an active member of the [[CEMS - The Global Alliance in Management Education|CEMS]] (Global Alliance in Management Education) and [[Partnership in International Management|PIM]] (Partnership in International Management).

===== MBA Programs =====
Aalto [[MBA]] and [[Executive MBA]] Programs are organized by [[Aalto University Executive Education]] Ltd. MBA and Executive MBA programs are offered in [[Helsinki]], [[China]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Poland]] and have tuition fees, unlike the degree programs. The MBA program is taught through two-week modules by visiting faculty from some of the top business schools in the world, including [[Emory University]], [[Rutgers Business School]], [[University of South Carolina]], [[Georgetown University]], [[UCLA]], [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]], [[Queen’s University]], [[Rotterdam School of Management]], [[Indiana University]], [[ESADE]] and [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaltoee.fi/en|title=Valmennusta, kehittämispalveluja ja koulutusta - Aalto EE|author=|date=|website=aaltoee.fi|access-date=2011-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106022249/http://www.aaltoee.fi/en|archive-date=2011-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/program/business/|title=Aalto University Gets You More Than a Degree|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial Times ranked Aalto University School of Business 78th in Global [[MBA]] programs,&lt;ref name="rankings.ft.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/helsinki-school-of-economics/masters-in-management-2013#masters-in-management-2013|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 85th in [[Executive MBA]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/helsinki-school-of-economics/emba-ranking-2013#emba-ranking-2013|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
[[File:Dome planck hfi.jpg|thumb|right|Radio science done with the receiver in the Planck probe reveals the age and composition of the universe.]]
Aalto University has defined four fundamental competence areas: ICT and digitalisation, Materials and sustainable use of natural resources, Global business dynamics and Art and design knowledge building. In addition to these, the university invests in three integrative multidisciplinary themes: Advanced energy solutions, Health and wellbeing, and Human-centred living environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/strengths/|title=Key research areas|author=|date=18 June 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at Aalto University have achieved notability in, among other things, [[low temperature physics]] (holding the current world record for the [[Coldest temperature recorded on Earth|lowest temperature achieved]]), the development of devices and methods for [[magnetoencephalography]], mobile communications, [[wood processing]], and neural networks, with professor [[Teuvo Kohonen]] initiating research in [[self-organizing map]]s. Additionally, the first commercialised [[total synthesis]], the synthesis of [[camphor]], was invented by [[Gustaf Komppa]], the first professor of chemistry at TKK&lt;ref&gt;Kemia-lehti. {{cite web|url=http://www.kemia-lehti.fi/pdf/gustafkomppa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928140713/http://www.kemia-lehti.fi/pdf/gustafkomppa.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nobel laureate]] (chemistry, 1945) [[Artturi Virtanen]] held a professorship in biochemistry at TKK. More recently, the university has notably invested in the research of nanotechnology, operating the largest [[cleanroom]] facility in Northern Europe&lt;ref name="micronova"&gt;{{cite web | title=VTT inaugurated Microelectronics and Nanotechnology Centre 'Micronova' | accessdate=2009-10-08 | url=http://www.ercim.org/publication/Ercim_News/enw53/linden.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest microscopy clusters in Europe.&lt;ref name="nanomicroscopy"&gt;{{cite web|title=TKK Nanomicroscopy Center |accessdate=2009-10-08 |url=http://nmc.tkk.fi/en/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717004627/http://nmc.tkk.fi/en/ |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MilliLab, a joint laboratory of [[VTT]] and Aalto University, built one of the radio receivers in the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] probe, which maps the [[cosmic microwave background]] for determining the age and composition of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/ulkomaat/2013032116811280_ul.shtml|title=Planck-luotain laittoi käsityksen kosmoksesta uusiksi|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centres of Excellence ===
Aalto University participates in seven Centres of Excellence ({{lang-fi|huippuyksikkö}}), selected by the [[Academy of Finland]] to represent the top research in the country, and receiving separate, fixed-period funding from the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aka.fi/en-GB/A/Centres-of-Excellence-/Aims/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928203831/http://www.aka.fi/en-GB/A/Centres-of-Excellence-/Aims/ |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the following units are designated Centres of Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalto.fi/fi/research/excellence_in_research/#sa_huippuyksikot|title=Tieteen huiput|author=|date=18 June 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/excellence_in_research/#academy_of_finland_centres_of_excellence|title=Excellence in Research|author=|date=18 June 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Main Campus Otaniemi ===
The four Schools of Science and Technology as well as the bachelor programs of the School of Business are based in Otaniemi in Espoo, 10&amp;nbsp;km from the center of Helsinki, on a campus designed by Alvar Aalto. Otaniemi has a high concentration of high technology. Several high-tech companies, the Finnish forest industry's joint experimental laboratory KCL, and [[business incubator]]s Innopoli and Technopolis are also situated nearby. It is also directly adjacent to [[Keilaniemi]], with Life Science Center and the headquarters of several notable Finnish companies, such as [[Nokia]] and [[Fortum]]. The Otaniemi campus is connected by a 15-minute bus ride to the center of Helsinki. [[Länsimetro|A metro connection]] has just started operating.

The ‘Teekkarikylä’ Student Village, home to over 2,000 students, is also located in Otaniemi. There are over one hundred student organizations on campus which provide a range of opportunities to take part in pastimes of various kinds, from sports to music.

== Culture and student life ==
[[File:TFteknolog.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Finnish technology student's hat ({{lang|fi|teekkarilakki}}) photographed on top of a mirror.]]
The Aalto University students are known for active student life.

An integral part of many student traditions play the brightly colored overalls worn to many events. The color of the overall signals what the student studies (e.g. the economy students are recognized from ''dollar green'' overalls). The student community has also organised important charity events. In fact, the name for these events ''tempaus'', has entered common language to describe any carnival-like charity event.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The students of technology ({{lang|fi|teekkarit}}) are especially noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat with a tuft on many occasions (both formal and informal). Technology students are also famous for, and Finland's leading practitioners of, [[student prank]]s (''jäynä''), similar in principle to [[MIT hack]]s. Their most widely publicised stunt took place in 1961, when a team of students smuggled a statue of [[Paavo Nurmi]] onto the 300-year-old wreck of [[Regalskeppet Vasa]] just days before its lifting from the bottom of the sea.&lt;ref name="iltasanomatttkyarchive"&gt;[[Ilta-Sanomat]] 5 July 1961 "Vasan veijarit", scan available at  [https://web.archive.org/web/20040713124028/http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html archive.org dump of ttky.fi].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although student traditions vary in between the different constituent schools common activities started to burgeon early after the foundation of Aalto University. The most noticeable student event of the first year of the university was ''Aalto on Tracks'', where a group of 100 students came together to rent a private train which they traveled 10 000&amp;nbsp;km on from Helsinki to the [[Shanghai Expo]] enjoying multidisciplinary talks and workshops on the way.&lt;ref name="aaltoontracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaltoontracks.com/|title=Aalto on Tracks|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was such a success that the follow-up ''Aalto on waves'' is planned to arrange a trip by boat to South America. ''Aalto on Tracks'' also spurred students of [[Tongji University]] to arrange ''Tongji on Tracks'' which essentially takes the journey of ''Aalto on Tracks'' in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfc.tongji.edu.cn/index.php?m=article&amp;a=detail&amp;id=26&amp;nav_id=47|title=欢迎来到同济大学中芬中心|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aalto Entrepreneurship Society]] is a multi-disciplinary society uniting students and graduates of all disciplines of the University. It aims to encourage high-tech, high-growth, scalable entrepreneurship by arranging get-togethers to spark ideas and innovations and aid start-up initiatives among the Aalto students.

=== Aalto Festival ===
Aalto Festival (formerly known as Masters of Aalto, and the Masters of Arts festival) is an annual event in May where the new professionals of the multidisciplinary university meet the public.

An extensive exhibition showcases a wide array of works: everything from distinguished theses, individual statements, concepts and products arising from commercial collaboration to works of art. For the graduating students, the exhibition is an opportunity to interact with society, future employers, the media and other influential parties.

Aalto Festival offers a varying program with exhibitions, seminars, discussions, films, workshops and guided tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moa.aalto.fi|title=Masters of Aalto University 2014 / MoA'14|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student Union ===
Aalto University Student Union ({{lang-fi|Aalto-yliopiston ylioppilaskunta}}, AYY in short) is the official student union of Aalto University. Every bachelor's and master's degree student enrolled in Aalto University is a member of the Student Union.

The purpose of AYY is to represent the students, look after their interests, and support the community of 15,000 students. AYY provides its members with a variety of services such as healthcare, recreation and housing. The Student Union is financed by membership fees, investments and profits from student housing.

Aalto University Student Union was formed in the beginning of 2010 through a merger between the respective student unions of the merged universities.

The Aalto University is also one of the two universities in Finland to host one or more Nations, a Finnish type of [[Corporation (University)|student corporation]]. AU's only nation is [[Teknologföreningen|Teknologföreningen (TF)]] and its goal is to unite Swedish-speaking students at the university. The nation is housed in its peculiar building called ''Urdsgjallar''. Since 1972, when the corresponding Finnish-speaking nation ''Tekniikan Ylioppilaat'' was abolished, there are no nations for the Finnish-speaking students, though the 15 regional nations at the [[University of Helsinki]], both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking, do welcome AU students as members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml Osakunnat – Nationerna.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502091419/http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml |date=May 2, 2013 }} Osakuntien yhteistyövaliokunta ry.

=== Associations ===
[[File:Retuperän WBK.jpg|thumb|The Retuperä WBK is a student band that parodies a volunteer fire brigade brass band. In this picture Retuperä is performing in central Helsinki on top of their fire truck.]]

In addition to the student union, Aalto university students have formed numerous associations for studies, cultural activity and sports. There are more than 150 associations maintained by university students.

==== List of student associations ====

Currently this list includes only the associations known to have English Wikipedia articles.

=== Student housing ===
The housing area of Otaniemi campus, known as ''Teekkarikylä'' (technology student village), is owned mostly by the student union and partly by [[Foundation for Student Housing in the Helsinki Region|HOAS]] (Helsinki Student Housing Fund). The housing is characterised by the presence of foreign students of many nationalities. As of 2005, the village offers housing for approximately 2,600 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Union web pages for the student village |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706062907/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archivedate=6 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the Otaniemi campus was started in 1950, in order for the first buildings to host the athletes of the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Some of the building material originally used for the campus was acquired from the former Soviet Union embassy, which had been destroyed during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of ''Teekkarikylä'' |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129041330/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |archivedate=2009-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of bombings by the [[Soviet Union]] itself. The student housing has been used for housing athletes again in e.g. the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], sometimes to the dismay of the students that have to move out during the events. The quality of the Otaniemi student housing holds a high standard in international comparison.

Some student housing is also available in the vicinity of the other campuses.

The Otaniemi campus also contains the former student union building ''[[Dipoli]]'', named as the second ''Poli'', the successor of the first student union building in downtown Helsinki. Dipoli was designed by [[Reima and Raili Pietilä]] and completed in 1966. In 1993, the building was permanently rented to the university to act as a conference and [[continuing education]] center and later sold due to high maintenance costs. It is regularly used for conventions, congresses and student parties.

All three constituent schools have played an integral part in educating many of the top names in their respective fields in Finland. After the Second World War Finland's economy grew and Finnish companies became players in the international markets requiring highly educated expertise and leadership. Both the schools of technology and economy catered to this need as the premier schools of their fields in the country. During the latter part of the 20th century the schools had to increase their student intake considerably to meet the demands of growing markets.

'''Agent-based computational economics''' ('''ACE''') is the area of [[computational economics]] that studies economic processes, including whole [[economy|economies]], as [[dynamic system]]s of interacting [[Agent (economics)|agents]]. As such, it falls in the [[paradigm]] of [[complex adaptive system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;• [[W. Brian Arthur]], 1994.

The rules are formulated to model behavior and social interactions based on incentives and information.&lt;ref&gt;Scott E. Page (2008).

The theoretical assumption of [[mathematical optimization]] by agents in [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibrium]] is replaced by the less restrictive postulate of agents with [[bounded rationality]] ''adapting'' to market forces.&lt;ref&gt;• [[John H.

The method has benefited from continuing improvements in modeling techniques of [[computer science]] and increased computer capabilities.

==Overview==
The "[[Agent (economics)|agents]]" in ACE models can represent individuals (e.g. people), social groupings (e.g. firms), biological entities (e.g. growing crops), and/or physical systems (e.g. transport systems). The ACE modeler provides the initial configuration of a computational economic system comprising multiple interacting agents. The modeler then steps back to observe the development of the system over time without further intervention. In particular, system events should be driven by agent interactions without external imposition of equilibrium conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socsci.aau.dk/ae2006/ Summary of methods]: ''Department of Economics, Politics and Public Administration, Aalborg University, Denmark'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues include those common to [[experimental economics]] in general&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon L. Smith]], 2008. "experimental economics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000277&amp;q=experimental%20&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; and development of a common framework for empirical validation and resolving open questions in agent-based modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Fagiolo, Alessio Moneta, and Paul Windrum, 2007. "A Critical Guide to Empirical Validation of Agent-Based Models in Economics: Methodologies, Procedures, and Open Problems," ''Computational Economics'', 30, pp. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t683473172528275/ 195]–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE is an officially designated special interest group (SIG) of the Society for Computational Economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comp-econ.org/ Society for Computational Economics] website.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] have contributed to the development of ACE.

==Example: finance==
One area where ACE methodology has frequently been applied is asset pricing. [[W. Brian Arthur]], Eric Baum, [[William A. Brock (economist)|William Brock]], Cars Hommes, and Blake LeBaron, among others, have developed computational models in which many agents choose from a set of possible forecasting strategies in order to predict stock prices, which affects their asset demands and thus affects stock prices. These models assume that agents are more likely to choose forecasting strategies which have recently been successful. The success of any strategy will depend on market conditions and also on the set of strategies that are currently being used. These models frequently find that large booms and busts in asset prices may occur as agents switch across forecasting strategies.&lt;ref name=arthuretal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Brock and C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9696">'''American Water Works Association''' ('''AWWA''') is an international [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], scientific and educational association founded to improve water quality and supply. Established in 1881, it has a membership (as of 2012) of around 50,000 members worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awwa.org/about-us.aspx|title=About Us - American Water Works Association|first=American Water Works|last=Association|website=www.awwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the success of the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] after 1974, senior EPA officials cite the vital role that AWWA played as kind of a non‐threatening meeting ground, particularly at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=24 Transcript] (see p24).&lt;/ref&gt;

AWWA members include: water utilities, treatment plant operators and managers, [[scientist]]s, [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]], [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], [[Academia|academics]], [[Regulatory agency|regulators]], and others with an interest in water supply and [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seametrics.com/blog/think-tank-awwa-focuses-on-water/ US Think Tank AWWA Focuses on Water], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirolink.org/resource.html?catid=5&amp;itemid=246 The EnviroLink Network - American Water Works Association], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; AWWA works through advocacy, communications, conferences, education and training, science and technology, and local action among 43 AWWA Sections throughout [[North America]].

AWWA launched AWWAIndia, its first international community, in 2015. AWWAIndia's headquarters office is located in Mumbai, India.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.awwa.org/publications/connections/connections-story/articleid/3904/a-new-day-dawns-in-indias-water-history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Publications and conferences==
To broaden distribution of information on water and related subjects, AWWA publishes the periodicals ''Journal AWWA'' and ''Opflow.''  AWWA also publishes a variety of books, training manuals, standards, reports and videos for use by water professionals and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterandwastewater.com/www_services/readingroom/awwa.htm AWWA-WEF Publications &amp; Books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620140407/http://www.waterandwastewater.com/www_services/readingroom/awwa.htm |date=2012-06-20 }}, Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardmethods.org/ Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookfinder.com/author/american-water-works-association/ American Water Works Association - BookFinder.com], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Association also hosts an annual [[business conference|conference]] and exposition for the entire organization each summer in North America. Section conferences are also held in all parts of North America. Specialty conferences are held throughout the year on topics including water quality, distribution systems and utility management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wef.org/conferences/page_details.aspx?id=8877 AWWA/WEF Information Management &amp; Technology Conference and Exposition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504220709/http://www.wef.org/conferences/page_details.aspx?id=8877 |date=2012-05-04 }}, Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proceedings of the annual and specialty conferences are published by AWWA.

==Water industry resources==
Through the Partnership for Safe Water AWWA also works with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and other water organizations to help water providers optimize system performance beyond existing regulatory levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/water-utility-management/partnership-for-safe-water.aspx|title=Resources &amp; Tools - American Water Works Association|first=American Water Works|last=Association|website=www.awwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AWWA offers opportunities for people to meet, learn, and network at the international, national, and section levels. In addition to publications and conferences for water professionals, AWWA hosts a variety of workshops, symposia, teleconferences, and programs focused on specific aspects of water stewardship.  In cooperation with other professional associations, AWWA is a resource for water professionals’ continuing education and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwdmag.com/wef-awwa-launch-new-work-water-website WEF, AWWA Launch New 'Work for Water' Website] , Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs.com/news/wef-water-security.htm ASCE, AWWA Release Security Standard Guidelines for Water/Wastewater Utilities], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
AWWA presents a number of awards every year to individuals who provide notable service to the drinking water community.  Among the major awards given are the [[Abel Wolman]] Award of Excellence, the [[George W. Fuller|George Warren Fuller]] Award, and the [[John L. Leal|Dr. John L. Leal]] Award.

==Water standards development==
In 1908, AWWA began developing industry standards for products, processes and best practices. The AWWA Standards Program is recognized internationally as a source for scientific and management reference resources for the water community. Currently, there are over 150 AWWA Standards covering [[filtration]] materials, treatment chemicals, [[disinfection]] practices, meters, [[valve]]s, utility management practices, [[storage tank]]s, pumps, and [[ductile iron]], [[steel]], [[concrete]], asbestos-cement, and [[plastic pipe]] and fittings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dot.ny.gov/main/business-center/consultants/forms-publications-and-instructions/engineering-information-issuance-system/eb-repository/eb01038.pdf ENGINEERING BULLETIN 01-038], Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Standing committees periodically review and update the standards as required.

In May 1985, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] entered into a cooperative agreement with a consortium led by [[NSF International]] to develop voluntary third-party consensus standards and a certification program for all direct and indirect drinking water additives. Other members of the consortium include AWWA. The consortium is responsible for the cooperative effort of manufacturers, regulators, product users and other interested parties that develop and maintain the NSF standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsf.org/business/newsroom/pdf/Std60-Brochure.pdf Certification Programs and Services for the Water Treatment and Chemicals Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513132637/http://nsf.org/business/newsroom/pdf/Std60-Brochure.pdf |date=2012-05-13 }}, Accessed June 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water for People==
In February 1991, AWWA founded [[Water For People]], a non-profit international development organization that helps people in [[Developing country|developing countries]] improve their quality of life by supporting the development of locally sustainable drinking water resources, sanitation facilities, and health and hygiene education programs.

==Drinking Water Week==
For more than 35 years, AWWA has set aside a week in the spring to recognize the importance of safe drinking water throughout North America.  In 1988, AWWA brought the event to the attention of the US government and formed a coalition along with the League of Women Voters, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators and the US Environmental Protection Agency. Subsequently, AWWA worked with Representative [[Robert Roe]] and Senator [[Dennis DeConcini]] to sponsor a resolution naming the first week of May as "Drinking Water Week."&lt;ref name="waterweek"&gt;[http://www.awwa.org/resources-tools/public-affairs/public-affairs-events/drinking-water-week.aspx "History of Drinking Water Week."] [http://www.awwa.org American Water Works Association]. Accessed January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, a joint congressional resolution declaration was passed and signed by President Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name="waterweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water treatment training|url=https://watertreatmentservices.co.uk/water/water-treatment-training/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
AWWA is an umbrella organization for 43 sections, each of whom represents a specific geographic region. There are 37 AWWA sections in the United States, 5 Canadian sections, and one each in Mexico and Puerto Rico. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.awwa.org/membership/sections-your-local-awwa/section-services/section-map.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10306">The '''Automatic Picture Transmission''' (APT) system is an analog image transmission system developed for use on [[weather satellites]]. It was introduced in the 1960s and over four decades has provided image data to relatively low-cost user stations at locations in most countries of the world. A user station anywhere in the world can receive local data at least twice a day from each satellite as it passes nearly overhead.

== Transmission ==
[[Image:NOAA APT Frame Format.gif|right|thumb|300px|The APT transmission format]]
&lt;!-- Note, this image is set to 300px to ensure its details are visible, as allowed by WP:STYLE --&gt;

=== Structure ===
The broadcast transmission is composed of two image channels, [[telemetry]] information, and synchronization data, with the image channels typically referred to as Video A and Video B. All this data is transmitted as a horizontal scan line. A complete line is 2080 [[pixels]] long, with each image using 909 pixels and the remainder going to the telemetry and synchronization. Lines are transmitted at 2 per second, which equates to a 4160 words per second, or 4160 [[baud]].

=== Images ===
On NOAA [[Polar Operational Environmental Satellites|POES]] system satellites, the two images are 4&amp;nbsp;km / pixel smoothed 8-bit images derived from two channels of the [[advanced very-high-resolution radiometer]] (AVHRR) sensor. The images are corrected for nearly constant geometric resolution prior to being broadcast; as such, the images are free of distortion caused by the curvature of the Earth.

Of the two images, one is typically long-wave [[infrared]] (10.8 [[micrometers]]) with the second switching between near-visible (0.86 micrometers) and mid-wave infrared (3.75 micrometers) depending on whether the ground is illuminated by sunlight. However, NOAA can configure the satellite to transmit any two of the AVHRR's image channels.

=== Synchronization and telemetry ===
Included in the transmission are a series of [[Synchronization in telecommunications|synchronization]] pulses, minute markers, and telemetry information.

The synchronization information, transmitted at the start of each video channel, allows the receiving software to align its sampling with the baud rate of the signal, which can vary slightly over time. The minute markers are four lines of alternating black then white lines which repeat every 60 seconds (120 lines).

The telemetry section is composed of sixteen blocks, each 8 lines long, which are used as reference values to decode the image channels. The first eight blocks, called "wedges," begin at 1/8 max intensity and successively increase by 1/8 to full intensity in the eighth wedge, with the ninth being zero intensity. Blocks ten through fifteen each encode a calibration value for the sensor. The sixteenth block identifies which sensor channel was used for the preceding image channel by matching the intensity of one of the wedges one through six. Video channel A typically matches either wedge two or three, channel B matches wedge four.

The first fourteen blocks should be identical for both channels. The sixteen telemetry blocks repeat every 128 lines, and these 128 lines are referred to as a frame.

=== Broadcast signal ===
The signal itself is a 256-level [[amplitude modulated]] 2400[[Hertz|Hz]] [[subcarrier]], which is then [[frequency modulated]] onto the 137&amp;nbsp;MHz-band [[Carrier wave|RF carrier]]. Maximum subcarrier modulation is 87% (±5%), and overall [[RF]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is 34&amp;nbsp;kHz. On NOAA POES vehicles, the signal is broadcast at approximately 37[[dBm]] (5 watts)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/klm/html/c4/sec4-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[effective radiated power]].

== Receiving images ==
&lt;!-- Get picture of a QRH antenna or similar --&gt;
An APT signal is continuously broadcast, with reception beginning at the start of the next line when the receiver is within radio range. Images can be received in real-time by relatively unsophisticated, inexpensive receivers during the time the satellite is within radio range, which typically lasts 8 to 15 minutes.

{{As of|2004}} there were almost 5,000 APT receiving stations registered with the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO). It is unclear what percent of the total user-base this represents, since registration is not a requirement, and was only available after 1996.

=== Radio receiver ===
The bandwidth required to receive APT transmissions is approximately 34&amp;nbsp;kHz. Most older scanners (police and fire type receivers) are the standard 15&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth which were designed to support voice transmissions. Newer VHF general coverage receivers are equipped with multiple IF bandpasses; some are, but not limited to: 6&amp;nbsp;kHz, 15&amp;nbsp;kHz 50&amp;nbsp;kHz &amp; 230&amp;nbsp;kHz(broadcast FM). Use of a receiver with too narrow a bandwidth will produce pictures that are saturated in the blacks and whites, as well as possible inversion. Too wide, and the noise floor of the receiver will be too high to acquire a good picture. For the amateur enthusiast, a computer controller receiver is the best option to allow the software to automatically tune and set the required modes for proper reception. There are also dedicated APT receivers made specifically for computer control and APT reception. Specifically, [[Icom Incorporated|ICOM]] PCR1000, PCR1500 &amp; PCR2500 will produce excellent results. Searching on the web for "NOAA APT (RECEPTION or RECEIVER)" will produce a wealth of information on receivers, software, and antennas.

=== Antenna ===
APT images from weather satellites can be received with a right-hand [[circular polarization|circular polarized]], 137&amp;nbsp;MHz antenna. Normally, there is no need to have the antenna follow the satellite and a fixed position antenna will provide good results.

The two most frequently recommended antennas are the [[turnstile antenna|crossed dipole]] and the [[helical antenna|quadrifilar helix antenna]] (QHA).

=== Displaying the images ===
Years ago,{{when|date=January 2015}} to receive APT images, a specialized decoder was required in addition to the receiver to display or print images, much like HF [[WEFAX]] (serving the maritime community). Often both receiver and decoder were combined into one unit.

Today,{{when|date=January 2015}} with the advent of personal computers, all that is required is dedicated software{{which|date=January 2015}} (many of which offer "free" versions [http://www.geo-web.org.uk/soft.php]) and a sound card. The sound card acquires and digitizes the [[Slow-scan television|slow scan]] video (in the audible range) coming from the speaker, phones, or line-out of the receiver, and then the software will process the various visible and infrared channels of the AVHRR sensor. Most software will automatically save every image and publish processed image onto the website of choice, putting up a new image on every pass of an APT satellite.

==== Enhanced images ====
Since each channel of the AVHRR sensor is sensitive to only one [[wavelength]] of light, each of the two images is [[luminance]] only, also known as [[grayscale]]. However, different materials tend to emit or reflect with a consistent relative intensity. This has enabled the development of software that can apply a color palette to the images which simulates visible light coloring. If the decoding software knows exactly where the satellite was, it can also overlay outlines and boundaries to help in utilizing the resulting images.

== History ==

'''Automotive oil recycling''' involves the [[recycling]] of used [[oil]]s and the creation of new products from the recycled oils, and includes the recycling of [[motor oil]] and [[Hydraulic fluid|hydraulic oil]]. Oil recycling also benefits the environment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sugartruck.com/ | title=Refining sector kicks off oil recycling effort.

==Motor oil==
[[File:Oil Change oil pan 2005 gmc suv.JPG|thumb|Oil being drained from an automobile]]

Recycled motor oil can be combusted as fuel, usually in plant boilers, space heaters, or industrial heating applications such as blast furnaces and cement kilns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/media/wwwlboroacuk/content/sustainability/downloads/guidancenotes/wgn025_general_oils.pdf | title=Waste Guidance Note: WGN025 | publisher="Loughborough University" | date=May 1, 2014 | accessdate=March 22, 2016| author=Hunt, Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used motor oil is burned as fuel it must be burned at high temperatures to avoid gaseous pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/8601/IETC_Waste_Oils_Compendium.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y |accessdate=November 27, 2018| title=Compendium of Recycling and Destruction Technologies for Waste Oils |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, waste motor oil can be [[Distillation|distilled]] into [[diesel fuel]] or [[Fuel oil|marine fuel]] in a process similar to oil re-refining, but without the final [[hydrotreating]] process. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The lubrication properties of motor oil persist, even in used oil, and it can be recycled indefinitely.&lt;ref name="Environmental Encyclopedia"/&gt;

===Used motor oil re-refining===

Used oil re-refining is the process of restoring used oil to new oil by removing chemical impurities, heavy metals and dirt.&lt;ref name="GreenvilleOnline"/&gt; Used industrial and automotive oil is recycled at re-refineries. The used oil is first tested to determine suitability for re-refining, after which it is dehydrated and the water distillate is treated before being released into the environment. Dehydrating also removes the residual light fuel that can be used to power the refinery, and additionally captures [[ethylene glycol]] for re-use in recycled antifreeze.

Next, industrial fuel is separated out of the used oil then [[vacuum distillation]] removes the lube cut (that is, the fraction suitable for reuse as lubricating oil) leaving a heavy oil that contains the used oil's additives and other by-products such as asphalt extender. The lube cut next undergoes hydro treating, or [[catalytic hydrogenation]] to remove residual polymers and other chemical compounds, and saturate carbon chains with hydrogen for greater stability.

Final oil separation, or fractionating, separates the oil into three different oil grades: Light viscosity lubricants suitable for general lubricant applications, low viscosity lubricants for automotive and industrial applications, and high viscosity lubricants for heavy-duty applications. The oil that is produced in this step is referred to as re-refined base oil (RRBL).

The final step is blending additives into these three grades of oil products to produce final products with the right detergent and anti-friction qualities. Then each product is tested again for quality and purity before being released for sale to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, C. (1994).

===REOB===
The sludge ("residue") associated with engine oil recycling, which collects at the bottom of re-refining vacuum distillation towers, is known by various names, including "re-refined engine oil bottoms" (abbreviated "REOB" or "REOBs").&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa"&gt;Arnold, Terence S. (senior research chemist, Pavement Materials Team, Office of Infrastructure Research and Development, [[Federal Highway Administration]]; Federal lab manager for the chemistry lab, [[Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center]]; fellow of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in the [[United Kingdom]]), [https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/17sept/03.cfm "What's in Your Asphalt?,"] September 2017 (last modified October 25, 2017), ''Public Roads,'' FHWA-HRT-17-006.htm,"   Office of Research, Development, and Technology, Office of Corporate Research, Technology, and Innovation Management, [[Federal Highway Administration]], [[U.S. Department of Transportation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from the U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) states that:
:The oil in a car engine... contains a variety of additives to enhance the vehicle’s performance. These include polymers, viscosity modifiers, heat stabilizers, additional lubricants, and wear additives. The REOB contains all the additives that were in the waste oil as well as the wear metals from the engine (mainly [[iron]] and [[copper]]). These additives include [[zinc dialkyldithiophosphate]], which contains [[zinc]], [[sulfur]], and  [[phosphorus]]; [[calcium phenate]], which contains [[calcium]]; and [[molybdenum disulfide]], which contains [[molybdenum]] and [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

Some producers of [[asphalt]] for [[Road surface|paving]] have—openly or secretly—incorporated REOBs into their asphalt, creating some controversy and concern in the [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]] community, with some experts suggesting it reduces the durability of the resulting [[Road surface|pavement]].&lt;ref name="whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa" /&gt;

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
'''Church attendance''' is a central religious practice for many [[Christians]]; some [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Catholic Church]] require church attendance on the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday); the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] is held by the Reformed Churches and teaches [[first-day Sabbatarianism]],&lt;ref name="Wigley1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wigley|first=John|title=The Rise and Fall of the Victorian Sunday|year=1980|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=English|isbn=9780719007941|page=800|quote=Following the formulation of the Westminster Confession, fully fledged Sabbatarianism quickly took root too, being embodied in an Act of 1661, then spreading northwards and westwards as the Highlands were opened up after the '45, during which time the doctrine lost its original force and vigour in the Lowlands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus proclaiming the duty of public worship in keeping with the [[Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy|Ten Commandments]].&lt;ref name="McKim2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=Donald K.|title=More Presbyterian Questions, More Presbyterian Answers: Exploring Christian Faith|year=2011|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664503086|page=72|quote=The Westminster Confession urges a strict observance of the Lord's Day as a day of rest and worship, away from "works, words, and thoughts" about "worldly employments and recreations." The whole time is to be devoted to "public and private exercises of [God's) worship, and in duties of necessity and mercy" (''BC'' 6.119). In the United States, many "blue laws" relating to Sunday originated from this general prescription observed by American Puritans of the Reformed tradition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, The General Rules of the Methodist Church also requires "attending upon all the ordinances of God" including "the public worship of God".&lt;ref name="AbrahamKirby2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abraham|first1=William J.|last2=Kirby|first2=James E.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Methodist Studies|date=24 September 2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|language=English|isbn=9780191607431|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1791, the [[government of the United Kingdom]] required attendance at [[church service]]s of the [[Church of England]] (the mother Church of the [[Anglican Communion]] and a [[state Church]]) at least twice a year.&lt;ref name="Day2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Cathy|title=Wiltshire Marriage Patterns 1754-1914: Geographical Mobility, Cousin Marriage and Illegitimacy|date=26 September 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443867924|page=198|quote=Attendance at an Anglican church service at least twice a year was a legal requirement for all people until 1791 and some parishioners endured the minimum church attendance requirement in order to avoid a fine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, all major branches of [[Christianity]], however, encourage church attendance, with one Christian apostolate providing the following biblical imperatives: 
{{quote|The Bible tells us we need to attend church so we can worship God with other believers and be taught His Word for our spiritual growth ({{Bibleverse|Acts|2:42|NRSV}}; {{Bibleverse|Hebrews|10:25|NRSV}}). Church is the place where believers can love one another ({{Bibleverse|1 John|4:12|NRSV}}), encourage one another ({{Bibleverse|Hebrews|3:13|NRSV}}), "spur" one another ({{Bibleverse|Hebrews|10:24|NRSV}}), serve one another ({{Bibleverse|Galatians|5:13|NRSV}}), instruct one another ({{Bibleverse|Romans|15:14|NRSV}}), honor one another ({{Bibleverse|Romans|12:10|NRSV}}), and be kind and compassionate to one another ({{Bibleverse|Ephesians|4:32|NRSV}}).&lt;ref name="Editor2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Houdmann|first=S. |title=Got Questions?: Bible Questions Answered|date=24 April 2014|language=English|isbn=9781490832739|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The [[Lutheran]] Christian theologian [[:da:Balthasar Münter|Balthasar Münter]] stated that church attendance is the "foundation for the Christian life" as "the [[Christian Bible]] and the [[sacraments]] provide the framework for the faith"; he also states that it is important for believers because it aids in the prevention of [[backsliding]], as well as offers "the [[Communion (Christian)|company of other believers]]".&lt;ref name="Roos2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Merethe|title=Enlightened Preaching: Balthasar Münter’s Authorship 1772-1793|date=2013-03-08|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English |isbn=9789004249899|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating the church's average weekend attendance is important since it determines the size of a given church. For example, in the U.S., an average weekend attendance of more than 2,000 people separates a [[mega church]] from a large church, and an average weekend attendance between 51 and 300 people defines the large church; while a small church is the church with an attendance lower than 50 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usachurches.org/church-sizes.htm Church Sizes]. ''USA Churches.org''. Accessed on January 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (Alternative definitions, such as house church, simple church, intentional community, were proposed by [[the Barna Group]], an American private consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.barna.org/barna-update/congregations/45-new-statistics-on-church-attendance-and-avoidance New Statistics on Church Attendance and Avoidance]. ''Barna Group'', March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) A narrow definition of a regular church attendee can be viewed as a synonym for a Sunday service visitation, while a broad definition, names as a regular attendee a person who comes to church during three out of eight weekends.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rebecca and Lindy Lowry.

===Attendance by country===
The frequency at which Christians attend church services varies greatly around the world. In some countries weekly attendance at religious services is common among Christians, while in others weekly attendance is rare. The following attendance statistics are mostly based on self-reporting surveys and may not accurately reflect real attendance figures.

==Demographics ==
[[File:Lucia procession.jpg|thumb|250px|A Swedish Christian girl leads a [[Christian procession|church procession]] on [[Saint Lucy's Day]]]]
Church attendance remains stronger among older demographics, and more common for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?sitemapid=137 Gender profile of church attenders].

The [[Pew Research Center]], which conducts the extensive research and information program ''Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life'', has linked regular church attendance with happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2006/02/13/are-we-happy-yet/5-3/ How Income and Church Attendance Affects Happiness].

Many studies, they report, have similar results ranging from 30 to 50 percent reduction in divorce risk. Happily, this holds largely true for white, black, Asian and Latino couples.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 European Union survey found that religious belief increased with age and was higher among women, those who were leaning towards [[right-wing politics]], and those reflecting more upon philosophical and ethical issues.&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eurobarometer 225: Social values, Science &amp; Technology |publisher=[[Eurostat]] |year=2005 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Iona Institute]] documented increasing church attendance in Ireland, despite sex-abuse scandals that plagued the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="The Iona Institute"&gt;[http://www.ionainstitute.eu/assets/files/Press_Release_by_The_Iona_Institute_2Nov2009-1.pdf ''Press Release by the Iona Institute'', 2 November 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggest{{who|date=December 2016}} the rise is due to the effects of the economic recession.

Research shows that there is a correlation between church attendance and the level of education. For instance, in a Pew Research study from 1996, approximately 34% of high school dropouts went to church on a typical Sunday, while 44% of those with a college degree or higher did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Analysis/96KOHUT/96KOHUT_Var63_1.asp Religion and Politics Survey, 1996]. ''The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA)''. Accessed on 19 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 48% of married individuals attended church on a typical Sunday, compared with 29% of divorced and 31% of never-married individuals. While it is likely that the well-educated and married might over-report their church attendance more often, these findings nevertheless demonstrate that they have maintained a stronger church-going identity than other Americans. A number of studies have been undertaken to examine the topic of [[religiosity and intelligence]] and religiosity and education. Studies also indicate that there is a higher rate of church attendance among married couples.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Influence of parents ===

Several research studies in the USA and Europe found that church attendance practices of parents, especially fathers, can be highly influential in forming the future church attendance practices of their children.

In [[Switzerland]], the [[Fertility and Family Survey]] was commissioned by the [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)]] to enable Switzerland to take part in this international project launched by the [[UNECE Population Activities Unit]]. The survey was conducted between October 1994 and May 1995, with the results being published in 2000 by the [[Council of Europe]].  The results are representative of Switzerland's permanent resident population aged 20–49 and presented in the table below.&lt;ref name="HaugCourbage2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Haug|author2=Philippe Wanner|title=The Demographic Characteristics of National Minorities in Certain European States|url=https://book.coe.int/eur/en/population-studies-series/1949-the-demographic-characteristics-of-national-minorities-in-certain-european-states-volume-2-population-studies-no-31.html|accessdate=12 November 2013|series=Population Studies No. 31|volume=Volume 2|date=January 2000|publisher=Council of Europe|location=Germany|isbn=978-92-871-4159-0|page=154|chapter=IV.

A non-practicing mother with a regular father will see a minimum of two-thirds of her children ending up at church. In contrast, a non-practicing father with a regular mother will see two-thirds of his children not attending church. If his wife is similarly irregular that figure rises to 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Truth About Men &amp; Church | journal = Touchstone | date = June 2003 | first = Robbie | last = Low | volume = 16 | issue = 5| id=| url = http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-05-024-v |publisher= The Fellowship of St. James| accessdate = 2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Egan |first=Richard |url=http://www.ad2000.com.au/church_attendance_the_family_feminism_and_the_declining_role_of_fatherhood_september_2002 |title=Church Attendance: The family, feminism and the declining role of fatherhood |journal=AD2000 |volume=15 |issue=8 |date=September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An American study found similar results on the impact of fathers:&lt;ref name="BruceBruce1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruce|first1=Robert|last2=Bruce|first2=Debra Fulghum|title=Becoming Spiritual Soulmates With Your Child|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y90JAAAACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers |location=Nashville |isbn=978-0-8054-6269-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*When only the father attends Sunday school, 55% of the children attend when grown.
*When only the mother attends Sunday school, 15% of the children attend when grown.
*When neither parent attends Sunday school, only 6% of the children attend when grown.

An unrelated survey in the USA also found fathers to be highly influential in church attendance. It found that if a child is the first person in a household to become a Christian, there is a 3.5% probability everyone else in the household will follow. If the mother is the first to become a Christian, there is a 17% probability everyone else in the household will follow. However, when the father is first, there is a 93% probability everyone else in the household will follow.&lt;ref name="HornerRalston1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bob Horner|author2=Ron Ralston|author3=David Sunde|title=The promise keeper at work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CglElq-WtecC|accessdate=12 November 2013|series=Promise Builders Study Series|date=December 1996|publisher=Focus on the Family Publishing|isbn=978-1-56179-451-5|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=15630 | title = Baptist Press: Want your church to grow?

Church attendance in advanced industrial societies is in gradual general decline with people shifting from weekly to monthly or holiday attendance. Sociologists have attributed this trend to a number of reasons, starting from a simple boredom during services and lack of motivation, to generational incompatibility of belief systems and social changes attributed to modernity.&lt;ref name="Christian Research Association"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801010204/http://www.cra.org.au/pages/00000242.cgi Why People Don't Go to Church... ]. Accessed through Internet Archives on 19 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Research across 65 different nations showed that out of 20 advanced industrial countries - 16 demonstrated a declining rate of monthly church attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Baker | first2 = Wayne E. | year = 2000 | title = Modernization, Cultural Change, and the Persistence of Traditional Values | url = http://my.fit.edu/~gabrenya/cultural/readings/Inglehart-Baker-2000.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 19–51 | doi=10.2307/2657288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in the ''Christianity Today Magazine'' emphasized that at least in America church attendance since the 1990s has remained stable.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter Baker. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/novemberweb-only/145-42.0.html Is Church Attendance Declining?], 11 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, 50% of Americans replied that God is very important in their lives, comparing with 40% of Irish, 28% of Canadians, 26% of Spaniards, 21% of Australians, and 10% of the French.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Michele. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BFWlhQRhQ6gC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=Church+attendance&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vmXcUpOHKvK_sQTOj4H4Cg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Church%20attendance&amp;f=false Handbook of the Sociology of Religion]. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The percent of Americans who regularly attend religious services has fluctuated over time, but presently is at a low point.&lt;ref name="Newport"&gt;Frank Newport, [http://www.gallup.com/poll/200186/five-key-findings-religion.aspx Five Key Findings on Religion in the US], Gallup Poll (December 23, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gallup Poll]] surveys, the yearly aggregate of those who answer "yes" to the question "Did you, yourself, happen to attend church or synagogue in the last seven days, or not?" was 36% in 2014, 2015, and 2016.&lt;ref name="GallupPoll"&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx Religion], Gallup Poll (last accessed May 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very long-running Gallup question: "In 1939, when Gallup first asked this question, 41% said 'yes.' That percentage dropped to 37% in 1940 and rose to 39% in 1950. It continued to climb, reaching as high as 49% at multiple points in the 1950s. Attendance then settled down to figures around 40% for decades, before dropping to 36%" beginning in 2014.&lt;ref name="Newport"/&gt;

The decline in church attendance is more pronounced in developed European countries, where it is suggested that the secular culture overrides interest in religion. In Poland Church attendance has declined from more than 50% in 1979 to 40% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Praktyki niedzielne Polaków (dominicantes)|url = http://iskk.pl/kosciolnaswiecie/211-praktyki-niedzielne-polakow-dominicantes.html|website = iskk.pl|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In the early 1990s, American sociologists Kirk Hadaway, Penny Marler, and Mark Chaves found that weekly attendance at Protestant and Catholic churches in one rural county in [[Ohio]] was only about 20%, whereas self-reported church attendance was 36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hadaway |first1=C.

Kirk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings point to a bigger issue as many people in the world may be over-reporting church attendance because of their self-perception and identity as churchgoing people, indicating a certain psychological aspect to the over-reporting of church attendance. Although surveys of church attendance are aimed to study religious behavior, many respondents view them as questions about their identity. This is especially true among Americans who consider themselves "regular churchgoers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html The Church Attendance Gap: A look at two older studies whose findings should be taken more seriously] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130031340/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/about/news_and_notes_vol4no1.html |date=2013-11-30 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2314">The '''City Statute''' (Law 10.257) is a federal law passed in [[Brazil]] in 2001 that builds on the [[Constitution of Brazil | Federal Constitution of Brazil]] to create a new legal-urban order to provide land access and equity in large urban cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The City Statute: A Commentary|year=2010|publisher=Cities Alliance and Ministry of Cities|location=Sao Paulo, Brazil|pages=120|url=http://www.citiesalliance.org/node/1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citiesalliance.org/sites/citiesalliance.org/files/CA_Images/CityStatuteofBrazil_Eng_ForewordandTOC.pdf The City Statute of Brazil: A commentary], ''The Cities Alliance'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is premised on the idea of the [[Right to the city]] and emerged as a result of many years of popular struggle.&lt;ref name="SCC 2012"&gt;[http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/polis-blog/30417/implementing-right-city-brazil "Implementing the Right to the City in Brazil?"], ''Sustainable Cities Collective'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

It has two main functions. The first is to ensure that the 'social function' of urban land and buildings is put before their commercial value. This has been defined as "the prioritization of [[use value]] over exchange value".&lt;ref name="SCC 2012"/&gt; The second is to ensure 'democratic city management'. This has been defined as "a path to plan, produce, operate and govern cities subject to social control and participation."&lt;ref name="SCC 2012"/&gt;

==Critiques==
It has been argued that, although the legislation is pro-poor, elite actors have been able to use their power to operate in a manner that still privileges elite interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepolisblog.org/2012/01/misusing-city-statute-in-sao-paulo.html Misusing the City Statute in São Paulo], Patricia Rodrigues Samora, ''Polis'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39437">'''Collaborative information seeking''' ('''CIS''') is a field of research that involves studying situations, motivations, and methods for people working in collaborative groups for information seeking projects, as well as building systems for supporting such activities. Such projects often involve information searching or [[information retrieval]] (IR), information gathering, and [[information sharing]]. Beyond that, CIS can extend to collaborative information synthesis and collaborative [[sense-making]].

==Background==
Seeking for information is often considered a solo activity, but there are many situations that call for people working together for [[information seeking]]. Such situations are typically complex in nature, and involve working through several sessions exploring, evaluating, and gathering relevant information. Take for example, a couple going on a trip. They have the same goal, and in order to accomplish their goal, they need to seek out several kinds of information, including flights, hotels, and sightseeing. This may involve them working together over multiple sessions, exploring and collecting useful information, and collectively making decisions that help them move toward their common goal.

It is a common knowledge that collaboration is either necessary or highly desired in many activities that are complex or difficult to deal with for an individual. Despite its natural appeal and situational necessity, collaboration in information seeking is an understudied domain. The nature of the available information and its role in our lives have changed significantly, but the methods and tools that are used to access and share that information in collaboration have remained largely unaltered. People still use general-purpose systems such as email and IM for doing CIS projects, and there is a lack of specialized tools and techniques to support CIS explicitly.

There are also several models to explain [[information seeking]] and [[information behavior]],&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, M. and Jansen, B. J. (2007) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/reddy_jansen_collaborative_information_searching.pdf A model for understanding collaborative information behavior in context: A study of two healthcare teams], Information Processing &amp; Management. 44 (1), 256-273.&lt;/ref&gt; but the areas of collaborative information seeking and collaborative information behavior remain understudied. On the theory side, Shah has presented C5 Model&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C. (2008, June 20). Toward collaborative information seeking (CIS). Position Paper in Proceedings of Collaborative Exploratory Search workshop at JCDL 2008, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C., &amp; Leeder, C. (2016). Exploring Collaborative Work Among Graduate Students Through the C5 Model of Collaboration: A Diary Study. Journal of Information Science (JIS), 42(5), pp. 609-629. &lt;/ref&gt; for studying collaborative situations, including [[information seeking]]. On the practical side, a few specialized systems for supporting CIS have emerged in the recent past, but their usage and evaluations have underwhelmed. Despite such limitations, the field of CIS has been getting a lot of attention lately, and several promising theories and tools have come forth. Multiple reviews of CIS related literature are written by Shah.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C (2010). Collaborative Information Seeking: A Literature Review, in Anne Woodsworth (ed.) Advances in Librarianship (Advances in Librarianship, Volume 32), Emerald Group Publishing Limited, pp.3-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Shah's book&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C (2012). Collaborative Information Seeking: The Art and Science of Making the Whole Greater than the Sum of All. The Information Retrieval Series, Vol. 34. Springer. {{ISBN|978-3-642-28812-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a comprehensive review of this field, including theories, models, systems, evaluation, and future research directions. Other books in this area include one by Morris and [[Jaime Teevan|Teevan]],&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. R. &amp; Teevan, J. (2010). Collaborative Web Search: Who, What, Where, When, and Why. San Rafael, CA: Morgan &amp; Claypool Series on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services (Ed. Gary Marchionini).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Foster's book on collaborative information behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. (2010). Collaborative Information Behavior: User Engagement and Communication Sharing. IGI Global: Hershey, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hansen, Shah, and Klas's edited book on CIS.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, P., Shah, C., &amp; Klas, C.-P. (Eds.) (2015).

(226 pages)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
Depending upon what one includes or excludes while talking about CIS, we have many or hardly any theories. If we consider the past work on the [[groupware]] systems, many interesting insights can be obtained about people working on collaborative projects, the issues they face, and the guidelines for system designers. One of the notable works is by Grudin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grudin | first1 = J | year = 1994 | title = Groupware and social dynamics: eight challenges for developers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 92–105 | doi=10.1145/175222.175230}}&lt;/ref&gt; who laid out eight design principles for developers of [[groupware]] systems.

The discussion below is primarily based on some of the recent works in the field of computer supported cooperative work [[CSCW]], collaborative IR, and CIS.

(2008). Toward Collaborative Information Seeking (CIS). In Proceedings of JCDL 2008 Workshop on Collaborative Exploratory Search, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; which are often used interchangeably.

There are several definitions of such related or similar terms in the literature. For instance, Foster&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. (2006). Collaborative information seeking and retrieval. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST), 40:329–356.&lt;/ref&gt; defined collaborative IR as ''"the study of the systems and practices that enable individuals to collaborate during the seeking, searching, and retrieval of information."'' Shah&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C. (2009). Lessons and challenges for Collaborative Information Seeking (CIS) systems developers. In Proceedings of GROUP 2009 Workshop on Collaborative Information Behavior, Sanibel Island, Florida.&lt;/ref&gt; defined CIS as a process of collaboratively seeking information that is ''"defined explicitly among the participants, interactive, and mutually beneficial."'' While there is still a lack of a definition or a terminology that is universally accepted, but most agree that CIS is an active process, as opposed to [[collaborative filtering]], where a system connects the users based on their passive involvement (e.g., buying similar products on Amazon).

===Models of collaboration===
Foley and Smeaton&lt;ref name="fs2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foley | first1 = Colum | last2 = Smeaton | first2 = Alan F. | year = 2010 | title = Division of labour and sharing of knowledge for synchronous collaborative information retrieval | doi = 10.1016/j.ipm.2009.10.010 | journal = Inf. Process. Manage | volume = 46 | issue = 6| pages = 762–772 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  defined two key aspects of collaborative information seeking as ''division of labor'' and the ''sharing of knowledge''. Division of labor allows collaborating searchers to tackle larger problems by reducing the duplication of effort (e.g., finding documents that one's collaborator has already discovered). The sharing of knowledge allows searchers to influence each other's activities as they interact with the retrieval system in pursuit of their (often evolving) information need. This influence can occur in real time if the collaborative search system supports it, or it can occur in a turn-taking, asynchronous manner if that is how interaction is structured.

[[Jaime Teevan|Teevan]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name="tmb2009"&gt;Jaime Teevan, Meredith Ringel Morris, and Steve Bush. 2009. Discovering and using groups to improve personalized search. In Proceedings of the Second ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM '09), Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Paolo Boldi, Berthier Ribeiro-Neto, and B. Barla Cambazoglu (Eds.). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 15-24. DOI=10.1145/1498759.1498786 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1498759.1498786&lt;/ref&gt;  characterized two classes of collaboration, task-based vs. trait-based. Task-based collaboration corresponds to intentional collaboration; trait-based collaboration facilitates the sharing of knowledge through inferred similarity of information need.

===Situations, motivations, and methods===
One of the important issues to study in CIS is the instance, reason, and the methods behind a collaboration. For instance, Morris,&lt;ref name="Morris, M. R. 2008"&gt;Morris, M. R. (2008). A survey of collaborative web search practices. In Proceedings of SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pages 1657–1660, Florence, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; using a survey with 204 [[knowledge worker]]s at a large technology company found that people often like and want to collaborate, but they do not find specialized tools to help them in such endeavors. Some of the situations for doing collaborative information seeking in this survey were travel planning, shopping, and literature search. Shah,&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C (2010). Working in Collaboration - What, Why, and How? Proceedings of Collaborative Information Retrieval workshop at CSCW 2010. Savannah, GA: February 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, using personal interviews, identified three main reasons why people collaborate.
#''Requirement/setup''. Sometimes a group of people are "forced" to collaborate. Example includes a merger between two companies.
#''Division of labor''. Working together may help the participants to distribute the workload. Example includes a group of students working on a class project.
#''Diversity of skills''. Often people get together because they could not individually possess the required set of skills. Example includes co-authorship, where different authors bring different set of skills to the table.

As far as the tools and/or methods for CIS are concerned, both Morris and Shah found that email is still the most used tool. Other popular methods are face-to-face meetings, IM, and phone or conference calls. In general, the choice of the method or tool for our respondents depended on their situation (co-located or remote), and objective (brainstorming or working on independent parts).

===Space-time organization of CIS systems and methods===
The classical way of organizing collaborative activities is based on two factors: location and time.&lt;ref name="Rodden, T. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rodden | first1 = T | year = 1991 | title = A Survey of CSCW Systems | url = | journal = Interacting with Computers | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 319–353 | doi=10.1016/0953-5438(91)90020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Hansen &amp; Jarvelin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = P. | last2 = Jarvelin | first2 = K. | year = 2005 | title = Collaborative information retrieval in an information-intensive domain | url = | journal = Information Processing and Management | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 1101–1119 | doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2004.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Golovchinsky, Pickens, &amp; Back&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Golovchinsky, G., Pickens, J., and Back, M. (2008b). A taxonomy of collaboration in online information seeking. In Proceedings of JCDL 2008 Workshop on Collaborative Exploratory Search, Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; also classified approaches to collaborative IR using these two dimensions of space and time. See "Browsing is a Collaborative Process",&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.40.9584&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where the authors depict various library activities on these two dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Twidale, M. B. and Nichols, D. M. (1996). Collaborative browsing and visualisation of the search process. In Proceedings of Aslib, volume 48, pages 177–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

As we can see from this figure, the majority of collaborative activities in conventional libraries are co-located and synchronous, whereas collaborative activities relating to digital libraries are more remote and synchronous. Social information filtering, or collaborative filtering, as we saw earlier, is a process benefitting from other users' actions in the past; thus, it falls under asynchronous and mostly remote domain. These days email also serves as a tool for doing asynchronous collaboration among users who are not co-located. Chat or IM (represented as 'internet' in the figure) helps to carry out synchronous and remote collaboration.

Rodden,&lt;ref name="Rodden, T. 1991"/&gt; similarly, presented a classification of CSCW systems using the form of interaction and the geographical nature of cooperative systems. Further, Rodden &amp; Blair&lt;ref&gt;Rodden, T. and Blair, G. (1991). CSCW and distributed systems: the problem of control. In Proceedings of ECSCW, pages 49–64, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; presented an important characteristic to all CSCW systems – control. According to the authors, two predominant control mechanisms have emerged within CSCW systems: speech act theory systems, and procedure based systems. These mechanisms are tightly coupled with the kind of control the system can support in a collaborative environment (discussed later).

Often researchers also talk about other dimensions, such as intentionality and depth of mediation (system mediated or user mediated),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; while classifying various CIS systems.

===Control, communication, and awareness===
Three components specific to group-work or collaboration that are highly predominant in the CIS or CSCW literature are control, communication, and awareness. In this section key definitions and related works for these components will be highlighted. Understanding their roles can also help us address various design issues with CIS systems.

====Control====
Rodden identified the value of control in CSCW systems and listed a number of projects with their corresponding schemes for implementing for control. For instance, the COSMOS project&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur, S. B. and Young, R. E. (1988). The COSMOS project: a multi-disciplinary approach to design of computer supported group working. In Speth, R., editor, EUTECO 88: Research into Networks and Distributed Applications, Vienna, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; had a formal structure to represent control in the system. They used roles to represent people or automatons, and rules to represent the flow and processes. Roles of the people could be supervisor, processor, or analyst. Rules could be a condition that a process needs to satisfy in order to start or finish. Due to such a structure seen in projects like COSMOS, Rodden classified these control systems as procedural based systems.

====Communication====
This is one of the most critical components of any collaboration. In fact, Rodden (1991) identified message or communication systems as the class of systems in CSCW that is most mature and most widely used.

Since the focus here is on CIS systems that allow its participants to engage in an intentional and interactive collaboration, there must be a way for the participants to communicate with each other. What is interesting to note is that often, collaboration could begin by letting a group of users communicate with each other. For instance, Donath &amp; Robertson&lt;ref&gt;Donath, J. S. and Robertson, N. (1994). The sociable web. In Proceedings of WWW Conference, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a system that allows a user to know that others were currently viewing the same webpage and communicate with those people to initiate a possible collaboration or at least a co-browsing experience. Providing communication capabilities even in an environment that was not originally designed for carrying out collaboration is an interesting way of encouraging collaboration.

====Awareness====
Awareness, in the context of CSCW, has been defined as ''"an understanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for your own activity"''.&lt;ref&gt;Dourish, P. and Bellotti, V. (1992). Awareness and coordination in shared workspaces. In Proceedings of ACM CSCW, pages 107–114, Toronto, Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt; The following four kinds of awareness are often discussed and addressed in the CSCW literature:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liechti | first1 = O. | last2 = Sumi | first2 = Y. | year = 2002 | title = Awareness and the WWW | url = | journal = International Journal of Human Computer Studies | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 1–5 | doi=10.1006/ijhc.2001.0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Group awareness.'' This kind of awareness includes providing information to each group member about the status and activities of the other collaborators at a given time.
#''Workspace awareness.'' This refers to a common workspace that the group has where they can bring and discuss their findings, and create a common product.
#''Contextual awareness.'' This type of awareness relates to the application domain, rather than the users. Here, we want to identify what content is useful for the group, and what the goals are for the current project.
#''Peripheral awareness.'' This relates to the kind of information that has resulted from personal and the group's collective history, and should be kept separate from what a participant is currently viewing or doing.

Shah and Marchionini&lt;ref&gt;Shah, C., &amp; Marchionini, G. (2010). Awareness in Collaborative Information Seeking. Journal of American Society of Information Science and Technology (JASIST), 61(10), 1970-1986.&lt;/ref&gt; studied awareness as provided by interface in collaborative information seeking. They found that one needs to provide "right" (not too little, not too much, and appropriate for the task at hand) kind of awareness to reduce the cost of coordination and maximize the benefits of collaboration.

==Systems==
A number of specialized systems have been developed back from the days of the [[groupware]] systems to today's Web 2.0 interfaces. A few such examples, in chronological order, are given below.

===Ariadne===
Twidale et al.&lt;ref&gt;Twidale, M. B., Nichols, D. M., and Paice, C. D. (1995). Supporting collaborative learning during information searching. In Proceedings of Computer Supported Col- laborative Learning (CSCL), pages 367–374, Bloomington, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt; developed Ariadne to support the collaborative learning of database browsing skills. In addition to enhancing the opportunities and effectiveness of the collaborative learning that already occurred, Ariadne was designed to provide the facilities that would allow collaborations to persist as people increasingly searched information remotely and had less opportunity for spontaneous face-to-face collaboration.

Ariadne was developed in the days when Telnet-based access to library catalogs was a common practice. Building on top of this command-line interface, Ariadne could capture the users’ input and the database’s output, and form them into a search history that consisted of a series of command-output pairs. Such a separation of capture and display allowed Ariadne to work with various forms of data capture methods.

To support complex browsing processes in collaboration, Ariadne presented a visualization of the search process.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.lis.illinois.edu/~twidale/irinterfaces/ariadne.gif&lt;/ref&gt; This visualization consisted of thumbnails of screens, looking like playing cards, which represented command-output pairs. Any such card can be expanded to reveal its details. The horizontal axis on Ariadne’s display represented time, and the vertical axis showed information on the semantics of the action it represented: the top row for the top level menus, the middle row for specifying a search, and the bottom row for looking at particular book details.

This visualization of the search process in Ariadne makes it possible to annotate, discuss with colleagues around the screen, and distribute to remote collaborators for asynchronous commenting easily and effectively. As we saw in the previous section, having access to one’s history as well as the history of one’s collaborators are very crucial to effective collaboration. Ariadne implements these requirements with the features that let one visualize, save, and share a search process. In fact, the authors found one of the advantages of search visualization was the ability to recap previous searching sessions easily in a multi-session exploratory searching.

===SearchTogether===
More recently, one of the collaborative information seeking tools that have caught a lot of attention is SearchTogether, developed by Morris and [[Eric Horvitz|Horvitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. R. and Horvitz, E. (2007). SearchTogether: An Interface for Collaborative Web Search. In ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST), pages 3–12, Newport, RI.&lt;/ref&gt; The design of this tool was motivated by a survey that the researchers did with 204 knowledge workers,&lt;ref name="Morris, M. R. 2008"/&gt; in which they discovered the following.
* A majority of respondents wanted to collaborate while searching on the Web.
* The most common ways of collaborating in information seeking tasks are sending emails back and forth, using IM to exchange links and query terms, and using phone calls while looking at a Web browser.
* Some of the most popular Web searching tasks on which people like to collaborate are planning travels or social events, making expensive purchases, researching medical conditions, and looking for information related to a common project.

Based on the survey responses, and the current and desired practices for collaborative search, the authors of SearchTogether identified three key features for supporting people’s collaborative information behavior while searching on the Web: awareness, division of labor, and persistence. Let us look at how these three features are implemented.

SearchTogether instantiates ''awareness'' in several ways, one of which is per-user query histories. This is done by showing each group member’s screen name, his/her photo and queries in the “Query Awareness” region. The access to the query histories is immediate and interactive, as clicking on a query brings back the results of that query from when it was executed. The authors identified query awareness as a very important feature in collaborative searching, which allows group members to not only share their query terms, but also learn better query formulation techniques from one another.

Another component of SearchTogether that facilitates awareness is the display of page-specific metadata. This region includes several pieces of information about the displayed page, including group members who viewed the given page, and their comments and ratings. The authors claim that such visitation information can help one either choose to avoid a page already visited by someone in the group to reduce the duplication of efforts, or perhaps choose to visit such pages, as they provide a sign of promising leads as indicated by the presence of comments and/or ratings.

''Division of labor'' in SearchTogether is implemented in three ways: (1) “Split Search” allows one to split the search results among all online group members in a round-robin fashion, (2) “Multi-Engine Search” takes a query and runs it on n different search engines, where ''n'' is the number of online group members, (3) manual division of labor can be facilitated using integrated IM.

Finally, the ''persistence'' feature in SearchTogether is instantiated by storing all the objects and actions, including IM conversations, query histories, recommendation queues, and page-specific metadata. Such data about all the group members are available to each member when he/she logs in. This allows one to easily carry a multi-session collaborative project.

===Cerchiamo===

Cerchiamo&lt;ref name="pgsqb08"&gt;Jeremy Pickens, Gene Golovchinsky, Chirag Shah, Pernilla Qvarfordt, and Maribeth Back. 2008. Algorithmic mediation for collaborative exploratory search. In Proceedings of the 31st annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (SIGIR '08). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 315-322. DOI=10.1145/1390334.1390389 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1390334.1390389
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gapqb08"&gt;Gene Golovchinsky, John Adcock, Jeremy Pickens, Pernilla Qvarfordt, and Maribeth Back. CerchiamoL a collaborative exploratory search tool. Demo presented at the 2008 ACM conference on computer supported cooperative work (CSCW 2008), San Diego, CA, November 08–12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  is a collaborative information seeking tool that explores issues related to algorithmic mediation of information seeking activities and how collaborators' roles can be used to structure the user interface. Cerchiamo introduced the notion of algorithmic mediation, that is, the ability of the system to collect input asynchronously from multiple collaborating searchers, and to use these multiple streams of input to affect the information that is being retrieved and displayed to the searchers.

Cerchiamo collected judgments of relevance from multiple collaborating searchers and used those judgments to create a ranked list of items that were potentially relevant to the information need. This algorithm prioritized items that were retrieved by multiple queries and that were retrieved by queries that also retrieved many other relevant documents. This rank fusion is just one way in which a search system that manages activities of multiple collaborating searchers can combine their inputs to generate results that are better than those produced by individuals working independently.

Cerchiamo implemented two roles&amp;mdash;Prospector and Miner&amp;mdash;that searchers could assume. Each role had an associated interface. The Prospector role/interface focused on running many queries and making a few judgments of relevance for each query to explore the information space. The Miner role/interface focused on making relevance judgments on a ranked list of items selected from items retrieved by all queries in the current session. This combination of roles allowed searchers to explore and exploit the information space, and led teams to discover more unique relevant documents than pairs of individuals working separately.&lt;ref name="pgsqb08" /&gt;

===Coagmento===
[http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] (Latin for "working together") is a new and unique system that allows a group of people work together for their information seeking tasks without leaving their browsers. [http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] has been developed with a client-server architecture, where the client is implemented as a Firefox plug-in that helps multiple people working in collaboration to communicate, and search, share and organize information. The server component stores and provides all the objects and actions collected from the client. Due to this decoupling, [http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] provides a flexible architecture that allows its users to be co-located or remote, working synchronously or asynchronously, and use different platforms.

[http://www.coagmento.org Coagmento] includes a toolbar and a sidebar. The toolbar has several buttons that helps one collect information and be aware of the progress in a given collaboration. The toolbar has three major parts:
* ''Buttons for collecting information and making annotations.'' These buttons help one save or remove a webpage, make annotations on a webpage, and highlight and collect text snippets.
* ''Page-specific statistics.'' The middle portion of the toolbar shows various statistics, such as the number of views, annotations, and snippets, for the displayed page. A user can click on a given statistic and obtain more information. For instance, clicking on the number of snippets will bring up a window that shows all the snippets collected by the collaborators from the displayed page.
* ''Project-specific statistics.'' The last portion of the toolbar displays task/project name and various statistics, including number of pages visited and saved, about the current project. Clicking on that portion brings up the workspace where one can view all the collected objects (pages and snippets) brought in by the collaborators for that project.

The sidebar features a chat window, under which there are three tabs with the history of search engine queries, saved pages and snippets. With each of these objects, the user who created or collected that object is shown. Anyone in the group can access an object by clicking on it. For instance, one can click on a query issued by anyone in the group to re-run that query and bring up the results in the main browser window.

An [[Android (operating system)]] app for Coagmento can be found in the [https://market.android.com/details?id=com.coagmento.mobile Android Market].

===Cosme===
Fernandez-Luna et al.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Luna, J. M., Huete, J. F., Perez-Vazquez, R., Rodriguez-Cano, J. C., and Shah, C. (2010). COSME: A NetBeans IDE plug-in as a team-centric alternative for search driven software development. In Proceedings of GROUP 2010 Workshop on Collaborative Information Seeking, Sanibel Island, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; introduce Cosme (COde Search MEeting) as a NetBeans IDE plug-in that enables remote team of software developers to collaborate in real time during source-code search sessions. The COSME design was motivated by early stadies of C. Foley, M. R. Morris, C. Shah, among others researchers, and by habits of software developers identified in a survey of 117 universities students and professors related with projects of software development, as well as to computer programmers of some companies. The five more commons collaborative search habits (or related to it) of the interviewees was:

* Revision of problems by the team in the workstation of one of them.
* Suggest addresses of Web pages that they have already visited previously, digital books stored in some FTP, or source files of a version control system.
* Send emails with algorithms or explanatory text.
* Division of search tasks among each member of the team for sharing the final result.
* Store relevant information in individual workstation.

COSME is designed to enable either synchronous or asynchronous, but explicit remote collaboration among team developers with shared technical information needs. Its client user interface include a search panel that lets developers to specify queries, division of labor principle (possible combination include the use of different search engines, ranking fusion, and split algorithms), searching field (comments, source-code, class or methods declaration), and the collection type (source-code files or digital documentation). The sessions panel wraps the principal options to management the collaborative search sessions, which consists in a team of developers working together to satisfy their shared technical information needs. For example, a developer can use the embedded chat room to negotiate the creation of a collaborative search session, and show comments of the current and historical search results. The implementation of Cosme was based on CIRLab (Collaborative Information Retrieval Laboratory) instantiation, a groupware framework for CIS research and experimentation, Java as programming language, NetBeans IDE Platform as plug-in base, and Amenities (A MEthodology for aNalysis and desIgn of cooperaTIve systEmS) as software engineering methodology.

==Open-source application frameworks and toolkits==
CIS systems development is a complex task, which involves software technologies and Know-how  in different areas such as distributed programming, information search and retrieval, collaboration among people, task coordination and many others according to the context. This situation is not ideal because it requires great programming efforts. Fortunately, some CIS application frameworks and toolkits are increasing their popularity since they have a high reusability impact for both developers and researchers, like Coagmento Collaboratory and DrakkarKeel.

==Future research directions==
{{originalsyn|section|date=January 2016}}
Many interesting and important questions remain to be addressed in the field of CIS, including
# Why do people collaborate? Identifying their motivations can help us design better support for their specific needs.
# What additional tools are required to enhance existing methods of collaboration, given a specific domain?
# How to evaluate various aspects of collaborative information seeking, including system and user performance?
# How to measure the costs and benefits of collaboration?
# What are the information seeking situations in which collaboration is beneficial? When does it not pay off?
# How can we measure the performance of a collaborative group?
# How can we measure the contribution of an individual in a collaborative group?
# What sorts of retrieval algorithms can be used to combine input from multiple searchers?
# What kinds of algorithmic mediation can improve team performance?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3198">'''Dacryphilia''' (also known as '''dacrylagnia''') is a form of [[paraphilia]] in which one is [[sexual arousal|aroused]] by tears or sobbing.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 48883594 |page= ''p''. 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | page=373 |title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unususal Sexual Practices|first=Anil|last=Aggrawal|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|year=2009|ISBN=978-1-4200-4308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term covers all forms of pleasure from the tears of others. The arousal is achieved when viewing a person in emotional distress. It carries the theme where a person (often a [[Top and bottom in sex and BDSM|Top]] in a [[BDSM]] relationship) induces another (the bottom) to cry, or otherwise show a strong emotion.

== BDSM ==
Dacryphilia may be a form of humiliation in the 'pain/restriction/servitude/humiliation' spectrum of BDSM; for example, a dominant may verbally abuse the submissive in order to elicit a tearful response. In contrast, a Dominant may instead physically torture the submissive to draw tears in a pain scene. In this way, dacryphilia is a form of [[wikt:sadism|sadism]]. A Sensual Dom or [[dominatrix]] may instead choose to elicit tears by making the Sub feel safe enough to become emotionally vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kinkly.com/definition/6750/sensual-domination|title=Sensual Domination|publisher=Kinkly|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychological aspects of dacryphilia are that the causative entity displays the power to control the psychological response from the receiver. This form of power-play therefore brings pleasure, and for some, sexual arousal. Passive dacryphilia involves a third party who also achieves pleasure in watching someone in emotional distress, usually caused by the scening dominant, though the reason does not restrict the pleasure – a person may enjoy the tears of others, whatever the cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dacryphilia/ BDSM Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-BDSM dacryphilia ==

Dacryphilia is not limited to BDSM and may be experienced by those who do not consider themselves a Dom or Sub. They may be aroused when their partner cries during a movie or from the normal emotional vulnerability and strong feelings of love that may make a partner cry during intercourse. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Crying Be Sexually Arousing?

Griffiths|work=Psychology Today|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201601/can-crying-be-sexually-arousing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other usage ==
Dacryphilia is sometimes used to express the pleasure experienced through one's own tears, often as an emotional release.

A dacryphiliac is someone who gets sexually aroused from watching other people cry.

A '''digital channel election''' was the process by which [[television station]]s in the [[United States]] chose which physical [[radio-frequency]] [[TV channel]] they would permanently use after the [[DTV transition in the United States|analog shutdown]] in 2009.  The process was managed and mandated by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] for all full-power TV stations.  [[Low-powered broadcasting|Low-powered television]] (LPTV) stations are going through a somewhat different process, and are also allowed to [[flash-cut]] to digital.

==Process==
Stations could choose to keep their initial [[digital TV]] channel allocation, do a flash-cut to their former [[analog TV]] channel, or attempt to select another channel, often an analog channel or pre-transition digital channel from another station that had been orphaned.  Stations on channels [[band V|52 to 69]] did not have the first option, as the FCC and then the [[U.S. Congress]] revoked them from the [[bandplan]].  

Many stations have chosen to keep their new channels permanently, after being forced to buy all new [[transmitter]]s and [[television antenna]]s.  In some cases where the station's current analog tower could not handle the stress of the new digital antenna's weight and [[wind load]], station owners had to construct entirely new [[broadcast tower]]s in order to comply with the FCC's DTV mandate.  

Most broadcasters were bitter at having to purchase digital equipment and broadcast a digital signal when very few homeowners had digital [[television set]]s.  The FCC allowed broadcasters the opportunity to petition the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) for [[special temporary authority]] (STA) to operate their digital facilities at low power, thereby allowing broadcasters additional time in which to purchase their full-power digital facilities.  However, the FCC gave a stern July 2006 deadline for all full-power television stations to at least replicate 80% of their current analog [[broadcast range|coverage area]], or run the risk of losing [[service contour|protection]] from encroachment by other stations.  

Most stations made an election in the first round, and most of those received their requested channels.  Applicant conflicts with neighboring stations had to request a different channel in the second round.  The third and final round occurred in May 2006.

Some stations requested that the FCC assign the best available channel.

==Considerations==
Aside from the practical considerations above, there are also technical considerations which are based on the [[physics]] of the [[radio spectrum]].  These affect the [[radio propagation]] of DTV just as with other signals.

The low [[VHF]] channels from 2 to 6, while requiring the lowest power (up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW analog video or 20&amp;nbsp;kW digital), are prone to [[electromagnetic interference]]. The [[ATSC]] digital TV system has severe problems with susceptibility to [[Electromagnetic interference|impulse noise]], bursts of interference which briefly render the entire channel unusable, due to its inability to instantaneously determine where in a video frame to resume display when the signal returns. The result is [[macroblock]]ing and [[pixelation]] of the entire signal whenever impulse noise sources (such as [[Electric motor|motors]], [[electrical appliance|appliances]] or [[electrical storm]]s) are active. They also are the lowest in [[frequency]] and therefore the longest in [[wavelength]], requiring the largest antennas both to [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmit]] and receive.  They are also prone to [[atmospheric ducting]], especially at [[night]] when the [[Soil|ground]] (and the [[air]] near it) cools rapidly.  Because of the antenna size (a [[half wave radiator|properly-sized]] VHF TV 2 [[dipole]] spans approximately eight feet (2.7 meters)) and the fact that there are only five channels in this band, most set-top antennas are designed to receive the higher TV bands.  

Furthermore, channel 6 abuts the [[FM broadcast band]] at 88&amp;nbsp;MHz, possibly causing and receiving [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]] from [[adjacent channel]]s.  (The FCC refused to remove this band from the bandplan, because taking the high UHF channels instead would bring in more money at [[auction]].  This also contradicts what has been done in every other country that has forced a DTV transition, all giving up the VHF bands.)  A completely unaddressed issue is the use of [[HD Radio]] on 88.1 [[FM broadcasting|FM]], where the lower [[sideband]] overlaps the far upper sideband of digital TV channel 6.

The upper VHF ([[band III]]), including channels 7 to 13, is better about the above problems, but still not as good as the [[UHF]] band.  By keeping these for TV, it also prevents the use of the band for [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]], as is done with local [[radio station]]s in [[Europe]].

The UHF band contains 55 channels from 14 to 69, which excludes [[channel 37]] in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;  Channels 52 to 69 are unavailable for digital TV, on a permanent basis, leaving only 37 channels.  Stations generally try to choose a lower frequency, which causes some crowding and therefore election conflicts on the lowest channels.  Still, the UHF band has great advantages over VHF, in large part because of its propagation characteristics and lack of [[Impulse noise (audio)|impulse noise]]. The shorter wavelength also means that smaller antennas are needed, an advantage for both the [[broadcasting|broadcaster]] and the viewer.  Another advantage is that the great majority of stations use this band, requiring only one type of antenna (and sometimes [[amplifier]]) to receive all of those stations.  Key disadvantages of UHF operation include the need for greater transmitter power and the reduced coverage area; the [[knife-edge effect|edge diffraction]] of signals around terrestrial obstacles degrades rapidly as frequency is increased.

==Effects==
Channel elections generally will not affect consumers in the long run, because [[virtual channel]] numbering will keep stations appearing on their original analog channel numbers, except the times that a station has trouble transmitting [[PSIP]] [[metadata]].  

However, most [[ATSC tuner]]s must re-[[wikt:scan|scan]] for stations that change their RF channel.  On some this is as simple as manually punching-in the new RF channel, at which point the decoder will read the PSIP data and re-map to the proper channel number.  However, this may not delete the original mapping, leaving the original "dead" channels interleaved with the new ones (such as 5.1 old, 5.1 new, 5.2 old, 5.2 new), or possibly confusing the receiver (and the user). In many cases, a receiver will not automatically add the new mapping at all if an old one exists. Completely re-scanning will normally solve this, but may not pick-up stations that are weak or temporarily [[off-air]] during the scan, causing the need to manually enter them (if this is even possible with the given receiver).

Where stations are moving to a different frequency band (such as [[UHF]] to [[VHF]]), this will affect [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] selection.  Many antennas marketed for [[HDTV]] use are UHF-only or perform poorly on VHF, while many 82-channel VHF/UHF antennas are a compromise design strongly favoring VHF channels.

      <comment>/* Syllogism where the audience supplies a premise */I replaced with the correct word. The previous author was looking for the word “axiom”.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6107">An '''enthymeme''' ({{lang-el|ἐνθύμημα}}, ''enthumēma'') is a rhetorical [[syllogism]] (a three-part deductive [[Logical argument|argument]]) used in oratorical practice. Originally theorized by [[Aristotle]], there are four types of enthymeme, at least two of which are described in Aristotle's work.&lt;ref name="Benoit1982"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Benoit
  | first = William
  | authorlink = 
  | title = The Most Important Passage in Aristotle's Rhetoric
  | journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly
  | volume = 12
  | issue = 1
  | pages = 2-9
  | date = Winter 1982
  | 
  | accessdate = 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle referred to the enthymeme as "the body of proof", "the strongest of rhetorical proofs...a kind of syllogism" (''Rhetoric'' I.I.3,11). He considered it to be one of two kinds of proof, the other of which was the [[paradeigma]]. Maxims, Aristotle thought to be a derivative of enthymemes. (''Rhetoric'' II.XX.1)

== Syllogism with an unstated premise ==
The first type of enthymeme is a truncated syllogism, or a syllogism with an unstated premise. 

Here is an example of an enthymeme derived from a syllogism through truncation (shortening) of the syllogism:
*"'''[[Socrates]] is mortal because he's human'''."

:The complete ''formal'' syllogism would be the classic:

::All humans are mortal. (major premise – unstated)
::Socrates is human. ([[minor premise]] – stated)
::Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion – stated)

While syllogisms lay out all of their premises and conclusion explicitly, these kinds of enthymemes keep at least one of the premises or the conclusion unstated.

== Syllogism based on signs == 

In the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', Aristotle argues that some enthymemes are derived from syllogisms that are based on signs (''semeia'') instead of absolute facts. In this context, signs are "things [that] are so closely related that the presence or absence of one indicates the presence or absence of the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speaking.pitt.edu/student/public-speaking/reasoning.html|title=Reasoning|date=2008-08-21|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are given below. 

*"'''He is ill, since he has a cough.'''"
*"'''Since she has a child, she has given birth.'''"

In the examples, 'having a cough' and 'having a child' are signs of illness and giving birth respectively. In both cases the enthymeme is only probably true because there are other sources of coughs and children besides pathogens and parturition respectively, such as allergies and adoption.

== Syllogism where the audience supplies a premise ==

The third kind of enthymeme consists of a syllogism with a missing premise that is supplied by the audience as an unstated assumption. In the words of rhetorician William Benoit, the missing premise is: "assumed by rhetor when inventing and by audience when understanding the argument."&lt;ref name="Benoit1987"&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Benoit
  | first = William
  | authorlink = 
  | title = On Aristotle's Example
  | journal = Philosophy and Rhetoric
  | volume = 20
  | issue = 4
  | pages = 261-267
  | date = 1987
  | 
  | accessdate = 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this kind of enthymeme is as follows: 
*"'''''[[Candide]]'' is a typical French novel; therefore it is vulgar.'''"

In this case, the missing term of the syllogism is "French novels are vulgar" and might be an assumption held by an audience that would make sense of the enthymematic argument. Such unstated premises can also rise to the level of axioms (statements so commonly accepted as to be thought universally true).

== Visual enthymemes ==

Another kind of enthymeme is the visual enthymeme. Scholars have argued that words are not the only form of expression that can be understood to form enthymematic arguments. Pictures can also function as enthymemes because they require the audience to help construct their meaning.&lt;ref name="Smith2007"&gt;{{cite journal

  | volume = 37
  | pages = 133-149
  | date = 2001
  | 
  | accessdate = 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism == 

Some scholars argue that our understanding of the enthymeme has evolved over time and is no longer representative of the enthymeme as originally conceived by Aristotle. This is obviously true of the visual enthymeme, only conceived in the early twenty-first century and may also be true of the enthymeme as truncated syllogism. Carol Poster argues that this later interpretation of the enthymeme was invented by British rhetoricians such as [[Richard Whately]] in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Poster2003"&gt;{{cite journal

{{Semiotics}}
'''Film semiotics''' is the [[semiotics]] of [[film]]; the study of signs as they pertain to film on a variety of levels.

== Early semioticians of film ==
*  [[Ricciotto Canudo]] – Italian writer working in the 1920s, identified “''language-like character of cinema''”.&lt;ref name="Stam"&gt;Stam, R., Burgoyne, R., &amp; Lewis, S. (1992). New vocabularies in film semiotics: structuralism, post-structuralism, and beyond. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Louis Delluc]] – French writer, working in the 1920s, wrote of the ability of film to transcend national language.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;
* [[Vachel Lindsay]] – referred to film as “''hieroglyphic language''”.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;
* [[Béla Balázs]] – Hungarian film theorist who wrote about language-like nature of film from the 1920s to the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

== Russian formalism (1910s–1930s) ==

[[Yury Tynyanov]] was a Russian writer and literary critic. [[Boris Eichenbaum]] outlined principles of syntagmatic construction. (see: [[syntagmatic analysis]]) Syntagmatic analysis deals with sequence and structure, as opposed to the paradigm emphasis of [[paradigmatic analysis]]. The cinema, for Eichenbaum, is a “''particular of figurative language,” the stylistics of which would treat filmic “syntax,” the linkage of shots in “phrases” and “sentences.''””  &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

Eichenbaum and Tynyanov had two different approaches to interpreting the signs of film. ''"Tynyanov spoke of the cinema as offering the visible world in the form of semantic signs engendered by cinematic procedures such as lighting and montage, while Eichenbaum saw film in relation to “inner speech” and “image translations of linguistic tropes.''”" &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

== Structuralism and post-structuralism (1950s–present) ==
The film-language concept was explored more deeply in the 1960s when [[post-structuralist]] thinkers started to criticize [[structuralism]]. Also, semiotics became popular in academia. Early work in this field dealt with “''contrasting arbitrary signs of natural language with the motivated, iconic signs of the cinema''”.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

* [[Umberto Eco]] – Italian novelist and semiotician
* [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] – Italian director and writer
* [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] – French film theorist
* [[Roland Barthes]] – French literary theorist

== Concepts ==
'''Denotation and connotation'''

Film communicates meaning denotatively and connotatively. What the audience sees and hears is denotative, it is what it is and they don’t have to strive to recognize it.  At the same time these sounds and images are connotative and the way the scene is shot is meant to evoke certain feelings from the viewer.  Connotation typically involves emotional overtones, objective interpretation, social values, and ideological assumptions.  According to Christian Metz, “The study of connotation brings us closer to the notion of the cinema as an art (the “seventh art”).” &lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metz|first1=Christian|title=Film language: A semiotics of the cinema|date=1974|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within connotations, paradigmatic connotations exist, which would be a shot that is being compared with its unrealized companions in the paradigm. A low angle shot of a rose conveys a sense that the flower is somehow dominant or overpowering because we unconsciously compare it with an overhead shot of a rose which would diminish its importance.  Syntagmatic connotation would not compare the rose shot to other potential shots but compare it with actual shots that precede or follow it. The meaning adheres to it because its compared to other shots we actually see.&lt;ref name="Monaco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monaco|first1=James|title=How to read a film: the world of movies, media, and multimedia: language, history, theory.|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narrative'''

Narrative is generally known as having two components; the story presented and the process of telling it, or narration, often referred to as narrative discourse. Film narrative theory seeks to uncover the apparently “motivated” and “natural” relationship between the signifier and the story-world in order to reveal the deeper system of cultural associations and relationships that are expressed through narrative form.&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt; As Roland Barthes has said, “narrative may be transmitted through oral or written language; through static or moving images, through gestures and through an organized mixture of all these substances. There is narrative in myth, legend, fables, fairytales, novellas, novels, history, novel, epos, tragedy, drama, comedy, pantomime, pictures, comics, events and conversation. In these unlimited forms, narrative exists at all times, in all corners of the earth, in all societies. Narrative begins with the history of mankind.” Films use a combination of dialog, sounds, visual images, gestures and actions to create the narrative. Narrators, usually in a voice-over format, are very popular in documentary film and greatly assist in telling the story while accompanying powerful shots.

'''Tropes'''

Metonymy refers to the ability of a sign to represent something entirely, while literally only being a part of it.  An example of this is the Eiffel Tower, which is a metonym for Paris. Film uses metonyms frequently because they rely on the external to reveal the internal. Another powerful semiotic tool for filmmaking is the use of metaphors, which are defined as a comparison between two things that are unrelated but share some common characteristics. In film, a pair of consecutive shots is metaphorical when there is an implied comparison of the two shots. For instance, a shot of an airplane followed by a shot of a bird flying would be metaphorical, implying that the airplane is (or is like) a bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics for Beginners|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important and notable works ==
'''Umberto Eco’s ''Articulations of The Cinematic Code'' (1976)'''

Umberto Eco’s research dealt with the semiology of visual codes using the work of Metz and Pasolini as a starting point. Eco viewed the task of semiology as important and radical. “''Semiology shows us the universe of ideologies, arranged in codes and sub-codes, within the universe of signs, and these ideologies are reflected in our preconstituted ways of using the language.''” &lt;ref name="Eco" /&gt;

Triple articulation codes consist of figures, signs and elements. Eco assumed that the cinematic codes are the only ones using triple articulation. Where current linguistic conventions might use two axes, the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic, the triple articulation can use [[kinesics]] to identify discrete units of time.&lt;ref name="Eco"&gt;Eco, U. (1970). Articulations of the Cinematic Code. Cinematics, 1(1), 590-605.&lt;/ref&gt; Articulations are introduced into a code to communicate the maximum number of combinable elements. Because we normally experience non-articulated and double-articulated codes, running across a code with triple articulation can be overwhelming. “''The contextual wealth of this combination makes the cinema a richer form of communication than speech.''” &lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;

'''Summary of codes'''&lt;ref name="Eco"/&gt;

1. Perceptive codes

2. Codes of recognition

3. Codes of transmission

4. Tonal codes

5. Iconic codes (figures, signs and semes)

6. Iconographic codes

7. Codes of taste and sensibility

8. Rhetorical codes

9. Stylistic codes

10. Codes of the unconscious

'''Christian Metz’s ''Film Language: A Semiotics of Cinema'' (1974''')

This collection of Metz’s writings on cinematographic problems was informed by insights from [[structural linguistics]].
“''The study of the cinema as an art – the study of cinematographic expressiveness – can therefore be conducted according to methods derived from linguistics...through its procedures of denotation, the cinema is a specific language''” &lt;ref&gt;Metz, C. (1974). Film language; a semiotics of the cinema. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Stam, Robert Burgoyne, and Sandy Flitterman-Lewis’s ''New Vocabularies in Film Semiotics: Structuralism, Post-structuralism, and Beyond'' (1992)'''

This work highlighted film semiotics as a new tool in art criticism. The book provided an overview of previous thinkers and defined terms critical to semiotic film theory. “''This book is intended as a didactic introduction to the vocabulary of the field, not as a series of interventions in film theory''” &lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part One ''The Origins of Semiotics'''''

Semiotics must be viewed through the broader context of the linguistic nature of contemporary thought.

"''The overarching meta-discipline of semiotics...can be seen as a local manifestation of a more widespread "linguistic turn," an attempt to reconceptualize the world "through" linguistics.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Two ''Cine-semiology'''''

Dealt with the cinematic sign, The Grand Syntagmatic, textual systems and analysis, semiotics of filmic sound, language in the cinema.

'''Part Three ''Film-narratology'''''

Taking cues from structuralism and [[Russian Formalism]], film narrative theory attempts to "''designate the basic structures of story processes and to define the aesthetic languages unique to film narrative discourse.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Four ''Psychoanalysis'''''

The relationship between human psyche and cinematic representation is explored. "''One of the aims, therefore, of psychoanalytic film theory is a systematic comparison of the cinema as a specific kind of spectacle and the structure of the socially and psychically constituted individual.''"&lt;ref name="Stam" /&gt;

'''Part Five ''From realism to intertextuality'''''

Describes the evolution from an emphasis on realism in the 1950s to the [[intertextuality]] of the 1970s.

[[Image:Glasmacherfamilie Familie Friedrich mit Kreuz 1596.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Votive portrait]] of the Northern Bohemian Glassworks Master '''Martin Friedrich the Younger''' and his Family (about 1596).]]

== History ==
From as early as 750 years ago, the shadowy picture of the oldest German-Bohemian glass-maker family Friedrich emerges, who contributed greatly towards the creation of the world-famous [[Bohemian glass]] (also called ''Bohemian [[Lead crystal|Crystal]]''). In pre-[[Hussite]] times they produced amazing works of vitreous art near Daubitz, nowadays called [[Doubice]]. During the 16th and 17th centuries, as a result of the family’s development of their glass factory in Oberkreibitz, today [[Horní Chribská]], Bohemian glass art enjoyed its first heyday.

The expansion of this glass-maker family over many European countries is unparalleled. Its hut master dynasties made glass history in [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Austria]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and [[Slovenia]]. Its glass-makers proved their artistic skills and technological experience in [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Styria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]] and so on. The well-known glass artist [[Friedrich Egermann]] also ranked among the family’s descendants as the  natural historian and explorer of South America [[Thaddäus Haenke]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6740">The '''fuzzy pay-off method for real option valuation''' ('''FPOM''' or '''pay-off method''') &lt;ref&gt;Collan, M., Fullér, R., and Mezei, J., 2009, [http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jamds/2009/238196.html Fuzzy Pay-Off Method for Real Option Valuation], ''[[Journal of Applied Mathematics and Decision Sciences]]'', vol. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is a new method for [[valuation (finance)|valuing]] [[real options]], created in 2008. It is based on the use of [[fuzzy logic]] and [[fuzzy number]]s for the creation of the possible pay-off [[statistical distribution|distribution]] of a project (real option). The structure of the method is similar to the probability theory based [[Datar–Mathews method for real option valuation]],&lt;ref&gt;Datar, V. &amp; Mathews, S. 2004. European Real Options: An Intuitive Algorithm for the Black Scholes Formula. Journal of Applied Finance, 14(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, S. &amp; Datar, V. 2007. A Practical Method for Valuing Real Options: The Boeing Approach. Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, 19(2): 95–104.&lt;/ref&gt; but the method is not based on probability theory and uses fuzzy numbers and possibility theory in framing the real option valuation problem.

==Method==

The Fuzzy pay-off method derives the real option value from a pay-off distribution that is created by using three or four cash-flow scenarios (most often created by an expert or a group of experts). The pay-off distribution is created simply by assigning each of the three cash-flow scenarios a corresponding definition with regards to a fuzzy number (triangular fuzzy number for three scenarios and a trapezoidal fuzzy number for four scenarios). This means that the pay-off distribution is created without any simulation whatsoever. This makes the procedure easy and transparent. The scenarios used are a minimum possible scenario (the lowest possible outcome), the maximum possible scenario (the highest possible outcome) and a best estimate (most likely to happen scenario) that is mapped as a fully possible scenario with a full degree of membership in the set of possible outcomes, or in the case of four scenarios used - two best estimate scenarios that are the upper and lower limit of the interval that is assigned a full degree of membership in the set of possible outcomes.

The main observations that lie behind the model for deriving the real option value are the following:
# The fuzzy NPV of a project is (equal to) the pay-off distribution of a project value that is calculated with [[fuzzy number]]s.
# The mean value of the positive values of the fuzzy [[net present value|NPV]] is the "possibilistic" mean value of the positive fuzzy NPV values.
# Real option value, ROV, calculated from the fuzzy NPV is the "possibilistic" [[mean value]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. &amp; Majlender, P. 2003. On weighted possibilistic mean and variance of fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 136: 363–374.&lt;/ref&gt; of the positive fuzzy NPV values multiplied with the positive area of the fuzzy NPV over the total area of the fuzzy NPV.

The real option formula can then be written simply as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ROV} = \frac{A(\mathrm{Pos})}{A(\mathrm{Pos})+A(\mathrm{Neg})} \times E[A_+]&lt;/math&gt;

::where ''A''(Pos) is the area of the positive part of the fuzzy distribution, ''A''(Neg) is the area of the negative part of the fuzzy distribution, and ''E''[''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;] is the mean value of the positive part of the distribution. It can be seen that when the distribution is totally positive, the real options value reduces to the expected (mean) value, ''E''[''A''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;].

As can be seen, the real option value can be derived directly from the fuzzy NPV, without simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Collan, M., Fullér, R., and Mezei, J., 2009, Fuzzy Pay-Off Method for Real Option Valuation, Journal of Applied Mathematics and Decision Sciences, vol. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, simulation is not an absolutely necessary step in the Datar–Mathews method, so the two methods are not very different in that respect. But what is totally different is that the Datar–Mathews method is based on probability theory and as such has a very different foundation from the pay-off method that is based on ''possibility'' theory: the way that the two models treat uncertainty is fundamentally different.

==Use of the method==
The pay-off method for real option valuation is very easy to use compared to the other real option valuation methods and it can be used with the most commonly used [[spreadsheet|spreadsheet software]] without any [[add-in]]s. The method is useful in analyses for decision making regarding investments that have an uncertain future, and especially so if the underlying data is in the form of cash-flow scenarios. The method is less useful if optimal timing is the objective. The method is flexible and accommodates easily both one-stage investments and multi-stage investments ([[compound option|compound]] real options).

The method has been taken into use in some large international industrial companies for the valuation of [[research and development]] projects and portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;Heikkilä, M., 2009, Selection of R&amp;D Portfolios of Real Options with Fuzzy Pay-offs under Bounded Rationality, IAMSR Research Report, 1/2009, {{ISBN|978-952-12-2316-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these analyses [[triangular distribution|triangular]] fuzzy numbers are used. Other uses of the method so far are, for example, R&amp;D project valuation  IPR valuation, valuation of [[M&amp;A]] targets and expected synergies,&lt;ref&gt;Kinnunen, J., 2010, Valuing [[M&amp;A|M&amp;A Synergies]] as (Fuzzy) Real Options, 14th Annual International Conference on Real Options in Rome, Italy, June 16–19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; valuation and optimization of M&amp;A strategies, valuation of area development (construction) projects, valuation of large industrial real investments. 

The use of the pay-off method is lately taught within the larger framework of real options, for example at the [[Lappeenranta University of Technology]] and at the [[Tampere University of Technology]] in Finland.

The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary substantially among cultures, while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures. There is ongoing debate as to what extent gender roles and their variations are [[Sex differences in humans|biologically determined]], and to what extent they are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]].

Various groups, most notably the [[feminism|feminist movement]], have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive or inaccurate.

The term ''gender role'' was first used by [[John Money]] and colleagues in 1954, during the course of his study of [[intersex]] individuals, to describe the manners in which these individuals expressed their status as a [[male]] or [[female]] in a situation where no clear biological assignment existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last  = Janssen | first = D.F. | year = 2018 | title = Know Thy Gender: Etymological Primer | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | issn = 0004-0002 | doi=10.1007/s10508-018-1300-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles are culturally specific, and while some cultures distinguish only two ([[boy]] and [[girl]] or [[man]] and [[woman]]), others recognize more.

Gender ''role,'' which refers to the cultural expectations as understood by gender classification, is not the same thing as [[gender identity]]{{contradiction inline|date=December 2018}}, which refers to the internal sense of one's own gender, whether or not it aligns with categories offered by societal norms. The point at which these [[Internalization|internalized]] gender identities become [[Externalization|externalized]] into a set of expectations is the genesis of a gender role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adler | first1 = P. | last2 = Kless | first2 = S. | last3 = Adler | first3 = P | year = 1992 | title = Socialization to gender roles: Popularity among elementary school boys and girls | url = | journal = Sociology of education | volume = 65 | issue = 3| pages = 169–087 | doi=10.2307/2112807| jstor = 2112807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Acker | first1 = J | year = 1992 | title = From sex roles to gendered institutions | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology: A Journal of Reviews | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 565–569 | doi=10.2307/2075528| jstor = 2075528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of gender as a social construct==
{{Main|Social construction of gender}}
[[File:Gobert - Louis XV as child, Fundación Jakober.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Changing norms of [[gender socialization]]: [[Louis XV]] in 1712, wearing the customary clothes of [[breeching (boys)|unbreeched]] boys, would be considered [[Cross-dressing|cross-dressed]] in the 21st century.]]

Some theories – which are collectively termed ''social construction'' theories – claim that gender behavior is mostly due to social conventions, although opposing theories disagree, such as theories in [[evolutionary psychology]].

Most children learn to categorize themselves by gender by the age of three.&lt;ref name="Pate"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pate |first=J. s.d |title=What everyone should know about gender and sexuality |url=http://jamespatemd.com/Pubs/gendersexuality.htm|website=jamespatemd.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119172004/http://jamespatemd.com/Pubs/gendersexuality.htm |archivedate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From birth, in the course of gender socialization, children learn gender stereotypes and roles from their parents and environment. In a traditional view, males learn to manipulate their physical and social environment through physical strength or dexterity, while girls learn to present themselves as objects to be viewed.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. E. (1986) Language practices and self definition: The case of gender identity acquisition. The Sociological Quarterly vol. 27, issue 3, pp 295-311&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionists state, for example, that gender-segregated children's activities create the appearance that gender differences in behavior reflect an essential nature of male and female behavior.&lt;ref name="Fenstermaker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenstermaker|first=Sarah|title=Doing Gender, Doing Difference: Inequality, Power, and Institutional Change|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-93179-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7vLBpyjCFwsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aspect of [[role theory]], gender role theory "treats these differing distributions of women and men into roles as the primary origin of sex-differentiated social behavior, their impact on behavior is mediated by psychological and social processes."&lt;ref&gt;Eagly, A.H. (1997). Sex differences in social behavior: Comparing social role theory and evolutionary psychology. American Psychologist, December, 1380-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gilbert Herdt]], gender roles arose from correspondent inference, meaning that general labour division was extended to gender roles.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Gender roles are considered by social constructionists to be hierarchical, and are characterized as a male-advantaged gender hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = W. | last2 = Eagly | first2 = A.

According to Eagly ''et al.'', the consequences of gender roles and stereotypes are sex-typed social behavior because roles and stereotypes are both socially shared descriptive norms and prescriptive norms.&lt;ref&gt;Eagly, A. H. (2004). Prejudice: Toward a more inclusive understanding. In A. H. Eagly, R. M. Baron, &amp; V. L.

==Major Theorists==
===Talcott Parsons===
Working in the [[United States]], [[Talcott Parsons]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte-tv.com Franco-German TV Station ARTE], Karambolage, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; developed a model of the [[nuclear family]] in 1955, which at that place and time was the prevalent family structure.{{According to whom|date=June 2016}} It compared a strictly traditional view of gender roles (from an industrial-age American perspective) with a more liberal view. The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles.

{{context inline|date=December 2018}} Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution of gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus: Enzyklopädie der Psychologie, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (The examples are based on the context of the culture and [[infrastructure]] of the United States.)

| '''[[Education]]'''
| Gender-specific education; high professional qualification is important only for the man
| Co-educative schools, same content of classes for girls and boys, same qualification for men and women.
|-
| '''[[Profession]]'''
| The workplace is not the primary area of women; career and professional advancement is deemed unimportant for women
| For women, career is just as important as for men; equal professional opportunities for men and women are necessary.

| '''Housework'''
| Housekeeping and child care are the primary functions of the woman; participation of the man in these functions is only partially wanted.
| All housework is done by both parties to the marriage in equal shares.
|-
| '''[[Decision making]]'''
| In case of conflict, man has the last say, for example in choosing the place to live, choice of school for children, buying decisions

| Man and woman share these functions equally.

However, these structured positions become less a liberal-individualist society, {{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and the actual behavior of individuals is usually somewhere between these poles. According to the interactionist approach, roles (including gender roles) are not fixed but are constantly negotiated between individuals. In North America and southern South America, this is the most common approach among families whose business is [[agriculture]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Gender roles can influence all kinds of behaviors, such as choice of clothing, choice of work and personal relationships, e.g., parental status (See also [[Sociology of fatherhood]]).{{According to whom|date=June 2016}}

===Geert Hofstede===
[[File:Landsdowne Herakles.jpg|thumb|upright|In Greek mythology, [[Heracles]] is synonymous with [[Apollonian]] masculinity.]]
[[Geert Hofstede]], a Dutch researcher and social psychologist who dedicated himself to the study of culture, sees culture as "broad patterns of thinking, feeling and acting" in a society&lt;ref&gt;Hoststede, Geert. 1998. Masculinity and Femininity: The Taboo Dimension of National Cultures. page 5&lt;/ref&gt; In Hofstede's view, masculinity and femininity differ in the social roles that are associated with the biological fact of the existence of the two sexes: masculinity and femininity refer to the dominant sex role pattern in the vast majority of both traditional and modern societies, males being more assertive and females more nurturing.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (1980). Culture’s consequences: international differences in work-related values. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Femininity creates a society of overlapping gender roles, where "both men and women are supposed to be modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life."&lt;ref name="Hof 2001"&gt;Hofstede (2001), Culture’s Consequences, 2nd ed. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masculinity creates a society of clearly distinct gender roles, where men should "be assertive, tough, and focused on material success," while women should "be more modest, tender, and concerned with the quality of life."&lt;ref name="Hof 2001" /&gt;

Hofstede's ''Feminine and Masculine Culture Dimensions'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Masculine cultures expect men to be assertive, ambitious and competitive, to strive for material success, and to respect whatever is big, strong, and fast. Masculine cultures expect women to serve and care for the non-material quality of life, for children and for the weak. Feminine cultures, on the other hand, define relatively overlapping social roles for the sexes, in which, in particular, men need not be ambitious or competitive but may go for a different quality of life than material success; men may respect whatever is small, weak, and slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofstede | first1 = G | year = 1986 | title = Cultural differences in teaching and learning | url = | journal = International Journal of Intercultural Relations | volume = 10 | issue = 3| page = 308 | doi=10.1016/0147-1767(86)90015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In feminine cultures, modesty and relationships are important characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofstede|first=Geert|year=2002|title=Consensus Societies with Their Own Character: National Cultures in Japan and the Netherlands.|url=|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=1|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from in masculine cultures, where self-enhancement leads to self-esteem. Masculine cultures are individualistic, and feminine cultures are more collective because of the significance of personal relationships.

'The dominant values in a masculine society are achievement and success; the dominant values in a feminine society are caring for others and quality of life'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofstede|first1=Geert|last2=de Mooij|first2=Marickc|title=The Hofstede model Applications to global branding and advertising strategy and research|journal=International Journal of Advertising|date=2010|volume=29|issue=1|page=89|doi=10.2501/S026504870920104X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Ellis===
In the 1940s, [[Albert Ellis]] studied eighty-four cases of mixed births and concluded that 'while the power of the human sex drive may possibly be largely dependent on physiological factors... the direction of this drive does not seem to be directly dependent on constitutional element'.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000" /&gt; In the development of masculinity, femininity, and inclinations towards homosexuality or heterosexuality, nurture matters a great deal more than nature.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000"&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne (2000).

===John Money===
"In the 1950s, [[John Money]], along with colleagues took up the study of [[intersex]] individuals, who, Money realized 'would provide invaluable material for the comparative study for bodily form and physiology, rearing, and [[psychosexual]] orientation'."&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling-2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fausto-Sterling |first=Anne |authorlink=Anne Fausto-Sterling |title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-976qhsz7A4C&amp;pg=PA46 |date=4 August 2008 |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7867-2433-8 |page=46 |oclc=818855499 |orig-year=1st pub. 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Money and his colleagues used their own studies to state in the extreme what these days seems extraordinary for its complete denial of the notion of natural inclination."&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling-2008" /&gt;

They concluded that [[gonads]], [[hormones]], and [[chromosomes]] did not automatically determine a child's gender role.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000" /&gt; Among the many terms he coined was ''gender role'' which he defined in a seminal 1955 paper as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman."&lt;ref name="Basic-Concepts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |journal=Bull.

In recent years, the majority of Money's theories regarding the importance of socialization in the determination of gender have come under intense criticism, especially in connection with the false reporting of success in the "John/Joan" case, later revealed to be [[David Reimer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colapinto|first=J.|title=The True Story of John/Joan|work=The Rolling Stone|date=11 December 1997|pages=54–97|url=https://www.healthyplace.com/gender/inside-intersexuality/the-true-story-of-john-joan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colapinto, J.

=== Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman ===
West and Zimmerman developed an interactionist perspective on gender beyond its construction as "roles." For them, gender is "the product of social doings of some sort...undertaken by men and women whose competence as members of society is hostage to its production".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Candace|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Don H.|date=June 1987|title=Doing Gender|journal=Gender and Society|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|volume=1|issue=2|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the use of "role" to describe gender expectations conceals the production of gender through everyday activities. Furthermore, roles are situated identities, such as "nurse" and "student," developed as the situation demands while gender is a master identity with no specific site or organizational context. For them, "conceptualizing gender as a role makes it difficult to assess its influence on other roles and reduces its explanatory usefulness in discussions of power and inequality".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; West and Zimmerman consider gender an individual production that reflects and constructs interactional and institutional gender expectations.

Because of the influence of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s feminist works and [[Michel Foucault]]'s reflections on sexuality (among others), the idea that [[gender]] was unrelated to sex gained ground during the 1980s, especially in sociology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/ Simone de Beauvoir]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; This view asserts that the relationship between gender and sex (presence of genitals/gonads) is not causally determinate. That is, that one may have the genitals of one sex while having the gender of another.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Robert William: Gender and Power, Cambridge: University Press 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

There continues to be debate on the subject. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], a Cambridge University professor of psychology and psychiatry claims 'the female brain is predominantly "hard-wired" for empathy, while the male brain is predominantly "hard-wired" for understanding and building systems'.&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S (2003) The Essential Difference: men, women and the extreme male brain.

Several studies have been conducted looking at the gender roles of [[intersex]] children.

In a third study, 14 male children born with [[cloacal exstrophy]] and assigned female at birth, including through [[intersex medical interventions]].

[[Sandra Bem|Dr. Sandra Lipsitz Bem]] is a psychologist who developed the [[gender schema theory]], based on the combination of aspects of the [[social cognitive theory|social learning theory]] and the [[theory of cognitive development|cognitive-development theory]] of sex role acquisition, to explain how individuals come to use gender as an organizing category in all aspects of their life. In 1971, she created the [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] to measure how well an individual conformed to a traditional gender role, characterizing those tested as having masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated personality. She believed that through gender-schematic processing, a person spontaneously sorts attributes and behaviors into masculine and feminine categories, and that therefore individuals processes information and regulate their behavior based on whatever definitions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]] their culture provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bem |first=Sandra L. |title=Gender schema theory: A cognitive account of sex typing |journal=Psychological Review|date=July 1981|volume=88|issue=4|pages=354–364|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.88.4.354 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are differences in average capabilities of various kinds (E.g. better average balance in females or greater average physical size and endurance in males) between the sexes{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} the capabilities of some members of one sex will fall within the range of capabilities needed for tasks conventionally assigned to the other sex.

Research at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center has also shown that gender roles may be biological among primates.

Ideas of appropriate behavior according to gender vary among cultures and era, although some aspects receive more widespread attention than others. [[R.W. Connell]] in ''Men, Masculinities and Feminism''&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Raewyn, Ph.D. "Men, Masculinities and Feminism." Social Alternatives July 1997: 7-10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; claims:

There are huge areal differences in attitudes towards appropriate gender roles. In the ''[[World Values Survey]]'', responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted to only men in the case of shortage in jobs: in Iceland the proportion that agreed with the proposition was 3.6%; while in Egypt it was 94.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fortin | first1 = Nicole | year = 2005 | title = Gender Role Attitudes and the Labour Market Outcomes of Women Across OECD Countries | url = | journal = Oxford Review of Economic Policy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 416–438 | doi=10.1093/oxrep/gri024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attitudes have also varied historically, for example, in Europe, during the Middle Ages, women were commonly associated with roles related to medicine and healing.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Witches, Midwives and Nurses: A History of Women Healers|year=2010|publisher=The Feminist Press|isbn=0-912670-13-4|pages=44–87|edition=2nd|author2=Deirdre English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the rise of [[witch-hunt]]s across Europe and the institutionalization of medicine, these roles became exclusively associated with men&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich" /&gt; but in the last few decades these roles have become largely gender-neutral in Western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boulis|first=Ann K.|title=The changing face of medicine: women doctors and the evolution of health care in America|year=2010|publisher=ILR|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-7662-3|author2=Jacobs, Jerry A.|quote=Encouraging one's daughter to pursue a career in medicine is no longer an unusual idea… Americans are now more likely to report that they feel comfortable recommending a career in medicine for a young woman than for a young man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vern Bullough]] stated that homosexual communities are generally more tolerant of switching gender roles.&lt;ref name="Bullough"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bullough |first=Vern L.|title=Crossdressing, Sex, and Gender|year=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press. 1993 |isbn=978-0-8122-1431-4|page=390|edition=1st|author2=Bonnie Bullough}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, someone with a masculine voice, a five o'clock shadow (or a fuller beard), an [[Adam's apple]], wearing a woman's dress and high heels, carrying a purse would most likely draw ridicule or other unfriendly attention in ordinary social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, Routledge, New York, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam, Judith, Female Masculinity, Duke University Press, Durham and London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Julia, Straub, Kristina; Eds, Body Guards: The Cultural Politics of Gender Ambiguity, Routledge, London, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the dominant class sees this form of gender expression as unacceptable, inappropriate, or perhaps threatening, these individuals are significantly more likely to experience discrimination and harassment both in their personal lives and from their employer, according to a 2011 report from the [[Center for American Progress]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/2011/06/pdf/workplace_discrimination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender roles may be a means through which one expresses their [[gender identity]], but they may also be employed as a means of exerting [[social control]], and individuals may experience negative social consequences for violating them.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J.R. (1992). "Group influences on individuals in organizations". In M.D. Dunnette &amp; L.M. Hough (Eds.), Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology (Vol. 3).

===Religion===
{{main|Gender and religion}}

Different religious and cultural groups within one country may have different norms that they attempt to "police" within their own group, including gender norms.

====Christianity====

{{main|Gender roles in Christianity}}
{{see also|Christian views on marriage}}

''I Corinthians,'' 11:14 and 15 indicates that it is inappropriate for a man to wear his hair long, and good for a woman to wear her hair long.

The roles of women in Christianity can vary considerably today as they have varied historically since the first century New Testament church. This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and [[parachurch organizations]].

Many leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the [[Sex, gender and the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], and [[bishop]]. Women may serve as [[abbess]]es. Most mainstream [[Protestants|Protestant]] denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.

Christian traditions that officially recognize "[[saint]]s", as persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the [[beatific vision]] ([[heaven]]), do list women in that group. Most prominent is [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]] who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the "[[Theotokos]]", i.e. "Mother of God", the son born of her, Jesus, being God Incarnate, that is, both God and Man. 
Women prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, [[doctors of the church]], founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. [[Paul the Apostle and women|Paul the Apostle]] held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the [[New Testament household codes]], also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or ''Haustafelen'', of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman law]] in the first century.

====Islam====
{{see also|Marriage in Islam}}

In the [[United Arab Emirates]], non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more [[modesty|modestly]], due to the injunction on women in Islam to dress modestly at all times when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.

In some Muslim-majority countries, however, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. This norm may sometimes be objected to by women visiting from other countries - but they may nevertheless decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interests of their own safety. For example, in Egypt, women who do not dress "[[modesty|modestly]]" - whether they are Muslims or not - may be perceived to be akin to prostitutes by men.

[[Muhammad]] described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith Collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father'"&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Muslim culture, women are seen as having a similar status to men, however, men are seen as a degree above women according to the qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quran.com/2/228?translations=22,101,18,17,84,19,21,85,95,20|title=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|website=Surah Al-Baqarah [2:228]|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; How gender roles are honored is largely cultural. While some cultures encourage men and women to take on the same roles, others promote a more traditional, less dominant role for the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Connections .

====Hinduism====
{{main|God and gender in Hinduism}}
Hindu deities are more ambiguously gendered than deities of other world religions, such as Christianity, Islam, and others. This informs female and males relations, and informs how the differences between males and females are understood&lt;ref&gt;Gopal, Madan (1990). K.S. Gautam, ed. India through the ages. Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:God marriage AS.jpg|thumb|upright|Image of [[Ardhanarishvara]]]] However, in a religious cosmology like [[Hinduism]], which prominently features female and androgynous deities, some gender transgression is allowed. This group is known as the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]], and has a long tradition of performing in important rituals, such as the birth of sons and weddings. Despite this allowance for transgression, Hindu cultural traditions portray women in contradictory ways. On one hand, women's fertility is given great value, and on the other, female sexuality is depicted as potentially dangerous and destructive.&lt;ref name="Peletz"&gt;Peletz, Michael Gates.

===Studies on marriage in the U.S.===
{{see also|Marriage}}

Marriage is an institution that influences gender roles, inequality, and change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = C | year = 2012 | title = Introduction: Marriage, gender relations and social change | url = | journal = Journal of Development Studies | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 1–9 | doi=10.1080/00220388.2011.629653}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, gender roles are communicated by the media, social interaction, and language. Through these platforms society has influenced individuals to fulfill the stereotypical gender roles within a heterosexual marriage starting out at a young age. Although traditionally, society claims that roles within a heterosexual marriage should be decided based on one's biological sex, today individuals are determining their own roles for themselves, ultimately creating equal partnerships.

====Communication of Gender Roles in the United States====
In the U.S., marriage roles are generally decided based on gender. For approximately the past seven decades, heterosexual marriage roles have been defined for men and women based on society's expectations and [[Media and gender|the influence of the media]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gauntlett, D. (2008). ''Media, gender and identity: An introduction''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women are typically associated with certain social roles dependent upon the personality traits associated with those roles.&lt;ref name="Gerber, G. L. 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerber | first1 = G. L. | year = 1988 | title = Leadership roles and the gender stereotype traits | doi = 10.1007/BF00288051 | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 18 | issue = 11–12| pages = 649–668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the role of the homemaker is associated with a woman and the role of a breadwinner is associated with a male. Typically, women are concerned with caring for the family and the home while men are typically providing for the family. This ultimately portrays the man as a leader and the woman as the follower.&lt;ref name="Gerber, G. L. 1988"/&gt;

In the U.S., single men are outnumbered by single women at a ratio of 100 single women to 86 single men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pritchard|first=Justin|title=Men hold the edge on gender gap odds|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6970963.html|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though never-married men over the age of 15 outnumber women by a 5:4 ratio (33.9% to 27.3%) according to the 2006 U.S. Census American Community Survey. The results are varied between age groups, with 118 single men per 100 single women in their 20s, versus 33 single men to 100 single women over 65.&lt;ref&gt;Facts for features: Valentine's Day U.S. Census Bureau Report 7 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers also vary between countries. For example, China has many more young men than young women, and this disparity is expected to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCurry|first=Justin|title=40m bachelors and no women ... the birth of a new problem for China|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/09/china.justinmccurry|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 March 2004|author2=Allison, Rebecca|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions with recent conflict such as Chechnya, women greatly outnumber men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Polygamy proposal for Chechen men|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4610396.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=13 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-cultural study by [[David Buss]], men and women were asked to rank the importance of certain traits in a long term partner. Both men and women ranked "kindness" and "intelligence" as the two most important factors. Men valued beauty and youth more highly than women, while women valued financial and social status more highly than men.

====Media====
In today's society, media saturates nearly every aspect of one's life. It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to their biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Traditional gendered roles view the man as a “pro-creator, a protector, and a provider,” and the woman as “pretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.” &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage and Families: Changes, Choices, and Constrains|last=Benokraits|first=Nijole|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2002|isbn=978-0-13-034177-8|location=New Jersey|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views. People learn through imitation and social-interaction both in the physical world and through the media; television, magazines, advertisements, newspapers, the Internet, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Michael Messner]] argues that "gendered interactions, structure, and cultural meanings are intertwined, in both mutually reinforcing and contradictory ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Messner | first = Michael A. | author-link = Michael Messner | title = Barbie girls vs. sea monsters: children constructing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 765&amp;ndash;784 | doi = 10.1177/089124300014006004 | date = December 2000 | ref = harv |url=http://www.michaelmessner.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/barbiegirls.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television's influence on society, specifically the influence of television advertisements, is shown in studies such as that of Jörg Matthes, Michael Prieler, and Karoline Adam. Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings. This underrepresentation in television advertising is seen in many countries around the world but is very present in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthes|first1=Jörg|last2=Prieler|first2=Michael|last3=Adam|first3=Karoline|date=October 2016|title=Gender-Role Portrayals in Television Advertising Across the Globe.|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=118091293&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Sex Roles|volume=75|issue=7–8|pages=314–327|doi=10.1007/s11199-016-0617-y|pmid=27688526|pmc=5023740}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study in the ''[[Journal of Social Psychology]],'' many television advertisements in countries around the world are seen targeting women at different times of the day than men. Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubie-Davies|first1=Christine M.|last2=Liu|first2=Sabrina|last3=Lee|first3=Kai-Chi Katie|date=March 2013|title=Watching Each Other: Portrayals of Gender and Ethnicity in Television Advertisements|url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=85285381&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|volume=153|issue=2|pages=179–180|doi=10.1080/00224545.2012.717974|pmid=23484346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been presented in the journal article by [[Emerald Group Publishing Limited]] that adolescent girls have been effected by the stereotypical view of [[Media and gender|women in media]]. Girls feel pressurised and stressed to achieve a particular appearance and there have been highly worrying consequences for the young girls if they fail to achieve this look. These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. Young girls in an experiment of this journal article describe pictures on women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake. They are dressed in little and revealing clothing which sexualised the women and expose their thin figures, that are gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.

It has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children's preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aubrey |first1=Jennifer Stevens |last2=Harrison |first2=Kristen |title=The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions. |journal=Media Psychology |date=May 2004 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=141–142 |url=http://echo.louisville.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=13247295&amp;site=ehost-live |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;In another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited, the underrepresentation of women in children's television shows between 1930 and 1960 is examined. While studies between 1960 and 1990 show an increase in the representation of women in television, studies conducted between 1990 and 2005, a time when women were considered to be equal to men by some, show no change in the representation of women in children's television shows. Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steyer|first1=Isabella|date=2014|title=Gender representations in children's media and their influence|journal=Campus-Wide Information Systems|volume=31|issue=2/3|pages=171–180|doi=10.1108/CWIS-11-2013-0065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social Interaction====
Gendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by their parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, L. L. (2015). ''Gender roles: A sociological perspective''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Changing gender roles in marriage====
Over the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Gender roles can be defined as the behaviors, values, and attitudes that a society considers appropriate for both male and female.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Motivated by the women's rights movement and various other movements gender roles have begun to change, resulting in the changing economic landscape, women entering the workplace and many more. Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; However, in today's society the division of roles are starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriage in order to share responsibilities. This revolutionary view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society it is more likely that a man and woman are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Despite the fact that there is still a gap between gender roles, today, roles are less gendered and more equal in comparison to how they were traditionally.

Societies can change such that the gender roles rapidly change. The 21st century has seen a shift in gender roles due to multiple factors such as new family structures, education, media, and several others. A 2003 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that about 1/3 of wives earn more than their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/business/27instincts.html | work=The New York Times | first=M.P. | last=Dunleavey | title=A Breadwinner Rethinks Gender Roles | date=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the importance of education emphasized nationwide, and the access of college degrees (online, for example), women have begun furthering their education. Women have also started to get more involved in recreation activities such as sports, which in the past were regarded to be for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=7 November 2012|title=Women and the Wild: Gender Socialization in Wilderness Recreation Advertising|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12147-012-9111-1|journal=SpringerLink|volume=29|pages=39–55|via=|doi=10.1007/s12147-012-9111-1 | last1 = McNiel | first1 = Jamie N. | last2 = Harris | first2 = Deborah A. | last3 = Fondren | first3 = Kristi M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family structures are changing, and the number of single-mother or single-father households is increasing. Fathers are also becoming more involved with raising their children, instead of the responsibility resting solely with the mother.

According to the Pew Research Center, the number of stay-at-home fathers in the US nearly doubled in the period from 1989 to 2012, from 1.1 million to 2.0 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/06/05/growing-number-of-dads-home-with-the-kids/|title=Growing Number of Stay-at-Home Dads - Pew Research Center|date=5 June 2014|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend appears to be mirrored in a number of countries including the UK, Canada and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/9822271/Rise-in-stay-at-home-fathers-fuelled-by-growing-numbers-of-female-breadwinners.html|title=Rise in stay-at-home fathers fuelled by growing numbers of female breadwinners|author1=Louisa Peacock |author2=Sam Marsden |date=23 January 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/stay-at-home-dads-on-the-rise-increasingly-because-they-want-to-be/article19014624/|title=Stay-at-home dads on the rise – increasingly because they want to be|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=14 June 2015|location=Toronto|date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/sweden-sees-boom-in-stay-at-home-dads/|title=Sweden sees boom in stay-at-home dads|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pew also found that, at least in the US, public opinion in general appears to show a substantial bias toward favoring a mother as a care-taker versus a father, regardless of any shift in actual roles each plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/|title=Breadwinner Moms|date=29 May 2013|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gender equality]] allows gender roles to become less distinct and according to Donnalyn Pompper, is the reason "men no longer own breadwinning identities and, like women, their bodies are objectified in mass media images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pompper | first1 = Donnalyn | year = 2010 | title = Masculinities, The Metrosexual, And Media Images: Across Dimensions Of Age And Ethnicity | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 63 | issue = 9/10| pages = 682–696 | doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LGBT rights movement]] has played a role increasing pro-gay attitudes, which according to Brian McNair, are expressed by many metrosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Brian.

According to Professor [[Lei Chang]], gender attitudes within the domains of work and domestic roles, can be measured using a cross-cultural gender role attitudes test. Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or ''instruments'') that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:
* Attitudes Towards Women Scale,
* Sex-Role Egalitarian Scale, and
* Sex-Role Ideology Scale.
Through such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Lei | year = 1999 | title = Gender Role Egalitarian Attitudes in Beijing, Hong Kong, Florida, and Michigan | url = | journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 722–41 | doi=10.1177/0022022199030006004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although existing studies have generally focused on gender views or attitudes that are work-related, there has so far not been a study on specific domestic roles. Supporting Hofstede's 1980 findings, that "high masculinity cultures are associated with low percentages of women holding professional and technical employment", test values for work-related egalitarianism were lower for Chinese than for Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=July 2016}} This is supported by the proportion of women that held professional jobs in China (far less than that of America), the data clearly indicating the limitations on opportunities open to women in contemporary Eastern society. In contrast, there was no difference between the viewpoint of Chinese and Americans regarding domestic gender roles.

A study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions.&lt;ref name="Bag"/&gt; The United States was considered a more 'independence-based culture', while China was considered ''''''inter'''''dependence-based'. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that "gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the [[socialization]] in work experiment, proving that "women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means".&lt;ref name="Bag"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bagozzi | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Wong | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Yi | first3 = Youjae | year = 1999 | title = The Role of Culture and Gender in the Relationship between Positive and Negative Affect | url = | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 641–72 | doi=10.1080/026999399379023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups — for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.

==Communication==
{{See also|Language and gender|Gender differences in social network service use|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}
Gender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.

Communication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication, A Critical Introduction|publisher = SAGE Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = |pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancisco, Victoria L., Catherine Helen Palczewski, and Danielle Dick McGeough. ''Gender in communication a critical introduction''. Los Angeles: Sage, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, females are often more expressive and intuitive in their communication, but males tend to be instrumental and competitive. In addition, there are differences in accepted communication behaviors for males and females. To improve communication between genders, people who identify as either male or female must understand the differences between each gender.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Differences in Communication." Intercultural Communication: A Global Reader. Ed. Fred E. Jandt. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004. 221–29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As found by Cara Tigue (McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada) [http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(11)00102-4/abstract the importance of powerful vocal delivery for women] could not be underestimated, as famously described in accounts of [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2011/nov/15/woman-lower-tone-voice-successful Margaret Thatcher's years in power].)

===Nonverbal communication===
Hall published an observational study on nonverbal gender differences and discussed the cultural reasons for these differences.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, J. A. (1990). Nonverbal sex differences: Accuracy of communication and expressive style. Baltimore, MD, US: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In her study, she noted women smile and laugh more and have a better understanding of nonverbal cues. She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.

Men, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, A. H. (2000). Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

McQuiston and Morris also noted a major difference in men and women's nonverbal communication. They found that men tend to show body language linked to dominance, like eye contact and interpersonal distance, more than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McQuiston | first1 = D. | last2 = Morris | first2 = K. A. | year = 2009 | title = Gender differences in communication: Implications for salespeople | url = | journal = Journal of Selling &amp; Major Account Management | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 54–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication and gender cultures===
[[File:Personality and gender word cloud for social media.png|thumb|upright|Words, phrases, and topics most highly distinguishing English-speaking females and males in social media in 2013]]
According to [[Julia Wood]], there are distinct communication 'cultures' for women and men in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J (2010) Gendered lives: Communication, gender and culture. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Wood believes that in addition to female and male communication cultures, there are also specific communication cultures for African Americans, older people, Indian Native Americans, gay men, lesbians, and people with disabilities. According to Wood, it is generally thought that biological sex is behind the distinct ways of communicating, but in reality the root is "gender".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J (2010) Gendered lives: Communication, gender and culture. Cengage Learning. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltz and Broker's research suggested that the games children play may contribute to socializing children into [[Masculinity|masculine]] and [[Femininity|feminine]] gender roles:&lt;ref name="maltz"&gt;Maltz, D., &amp; Borker, R. (1982). A cultural approach to male-female miscommunication. In J. Gumperz (Ed.), Language and social identity (pp. 196–216). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, girls being encouraged to play "house" may promotes stereotypically feminine traits, and may promote interpersonal relationships as playing house does not necessarily have fixed rules or objectives; boys tended to play more competitive and adversarial team sports with structured, predetermined goals and a range of confined strategies.

===Communication and sexual desire===
Mets, et al.&lt;ref name="metts"&gt;Metts, S., Sprecher, S., &amp; Regan, P. C. (1998). Communication and sexual desire. In P. A. Andersen &amp; L. K. Guerrero (Eds.) Handbook of communication and emotion. (pp. 354–377). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; explain that [[Libido|sexual desire]] is linked to emotions and communicative expression. Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and 'complicated emotional states', and is also the 'mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] and emotional meanings'.

Gender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express their sexual interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R | last2 = Catanese | first2 = K | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K | year = 2001 | title = Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive? Theoretical views, conceptual distinctions, and a review of relevant evidence | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 242–273 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0503_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This may be greatly affected by masculine people being less inhibited by [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] for expressing their desire, being more aware of their sexual desire or succumbing to the expectation of their gender culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seal | first1 = D | last2 = Ehrhardt | first2 = A | year = 2003 | title = Masculinity and urban men: Perceived scripts for courtship, romantic, and sexual interactions with women | url = | journal = Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality: an International Journal for Research, Intervention and Care | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 295–319 | doi=10.1080/136910501171698}}&lt;/ref&gt; When feminine people employ tactics to show their sexual desire, they are typically more indirect in nature. On the other hand, it is known masculinity is associated with aggressive behavior in all mammals, and most likely explains at least part of the fact that masculine people are more likely to express their sexual interest. This is known as the [[Challenge hypothesis]].

Various studies show different communication strategies with a feminine person refusing a masculine person's sexual interest. Some research, like that of Murnen,&lt;ref name="murnen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perot |first1= |last2=Byrne Murnen |first2=SK |last3=Perot |first3=A |last4=Byrne |first4=D |year=1989 |title = Coping with unwanted sexual activity: Normative responses, situational determinants, and individual differences |doi=10.1080/00224498909551493 |journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 85–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that when feminine people offer refusals, the refusals are verbal and typically direct. When masculine people do not comply with this refusal, feminine people offer stronger and more direct refusals. However, research from Perper and Weis&lt;ref name="perper"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perper | first1 = T. | last2 = Weis | first2 = D. L. | year = 1987 | title = Proceptive and rejective strategies of U.S. and Canadian college women | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 455–480 | doi=10.1080/00224498709551385}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that rejection includes acts of avoidance, creating distractions, making excuses, departure, hinting, arguments to delay, etc. These differences in refusal communication techniques are just one example of the importance of communicative competence for both masculine and feminine gender cultures.

==Gender stereotypes==
{{See also|Sexism#Gender stereotypes|Implicit stereotype#Gender stereotypes|Stereotypes}}
[[File:Glaspalast München 1883 064.jpg|thumb|An 1883 German illustration of children playing house]]
A 1992 study tested gender stereotypes and labeling within young children.&lt;ref name="fagot"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fagot | first1 = Beverly I. | last2 = Leinbach | first2 = Mary D. | last3 = O'Boyle | first3 = Cherie | title = Gender labeling, gender stereotyping, and parenting behaviors | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–230 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.225 | date = March 1992 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fagot ''et al.'' divided this into two different studies, the first investigated how children identified the differences between gender labels of boys and girls, the second study looked at both gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child.

Within the first study, 23 children between the ages of 2 and 7 underwent a series of gender labelling and gender stereotyping tests consisting of showing the children either pictures of males and females or objects such as a hammer or a broom then identifying or labeling those to a certain gender. The results of these tests showed that children under 3 years could make gender-stereotypic associations.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

The second study looked at gender labelling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender specific toys.

The third was a series of questionnaires such as an "Attitude Toward Women Scale", "[[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]]", and "Schaefer and Edgerton Scale" which looked at the family values of the mother.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

The results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labelling and stereotyping.

They also identified in the second method that the mothers positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the “Gender Labeling Test”, had more traditional family values. These two studies, conducted by Beverly I. Fagot, Mar D. Leinbach and Cherie O'Boyle, showed that gender stereotyping and labeling is acquired at a very young age, and that social interactions and associations play a large role in how genders are identified.&lt;ref name="fagot" /&gt;

[[Virginia Woolf]], in the 1920s, made the point: 'It is obvious that the values of women differ very often from the values which have been made by the other sex. Yet it is the masculine values that prevail'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Woolf | first = Virginia | author-link = Virginia Woolf | title = A room of one's own | publisher = Hogarth Press | location = New York | year = 1929 | page = 76 | oclc = 31499943| title-link = A Room of One's Own }}&lt;/ref&gt; remade sixty years later by psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] who used it to show that psychological tests of maturity have generally been based on masculine parameters, and so tended to show that women were less 'mature'. Gilligan countered this in her ground-breaking work, ''[[In a Different Voice]]'', holding that maturity in women is shown in terms of different, but equally important, human values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilligan |first = Carol | author-link = Carol Gilligan | title = In a different voice |publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780674445444|title-link = In a Different Voice }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender stereotypes are extremely common in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Brewer | first = Holly | title = List of gender stereotypes | url = http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/15910/1/List-of-Gender-Stereotypes.html | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gender and gender identity at a glance | url = http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender/gender-gender-identity-26530.htm | website = plannedparenthood.org | publisher = Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons this may be is simply because it is easier on the brain to stereotype (see [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|Heuristics]]).

The brain has limited perceptual and memory systems, so it categorizes information into fewer and simpler units which allows for more efficient information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Carol Lynn | last2 = Halverson Jr. | first2 = Charles F. | title = A schematic processing model of sex typing and stereotyping in children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 1119–1134 | doi = 10.2307/1129498 | jstor = 1129498 | date = December 1981 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender stereotypes appear to have an effect at an early age. In one study, the effects of gender stereotypes on children's mathematical abilities were tested. In this study of American children between the ages of six and ten, it was found that the children, as early as the second grade, demonstrated the gender stereotype that mathematics is a 'boy's subject'. This may show that the mathematical self-belief is influenced before the age in which there are discernible differences in mathematical achievement.&lt;ref name="Cvencek"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cvencek | first1 = Dario | last2 = Meltzoff | first2 = Andrew N. | last3 = Greenwald | first3 = Anthony G. | title = Math–gender stereotypes in elementary school children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 766–779 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01529.x | pmid = 21410915 | date = May–June 2011 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.300.2757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1972 study by Jean Lipman-Blumen, women who grew up following traditional gender roles from childhood were less likely to want to be highly educated while women brought up with the view that men and women are equal were more likely to want higher education. This result indicates that gender roles that have been passed down traditionally can influence stereotypes about gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lipman-Blumen | first = Jean | title = How ideology shapes women's lives | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 226 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–42 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0172-34 | date = January 1972 | ref = harv | bibcode = 1972SciAm.226a..34L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=9 July 2015 |first = Leigh|last = Goodmark|first2 = Juanita|last2 = Flores|first3 = Julie|last3 = Goldscheid|first4 = Andrea |last4 = Ritchie |last5=SpearIt |title=Plenary 2—Redefining Gender Violence |url=https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;context=umrsjlr |journal=University of Miami Race &amp; Social Justice Law Review |volume=5 |page=289 |ssrn=2628984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later study, Deaux and her colleagues (1984) found that most people think women are ''more'' ''nurturant'', but ''less self-assertive'' than men. and that this belief is indicated universally, but that this awareness is related to women's ''role''. To put it another way, women do not have an ''inherently'' nurturant personality, rather that a nurturing personality is acquired by whoever happens to be doing the housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Deaux | first1 = Kay | last2 = Lewis | first2 = Laurie L. | title = Structure of gender stereotypes: interrelationships among components and gender label | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 991–1004 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.46.5.991 | date = May 1984 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of gender stereotypes by Jacobs (1991) it was found that parents' stereotypes interact with the sex of their child to directly influence the parents' beliefs about the child's abilities. In turn, parents' beliefs about their child directly influence their child's self-perceptions, and both the parents' stereotypes and the child's self-perceptions influence the child's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jacobs | first = Janis E. | title = Influence of gender stereotypes on parent and child mathematics attitudes | journal = [[Journal of Educational Psychology]] | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 518–527 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0663.83.4.518 | date = December 1991 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stereotype threat]] is being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = Claude M. | last2 = Aronson | first2 = Joshua | author-link1 = Claude Steele | title = Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 797–811 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797 | pmid = 7473032 | date = November 1995 | ref = harv }} [http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&amp;_Aronson_95.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of gender it is the implicit belief in gender stereotype that women perform worse than men in mathematics, which is proposed to lead to lower performance by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spencer | first1 = Steven J. | last2 = Steele | first2 = Claude M. | last3 = Quinn | first3 = Diane M. | author-link2 = Claude Steele | title = Stereotype threat and women's math performance | journal = [[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–28 | doi = 10.1006/jesp.1998.1373 | date = January 1999 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.370.3979 }} [http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/carnegie/learning_resources/LAW_PGCHE/SteeleandQuinnStereotypeThreat.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108184501/http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/carnegie/learning_resources/LAW_PGCHE/SteeleandQuinnStereotypeThreat.pdf |date=8 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review article of stereotype threat research (2012) relating to the relationship between gender and mathematical abilities concluded "that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this [as a] mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gijsbert | last2 = Geary | first2 = David C. | title = Can stereotype threat explain the gender gap in mathematics performance and achievement? | journal = [[Review of General Psychology]] | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–102 | doi = 10.1037/a0026617 | date = March 2012 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Jolien A. van Breen and colleagues conducted research into [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] gender stereotyping. Researchers took participants through a fictional Moral Choice Dilemma Task, which consisted of eight scenarios "in which sacrificing one person can save several others of unspecified gender... In four scenarios, participants are asked to sacrifice a man to save several others (of unspecified gender), and in four other scenarios they are asked to sacrifice a woman." The results showed that women who identified as feminists were more willing to 'sacrifice' men than women who did not identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jolien A. | first1 = van Breen | last2 = Spears | first2 = Russell | last3 = Kuppens | first3 = Toon | last4 = de Lemus | first4 = Soledad | title = Subliminal gender stereotypes: who can resist? | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 44 | issue = 12 | pages = 1648–1663 | doi = 10.1177/0146167218771895 | pmid = 29781373 | date = May 2018 | ref = harv }} [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/ref&gt; "If a person wanted to counteract that and ‘level the playing field’, that can be done either by boosting women or by downgrading men”, said van Breen. “So I think that this effect on evaluations of men arises because our participants are trying to achieve an underlying aim: counteracting gender stereotypes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Airaksinen | first = Toni | title = STUDY: Feminists more willing to ‘sacrifice’ men | url = https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=10984 | work = [[Campus Reform]] | publisher = [[Leadership Institute]] | date = 5 June 2018 | access-date = 11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender stereotypes and issues in the workplace ===
[[Gender stereotypes]] are frequently brought up{{by who|date=December 2018}}{{clarify|date=December 2018}} as one disadvantage to women during the hiring process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorman|first1=Elizabeth H.|title=Gender Stereotypes, Same-Gender Preferences, and Organizational Variation in the Hiring of Women: Evidence from Law Firms|journal=American Sociological Review|date=August 2005|volume=70|issue=4|doi=10.1177/000312240507000408|pages=702–728}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as one explanation of the lack of women in key organizational positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=Madeline E.|title=Description and Prescription: How Gender Stereotypes Prevent Women's Ascent Up the Organizational Ladder|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=2001|volume=57|issue=4|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00234|pages=657–674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Management and similar leader positions are often perceived to be "masculine" in type, meaning they are assumed to require aggressiveness, competitiveness, strength and independence. These traits do not line up with the perceived traditional female gender role stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=Madeline E.|last2=Eagly|first2=Alice H.|title=Gender Stereotypes Are Alive, Well, and Busy Producing Workplace Discrimination|journal=Industrial and Organizational Psychology|date=2008|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is often referred to as the "lack of fit" model which describes the dynamics of the gender bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heilman|first=Madeline E.|year=1983|title=Sex Bias in Work Settings: The Lack of Fit Model|url=|journal=Research in Organizational Behavior|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Therefore, the perception that women do not possess these "masculine" qualities, limits their ability to be hired or promoted into managerial positions.

One's performance at work is also evaluated based on one's gender. If a female and a male worker show the same performance, the implications of that performance vary depending on the person's gender and on who observes the performance; if a man performs exceedingly well he is perceived as driven or goal-oriented and generally seen in a positive light while a woman showing a similar performance is often described using adjectives with negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Shelley E.|last2=Fiske|first2=Susan T.|last3=Etcoff|first3=Nancy L.|last4=Ruderman|first4=Audrey J.|title=Categorical and Contextual Bases of Person Memory and Stereotyping|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1978|volume=36|issue=7|pages=778|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.7.778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Female performance is therefore not evaluated neutrally or unbiased and stereotyped in ways to deem their equivalent levels and quality of work as instead of lesser value.

Consequently, that gender stereotype filter leads to a lack of fair evaluation and, in turn, to fewer women occupying higher paying positions.

Activists during [[second-wave feminism]] have also used the term "horizontal oppressions" to describe this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doing Feminist Theory: From Modernity to Postmodernity|last=Mann|first=Susan Archer|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=172|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that women of color in addition to the glass ceiling, face a "concrete wall" or a "sticky floor" to better visualize the barriers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Liberal feminism|Liberal feminist]] theory states that due to these systemic factors of oppression and discrimination, women are often deprived of equal work experiences because they are not provided equal opportunities on the basis of legal rights. Liberal feminists further propose that an end needs to be put to discrimination based on gender through legal means, leading to equality and major economic redistributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Reproduction of Gender Inequality: A Discourse Analysis of Research Texts on Women's Entrepreneurship|last=Ahl|first=Helene|publisher=Copenhagen Business School Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=14|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wendell|first=Susan|year=1987|title=A (Qualified) Defense of Liberal Feminism|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1987.tb01066.x|journal=Hypatia|volume=2|issue=2|pages=65–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and social consequences===
If a woman ''does'' act according to female stereotypes, she is likely to receive backlash for not being competent enough; if she does ''not'' act according to the stereotypes connected to her gender and behaves more [[androgynous]], or even [[Masculinity|masculine]], it is likely to cause backlash through [[third-party punishment]] or further [[job discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudman|first1=Laurie A.|last2=Glick|first2=Peter|title=Prescriptive Gender Stereotypes and Backlash Toward Agentic Women|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=2001|volume=57|issue=4|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00239|pages=743–762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are expected to behave in a way that aligns with female gender stereotypes while these stereotypes are simultaneously used to justify their lack of success in an economic context, putting women in the workforce in a precarious, "double bind" situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Joan C.|title=Reconstructive Feminism: Changing the Way We Talk About Gender and Work Thirty Years After the PDA|journal=21 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism|date=2009|volume=79|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed step to relieve women from this issue is the above-mentioned ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], as it would legally further gender equality and prohibit gender-based discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Tarver|first2=Banks|date=1989|title=Equal Rights Amendment: Governmental Action and Individual Liberty|journal=Tex.

[[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]] identified four types of [[Media and gender|stereotypes given to professional women via the media]]. The four stereotypes are, iron maiden, pet, mother, and [[Seduction|seductress]]/sex object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men and Women of the Corporation|last=Kanter|first=Rosabeth Moss|publisher=Basic Books Inc.|year=1993|isbn=9780465044542|location=New York|pages=233–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron maiden refers to women who are deemed to display too many [[Masculinity|masculine]] traits and not enough feminine traits according to her audience. This leads audiences to question the trustworthiness of an iron maiden, because she is seen as strategically playing the field to appease voters. The pet stereotype is given to women who are identified as helpmates, cheerleaders, or mascots, which then leads the audience to see these women as naive or weak and unable to lead without a man's help. If a professional woman is seen as a mother, she is more likely to be seen as compassionate and caring, but also has the capacity to be shrew, punishing, and scolding. Additionally, it is possible for her leadership abilities to be called into question due to perceived conflicts with her maternal responsibilities. The fourth stereotype, [[Seduction|seductress]], is assigned to women who speak and act rather femininely, or have been victims of [[sexual harassment]]. The media tends to focus on the seductress woman's sex appeal and physical appearance in opposition to her policy stances and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlin|first=Diana B.|date=Fall 2009|title=Have You Come a Long Way, Baby?

A proposed step to relieve women from that [[double bind]] is the above-mentioned ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, as it would further legal gender equality and prohibit gender-based discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarlin|first1=William Wayne|last2=Tarver|first2=Banks|title=Equal Rights Amendment: Governmental Action and Individual Liberty|journal=Tex.

===Implicit gender stereotypes===
{{See also|Implicit stereotype}}
[[File:Bettie Page driving.jpg|thumb|300px|A magazine feature from ''Beauty Parade'' from March 1952 stereotyping women drivers. It features [[Bettie Page]] as the model.]]
Gender stereotypes and roles can also be supported implicitly. [[Implicit stereotypes]] are the unconscious influence of attitudes a person may or may not be aware that they hold. A person is influenced by these attitudes even though they are not aware. Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.

These implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the [[Implicit-association test]] (IAT).

One example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females. It has been found that men have stronger positive associations with mathematics than women, while women have stronger negative associations with mathematics and the more strongly a woman associates herself with the female gender identity, the more negative her association with mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = Brian A. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = Mahzarin R. | last3 = Greenwald | first3 = Anthony G. | title = Math = male, me = female, therefore math ≠ me | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–59 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.83.1.44 | date = July 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.463.6120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These associations have been disputed for their biological connection to gender and have been attributed to social forces that perpetuate stereotypes such as aforementioned stereotype that men are better at mathematics than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYw7ZZzCqNYC&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q=males+better+at+math|title=Myths Of Gender: Biological Theories About Women And Men, Revised Edition|first=Anne|last=Fausto-Sterling|date=4 August 2008|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=22 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780786723904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This particular stereotype has been found in American children as early as second grade.&lt;ref name="Cvencek" /&gt;

The same test with Singaporean children found that the strength of their mathematics-gender stereotype and their gender identity predicted the association between individuals and mathematical ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cvencek | first1 = Dario | last2 = Meltzoff | first2 = Andrew N. | last3 = Kapur | first3 = Manu | title = Cognitive consistency and math–gender stereotypes in Singaporean children | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 117 | pages = 73–91 | doi = 10.1016/j.jecp.2013.07.018 | pmid = 24141205 | date = January 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that this stereotype also reflects mathematical performance: a study was done on the worldwide scale and it was found that the strength of this mathematics-gender stereotype in varying countries correlates with 8th graders' scores on the [[TIMSS]], a standardized math and science achievement test that is given worldwide. The results were controlled for general gender inequality and yet were still significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nosek | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Smyth | first2 = F.

==Gender inequality online==
An example of gender stereotypes assumes those of the male gender are more 'tech savvy' and happier working online, however, a study done by Hargittai &amp; Shafer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differences in Actual and Perceived Online Skills: The Role of Gender*|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x/abstract|journal = Social Science Quarterly |date=1 June 2006 |issn = 1540-6237|pages = 432–448|volume = 87|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x|first = Eszter|last = Hargittai|first2 = Steven|last2 = Shafer}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that many women also typically have lower self-perceived abilities when it comes to use of the World Wide Web and online navigation skills. Because this stereotype is so well known many women assume they lack such technical skills when in reality, the gap in technological skill level between men and women is significantly less than many women assume.

In the journal article written by Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz video games have been guilty of using sexualised female characters, who wear revealing clothing with an 'ideal' figure. It has been shown, female gamers can experience lower self-efficacy when playing a game with a sexualized female character. Women have been stereotyped in online games and have shown to be quite sexist in their appearance. It has been shown these kind of character appearances have influenced peoples' beliefs about gender capabilities by assigning certain qualities to the male and female characters in different games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9683-8|title=The Effects of the Sexualization of Female Video Game Characters on Gender Stereotyping and Female Self-Concept|first1=Elizabeth|last1=Behm-Morawitz|first2=Dana|last2=Mastro|date=1 December 2009|publisher=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=61|issue=11–12|pages=808–823|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9683-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of gender inequality is often perceived as something that is non-existent within the online community, because of the anonymity possible online. Remote or home-working greatly reduces the volume of information one individual gives another compared to face-to-face encounters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Postmes|first1=Tom|last2=Spears|first2=Russell|title=Behavior Online: Does Anonymous Computer Communication Reduce Gender Inequality?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=2002|volume=28|issue=8|pages=1073–1083|doi=10.1177/01461672022811006}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing fewer opportunities for unequal treatment but it seems real-world notions of power and privilege are being duplicated: people who choose to take up different identities (avatars) in the online world are (still) routinely discriminated against, evident in [[Online game|online gaming]] where users are able to create their own characters. This freedom allows the user to create characters and identities with a different appearance than their own in reality, essentially allowing them to create a new identity, confirming regardless of actual gender those who are perceived to be female are treated differently because of their on-line gender identity.

In marked contrast to the traditional male-dominated stereotype a study shows that 52% of the gaming audience is made up of women and a minority of gaming characters are women.{{non sequitur|date=December 2018}} Only 12% of game designers in Britain and 3% of all programmers are women.&lt;ref name="Jayanth1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 52% of gamers are women – but the industry doesn’t know it {{!}} Meg Jayanth|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know|website = the Guardian|accessdate =10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the growing number of women who partake in online communities, and the anonymous space provided by the Internet, issues such as gender inequality, the issue has simply been transplanted into the online world.

== Politics and gender issues ==
=== In political office ===
Even though the number of women running for [[elected office]] has increased over the last decades, they still only make up 20% of U.S. senators, 19.4% of U.S. congressional representatives and 24% of statewide executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Current Numbers |quote=This page contains current numbers of women officeholders serving in 2017 with links on the right to basic fact sheets for each level of office. |url=http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/current-numbers|website=www.cawp.rutgers.edu/current-numbers|publisher=Center for American Women and Politics|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many of these political campaigns appear to focus on the aggressiveness of the female candidate which is often still perceived as a masculine trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huddy|first1=Leonie|last2=Terkildsen|first2=Nayda|title=Gender Stereotypes and the Perception of Male and Female Candidates|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=February 1993|volume=37|issue=1|doi=10.2307/2111526|page=119|jstor=2111526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, female candidates are running based on gender-opposing stereotypes because that predicts higher likelihood of success than appearing to be a stereotypical woman.

Elections of increasing numbers of women into office serves as a basis for many scholars to claim that voters are not biased towards a candidate's gender. However, it has been shown that female politicians are perceived as only being superior when it comes to handling [[women's rights]] and [[poverty]], whereas male politicians are perceived to be better at dealing with [[crime]] and [[foreign affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanbonmatsu|first1=Kira|title=Stereotypes and Vote Choice|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=January 2002|volume=46|issue=1|doi=10.2307/3088412|page=20|jstor=3088412}}&lt;/ref&gt; That view lines up with the most common gender stereotypes.

It has also been predicted that gender does only highly matter for female candidates that have not been politically established. These predictions apply further to established candidates, stating that gender would not be a defining factor for their campaign or the focal point of media coverage. This has been disproven by multiple scholars, often based on [[Hillary Clinton]]'s multiple campaigns for the office of [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Susan J.|year=2009|title=Reflections on Gender and Hillary Clinton's Presidential Campaign: The Good, the Bad, and the Misogynistic|url=|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=5|pages=1–20|via=|doi=10.1017/s1743923x09000014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlin|first1=Diana B.|last2=Winfrey|first2=Kelly L.|title=Have You Come A Long Way, Baby?

Additionally, when voters don't have a lot of information about a female candidate, they are likely to view her as being a stereotypical woman which they often take as a basis for not electing her because they consider typical male qualities as being crucial for someone holding a political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huddy|first1=Leonie|last2=Terkildsen|first2=Nadya|title=The Consequences of Gender Stereotypes for Women Candidates at Different Levels and Types of Office|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=1993|volume=46|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, women in the United States saw a dramatic shift in social and professional aspirations and norms. Following the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Women's Suffrage Movement]] of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, [[World War I|WWI]] and [[World War II|WWII]], women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from "homemakers" and "caregivers", women were now factory workers and "breadwinners" for the family.

However, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American [[Suburb]]ia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, [[middle-class]] families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the "private sphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rotman | first1 = Deborah L. | year = 2006 | title = Separate Spheres? Beyond the Dichotomies of Domesticity | url = | journal = Current Anthology | volume = 47 | issue =4 | pages=666–674 |doi=10.1086/506286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though frequently sold and idealized as “perfect living”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dodson | first1 = Dan W. | year = 1958 | title = Suburbanism and Education | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Sociology | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages =2–7|doi=10.2307/2264228| jstor = 2264228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many women had difficulty adjusting to the new “private sphere.” Writer [[Betty Friedan]] described this discontent as “[[The Feminine Mystique|the feminine mystique]].” The “mystique” was derived from women equipped with the knowledge, skills, and aspirations of the workforce, the “public sphere”, who felt compelled whether socially or morally to devote themselves to the home and family.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty. "The Feminine Mystique". New York:W.W. Norton, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

One major concern of feminism, is that women occupy lower-ranking job positions than men, and do most of the housework.&lt;ref name="Gender differences in perceptions of household labor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-18658547.html|title=Gender differences in perceptions of household labor|accessdate=23 October 2009 |publisher=The Journal of Psychology|date=1 July 1996|author1=Kiger, Kiger |author2=Riley, Pamela J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent (October 2009) report from the Center for American Progress, "The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything" tells us that women now make up 48% of the US workforce and "mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners in a majority of families" (63.3%, see figure 2, page 19 of the Executive Summary of The Shriver Report).&lt;ref name="The Shriver Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/10/womans_nation.html/#executive_summary|title=The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything|accessdate=23 October 2009 |publisher=Center for American Progress|date=19 October 2009|author=Maria Shriver and the Center for American Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' indicates that young women today are closing the pay gap. Luisita Lopez Torregrosa has noted, "Women are ahead of men in education (last year, 55 percent of U.S. college graduates were female). And a study shows that in most U.S. cities, single, childless women under 30 are making an average of 8 percent more money than their male counterparts, with Atlanta and Miami in the lead at 20 percent.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Torregrosa|first=Luisita|title=They Call It the Reverse Gender Gap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/us/14iht-letter14.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this study concerned American cities, a global trend is developing, and has now been termed "the reverse gender gap."

Feminist theory generally defines gender as a social construct that includes ideologies governing feminine/masculine (female/male) appearances, actions, and behaviors.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} An example of these gender roles would be that males were supposed to be the educated breadwinners of the family, and occupiers of the public sphere whereas, the female's duty was to be a homemaker, take care of her husband and children, and occupy the private sphere. According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in [[Londa Schiebinger]]'s ''Has Feminism Changed Science'', in which she states, "Gendered characteristics - typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00544-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]’s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, “abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.”&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth, Sally. "Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era." Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47–70&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since, they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.

The men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger [[men's movement]]. It branched off from the [[men's liberation movement]] in the early-1970s. The men's rights movement is made up of a variety of groups and individuals who are concerned about what they consider to be issues of male disadvantage, [[discrimination]] and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgzFZ4o0qnMC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |last=Gavanas |first=Anna |title=Fatherhood Politics in the United States: Masculinity, Sexuality, Race, and Marriage |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location= Urbana |year=2004 |isbn=0-252-02884-8 |quote=All these cases of perceived discrimination make up the men's rights view that men are considered, by government and society, to be more expendable than women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoydLongwood1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Redeeming men: religion and masculinities|editor1-first=Stephen Blake |editor1-last=Boyd |editor2-first=W.

==Sexual orientation==

{{LGBT sidebar}}

Sexual orientation is defined by the interplay between a person's emotional and physical attraction toward others.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in Society : Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. (2014). Thirroul, AU: The Spinney Press. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ebrary.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, sexual orientation is broken into the three categories: heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual. By basic definition, the term heterosexual is typically used in reference to someone who is attracted to people of the opposite sex, the term homosexual is used to classify people who are attracted to those of the same sex, and the term bisexual is used to identify those who are attracted to both the same and opposite sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindley | first1 = Lisa | last2 = Walsemann | first2 = Katrina | last3 = Carter | first3 = Jarvis | year = 2012 | title = The Association of Sexual Orientation Measures With Young Adults' Health-Related Outcomes | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 6| pages = 1177–1178 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300262 | pmid = 22021310 | pmc=3483939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that sexual orientation is better defined as a continuum with those three categories represented. This idea was first proposed by sexologist Alfred Kinsey in 1948. After conducting a series of interviews, Kinsey and his team of researchers concluded that most people fell somewhere on a spectrum between strictly heterosexual and strictly homosexual. Their findings suggested that sexual orientation was more fluid than once believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | first1 = Robert | last2 = McKinney | first2 = Paul | last3 = Fox | first3 = Shannon | last4 = Garcia | first4 = Carlos | year = 2013 | title = Support for a Fluid-Continuum Model or Sexual Orientation: A Large-Scale Internet Study | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 59 | issue = 10| pages = 1356–1358 | doi = 10.1080/00918369.2012.724634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps it is an attempt to reconcile this conflict that leads to a common assumption that one same-sex partner assumes a pseudo-male gender role and the other assumes a pseudo-female role. For a gay male relationship, this might lead to the assumption that the "wife" handled domestic chores, was the receptive sexual partner, adopted effeminate mannerisms, and perhaps even dressed in women's clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mager|first1=Don|title=Gay Theories of Gender Role Deviance|journal=SubStance|date=1985|volume=14|issue=1|pages=32–48|doi=10.2307/3684953|jstor=3684953}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption is flawed because homosexual couples tend to have more equal roles, and the effeminate behavior of some gay men is usually not adopted consciously, and is often more subtle.&lt;ref name=Dwyer&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer |first=D.|title=Interpersonal Relationships [e-book]|year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-203-01971-7|page=104|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohabitating same-sex partners are typically egalitarian when they assign domestic chores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cherlin|first=Andrew|title=Public and Private Families, an introduction|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes these couples assign traditional female responsibilities to one partner and traditional male responsibilities to the other. Same-sex [[domestic partnership|domestic partners]] challenge traditional gender roles in their division of household responsibilities, and gender roles within homosexual relationships are flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crook|first=Robert|title=Our Sexuality|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, cleaning and cooking, traditionally regarded by many as both female responsibilities, might be assigned to different people. Carrington observed the daily home lives of 52 gay and lesbian couples and found that the length of the work week and level of earning power substantially affected the assignment of housework, regardless of gender or sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Carrington, C.

In many cultures, gender roles, especially for men, simultaneously act as an indicator for heterosexuality, and as a boundary of acceptable behavior for straight people. Therefore, lesbians, gay men and bisexual people may be viewed as exempt from some or all components of gender roles or as having different "rules" they are expected to follow by society.

These modified "rules" for lesbian, gay and bisexual people may also be oppressive. Morgan examines the plight of homosexuals seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] from homophobic persecution who have been turned away by US customs for "not being gay enough"; not conforming sufficiently to standard (Western) conceptions of the gender roles occupied by gays and lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, D. (2006) Not gay enough for the government: Racial and sexual stereotypes in sexual orientation asylum cases. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Legal Issues http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/lsex15&amp;div=9&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#141&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, heterosexual men and women who are not perceived as being sufficiently masculine or feminine, respectively, may be assumed to be, or suspected to be, homosexual, and persecuted for their perceived homosexuality.

Both men and women are more heavily involved in minor property and substance abuse offenses than in serious crimes like robbery or murder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20333">The '''green gross domestic product''' ('''green GDP''' or '''GGDP''') is an index of [[economic growth]] with the environmental consequences of that growth factored into a country's conventional [[GDP]]. Green GDP monetizes the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], and accounts for costs caused by [[climate change]]. Some environmental experts prefer physical indicators (such as "[[waste]] [[per capita]]" or "[[carbon dioxide emissions]] per year"), which may be aggregated to indices such as the "[[Sustainable Development Index]]".

==Calculation==

Calculating green GDP requires that net [[natural capital]] consumption, including [[resource depletion]], [[environmental degradation]], and [[environmental protection|protective]] and [[environmental restoration|restorative]] environmental initiatives, be subtracted from traditional GDP.&lt;ref name="Fitoussi"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, [http://templatelab.com/rapport-anglais/ "Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress"], "Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some early calculations of green GDP take into account one or two but not all environmental adjustments. These calculations can also be applied to [[net domestic product]] (NDP), which deducts the depreciation of produced capital from GDP. In each case, it is necessary to convert the resource activity into a monetary value, since it is in this manner that indicators are generally expressed in national accounts.

==Rationale==

The motivation for creating a green GDP originates from the inherent limitations of GDP has as an indicator of [[economic performance]] and [[social progress]]. It only assesses gross output, and does not have a mechanism for identifying the wealth and assets that underlie output.&lt;ref name="WAVES"/&gt; This is problematic because it cannot account for permanent or significant depletion or replenishment of these assets. Ultimately, GDP has no capacity to identify whether the level of [[income]] generated in a country is [[sustainable]]. Richard Stone, one of the creators the original GDP indicator, suggested that while "the three pillars on which an analysis of society ought to rest are studies of economic, socio-[[demographic]] and environmental phenomenon", he had done little work in the area of [[environmental issues]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stone, [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1984/stone-lecture.pdf "The Accounts of Society"], "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1984", 8 December 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, natural capital is poorly represented in GDP; resources are not adequately considered as economic assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-policy "Policy Recommendations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420075450/http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-policy |date=2013-04-20 }}, "International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Relative to their costs, companies and policy makers also do not give sufficient weight to the future benefits generated by restorative or protective environmental projects. As well, the important positive externalities that arise from forests, wetlands and agriculture are unaccounted for or otherwise hidden because of practical difficulties around measuring and pricing these assets.&lt;ref name="WAVES"&gt;[http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/natural-capital-accounting?active=1 "Natural Capital Accounting"], "Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the impact that the [[depletion of natural resources]] or increases in [[pollution]] can and do have on the future productive capacity of a nation are unaccounted for in traditional GDP estimates.&lt;ref name="WAVES" /&gt;

The need for a more comprehensive macroeconomic indicator is consistent with the conception of sustainable development as a desirable phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sesric.org/files/article/52.pdf "Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Growth and Development with Special Reference to a System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA): The Indonesian Experience"], "Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Centre for Islamic Countries"&lt;/ref&gt; GDP is mistakenly appropriated as a primary indicator of well-being, and as a result, it is used heavily in the analysis of political and economic policy. Green GDP would arguably be a more accurate indicator or measure of societal well-being. Therefore, the integration of environmental statistics into national accounts, and by extension, the generation of a green GDP figure, would improve countries' abilities to manage their economies and resources.

==History==
Many economists, scientists and other scholars have theorized about adjusting [[macroeconomic]] [[economic indicator|indicator]]s to account for [[environmental change]]. The idea was developed early on through the work of Nordhaus and Tobin (1972), Ahmad et al. (1989), Repetto et al. (1989), and Hartwick (1990).&lt;ref&gt;John Asafu-Adjaye, [http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf "Green National Accounting and the Measurement of Genuine (Extended) Saving"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811080135/http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf |date=2007-08-11 }}, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, William Nordhaus and James Tobin introduced the first model to measure the annual real consumption of households, called the [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW).&lt;ref name="MEW"&gt;William Nordhaus and James Tobin, [https://www.nber.org/chapters/c7620.pdf "Is Growth Obsolete?"], National Bureau of Economic Research, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; MEW adjusts GDP to include the value of leisure time, unpaid work and [[environmental damage]]s.&lt;ref name="MEW" /&gt; They also defined a sustainable MEW (MEW-S) value, and their work was the precursor to more sophisticated measures of sustainable development.

Repetto further explored the impact that the failure of resource-based economies to account for the depreciation of their natural capital could have, especially by distorting evaluations of macroeconomic relationships and performance.&lt;ref name="Jeroen"&gt;Jeroen van den Bergh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6bwKkM1GC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Ecological Economics and Sustainable Development"], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He and his colleagues developed the concept of depreciation accounting, which factors environmental depreciation into "aggregate measures of economic performance".&lt;ref name="Jeroen" /&gt;

In their seminal report, "Economic Accounting for Sustainable Development", Yusuf Ahmad, Salah El Serafy and Ernst Lutz compiled papers from several [[UNEP]]-[[World Bank]] sponsored workshops, convened after 1983, on how to develop [[environmental accounting]] as a [[public policy]] tool.&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;Edited by Yusuf J. Ahmad, Salah El Serafy and Ernst Lutz, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/12/03/000178830_98101901491957/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf "Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Development"], The World Bank, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The central theme of all of the authors' arguments is that the [[system of national accounts]] (SNA), as it traditionally calculates income, omits important aspects of economic development that ought to be included.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; One important disagreement on environmentally adjusted indicators is presented by Anne Harrison and Salah El Serafy in their respective chapters.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; Harrison argues that appropriate adjustments ought to be made within the existing SNA framework, while El Serafy suggests a redefinition of what constitutes intermediate and final demand.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; In his view, the SNA should not consider the sale of natural capital as generating value added, while at least part of the income generated from this sale should be excluded from GDP and net product.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt; This would effectively allow GDP to continue to be used extensively.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;

In "Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation", John Hartwick presents an accounting methodology to find NNP inclusive of the depletion of natural resource stock by representing the use of natural resources as "economic depreciation magnitudes".&lt;ref&gt;John Hartwick, [http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/working_papers/papers/qed_wp_771.pdf "Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation"], Queen's University, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of accounting, which makes adjustments to the existing national account indicators, found traction in the [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]] (SEEA), published by the [[United Nations]] as an appendix to the 1993 SNA.&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;Joy Hecht, [http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C13/E1-21-03-04.pdf "The Evolving System of Integrated Economic and Environmental Accounts"], Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The report offered five approaches, or versions, to developing environmental accounts.&lt;ref name="Joy" /&gt; Over the years, the SEEA has been expanded and revised in view of the increased sophistication of accounting methodologies and technology. This revision will be explored in greater detail in the "Global Initiatives" section. Ultimately, the importance of the SEEA with respect to the green [[GDP]] is that it is possible to create full-sequence accounts from which aggregates such as green GDP can be derived and compared internationally, and many countries have begun this process.&lt;ref&gt;London Group on Environmental Accounting, [http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/download/bgdp-ve-seea.pdf "Why We Need the SEEA"], ''Beyond GDP'', 25 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reports and initiatives after the SEEA-1993 have explored the possibility of expanding or changing the scope of environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators. As the popularity of green GDP and other environmentally adjusted macroeconomic indicators grows, their construction will increasingly draw on this continuously developing body of research, especially with respect to the methodology associated with valuing non-market capital (e.g., services from natural capital which exist outside of traditional market settings).

In 1993, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the official bookkeeper of the U.S. economy, began responding to concerns that the GDP needed retooling. The agency began working on a green accounting system called Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts. These initial results released in 1994 showed that GDP numbers were overstating the impact of mining companies to the nation's economic wealth. Mining companies didn't like those results, and in 1995 Alan B. Mollohan, a Democratic House Representative from West Virginia's coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 Appropriations Bill that stopped the Bureau of Economic Analysis from working on revising the GDP and that's where things stand today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | date=April 9, 2004 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602190235/http://gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archivedate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph (2008), presentation in New York, 5 Feb 2008, "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q_PA_czIKM&amp;feature=related video from 3:18]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Costanza et al. (1997) estimated the current economic value of 17 [[ecosystem services]] for 16 biomes.&lt;ref name="Costanza"&gt;Costanza et al., [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6630/abs/387253a0.html "The Value of the World's Ecosystem Services and Natural Capital"], ''Nature'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the entire biosphere, most of which exists outside of the market, is estimated conservatively to be between $16–54 trillion per year.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt; By comparison, global GNP is approximately $18 trillion per year.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt; The size of this figure demonstrates the significance of ecosystem services on human welfare and income generation, and the importance of identifying and recognizing this value. The valuation techniques used by the authors were often based on estimations of individuals' "willingness-to-pay" for ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Costanza" /&gt;

Kunte et al. (1998) use their paper "Estimating National Wealth: Methodology and Results" to demonstrate that expanding the national accounts to include natural capital is a "practical [and necessary] exercise".&lt;ref name="Kunte"&gt;Kunte et al., [http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/ceea/archive/Framework/Kunte_etal_1998.PDF "Estimating National Wealth"], The World Bank, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; They estimate the total wealth of nations by including different components of wealth in their calculations, including natural capital. They place values on natural capital by using the concept of economic rent. "Economic rent is the return on a commodity in excess of the minimum required to bring forth its services. Rental value is therefore the difference between the market price and cost of production / extraction."&lt;ref name="Kunte" /&gt; Following this, and by adjusting calculations for (un)sustainable use patterns, they are able to determine the stock of natural capital in a country that more accurately reflects its wealth.&lt;ref name="Kunte" /&gt;

Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment, written by William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg and published in 1999, examined whether or not to broaden the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) to include natural resources and the environment.&lt;ref name="Nordhaus"&gt;William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3147043 "Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment"], National Academy Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The panel, which addressed this question, concluded that extending the NIPA and developing supplemental environmental accounts should be a high priority goals for the U.S., because these would provide useful data on a variety of economic issues and government trends, which entailed both replenishing and extractive activities.&lt;ref name="Nordhaus" /&gt; One of the major findings of the report is that it is fundamentally necessary for green adjustments to account for instances when natural capital is discovered or replenished, along with general depletive activities.

In 2004, [[Wen Jiabao]], the Chinese premier, announced that the green [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] index would replace the Chinese GDP index itself as a performance measure for government and party officials at the highest levels. The first green GDP accounting report, for 2004, was published in September 2006. It showed that the financial loss caused by pollution was 511.8 billion yuan ($66.3 billion), or 3.05 percent of the nation's economy.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Xiaohua (2007) "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/19/content_853917.htm Call for return to green accounting]", ''China Daily'', 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an experiment in national accounting, the Green GDP effort collapsed in failure in 2007, when it became clear that the adjustment for environmental damage had reduced the growth rate to politically unacceptable levels, nearly zero in some provinces. In the face of mounting evidence that environmental damage and [[resource depletion]] was far more costly than anticipated, the government withdrew its support for the Green GDP methodology and suppressed the 2005 report, which had been due out in March, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, J. and Yardley, J. (2007) "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/world/asia/26china.html Choking on Growth: As China Roars, Pollution Reaches Deadly Extremes]", ''The New York Times'', 26 Aug 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent estimates of the cost to China of environmental degradation and resource depletion have for the last decade ranged from 8 to 12 percentage points of GDP growth.&lt;ref&gt;Economy, Elizabeth (2007) "[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/nature/greengdp.html Green GDP: Accounting for the Environment in China]", ''China from the Inside'', U.S. Public Broadcasting System.&lt;/ref&gt; These estimates support the idea that, by this measure at least, the growth of the Chinese economy is close to zero.

The most promising national activity on the green GDP has been from India. The country's environmental minister, Jairam Ramesh, stated in 2009 that "It is possible for scientists to estimate green GDP. An exercise has started under the country's chief statistician Pronab Sen and by 2015, India's GDP numbers will be adjusted with economic costs of [[environmental degradation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/India-to-release--green-GDP--data-from-2015/544338/|title=India to release green GDP data from 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
The [[Global Reporting Initiative]]'s (GRI) core goals include the mainstreaming of disclosure on environmental, social and governance performance. Although the GRI is independent, it remains a collaborating centre of [[UNEP]] and works in cooperation with the [[United Nations Global Compact]]. It produces one of the world's most prevalent standards for sustainability reporting&amp;mdash;also known as [[ecological footprint]] reporting, [[Environmental Social and Corporate Governance|environmental social governance]] (ESG) reporting, [[triple bottom line]] (TBL) reporting, and [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) reporting. It is working on a green GDP to be implemented worldwide.

==Current debate==

Some critics of environmentally adjusted aggregates, including GDP, point out that it may be difficult to assign values to some of the outputs that are quantified. This is a particular difficulty in cases where the environmental asset does not exist in a traditional market and is therefore non-tradable. Ecosystem services are one example of this type of resource. In the case that valuation is undertaken indirectly, there is a possibility that calculations may rely on speculation or hypothetical assumptions.

Supporters of adjusted aggregates may reply to this objection in one of two ways. First, that as our technological capabilities increase, more accurate methods of valuation have been and will continue to develop. Second, that while measurements may not be perfect in the cases of non-market natural assets, the adjustments they entail are still a preferable alternative to traditional GDP.

A second objection may be found in the Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, when Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi remark that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"there is a more fundamental problem with green GDP, which also applies to Nordhaus and Tobin's SMEW and to the ISEW/GNI indices. None of these measures characterize sustainability per se. Green GDP just charges GDP for the depletion of or damage to environmental resources. This is only one part of the answer to the question of sustainability."&lt;ref name="Fitoussi" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''history and philosophy of science''' ('''HPS''') is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] that encompasses the [[philosophy of science]] and the [[History of science and technology|history of science]]. Although many scholars in the field are trained primarily as either historians or as philosophers, there are degree-granting departments of HPS at several prominent universities (see below).

==A unified discipline==
The organization [http://integratedhps.org/en/ &amp;HPS] (Integrated History and Philosophy of Science) has set forth a program for a unified discipline: "Good history and philosophy of science is not just history of science into which some philosophy of science may enter, or philosophy of science into which some history of science may enter. It is work that is both historical and philosophical at the same time. The founding insight of the modern discipline of HPS is that history and philosophy have a special affinity and one can effectively advance both simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;"About &amp;HPS," http://www3.nd.edu/~andhps/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

One origin of the unified discipline is the historical approach to the discipline of the philosophy of science. This hybrid approach is reflected in the career of [[Thomas Kuhn]]. His first permanent appointment, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref&gt;"A Discussion with Thomas S. Kuhn" in ''The Road Since Structure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; was to a position advertised by the philosophy department, but he also taught courses from the history department. When he was promoted to full professor in the history department only, Kuhn was offended at the philosophers' rejection because "I sure as hell wanted to be there, and it was my philosophy students who were working with me, not on philosophy but on history, were nevertheless my more important students".&lt;ref&gt;"A Discussion with Thomas S. Kuhn," p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude is also reflected in his historicist approach, as outlined in Kuhn's seminal [[Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962, 2nd ed. 1970), wherein philosophical questions about scientific theories and, especially, theory change are understood in historical terms, employing concepts such as [[paradigm shift]].

However, Kuhn was also critical of attempts fully to unify the ''methods'' of history and philosophy of science: "Subversion is not, I think, too strong a term for the likely result of an attempt to make the two fields into one. They differ in a number of their central constitutive characteristics, of which the most general and apparent is their goals. The final product of most historical research is a narrative, a story, about particulars of the past. [...] The philosopher, on the other hand, aims principally at explicit generalizations and at those with universal scope. He is no teller of stories, true or false. His goal is to discover and state what is true at all times and places rather than to impart understanding of what occurred at a particular time and place."&lt;ref&gt;"The Relations Between the History and the Philosophy of Science," pp. 3–20 in ''The Essential Tension'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent work questions whether these methodological and conceptual divisions are in fact barriers to a unified discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Patton, ''Philosophy, Science, and History'', pp. 27–33, New York: Routledge 2014, http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415898317/.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="87309">The '''history of advertising''' can be traced to ancient civilizations. It became a major force in [[capitalist]] economies in the mid-19th century, based primarily on [[newspaper]]s and magazines. In the 20th century, [[advertising]] grew rapidly with new technologies such as [[direct mail]], [[radio]], [[television]], the internet and mobile devices.

[[File:Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestice Product in the United States.svg|thumb|Advertising as a percent of Gross Domestic Product in the United States, 1919 to 2007 per Douglas Galbi.]]

Between 1919 and 2007 advertising averaged 2.2 percent of [[Gross Domestic Product]] in the United States.

==Pre-modern history==

[[File:Bronze printing plate for an advertisement.jpg|thumb|Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at [[Jinan]], [[Song dynasty]] China. It is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.]]
Egyptians used [[papyrus]] to make sales messages and wall posters. [[Advertising campaign|Commercial messages]] and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and  [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. [[Lost and found]] advertising on papyrus was common in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian [[rock art]] paintings that date back to 4000 BC.&lt;ref name= Bhatia&gt;Bhatia (2000). ''Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism'', 62+68&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the [[Classic of Poetry]] (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell candy. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the [[Song dynasty]] used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with "[[Jinan]] Liu's Fine Needle Shop" and "We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time" written above and below.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China," ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' [European Conference Proceedings] Vol. 8, 2008; Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "A Brief History of Branding in China," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Liu, ''Chinese Business: Landscapes and Strategies'' (2013), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]

In Europe, as the towns and cities of the [[Middle Ages]] began to grow, and the general populace was unable to read, instead of signs that read "cobbler", "miller", "tailor", or "blacksmith" would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in ''Les Crieries de Paris'' ([[Street cries]] of Paris), a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve.&lt;ref&gt;Aimeé Boutin, "Sound Memory: Paris Street Cries in Balzac's Pere Goriot," ''French Forum,'' Volume 30, Number 2, Spring 2005, pp. 67–78, DOI:10.1353/frf.2005.0029&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three major forms of advertisement existed during the pre-printing period (before the 15th-century); those forms were trademarks (moon, stars etc.), town criers and [[signage|sign boards]]:

* '''Trademarks''': The practice of attaching seals or marks to products was widespread in antiquity. Around 4,000 years ago, producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wengrow, D., "Prehistories of Commodity Branding," ''Current Anthropology,''Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7-34&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest use of maker's marks, dating to about 1,300 BCE, have been found in India.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, M. and Mufti, S.U., ''The Hot History &amp; Cold Future of Brands'', ''Journal of Managerial Sciences'', vol. 1, no. 1, 2007, pp 75–87, http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; By the medieval period, [[hallmark]]s were applied to high value goods such as precious metals, and assayers were appointed by governments to administer the system and ensure product quality.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, E.C., ''Byzantine Silver Stamps'', [Dumbarton Oaks Studies] Vol. 7, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1961, pp 23–35&lt;/ref&gt; 

* '''Town criers''': In ancient towns and cities, where the majority of citizens were illiterate, town-criers were appointed to call out official announcements and general news. Before long, private individuals began to employ public criers to act as an auctioneer.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, itinerant [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] developed a system of [[street cries]] to promote their goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, V., "The Streets for the People: London's Street Markets 1850–1939, ''Urban History'', June, 2015, pp. 1–21,&lt;/ref&gt; These street cries provided an essential public service before the advent of mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Garrioch, D., "Sounds of the City: the soundscape of early modern European towns," ''Urban History,'' 2003, Vol. 30, no. 1, pp 5&amp;ndash;25, [http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0963926803001019 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Saracens Head pub sign.jpg|thumb|left|Saracens Head pub sign, Bath, England]]
*'''Sign-boards''':  The use of commercial signage has a very ancient history. Retail signage and promotional signs appear to have developed independently in the East and the West. In antiquity, the ancient Egyptians, Romans and Greeks were known to use signage for shop fronts as well as to announce public events such as market days.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, F.K.,  "The Ancient History of Advertising: Insights and Implications for Practitioners: What Today's Advertisers and Marketers Can Learn from Their Predecessors," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 57 no. 3, pp 239-244 DOI: 10.2501/JAR-2017-033&lt;/ref&gt; China also exhibited a rich history of early retail signage systems.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419–32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Medieval Britain and France and much of Europe, innkeepers were compelled to erect a sign-board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manton|first=Dafydd|title=Ale and Arty in Sheffield: The Disappearing Art of Pub Signs|year=2008|publisher=Arc Publishing and Print|location=Sheffield, England|isbn=978-1906722005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth.

==16th-18th centuries==

Modern advertising began to take shape with the advent of newspapers and magazines in the 16th and 17th centuries. The very first weekly [[gazette]]s appeared in Venice in the early 16th-century. From there, the concept of a weekly publication spread to Italy, Germany and Holland.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, J., "The 'Avvisi' of Venice: Toward an Archaeology of Media Forms." ''Journalism History'' 14#2, 1987, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the first weeklies appeared in the 1620s, and its first daily newspaper was the ''[[The Daily Courant]]'' published from 1702 to 1735.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B., ''From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History of English Newspapers to 1899'' (Ashgate, 2004; Hunt, M., "Hawkers, Bawlers, and Mercuries: Women and the London Press in the Early Enlightenment", ''Women &amp; History'', Vol. 3, no. 9, 1984 pp 41-68; Maxted, U., 'Mallet, Elizabeth (fl. 1672–1706)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66880, accessed 27 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost from the outset, newspapers carried advertising to defray the cost of printing and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Barrès-Baker, M.C., ''An Introduction to the Early History of Newspaper Advertising'', [Brent Museum and Archive Occasional Publications, No. 2], Brent Heritage Services,   2006, &lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commercial advertisements were for books and quack medicines, but by the 1650s, the variety of products being advertised had increased markedly.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, E.E., ''The Shocking History of Advertising'', New York, Ballantine Books, 1980, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in printing allowed retailers and manufacturers to print [[Flyer (pamphlet)|handbills]] and [[trade card]]s. For example, Jonathon Holder, a London haberdasher in the 1670s, gave every customer a printed list of his stock with the prices affixed. At the time, Holder's innovation was seen as a "dangerous practice" and an unnecessary expense for retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, S., ''A History of Advertising from the Earliest Times'', Chatto and, Windus, 1875, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest trade cards were not cards at all, instead they were printed on paper and did not include illustrations. By the 18th century, however, they were printed on the more substantial card and typically bore the tradesmen's name and address, and before street numbering was in common use, often included a long-winded set of directions on how to locate the store or premises. With the advent of commercial engraving and lithography, illustrations became a standard feature of even the most humble trade card. Eventually trade cards evolved into business cards, which are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;"Trade Cards," in ''The Encyclopedia of Ephemera: A Guide to the Fragmentary Documents of Everyday Life for the Collector, Curator, and Historian,'' Maurice Rickards (ed), Psychology Press, 2000, pp 334-335, pp 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
In June 1836, [[Émile de Girardin]] editor of the Paris newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to rely on paid advertising to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability. His formula was soon copied by all titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clyde Thogmartin|title=The National Daily Press of France|year=1998|isbn=978-1-883479-20-6|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the [[printing press]]; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as modern people rejected traditional cures. However, [[false advertising]] and "[[Quackery]]" became common. British newspapers in the 1850s and 1860s appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.&lt;ref&gt;Beverley Ann Tudor, "Retail Trade Advertising in the 'Leicester Journal' and the 'Leicester Chronicle' 1855-71." ''European Journal of Marketing'' 20#9 (1986) pp: 41-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A leadership position in British advertising was held by [[Cope Bros &amp; Co]] tobacco company, founded in Liverpool in 1848 by Thomas and George Cope. Smoking, of course, had been common for centuries, but the innovations consisted in brand names, heavy advertising, and market segmentation according to class. An innovative appeal was to health consciousness; the ads directed at the middle-class men promised that  "smoke not only checks disease but preserves the lungs."   A rugged heavy taste was pitched to working men, soldiers and sailors,  while "delicately fragrant" was part of the appeal to the upper-class. The packaging was attractive, posters were omnipresent to show that smoking was a normal part of English life;  lobbying was used to undercut the anti-tobacco lobby.&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Seaton,"Cope's and the Promotion of Tobacco in Victorian England." ''European Journal of Marketing''  (1986) 20#9 pp: 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising agencies===

====Great Britain====
{{main article|History of advertising in Britain}}
[[Image:Parrywatercolour.jpg|right|thumb|390px|In Britain, outdoor advertising was based on hoardngs (billboards): England 1835, by [[John Orlando Parry]]]]
In London [[Thomas J. Barratt]] was hailed as "the father of modern advertising".&lt;ref&gt;He was first described as such in T F G Coates, 'Mr Thomas J Barratt, "The father of modern advertising"', Modern Business, September 1908, pp. 107–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "mat"&gt;Matt Haig, ''Brand failures: the truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time'', Kogan Page Publishers, 2005, pp. 219, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nick"&gt;Nicholas Mirzoeff, ''The visual culture reader'', Routledge, 2002, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; Working for the [[Pears Soap]] company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, "Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/04/27/100310554.pdf |title=Obituary, Thomas J. Barratt Dead: Chairman of the Firm of A. &amp; F. Pears an Advertising Genius|work=New York Times| page= 11 |publisher=New York Times |date=1914-04-27 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "part"&gt;Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, ''A Dictionary of Catch Phrases: British and American, from the Sixteenth Century to the Present Day'', Routledge, 1986, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

An advertising tactic that he used was to associate the Pears brand with high culture and quality. Most famously, he used the painting ''[[Bubbles (painting)|Bubbles]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]] as an advertisement by adding a bar of Pears soap into the foreground. Barratt continued this theme with a series of adverts of well groomed middle-class children, associating Pears with domestic comfort and aspirations of high society.

[[File:Pears Soap 1900.jpg|right|thumb|A 1900 British ad for soap]]

Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste."&lt;ref name = "mat"/&gt;

====United States====
In the United States around 1840, Volney B. Palmer set up the first [[advertising agency]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad – the copy, layout, and artwork – was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of [[N.W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was founded in New York. It planned, created, and executed complete advertising campaigns for its customers. It created a number of memorable slogans for firms such as [[De Beers]], [[AT&amp;T]] and the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency: N. W. Ayer &amp; Son 1869-1949'' (1949) p 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J. Walter Thompson Advertisement 1903.JPG|thumb|left|275px|J. Walter Thompson Co. promotes high-powered advertisement, 1903]]

By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.
&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Graphic Design: A New History |last=Eskilson |first=Stephen J. |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers.  [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]] was the first full-service agency to assume responsibility for advertising content. N.W. Ayer opened in 1869, and was located in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58"/&gt;

The amount of space available in newspapers grew rapidly. The ''Boston Transcript'' published in 19,000 "agate lines" Of advertising in 1860,  87,000 in 1900, and 237,000 in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Starch, ''Advertising Principles'' (1927)  p 485&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, 104 companies spent over $50,000 each on national advertising; most sold patent medicines, which faded away after the federal food and drug legislation of the early 20th century. Seven innovators had emerged in the big time: [[Quaker Oats]], Armour meat, Cudahy meat, American Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard tobacco, Remington Typewriters, and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] soap.  By 1914, two thirds of the top advertisers came from just five industries: 14 food producers, 13 in automobiles and tires,  nine in soap and cosmetics, and four in tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Pope, ''The making of modern advertising'' (1983) pp 42-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agencies were forever breaking up and reforming, especially when one executive would split taking with him a major client and his team of [[copywriter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, ''The History of an Advertising Agency '' (1949) pp 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In the late 19th century in France, [[Charles-Louis Havas]] extended the services of his news agency, [[Havas]] to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.

== Since 1900:  Global==
Advertising in the developing world was dominated by agencies in the imperial powers, especially from London and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Ciochetto, ''Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China'' (2013) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  [[J. Walter Thompson]] became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.  It expanded across the globe, becoming one of the first American agencies in Egypt, South Africa and Asia.  Much of the pressure to expand came from General Motors, which wanted to export its automobiles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring,  "The Globalization of American Advertising and Brand Management: A Brief History of the J. Walter Thompson Company, Proctor and Gamble, and US Foreign Policy." ''Global Studies Journal'' (2013). 5#4&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford turned to N.W. Ayer, which began its expansion in Europe and Latin America in the 1930s.  The typical policy was to put an American manager in charge, and hire a staff drawn from locals who had a better understanding of the language and the culture.  In 1941-42, however, Ayer closed its foreign offices and decided to concentrate on the American market.&lt;ref&gt;Hower, 'The History of an advertising agency: N.W. Ayer &amp; Son at work, 1869-1949." (1949) pp 140-46, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, spending on advertising reached $143 billion in the United States and $467 billion worldwide.&lt;ref name="WPP Group Forecasts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/2011/dec/05/groupm-forecasts-global-ad-spending-to/ |title=GroupM forecasts 2012 global ad spending to increase 6.4% |publisher=WPP |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1900: United States and Canada==

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States after 1870 as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products to a very large market. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 33. "As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single-purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods."&lt;/ref&gt; Total advertising volume in the United States grew from about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Pope|title=The making of modern advertising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bElPAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s and 1920s, many ad men believed that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed – "[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]]" into the desire to purchase commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness: Advertising and the Social Roots of the Consumer Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2008|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Bernays]], a nephew of [[Sigmund Freud]], promoted the approach making him [[Tobacco advertising|a pioneer of modern cigarette advertising.]]  Glantz argues, "it was really the tobacco industry, from the beginning, that was at the forefront of the development of modern, innovative, advertising techniques."&lt;ref name="GlantzModernAds"&gt;Stanton Glantz in ''[[Mad Men]] Season 3 Extra – Clearing the Air – The History of Cigarette Advertising'', part 1, min 3:38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, under [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]], the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1929, the head of the U.S. [[Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce]], Julius Klein, stated "Advertising is the key to world prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the "unparalleled" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising was a vehicle for [[cultural assimilation]], encouraging immigrants to exchange their traditional habits and tastes in favor of a modern American lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ewen|title=Captains Of Consciousness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1R5S1DSC9kC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2008|pages=56–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the [[American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers]] (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeanne D. Petit|title=The Men and Women We Want: Gender, Race, and the Progressive Era Literacy Test Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTubHqECr84C&amp;pg=PA66|year=2010|publisher=U of Rochester Press|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian media market===
In 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as  contracts for public printing  controlled by the political parties. With the rise of national advertising agencies after 1900, a major transformation was underway. The advertisers wanted them to reach the maximum possible circulation, regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Across the board, the news pages increasingly featured more objectivity and bipartisanship, and the publishers were mostly focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911.  Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations]], which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were "independent" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Johnston, "Partisan Politics, Market Research, and Media Buying in Canada, 1920," '' Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly'' (2006) 83#4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and psychology===
{{main article|Sex in advertising}}
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|300px|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal'' version of the famous ad]]

At the turn of the 20th century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their household, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]]  at J. Walter Thompson Agency, was one of the pioneers.

In 1911, the [[Woodbury Soap Company]] became the first to use images of sexual contact to sell a product. Their ad slogan, created by Helen Lansdowne, claimed that women who used the soap would have "Skin You Love To Touch". Her copy promised the soap would increase the beauty of one's skin; it offered a color print and a week's supply of the soap for 10 cents. The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history. It was ranked 31st on ''Advertising Age's'' list of the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/resor-helen-lansdowne-1886-1964/98850/ "Resor, Helen Lansdowne (1886-1964)" in ''Advertising Age'' Sept 15, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nudity===
In 1936, Woodbury was one of the first companies to use nudity in its advertisements. The ad, known as "The Sun Bath", was photographed by [[Edward Steichen]] and showed a nude woman lying on stairs on her side with her back to the camera. The text advertised that Woodbury Soap was now enriched with "filter sunshine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria |title=For Appearance' Sake: The Historical Encyclopedia of Good Looks, Beauty, and Grooming|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=1-573-56204-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many celebrities appeared in advertisements for Woodbury Soap.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in advertising in Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle R. Nelson and Hye-Jin Paek, "Nudity of female and male models in primetime TV advertising across seven countries," ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2008) 27#5 pp 715-744&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
In the early 20th century, psychologists Walter D. Scott and [[John B. Watson]] contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, "Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L.T., &amp; Baker, D.B. 2004. Industrial-organizational psychology: The new psychology and the business of advertising. ''From Séance to Science: A History of the Profession of Psychology in America''. 118-121. California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer. The former chair at [[Johns Hopkins University]], John B. Watson was a highly recognized psychologist in the 1920s. After leaving the field of academia he turned his attention towards advertising where he implemented the concepts of [[behaviorism]] into advertising. This focused on appealing to the basic emotions of the consumer: love, hate, and fear. This type of advertising proved to be extremely effective as it suited the changing social context which led to heavy influence of future advertising strategy and cemented the place of psychology in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;T. Jackson Lears,  "From salvation to self-realization: Advertising and the therapeutic roots of the consumer culture, 1880-1930."

''Journal of Advertising'' 19#2 (1990): 49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Lasker:  Salesmanship in print===
{{main article|Albert Lasker}}
Chicago, along with New York, was the center of the nation's advertising industry. Albert Lasker, known as the "father of modern advertising," made Chicago his base 1898–1942. As head of the [[Draftfcb|Lord and Thomas agency]], Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked [[Lucky Strikes]] they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for [[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]] soap, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste, [[Kotex]] products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur W. Schultz, "Albert Lasker's Advertising Revolution," ''Chicago History,'' Nov 2002, Vol. 31#2 pp. 36–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked. Lasker believed that advertising consisted of news and information was news, He changed his mind when a colleague Johnny Kennedy told him, "News is a technique of presentation, but advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words, it is 'salesmanship in print'".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshank &amp; Arthur W. Schultz, ''The Man Who Sold America,'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;  Lasker and Kennedy used this concept with [[Whirlpool Corporation|the 1900 Washer Co.]] (later Whirlpool). Their campaign was so successful that, within four months of running the first ad, they attracted additional clients and their "advertising spend" went from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a month. Within six months, their firm was one of the three or four largest advertisers in the nation.

In 1908 Lasker recruited [[Claude C. Hopkins]] to the firm, specifically to work on the Van Camp Packaging Company ([[Van Camp's]]) account. The relationship lasted for 17 years. Lasker helped create America's infatuation with orange juice. Lord &amp; Thomas acquired the [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated]] account in 1908, when the citrus industry was in a slump. Lasker created campaigns that not only encouraged consumers to eat oranges, but also to drink orange juice.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunther, ''Taken at the Flood'' (1960) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Lasker's pioneering contributions was the introduction into public schools of classes that explained to young girls about puberty and [[menstruation]] (done to promote [[Kotex]] [[tampons]]). He is also credited as the creator of the [[soap opera]] genre, and using radio and television as media driven by advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinrich|first1=Thomas|last2=Batchelor|first2=Bob|title=Kotex, Kleenex, Huggies: Kimberly-Clark and the Consumer Revolution in American Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlPNB5HpRDIC&amp;pg=PA83|year=2004|publisher=Ohio State University Press|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cruikshank|first1=Jeffrey L.|last2=Schultz|first2=Arthur|title=The Man Who Sold America: The Amazing (but True!)

Morello, ''Selling the President, 1920: Albert D. Lasker, Advertising, and the Election of Warren G. Harding'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the radio from the 1920s===
{{main article|History of broadcasting}}
[[File:1930.05.06 Advertisement for Radio Broadcast With Lisa Roma.gif|thumb|Advertisement for a live radio broadcast, sponsored by a milk company and published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on May 6, 1930]]

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. Madison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. United States, never had a licensing fee for set users.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Smulyan]], ''Selling radio: The commercialization of American broadcasting, 1920-1934'' (Smithsonian Inst Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain Use the mandatory fee on set owners to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], Which to this day operates without commercials or advertising.  However, the government permitted
commercial television in 1954 and commercial radio in 1972.

[[Public service advertising]], [[non-commercial advertising]], public interest advertising, [[cause marketing]], and [[social marketing]] are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.

In the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of [[public service ad]]vertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required public service announcements during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Public service advertising in the United States reached its height during the world wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Creel]], ''How we advertised America: The first telling of the amazing story of the Committee on Public Information that carried the gospel of Americanism to every corner of the globe'' (1920).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Hollihan, "Propagandizing in the interest of war: A rhetorical study of the committee on public information." ''Southern Journal of Communication'' 49#3 (1984): 241-257.&lt;/ref&gt; During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the [[Ad Council]]) which is the United States' largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running public service campaign, [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;Dannagal Goldthwaite Young, "Sacrifice, consumption, and the [[American way]] of life: Advertising and domestic propaganda during World War II." ''The Communication Review'' 8#1 (2005) pp: 27-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Griffith, "The Selling of America: The Advertising Council and American Politics, 1942–1960." ''Business History Review'' 57#3 (1983): 388-412 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3114050 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s and World War II===
Advertising came under heavy pressure in the 1930s. The [[Great Depression]] forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The [[New Deal]] furthermore aggressively promoted [[consumerism]], and minimized the value or need of advertising.  Historian Jackson Lears argues that "By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics." They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own [[market research]], as well has the key to understanding politics. [[George Gallup]], the vice president of [[Young and Rubicam]], and numerous other advertising experts, led the way.  Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the "American Way of Life" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. "Advertisers," Lears concludes, "played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson Lears|title=Fables Of Abundance: A Cultural History Of Advertising In America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgoXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean M. Converse," ''Survey Research in the United States: Roots and Emergence 1960'' (1987) pp: 114-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar era===
In the prosperous postwar era, millions of Americans moved into new housing, especially in the rapidly growing suburbs. They spent heavily on housing, appliances, furniture, clothing and automobiles. The coming of television in the 1950s dramatically enlarged the arena for advertising. With most families having automobiles, and more leisure time, travel holidays became much more common, and the motel and [[tourism]] industries eagerly supported large-scale advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Popp, ''The Holiday Makers: Magazines, Advertising and Mass Tourism in Postwar America'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public service arena, the Ad Council aggressively promoted [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] as a [[Cold War]] strategy, with campaigns such as the Freedom Train, the Crusade for Freedom, Religion in American Life, Adams for Piece, and Peoples Capitalism.  The new Brand Names Foundation sponsored conferences, local campaigns, and educational programs to promote brand loyalty, as well as free enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Spring, ''Advertising in the Age of Persuasion: Building Brand America, 1941-1961'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Hidden Persuaders'' (1957) popular writer [[Vance Packard]] exposes the use of consumer [[motivational research]] and other psychological techniques, including depth psychology and [[subliminal message|subliminal]] tactics. They had been used to manipulate expectations and induce desire for products since the 1920s, but the popular audience was caught by surprise. He identified eight "compelling needs" that advertisers promise products will fulfill. According to Packard these needs are so strong that people are compelled to buy products to satisfy them. The book questions the [[morality]] of using these techniques.&lt;ref name=DiRenzo&gt;Gordon Di Renzo (1958) ''The American Catholic Sociological Review'', Vol. 19, No. 4 (Dec., 1958) (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial themes====
Before the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, black people were largely missing from mainstream white advertising. Those who did appear typically followed the long-standing "hierarchy of skin color" whereby those with lighter skin tones were seen as being more socially and culturally acceptable than dark-skinned black people.&lt;ref&gt;Julia M. Bristor, Renee Gravois Lee, and Michelle R. Hunt. "Race and ideology: African-American images in television advertising." ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'' (1995): 48-59. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30000378 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jannette Lake Dates and William Barlow, eds., ''Split image: African Americans in the mass media'' (Howard University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most national corporations before the 1960s ignored the black market, and paid little attention to working with black merchants or hiring blacks for responsible positions. [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]] was a major exception, as the number two brand fought for parity with [[Coca-Cola]].  The upstart soda brand hired black promoters who penetrated into black markets across the South and the urban North. Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s: 
:The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, "ladies groups," schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to give shout-outs for Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, "How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity." ''CHANGE'' 63 (2007): 1-26 [http://www.comlabgames.com/45-870N/instructor/01_day/How_Pepsi_Opened_Door_to_Diversity.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:New-York tribune., November 07, 1909, Page 20, Image 44 Aunt Jemima.jpg|right|thumb|Quaker Oats 1909 newspaper ad directed at white consumers with stereotypical images and dolls.]]

Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted  one-dimensional [[Aunt Jemima]]s and [[Uncle Ben's|Uncle Bens]] whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead it portrayed black customers as self-confident [[middle-class]] citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Capparell, ''The Real Pepsi Challenge: The Inspirational Story of Breaking the Color Barrier in American Business'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, more than a few token blacks were hired at advertising agencies, and the sensitivity to the problem increased.  The leading black  magazines [[Essence (magazine)|''Essence'']] and [[Jet (magazine)|''Jet'']] routinely deplored racism in mainstream media, especially in the negative depictions of black men and women. However ''Essence'' and ''Jet'' in the 21st century themselves ran about a dozen ads a year, especially for skin lighteners, that were pervaded with "racism and White supremacy."&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Hazell and Juanne Clarke, "Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines" ''Journal of Black Studies'' (2008) 39#1 pp 5-21. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40282545 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco====
By the 1950s, fears of [[cancer]] from tobacco [[smoking]] caused consternation in the [[tobacco industry]], which turned to advertisers for help in avoiding falling consumer [[demand]] and increased regulation. British and American agencies separately arrived at similar solutions.  The Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the United States and the Tobacco Manufacturers' Standing Committee in Britain each assuaged public anxieties and encouraged the misperception that the cigarette makers were resolving the issues through filters and low tar formulations. The public relations approach was successful in the short run, but the accumulation of medical evidence led to a fall in smoking, heavier taxation, and increased regulation. The agencies responded with sophisticated advertising strategies designed to encourage adolescent smokers as well as to recruit new smokers in [[developing countries|less-developed foreign markets]].&lt;ref&gt;David T. Courtwright,  "'Carry on Smoking': Public Relations and Advertising Strategies of American and British Tobacco Companies since 1950," ''Business History'' (2005) 47#3 pp 421-432.

===Cable television from the 1980s===
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly [[MTV]]. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in ''for'' the advertising message, rather than it being a [[by-product]] or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, [[specialty channel]]s emerged, including channels entirely [[Shopping channel|devoted to advertising]], such as [[QVC]], [[Home Shopping Network]], and [[ShopTV Canada]].

===On the Internet from the 1990s===
{{main article|Online advertising}}
With the advent of the [[ad server]], marketing through the Internet opened new frontiers for advertisers and contributed to the "[[dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from [[coupon]]s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, a number of websites, including the [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Google]], started a change in [[online advertising]] by emphasizing contextually relevant ads based on an individual's browsing interests. This has led to a plethora of similar efforts and an increasing trend of [[interactive advertising]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on [[Tram|streetcars]], and outdoor [[poster]]s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower – about 2.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm |title=Annual U.S. Advertising Expenditure Since 1919 |publisher=Galbithink.org |date=September 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090401205848/http://galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm| archivedate= April 1, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising business model has also been adapted since the 1990s.  In [[media for equity]], advertising is not sold, but provided to start-up companies in return for [[equity (finance)|equity]]. If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares.

Chinese advertising is moving heavily to the smartphone, leaving television behind. Companies in China are increasingly more focused on mobile advertisements than on television advertisements. Central roles are played by Chinese-based social networking sites Weixin (also known as WeChat), and Sina Weibo, and the efforts of Western companies, including Coca-Cola, Burberry, and North Face, to market to Chinese consumers through their smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Stevenson and Shanshan Wang. "A Jump to Mobile Ads in China." ''New York Times'', 22 Dec 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restrictions on advertising====
Since the 1950s, the industry itself, or the government, has imposed some restrictions on advertising certain types of products, especially liquor and cigarettes. Tobacco bans exist in many major countries across the world and cover 2.3 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, ''WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2013: enforcing bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship'' (World Health Organization, 2013) [http://www.who.int/tobacco/global_report/2013/en/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s Quebec banned some advertising directed at children. The restrictions have hindered competition in the breakfast cereal market when compared with the rest of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;C. Robert Clark, "Advertising Restrictions and Competition in the Children's Breakfast Cereal Industry," ''Journal of Law &amp; Economics'' (2007) 50#4 pp 757-780. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/519820 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 1900:  Europe==
[[File:Michelin Poster 1898.jpg|thumb|A poster by "[[Marius Rossillon|O'Galop]]" of [[Bibendum]], the Michelin Man, 1898]]
[[J. Walter Thompson]] became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Ciochetto, ''Globalisation and Advertising in Emerging Economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China'' (Routledge, 2013) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet]] (1906-1996) was the most prominent leader of French advertising in the 20th century. He founded [[Publicis]]. After 1945 his little-known Paris-based advertising agency grew rapidly, becoming the world's fourth largest agency. It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the advertising industry. It was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government, its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing industries.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Lorin, ''5 Giants of Advertising'' (Assouline Pub., 2001). pp 82-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark Hultquist, "Publicis and the French advertising world, 1946--1968" ''Essays in Economic &amp; Business History'' (2009) 27: 61-76&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether advertising reflects society or shapes society, can be seen in European models that diverged from the American style.  In France, [[Michelin]] dominated the tire industry and was one of the leading advertisers; to this day [[Michelin Guide|its famous guidebooks]] are very widely used by upscale travelers.  From 1894 to the present its symbol was [[Bibendum]] (the "Michelin Man" made of tires). He was a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic expounder of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America's superior factory system, but to patriotically avoid using the "inferior" products of those factories.  As automobiles diffused to the middle classes, Michelin advertising likewise shifted downscale, and its restaurant and hotel guides covered a broader range of price categories.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Harp, ''Marketing Michelin. Advertising and Cultural Identity in Twentieth-Century France'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Martin,  "Le marché publicitaire Français et les grands médias 1918-1970." ''Vingtieme siecle. Revue d'histoire'' (1988): 75-90. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/xxs_0294-1759_1988_num_20_1_2796 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

J Walter Thompson expanded successfully in many countries, but France was not one of them.  French businessmen did not like the American tone, and were fearful of Americanization. The French market was heavily regulated and protected to repel foreign interests, and the American admen in Paris were not good at hiding their condescension and insensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Eric Hultquist,  "Americans in Paris: The J. Walter Thompson Company in France, 1927–1968." ''Enterprise and Society'' 4#03 (2003): 471-501.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
As millions of American soldiers passed through  Britain during the Second World War, there were fearsof an "Americanization" of British commerce and culture. The Marshall Plan explicitly required and upgrading of the marketing and organizational skills of British industry. There were fears among the leaders of the  London advertising world of what the brash, rich Americans would do to them.    Radio and television was off limits to advertising, because BBC relied on fees paid by owners of radio receivers.  The question was whether the heavily funded American methods would prove irresistible. JWT London was an American owned  advertising agency controlled by J. Walter Thompson in New York City.   JWT London avoided being  the bold apostle of the American style. Instead  it is relied on soft persuasion, shedding its Americanness to adapt to the British understated style.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Nixon,  "Apostles of Americanization? J. Walter Thompson Company Ltd, Advertising and Anglo-American Relations 1945-67," ''Contemporary British History'' (2008) 22#4 pp 477-499.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the 1920s, most advertising was handled by manufacturing companies in-house. Numerous small advertising agencies handled purchase of space in the media, but did not design campaigns or the ads themselves. An important role was played by travelling salesmen in promoting products to wholesalers and retailers and providing feedback from the market to the producer.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela E. Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika: Advertising and Commercial Culture in Nazi Germany'' (2014) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nazi era (1933–45), the advertising industry expelled its Jews, and came under the supervision of the "Ad Council for the German Economy," a department of the propaganda ministry of [[Joseph Goebbels]]. The relationship was friendly, For the industry learned a great deal from the Nazi propaganda techniques. The industry promoted Hitler's favorite products, such as the promised Volkswagen automobile for the people, and the construction of autobahns. It emphasized the availability of trusted brands despite growing shortages after the war began in 1939. It helped support the regime, articulating a vision of consumption that was well aligned with the Nazi spirit. In some environments and social movements, such as with post-WW2 East Germany Stasi's [[zersetzung]], criminology theorists estimated advertisement was used as a means to crime, the nature of the crime was the intentional exploitation of an individual to cause damage to the individual's ability to form social bonds and appropriate perceptions of the world. This is especially true in the case of manipulation, people take advantage of their underdeveloped social skills and exploit them for selfish gain, this was later criticized to be adopted by turpitude agents of modern advertising. Many major brands were off the market by 1944, because of severe shortages. When they returned after the war, they were welcomed as an index of normality and were not associated with Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Swett, ''Selling under the Swastika'' (2014) ch 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, German advertising agencies were starting to mimic American methods.&lt;ref&gt;Harm G. Schröter, "Die Amerikanisierung der Werbung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland," ["The Americanization of advertising in West Germany."] ''Jahrbuch für Wirtschaftsgeschichte'' (1997), Issue 1, pp 93-115, dates the Americanization to the 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt;  Coca-Cola was advising  "Mach mal Pause" ("Take a Rest!), and conservative Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was running for reelection with the slogan "Keine Experimente!" ("No Experiments!").&lt;ref&gt;Gries, Rainer et al. "Die Ära Adenauer: Zeitgeschichte im Werbeslogan. 'Mach Mal Pause,' 'Keine Experimente!'" ''Journal Geschichte'' (1989)  Issue 3, pp 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The German agencies have always remained small and limited in scope,&lt;ref&gt;"German agencies often overlooked on global scene." ''Marketing News'' (Aug 29, 1986) v. 20 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; even after the unification of East Germany and West Germany in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Cote and Dagmar Mussey, "German advertising growing together: unification of Germany, EC electrify market," ''Advertising Age'' (Feb. 11 1991), V. 62, pp 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; After unification, Germany became the third largest ad market in the world, with $18 billion in total ad spending in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''Advertising Age'' (March 21, 1994) v. 65 p. I-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The American influence became strong in Italy after 1945.  The high risk of communist success led the American government to invest heavily in propaganda activities.&lt;ref&gt;Simona Tobia. ''Advertising America: The United States Information Service in Italy (1945–1956)'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several American firms opened offices, including Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. Italian graphic designers, most prominently [[Armando Testa]], were inspired by modernist aesthetics and thinking brought in by the American advertising agencies and techniques in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Simona De Iulio,  and Carlo Vinti, "La publicité italienne et le modèle américain: le débat entre les artistes et techniciens, 1948-1960," [Italian advertising and the American model: the debate between artists and technicians, 1948-60] ''Vingtième Siecle'' (2009), Issue 101, pp 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The advertising industry helped transform Italy into a consumer-oriented society.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Arvidsson, "Pubblicita E Consumi Nell'Italia Del Dopoguerra" [Advertising and consumerism in postwar Italy] ''Contemporanea: Rivista di Storia dell '800 e del '900'' (2001) 4#4 pp 649-672.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Oliviero Toscani International Journalism Festival 3.jpg|thumb|200px|Oliviero Toscani]]

A dramatic example of how advertising nudged the Italian middle-class into modern consumer society appears in the heavily advertised automatic washing machine. It appeared on the Italian market in 1958 and by 1965, 23% of families had purchased one, reaching 42% by 1970. Advertisers hailed the  mechanization of domestic tedium as the advent of a new women's "liberation."  Commentary appeared everywhere, from advertisements to the specialized press, to women's reviews. Architects and designers made room for the new marvel, as the promotional language celebrating the device became a chorus of praise for domestic appliances as the secret of  "progress" and "freedom" and "liberation."  On the other hand, husbands still insisted on driving the family automobile; it was off-limits to the liberated female.&lt;ref&gt;Enrica Asquer, "La Signora Candy e la sua lavatrice: storia di un'intesa perfetta nell'Italia degli anni Sessanta." [Mrs. Candy and her washing machine: a perfect love story in 1960s Italy] ''Genesis'' 1 (2006) pp: 1000-1022.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Armando Testa Set up a full-service advertising agency in 1956, specializing in the new medium of television advertising.  He was inspired by Eastern European animation techniques, and often use simple graphics like the blue hippo. His son Marco Testa, trained at Benton &amp; Bowles in New York, and maintained the fast-paced, witty style.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 138-43&lt;/ref&gt; Emmanuelle Pirella, who trained at the Italian offices of Young &amp; Rubicon and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, emerged as a leading copywriter.

[[Benetton Group|Benetton]] gained worldwide attention for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director [[Oliviero Toscani]]. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign "United Colors of Benetton" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.&lt;ref&gt;Tungate, ''Adland: A Global History of Advertising'' pp 146-49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Since 1900: Asia and Africa==

===Japan===
[[Dentsu]] is the dominant firm in Japan thanks to its origins as a media representative. It produced Japan's first newspaper advertisements as well as the first television commercials. It was established in 1901 as Japan Advertising Ltd. and Telegraphic Service Co. by Hoshiro Mitsunaga. In 1936, it sold off its news division to Doumei News Agency, to focus on advertising. In 1946, it purchased 16 small companies and set up operational bases in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kyūshū. Dentsu company now offers a range of services, from traditional and creative marketing to specialty disciplines such as sports marketing, investing in feature film production and acquiring broadcasting rights, PR, digital contents, and a growing range of communications services.&lt;ref&gt;Kotaro Sugiyama and Tim Andree. ''The Dentsu Way: Secrets of Cross Switch Marketing from the World's Most Innovative Advertising Agency'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In the first 20 years of communist control of China (1947 to 1966) Mao Zedong tried to reverse the long-standing advertising practices of Chinese newspapers, considering it a capitalist infringement on the goals of socialism. Consumerism, which had been highly developed in Shanghai, was anathema, to Mao's peasant-based communist perspective. The regime emphasized maximum production rather than optimal consumption. The approach worsened the massive famines that happened when national resources were devoted to a highly inefficient factory production at the cost of basic food output. On the other hand, propaganda was highly developed art in the Communist Party, and so a sort of  compromise was reached. Socialist-oriented advertising emphasized the collective good, rather than the benefits of products for the individual consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Gerth, "Compromising with Consumerism in Socialist China: Transnational Flows and Internal Tensions in 'Socialist Advertising'", ''Past &amp; Present'' (2013 Supplement)  pp 203-232  [http://karl-gerth.pubs-hub.ucsd.edu/mm_uploads/gerth-past-y-present-2013.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, the strength of the private economy, and advertising, has grown dramatically.  By the 1980s much emphasis was placed on the role of advertising in promoting [[Chinese economic reform|the Four Modernizations]] emphasized by [[Deng Xiaoping]].  Lip service is still paid to old Maoist ideals by recycling images of historic places and episodes, but it does not inhibit the growth of consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;Xin Zhao and Russell W. Belk, "Politicizing Consumer Culture: Advertising's Appropriation of Political Ideology in China's Social Transition," ''Journal of Consumer Research'' (2008) 35#2 pp 231-244&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, its advertising industry has fundamentally changed. It has become the world's fastest-growing advertising market and the country with the largest pool of netizens.  Major changes have come in terms of shifting cultural values, the growing role of brand names,  the attractiveness of English-language titles to the younger generation,  the redefinition of  acceptable/offensive advertising,  the very rapid growth of new media (especially the Internet and smart phones),  the emergence of on-line shopping in a country with an underdeveloped system of department stores in shopping centers, and much more advanced techniques of managing advertising agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Kineta Hung, et al.  "Advertising Research in the Post-WTO Decade in China," ''Journal of Advertising'' (2012) 41#3 pp 121-146&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Many elements of Indian culture and industry have British roots, so that British advertising models usually work well. In 1991, the government dramatically liberalized Indian economy, opening it to international business. The emergence of a moderately affluent middle-class numbering in the hundreds of millions attracts multinational corporations and international advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;William M. O'Barr, "Advertising in India." ''Advertising &amp; Society Review'' 9#.3 (2008) pp: 1-33. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/advertising_and_society_review/v009/9.3.o-barr.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aruna Chandra, David A. Griffith, and John K. Ryans, "Advertising standardisation in India: US multinational experience" ''International Journal of Advertising'' (2002) 21#1 pp47-66&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising in India operates at two levels. Ads for high-value products appear in English-language papers such as ''The Hindu'' and ''The Madras Mail,'' which targeted Europeans and high-status Indians. By contrast, ads for low-value products are typically placed in vernacular papers and are aimed at a lower middle class with highly restricted spending power. The working class and peasant populations, with very low disposable incomes, are seldom targeted by the advertising agencies. Local merchants might use signs and posters to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Haynes, "Advertising and the History of South Asia, 1880–1950" p 363&lt;/ref&gt;  Cricket is one sport where the Indians have had an international success, so that cricket stars are prominent endorsers in national advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Sharma, "Indian cricket players are becoming big winners for many advertisers," ''Asian Wall Street Journal'' (May 11, 1998) p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtle cultural norms can be easily transgressed. In 2002, widespread protests forced Hindustan Lever Ltd. (the Indian subsidiary of London-based Unilever) to cancel  a television ad campaign for its fairness cream because of its portrayal of women. The campaign was built around the theme of a father lamenting "If only I had a son" while showing his problem: a dark-skinned, unattractive daughter.  Fast-forward.  She uses the Fair &amp; Lovely cream and has become a gorgeous light-skinned beauty.  Clad in a stylish miniskirt, she is a successful airline flight attendant and takes her proud father to dine at a five-star hotel.  The All India Women's Democratic Association ([[AIDWA]]), a far left political organization, lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi. It argued endorsing the traditional preference for sons strengthens gender discrimination, which is a major problem in India. Furthermore, said AIDWA, the ad perpetuated a culture of discrimination in a society where "fair skin" is synonymous with "beautiful."  The government's Ministry of Information and Broadcast sided with AIDWA and directed stations not to air the ads because they violated the Cable and Television Networks Act of 1995 which states that no advertisement shall be permitted which "derides any race, caste, color, creed and nationality" and furthermore states that, "Women must not be portrayed in a manner that emphasizes passive, submissive qualities and encourages them to play a subordinate secondary role in the family and society."  The minister told Parliament that if broadcasters do not regulate ad content the government will be forced to do so. The Mumbai-based Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a body of advertisers and media agencies, insisted that it should do the regulating not the government. ASCI had already told Hindustan Lever that its ad campaign was offensive and it was ended.&lt;ref&gt;Arundhati Parmar, "Objections to Indian ad not taken lightly" ''Marketing News'' (June 9, 2003) 37#12 pp 4-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing world===
During the decolonization era from the late 1940s to the 1970s, British and French firms operating  in Africa and Asia at first largely ignored local, nationalistic aspirations.  However they learned to  adjust to exploit  the new spirit of independence that was shaping consumer attitudes.  The new emergence of a middle class was the target audience.  Their advertising abandoned the traditional  paternalistic attitude toward the natives. Instead there was a portrayal of locals as up-and-coming middle class men  in control of developing their nations. These more positive images assisted business operations  during spells of military dictatorship, economic nationalism, and expropriation of foreign assets.&lt;ref&gt;Sephanie Decker, "Corporate Legitimacy and Advertising: British Companies and the Rhetoric of Development in West Africa, 1950-1970," ''Business History Review'' (2007) 81#1 pp 59-86&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco advertising was especially important. For example, in Egyptian popular culture the cigar was associated with elites, the water pipe with a lower-class and traditional lifestyle, and the cigarette with the new middle class which was striving to make the transition to modernity.  It was the third group that the cigarette industry targeted.&lt;ref&gt;Relli Shechter, "Reading advertisements in a colonial/development context: Cigarette advertising and identity politics in Egypt, c1919-1939." ''Journal of social history'' 39#2 (2005): 483-503. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3790779 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is the largest country in Latin America, and number five in the world in terms of population. Its economy grew rapidly in the 21st century, until it began to stall in 2010. At that time it was the world's sixth-biggest advertising market, at $US 14.2 billion.  Brazil in 2010 ranks #1 in deodorants, #2 in children's products, #3 in cosmetics, and #4 in automobile sales&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Wentz and Claudia Penteado, "Why so many agencies are storming road to Sao Paulo" ''Advertising Age'' (Dec. 6 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
The start in 1994 of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] had a dramatic impact on the adveritising industry in Mexico, with its 130 full service agencies and 270 smaller operations under the auspisces of the Mexican Association of Advertising Agencies.  The flood of American brand-name products greatly expanded the scope of the advertising industry, and the Mexican agencies faced new competition from branch offices of international firms.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McCurry, "Advertising in transition: agencies change their image to meet market demand" ''Business Mexico'' (Sept. 1992) 2#4, Vol. 2, p4+&lt;/ref&gt;

A key to the new market was that upscale consumers in Mexico typically display [[Malinchism|"malinchismo"]], which is a preference for imported American brands rather than local Mexican brands. As a result, American products are sold mostly to the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts instead on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising battles in Mexico, include not only issues of quality, but issues of national authenticity. For example, in Mexico in the 1990s, two American exporters Procter &amp; Gamble and Frito-Lay fought an advertising battle concerning whose potato chips are tastier, more natural, and more Mexican. Procter &amp; Gamble challenged Frito-Lay's Sabritas which controls 80 percent of the $1 billion chip market.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Friedland, "P&amp;G, Frito-Lay in Mexican—ad standoff," ''Wall Street Journal'' (March 19, 1999).

The '''Inter-Services Public Relations''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|بین الخدماتی تعلقات عامہ}}}}; [[Reporting mark|Reporting name:]]'''ISPR'''), is the media wing of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] which broadcasts and coordinates military news and information to the country's [[Media of Pakistan|civilian media]] and the [[Pakistani society|civic society]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adache, PhD|first1=Col. John|title=The Military and Public Relations|date=2014|publisher=AuthorHouse Publications|location=Bloomington, Indiana [US]|isbn=1496982363|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BMQBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT58&amp;dq=inter+services+public+relations+pakistan+army&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F-5qVIKVM5GZjALxv4CoBA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=inter%20services%20public%20relations%20pakistan%20army&amp;f=true|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISPR directorate serves the purpose of aiming to strengthen [[Public Relations Officer|public relations]] with the [[Pakistani society|civic society]], through interacting with the media.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The directorate also works as the principle voice of the Pakistan's [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]], with its [[director-general]] serving as the official spokesperson of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; In addition, the ISPR provides funds, productions, and assists with the military-produced public relations media– both military [[Pakistani dramas|dramas]] and the [[Pakistan film industry|war films]].&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=WebDesk|title=Short film 'Defender' wins award at international defence film festival|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/791718/short-film-defender-wins-award-at-rome-film-festival/|accessdate=30 November 2017|publisher=The Express Tribune (newspaper)|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The Directorate of the Inter–Services Public Relations (ISPR) was established in 1949 with [[Pakistan Army|army]] [[colonel]] Shahbaz Khan becoming its first director-general.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The ISPR operates as a unified public relations system for the Pakistan's [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]], which combined [[Pakistan Army|army]], [[Pakistan Air Force|air force]], [[Pakistan Navy|navy]], and [[Pakistan Marines|marines]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The ISPR manage the public relations requirement of the armed forces, and is staff with the combined personnel of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]] along with civilian officers.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; It functions at the [[Joint Staff Headquarters (Pakistan)|Joint Staff Headquarters]] (JS HQ) and plays an important role for gathering a national support for the [[Pakistani military|armed forces]] at the public level.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt; The ISPR also strengthened support for the [[Pakistani military|military]]'s assigned contingency operations while undermining the will of the adversary.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

In views of [[United States Army|US army]] colonel John Adache, the ISPR interfaces between the [[Pakistan armed forces|armed forces]], [[Media of Pakistan|civil media]], and the [[Pakistani society|civic society]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;  Furthermore, the ISPR also formulates the media policy of the unified [[Pakistan armed forces|armed forces]], safeguards the military interests of the [[Pakistan armed forces|armed forces]] from negative influence, and monitors international and domestic media reporting regarding its military issues.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

On regular basis, the ISPR broadcasts the televised news regarding the strategic arsenals testings, contingency operations and [[military exercise]]s— both at foreign and domestic areas. In [[Military of Pakistan|Pakistan's military]] staff appointments and assignments, the ISPR is one of the most prestigious directorate of [[Pakistan Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

Its executive authority, a [[director-general]], is a chief military spokesperson of the Pakistan Armed Forces who reports to [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (Pakistan)|Chairman]] of [[Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, Pakistan|Joint Chiefs of Staff Secretariat]]; [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] as well the head also directly report to [[Chief of Air Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Air Staff]], [[Commandant]] of [[Pakistan Marines|Marines]], and the [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Naval Staff]].&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse Publications"/&gt;

==Operations==
The ISPR directorate is staffed with combined personnel of Pakistan's unified [[Pakistan Defence Forces|military]] along with civilian [[Central Superior Services of Pakistan|bureaucrats]] and officials.&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff |title=The ISPR |url=https://lib.vcomsats.edu.pk/library/MPA517/MPA517%20PPT/Lecture_30/Lecture-30.pptx |publisher=Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint) |accessdate=18 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISPR functioned at the [[JS HQ (Pakistan)|JS HQ]] and responsible for garnering national support for the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]] as well as strengthen their resolve to accomplish the assigned mission while undermining the will of the adversary.

It also acts as an interface between the armed forces, the media and the public.&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint)"/&gt; It formulates much of the media policy of Pakistan's military, safeguards the armed forces from negative influences and monitors both international and domestic media.

It is likely that the army is planning the further expansion of ISPR to counter negative propaganda against the state and armed forces by international powers and their funded domestic media campaigns, in ongoing operation against terror outfits and economic terrorism.
That's why, for the first time in its history ISPR was being led by a three-star general,
Lt-General Asim Saleem Bajwa.&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan -(PowerPoint)-"&gt; {{cite web|last1=staff |title=Bajwa, three others promoted to Lt Gen rank |url=https://www.samaa.tv/news/2015/09/bajwa-three-others-promoted-to-lt-gen/ |publisher=Samaa News |accessdate=22 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal media network==

On regular basis, the ISPR release televised press releases on regarding the ongoing [[military exercises]], and notified the [[Media of Pakistan|civilian media]] about the ingenious strategic arsenal testings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISPR Press Release on testings|url=https://www.ispr.gov.pk/front/main.asp?o=t-press_release&amp;id=2707#pr_link2707|publisher=ISPR Press Release|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISPR Press Release, timeline"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DG ISPR|title=ISPR Press release|url=https://www.ispr.gov.pk/front/main.asp?o=t-pr_archive&amp;mon=10&amp;yr=2014&amp;styr=2013|publisher=ISPR Press Release, timeline|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from functioning as the public relations body of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]], the ISPR handles exclusive dissemination of information regarding Pakistan's ongoing military [[War in North-West Pakistan|contingency operations]].&lt;ref name="Govt. of Pakistan (PowerPoint)" /&gt;

== Controversies ==
In recent years, there have been accusations of ISPR going beyond its domain and meddling in media affairs to undermine democracy. Concerns have been raised on ISPR handling media channels (Bol TV, Pak TV et al.), radio stations (FM 89.04, FM 96.00 ) and several media personalities such as Dr Shahid Masood, Arshad Sharif, Sami Ibrahim, Dr Aamir Liaqat etc. to indoctrinate pro-military narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/how-many-radio-stations-journalists-work-for-you-asma-jahangir-asks-ispr/|title=How many radio stations, journalists work for you? Asma Jahangir asks ISPR|work=Daily Pakistan Global|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISPR has regularly been criticized for posting inflammatory tweets on their official Twitter account. In April 2017, Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor (a BPS-21 officer) posted a tweet 'rejecting' Prime Minister's directives to probe Dawn Leaks controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1396876/pakistan-army-rejects-govt-notification-dawn-leaks/|title=Army rejects PM Office statement on Dawn Leaks report - The Express Tribune|date=2017-04-29|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After huge public outcry over the choice of words, ISPR had to redact its earlier tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1332244|title=Army withdraws tweet 'rejecting' PM Office's directives on Dawn story probe|last=Dawn.com|date=2017-05-10|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, during Allama Khadim Rizvi's Islamabad sit-in a tweet was posted attributing COAS's appeal to 'both sides' to exercise restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2017/11/coas-telephones-pm-suggests-handle-islamabad-dharna-situation-peacefully/|title=COAS suggests PM to handle Islamabad dharna situation peacefully|website=www.samaa.tv|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely decried for equating people's elected government against a mob, further strengthening the belief that Army was behind the sit-ins to arm-twist government.

==Media production==

Since the 1990s, the ISPR has been [[Director (film)|directing]], [[Film producer|producing]], assisting in [[Film writer|writings]], and funding the miniseries, drama, and films on military fiction. Some of its highly acclaimed works include: [[Alpha Bravo Charlie]]— a television series on [[Pakistan Army]] directed by [[Shoaib Mansoor]] in 1990

*[[Shahpar]]— a television drama on [[Pakistan Air Force]] funded by ISPR and broadcast at [[ARY Digital]]
*[[PNS Ghazi (Shaheed)]]— a [[thriller drama]] based on [[Pakistan Navy]] broadcast at [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]]
* [[Waar]]
*[[The Glorious Resolve]]
* ''Sunehre Din''
* ''Wilco''

* "Zinda"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12437">'''Intrusion detection system evasion techniques''' are modifications made to attacks in order to prevent detection by an [[intrusion detection system]] (IDS). Almost all published evasion techniques modify network attacks. The 1998 paper ''Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding Network Intrusion Detection'' popularized IDS evasion, and discussed both evasion techniques and areas where the correct interpretation was ambiguous depending on the targeted computer system. The 'fragroute' and 'fragrouter' programs implement evasion techniques discussed in the paper. Many web vulnerability scanners, such as 'Nikto', 'whisker' and 'Sandcat', also incorporate IDS evasion techniques.

Most IDSs have been modified to detect or even reverse basic evasion techniques, but IDS evasion (and countering IDS evasion) are still active fields.

==Payload obfuscation==
An IDS can be evaded by obfuscating or encoding the attack payload in a way that the target computer will reverse but the IDS will not. In this way, an attacker can exploit the end host without alerting the IDS.

=== Encoding and encryption ===
Application layer protocols like [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] allow for multiple encodings of data which are interpreted as the same value. For example, the string "cgi-bin" in a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] can be encoded as "%63%67%69%2d%62%69%6e" (i.e., in hexadecimal).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Tsung-Huan|last2=Lin|first2=Ying-Dar|last3=Lai|first3=Yuan-Cheng|last4=Lin|first4=Po-Ching|title=Evasion Techniques: Sneaking through Your Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems|journal=IEEE Communications Surveys &amp; Tutorials|volume=14|issue=4|pages=1011–1020|doi=10.1109/surv.2011.092311.00082}}&lt;/ref&gt; A web server will view these as the same string and act on them accordingly. An IDS must be aware of all of the possible encodings that its end hosts accept in order to match network traffic to known-malicious signatures.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corona|first=Igino|last2=Giacinto|first2=Giorgio|last3=Roli|first3=Fabio|title=Adversarial attacks against intrusion detection systems: Taxonomy, solutions and open issues|journal=Information Sciences|volume=239|pages=201–225|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2013.03.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attacks on encrypted protocols such as [[HTTPS]] cannot be read by an IDS unless the IDS has a copy of the private key used by the server to encrypt the communication.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ptacek|first=Thomas H.|last2=Newsham|first2=Timothy N.|date=1998-01-01|title=Insertion, evasion, and denial of service: Eluding network intrusion detection|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.119.399&amp;rank=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDS won't be able to match the encrypted traffic to signatures if it doesn't account for this.

=== Polymorphism ===
Signature-based IDS often look for common attack patterns to match malicious traffic to signatures. To detect [[buffer overflow]] attacks, an IDS might look for the evidence of [[NOP slide]]s which are used to weaken the protection of [[address space layout randomization]].&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaboya|first=D. J.|last2=Raines|first2=R. A.|last3=Baldwin|first3=R. O.|last4=Mullins|first4=B. E.|date=2006-11-01|title=Network Intrusion Detection: Automated and Manual Methods Prone to Attack and Evasion|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4042655|journal=IEEE Security Privacy|volume=4|issue=6|pages=36–43|doi=10.1109/MSP.2006.159|issn=1540-7993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obfuscate their attacks, attackers can use [[Polymorphic code|polymorphic shellcode]] to create unique attack patterns. This technique typically involves encoding the payload in some fashion (e.g., XOR-ing each byte with 0x95), then placing a decoder in front of the payload before sending it. When the target executes the code, it runs the decoder which rewrites the payload into its original form which the target then executes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Polymorphic attacks don't have a single detectable signature, making them very difficult for signature-based IDS, and even some anomaly-based IDS, to detect.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; [[Shikata ga nai]] ("it cannot be helped") is a popular polymorphic encoder in the [[Metasploit Project|Metasploit]] framework used to convert malicious [[shellcode]] into difficult-to-detect polymorphic shellcode using XOR additive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/encoder/x86/shikata_ga_nai|title=Polymorphic XOR Additive Feedback Encoder|work=rapid7.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insertion and evasion ==
Attackers can evade IDS by crafting packets in such a way that the end host interprets the attack payload correctly while the IDS either interprets the attack incorrectly or determines that the traffic is benign too quickly.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

=== Fragmentation and small packets ===
One basic technique is to split the attack payload into multiple small packets, so that the IDS must reassemble the packet stream to detect the attack. A simple way of splitting packets is by [[IP fragmentation|fragmenting]] them, but an [[Adversary (cryptography)|adversary]] can also simply craft packets with small payloads.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The 'whisker' evasion tool calls crafting packets with small payloads 'session splicing'.

By itself, small packets will not evade any IDS that reassembles packet streams. However, small packets can be further modified in order to complicate reassembly and detection. One evasion technique is to pause between sending parts of the attack, hoping that the IDS will time out before the target computer does. A second evasion technique is to send the packets out of order, confusing simple packet re-assemblers but not the target computer.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Overlapping fragments and TCP segments ===
Another evasion technique is to craft a series of packets with [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP sequence numbers]] configured to overlap. For example, the first packet will include 80 bytes of payload but the second packet's sequence number will be 76 bytes after the start of the first packet. When the target computer reassembles the TCP stream, they must decide how to handle the four overlapping bytes.  Some operating systems will take the older data, and some will take the newer data.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; If the IDS doesn't reassemble the TCP in the same way as the target, it can be manipulated into either missing a portion of the attack payload or seeing benign data inserted into the malicious payload, breaking the attack signature.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; This technique can also be used with IP fragmentation in a similar manner.

=== Protocol ambiguities ===
Some IDS evasion techniques involve deliberately manipulating [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[Internet Protocol|IP]] protocols in a way the target computer will handle differently from the IDS. For example, the TCP urgent pointer is handled differently on different operating systems. If the IDS doesn't handle these protocol violations in a manner consistent with its end hosts, it is vulnerable to insertion and evasion techniques similar to those mentioned earlier.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

=== Low-bandwidth attacks ===
Attacks which are spread out across a long period of time or a large number of source IPs, such as [[Nmap|nmap's]] slow scan, can be difficult to pick out of the background of benign traffic. An online [[Password cracking|password cracker]] which tests one password for each user every day will look nearly identical to a normal user who mistyped their password.

== Denial of service ==
Due to the fact that passive IDS are inherently [[fail-open]] (as opposed to [[fail-closed]]), launching a [[denial-of-service attack]] against the IDS on a network is a feasible method of circumventing its protection.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; An adversary can accomplish this by exploiting a bug in the IDS, consuming all of the computational resources on the IDS, or deliberately triggering a large number of alerts to disguise the actual attack.

=== CPU exhaustion ===
Packets captured by an IDS are stored in a kernel buffer until the CPU is ready to process them. If the CPU is under high load, it can't process the packets quickly enough and this buffer fills up. New (and possibly malicious) packets are then dropped because the buffer is full.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

An attacker can exhaust the IDS's CPU resources in a number of ways. For example, signature-based intrusion detection systems use pattern matching algorithms to match incoming packets against signatures of known attacks. Naturally, some signatures are more computational expensive to match against than others. Exploiting this fact, an attacker can send specially-crafted network traffic to force the IDS to use the maximum amount of CPU time as possible to run its pattern matching algorithm on the traffic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This [[algorithmic complexity attack]] can overwhelm the IDS with a relatively small amount of bandwidth.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

An IDS that also monitors encrypted traffic can spend a large portion of its CPU resources on decrypting incoming data.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

=== Memory exhaustion ===
In order to match certain signatures, an IDS is required to keep [[State (computer science)|state]] related to the connections it is monitoring. For example, an IDS must maintain "TCP control blocks" (TCBs), chunks of memory which track information such as sequence numbers, window sizes, and connection states (ESTABLISHED, RELATED, CLOSED, etc.), for each TCP connection monitored by the IDS.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Once all of the IDS's [[random-access memory]] (RAM) is consumed, it is forced to utilized [[virtual memory]] on the [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] which is much slower than RAM, leading to performance problems and dropped packets similar to the effects of CPU exhaustion.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

If the IDS doesn't [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collect]] TCBs correctly and efficiently, an attacker can exhaust the IDS's memory by starting a large number of TCP connections very quickly.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Similar attacks can be made by fragmenting a large number of packets into a larger number of smaller packets, or send a large number of out-of-order TCP segments.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

===Operator fatigue===
Alerts generated by an IDS have to be acted upon in order for  them to have any value. An attacker can reduce the "availability" of an IDS by overwhelming the human operator with an inordinate number of alerts by sending large amounts of "malicious" traffic intended to generate alerts on the IDS. The attacker can then perform the actual attack using the alert noise as cover. The tools 'stick' and 'snot' were designed for this purpose. They generate a large number of IDS alerts by sending attack signatures across the network, but will not trigger alerts in IDS that maintain application protocol context.

'''Legal cultures''' are described as being temporary outcomes of interactions and occur pursuant to a challenge and response [[paradigm]]. Analyses of core legal paradigms shape the characteristics of individual and distinctive legal cultures.
“Comparative legal cultures are examined by a field of scholarship, which is situated at the line bordering [[comparative law]] and historical [[jurisprudence]].” &lt;ref&gt;Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) p. xix.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal cultures can be examined by reference to fundamentally different legal systems. However, such cultures can also be differentiated between systems with a shared history and basis which are now otherwise influenced by factors that encourage cultural change. Students learn about legal culture in order to better understand how the law works in society. This can be seen as the study of Law and Society.

[[Western legal culture]] is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include [[corporations]], [[contracts]], [[Estate (law)|estates]], rights and powers. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"&gt;J.C. Smith (1968) ‘The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law’ The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on [[language]] and [[symbols]] and any attempt to analyze non-western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"/&gt;  So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group’s culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level.

Traditional law in Africa is based on natural justice and lacks abstract concepts. This is characteristic of cultures that have an absence of written language which is necessary to elaborate concepts into theory.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"&gt;Max Gluckman (1964) ‘Natural Justice in Africa’ Natural Law Forum vol: 9 (pp. 25-44) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrines of traditional [[African law]] are based on social considerations whereby parties to disputes seek not declarations of right or wrong but rather they seek restitution of social relationships.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The trier of fact and law adjudicates between closely related people from communities as opposed to strangers in commerce. Judgments stress the importance of living together in generous, loving kindness, mutual helpfulness and reciprocity. Evidence suggests that ‘African law demonstrates that all men, because they live in society, have some theory of rules of justice which they believe arise from reason itself; [and Gluckman’s evidence] suggests that Africans may well have formulated, in embryonic form at least, a theory of natural justice coming from human kindness itself.’ &lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The [[Sharia|Islamic legal system]] exemplifies law as part of a larger culture where the concepts of knowledge, right and human nature play a central role. A case study by [[Lawrence Rosen (anthropologist)|Lawrence Rosen]] explains the anthropological, procedural and [[judicial discretion]] aspects of bringing a case to court in [[Sefrou]], [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"&gt;Lawrence Rosen (1989) The Anthropology of Justice: Law as Culture in Islamic Society (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge).&lt;/ref&gt;  The case study makes explicit those fundamentals in Islamic society that shape Islamic legal culture and differentiate this from western legal cultures.

Rigid procedural rules and strict court room decorum or etiquette which is entrenched in western legal cultures clears the way for a more natural process of dispute resolution.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  In Morocco, close attention is paid to social origins, connections and identity where these concepts influence a [[qadi]]’s (judge) judicial interrogation and discretion.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

While the systems of law found in the western world consist of conceptualisation and implementation that mimic the extrajudicial world only slightly, in the Islamic courts of Morocco, the culture of law being propounded reflects the overall culture of its people.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  This is attributable to the goals of law in Islamic society, which is not to hold state or religious power as supreme or to develop an exacting body of legal doctrine, but to restore relationships and then facilitate the resolution of disputes independently of rigid [[precedent]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

== Western comparisons ==
The traditional focus between [[common law]] culture and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] culture has been highlighted by court room procedure, whereby the former nurtures an [[adversarial]] environment and the latter an [[inquisitorial]] one. Indeed no system of court procedure can ever be purely adversarial or purely inquisitorial.

In fact [[France]], which subscribes to a civil legal system, historically gave the [[judge]] a passive role and left the parties to engage in an accusatorial manner.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Jolowicz ‘Civil Procedure and the Common and Civil Law’ (pp. 55-78) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless the common law culture predominately consists of oral arguments where legal representors steer the case in search of [[justice]] and reinforcement of rights.

The use of a [[Jury]] in the common law as a judge of fact is unique when compared to civil law systems. The Jury are triers of fact in both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases and this reflects a particular culture of law; namely the direct involvement of society in the [[legal framework]]. In France a judge’s role as trier of law and fact is merely as an administrator without creating binding [[legal principle]]. Hence the civil law culture is more rational, orderly, authoritative and [[paternalistic]].

Common law has a culture of judicial inventiveness and even flexibility. Enunciation of principle is not forever paramount but indeed a continuing flow of cases and statutes add to the ebb and flow of the law, whereby ‘case law represented the modern man’s realisation of his own limitations.’ &lt;ref&gt;A. G. Chloros (1978) ‘Common Law, Civil Law and Socialist Law: Three Leading Systems of the World, Three Kinds of Legal Thought’ The Cambridge Law Review (pp. 11-26) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) at 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Further differences include where a civilian [[lawyer]] speaks in terms of the law of nature while the common lawyer speaks to reason. It follows that the culture of these legal systems has been moulded by perceptions of justice and the means available to attain it.

== Common law comparisons ==
Legal culture can differ between countries despite their conformity to a similar if not identical legal system. Both the [[United States]] and [[England]] possess common law systems of law and yet each country embodies a distinctive legal culture. This has been attributable by contrasting both the institutions within the legal system and characteristics of the profession ([[judge]]s, [[barristers]] and [[solicitors]]).&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard A. Posner|Posner]]&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; during 1996 there was about 15 times more American judges than English judges but only about 10 times more American lawyers than English lawyers. Posner suggests that English judges have more prestige than American judges and a related point is that the ratio of judges to lawyers is lower in England than the United States.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; The consequence of this is that the English common law system, as opposed to the American legal system, displays a legal culture of greater prestige and [[elitism]] not only in the judiciary but also those who are candidates for the [[judiciary]].

In England, and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, barristers are apt candidates for judicial nomination. The reasons for this stem from the common law systems which have a culture to encourage, harness and capture high quality intellect and experience within a concentrated portion of non-judicial officers of the legal profession known as barristers (which includes and accounts for their subsequent appointments to higher ranking [[queens counsel]] and [[senior counsel]]).

Barristers are engaged upon a solicitor's [[Brief (law)|brief]] instead of direct engagement with the client. This insulation avoids lay persons being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lawyers which is evidently "a big problem in the United States, where incompetent lawyers, and known to be such both by judges and by other lawyers, often wow naïve clients." &lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford) at 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of pursuing [[litigation]] influences the culture of each legal system in terms of what society perceives as the net benefit gained from the court and the profession. To litigate similar cases in England and the United States would cost approximately the same; however English courts are not as generous as their American counterparts in awarding [[damages]], especially [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  Therefore the net expected benefit of litigation being greater in the United States encourages a legal culture that is more litigious in nature than England.

National character is inherent in the legal institutions of the [[courts]] and [[parliament]], their formation and their output in terms of [[legislation]] or [[judgments]]. For example it has been said that many factors have contributed to the litigiousness of the United States, including: the rights afforded to the people, a written [[constitution]], immigrant origins of its population, racial and ethnic heterogeneity and the wealth and spoils of its population.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  To this end [[national character]] and [[history]] influence current legal culture.

== Chinese legal culture ==
The legal culture of [[China]], as well as its social and economic culture, continues to undergo dramatic change since the [[People’s Republic of China]]'s reforms of 1978. Transformation has occurred by legal modernisation whereby a rule of law has been suggested to replace the rule of man. The latter is a characteristic of the traditional rural Chinese society where unwritten rules, personal relationships and trust govern citizens' legal relationships; analogous to [[gemeinschaft]]. In the modern society of China, institutional, customary and legal reform (a rule of law that embodies universal rules uniformly enforced by a centralised and bureaucratic state) is necessary to govern legal relations; analogous to [[gesellschaft]].

Direct [[legal transplant|transplants]] of [[western legal systems]] or culture may not provide an adequate rule of law where the life of ordinary Chinese may be marginalised in favour of legal elite who use legal instruments for self-promotion. Furthermore, implanting western legal norms disregards the local culture and relations; thus potentially destroying significant cultural bonds and relationships in the rural community. The traditional [[rural Chinese]] legal culture which is premised on personal and informal relations faces erosion unless [[legal pluralism]] is promoted.

A top down approach in analysing the legal culture of China suggests that both under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Jiang Zemin]], China is "a country under rule by law, not rule of law."&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence comes from post Mao-China, where law is seen as necessary for institutionalising and generalising ad hoc policies for [[economic reform]] and as maintaining party leadership.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;

Further problems with the Chinese legal culture include a piecemeal approach to law making with an imbalance between [[law and policy]]; denials of private law; neglect towards [[human rights]] and individual liberties; and poor enforcement of laws.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;  According to Chen, the consensus in China among scholars is that the lack of [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] are interdependent concepts whereby "the rule of law is legitimate only if it is the product of democratic government." &lt;ref&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart) at 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is evident with the China experience is that legal culture is susceptible to change in pursuance to [[socio-economic]] and [[political]] forces. While such a change could be beneficial for portions of the society and [[international relations]], traditional and established cultural methods face extinction.

The '''light-harvesting complex''' (or '''antenna complex''') is an array of [[protein]] and [[chlorophyll]] molecules embedded in the [[thylakoid]] membrane of plants, which transfer light energy to one chlorophyll ''a'' molecule at the [[Photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction center]] of a [[photosystem]].

The [[photosynthetic pigment|antenna pigments]] are predominantly [[chlorophyll b|chlorophyll ''b'']], [[xanthophylls]], and [[carotene]]s. [[Chlorophyll a|Chlorophyll ''a'']] is known as the core pigment. Their absorption spectra are non-overlapping and broaden the range of light that can be absorbed in photosynthesis. The carotenoids have another role as an antioxidant to prevent photo-oxidative damage of chlorophyll molecules. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by [[resonance energy transfer]] to a specialized chlorophyll-protein complex known as the [[Photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction center]] of each [[photosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biochemistry 4th Ed.|last = Voet and Voet|first = Donald and Judith G.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0470-57095-1|location = USA|pages = 906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction center initiates a complex series of chemical reactions that capture energy in the form of chemical bonds.

For photosystem II, when either of the two chlorophyll ''a'' molecules at the reaction center absorb energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an [[electron acceptor]] molecule, [[pheophytin]], leaving the chlorophyll ''a'' in an [[oxidation|oxidized]] state. The oxidised chlorophyll ''a'' replaces the electrons by [[photolysis]] that involves the oxidation of water molecules to [[oxygen]], [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s.

Under changing light conditions, the reversible phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (LHCII) represents a system for balancing the excitation energy between the two photosystems.&lt;ref name="PUB00015383"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu XD, Shen YG |title=NaCl-induced phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins in thylakoid membranes from the halotolerant green alga, Dunaliella salina |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=569 |issue=1–3 |pages=337–340 |year=2004 |pmid=15225658 |doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2004.05.065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The N-terminus of the chlorophyll A-B binding protein extends into the stroma where it is involved with adhesion of granal membranes and photo-regulated by reversible phosphorylation of its threonine residues.&lt;ref name="PUB00015384"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson B, Yang DH, Paulsen H |title=The N-terminal domain of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein complex (LHCII) is essential for its acclimative proteolysis |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=466 |issue=2–3 |pages=385–388 |year=2000 |pmid=10682866 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01107-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these processes are believed to mediate the distribution of excitation energy between photosystems I and II.

This family also includes the photosystem II protein PsbS, which plays a role in energy-dependent quenching that increases thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in the photosystem.&lt;ref name="PUB00015385"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kramer D, Bassi R, Li XP, Gilmore AM, Caffarri S, Golan T, Niyogi KK |title=Regulation of photosynthetic light harvesting involves intrathylakoid lumen pH sensing by the PsbS protein |journal=J.

==Unpopular designs==
[[British Airways]] introduced varied and unusual tailfin designs in 1997.  These "airline liveries and logos" were intended to make the airline's branding more cosmopolitan and were described as "arty" and "ethnic".  They were unpopular with many customers and also caused confusion for ground controllers who had more difficulty recognising the [[British Airways ethnic liveries]] aircraft to give clear taxiing instructions.  Despite the £60M expense of this livery, it was replaced completely in 2001 and the airline has now returned to a more traditional design based upon the [[Union flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk/1325127.stm|title=R.I.P. British Airways' funky tailfins|publisher=BBC|date=11 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brussels Airlines|Brussels Airlines']] first logo was a stylised letter [[B]] composed of 13 dots resembling a [[runway]].  This was thought to be unlucky and protests by [[superstition|superstitious]] passengers caused the airline to add another dot.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6383171.stm|title='Unlucky' airline logo grounded|publisher=BBC|date=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the U.S. and Canada before moving to the [[University of Toronto]] in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life.

McLuhan is known for coining the expression "[[the medium is the message]]"&lt;!--"message" is correct here--&gt; and the term [[global village]], and for predicting the [[World Wide Web]] almost 30 years before it was invented.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt; He was a fixture in media discourse in the late 1960s, though his influence began to wane in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plummer|first=Kevin|title=Historicist: Marshall McLuhan, Urban Activist|url=http://torontoist.com/2011/06/historicist_marshall_mcluhan_urban_activist/|publisher=www.torontoist.com|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after his death, he continued to be a controversial figure in academic circles.&lt;ref name="stille"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/14/arts/marshall-mcluhan-back-dustbin-history-with-internet-his-ideas-again-seem-ahead.html|title=Marshall McLuhan Is Back From the Dustbin of History; With the Internet, His Ideas Again Seem Ahead of Their Time|last=Stille|first=Alexander| date=14 October 2000|work=The New York Times|page=9|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]] interest was renewed in his work and perspective.&lt;ref name="guard08"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/feb/28/livinginmarshallmcluhansga|title=Living in Marshall McLuhan's galaxy|last=Beale|first=Nigel|date=28 February 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2011|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired saint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boxer"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/03/arts/critic-s-notebook-mcluhan-s-messages-echoing-on-iraq.html?scp=12&amp;sq=mcluhan&amp;st=nyt|title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; McLuhan's Messages, Echoing On Iraq|last=Boxer| first=Sarah|date=3 April 2003|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Herbert Marshall McLuhan was born on July 21, 1911, in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, to Elsie Naomi ([[married and maiden names|née]] Hall) and Herbert Ernest McLuhan, both born in Canada. His brother Maurice was born two years later. "Marshall" was his maternal grandmother's surname. His mother was a [[Baptist]] school teacher who later became an actress; his father was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] and had a real estate business in Edmonton. That business failed when [[World War I]] broke out, and McLuhan's father enlisted in the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian army]]. After a year of service, he contracted [[influenza]] and remained in Canada, away from the front lines. After his discharge from the army in 1915, the McLuhan family moved to [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, where Marshall grew up and went to school, attending [[Kelvin High School|Kelvin Technical School]] before enrolling in the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Manitoba, McLuhan explored his conflicted relationship with religion and turned to literature to "gratify his soul's hunger for truth and beauty,"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edan, Tina (2003). [http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/1977/1/MQ77929.pdf "St Marshall, Mass and the Media: Catholicism, Media Theory and Marshall McLuhan"], p. 10. Retrieved 2010-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; later referring to this stage as [[agnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edan (2003), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying for one year as an engineering student, he changed majors and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (1933), winning a University Gold Medal in Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (1997), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p.32&lt;/ref&gt; He took an [[Master of Arts|MA]] (1934) in [[English studies|English]] from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1934. He had long desired to pursue graduate studies in [[England]] and was accepted to the [[University of Cambridge]], having failed to secure a [[Rhodes scholarship]] to [[Oxford University|Oxford]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

He had already earned a BA and an MA degree at Manitoba, but Cambridge required him to enroll as an undergraduate "affiliated" student, with one year's credit towards a three-year bachelor's degree, before entering any doctoral studies.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 40; McLuhan later commented  "One advantage we Westerners have is that we're under no illusion we've had an education. That's why I started at the bottom again." Marchand (1990), p 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in the autumn of 1934, where he studied under [[I. A. Richards]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] and was influenced by [[New Criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reflection years afterward, he credited the faculty there with influencing the direction of his later work because of their emphasis on the ''training of perception'' and such concepts as Richards' notion of ''[[I. A. Richards#Feedforward|feedforward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, pp. 37–47.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies formed an important precursor to his later ideas on technological forms.&lt;ref name="LAC"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/ Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; He received the required bachelor's degree from Cambridge in 1936&lt;ref name="Gordon, p. 94"&gt;Gordon, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and entered their graduate program. Later, he returned from England to take a job as a teaching assistant at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] that he held for the 1936–37 academic year, being unable to find a suitable job in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

While studying the [[trivium]] at Cambridge, he took the first steps toward his eventual conversion to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt; founded on his reading of [[G. K. Chesterton]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis H. Lapham, Introduction to ''Understanding Media'' (First MIT Press Edition), p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he wrote to his mother: "[H]ad I not encountered Chesterton, I would have remained agnostic for many years at least."&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. "Letter to Elsie McLuhan", September 5, 1935. Molinaro ''et alia'' (1987), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of March 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p.74, gives the date as March 25; Marchand (1990), p.44, gives it as March 30.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan completed what was a slow but total conversion process, when he was formally received into the Roman Catholic Church. After consulting a minister, his father accepted the decision to convert. His mother, however, felt that his conversion would hurt his career and was inconsolable.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan was devout throughout his life, but his religion remained a private matter.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1990), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He had a lifelong interest in the number three&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., the trivium, the [[Trinity]]) and sometimes said that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] provided intellectual guidance for him.&lt;ref&gt;Associates speculated about his intellectual connection to the Virgin Mary, one saying, "He had a direct connection with the Blessed Virgin Mary.... He alluded to it very briefly once, almost fearfully, in a please-don't-laugh-at-me tone. He didn't say, 'I know this because the Blessed Virgin Mary told me,' but it was clear from what he said that one of the reasons he was so sure about certain things was that the Virgin had certified his understanding of them." (cited in Marchand, p. 51).&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of his career, he taught in Roman Catholic institutions of higher education. From 1937 to 1944, he taught English at [[Saint Louis University]] (with an interruption from 1939–40 when he returned to Cambridge). There he taught courses on [[Shakespeare]]&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and tutored and befriended [[Walter J. Ong]], who went on to write his PhD dissertation on a topic that McLuhan had called to his attention, and who also became a well-known authority on communication and technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

They spent 1939–40 in Cambridge, where he completed his master's degree (awarded in January 1940)&lt;ref name="Gordon, p. 94" /&gt; and began to work on his doctoral dissertation on [[Thomas Nashe]] and the verbal arts. While the McLuhans were in England, [[World War II|war]] had broken out in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where he continued teaching and they started a family. He was awarded a Ph.D. in December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  He next taught at [[Assumption University (Windsor)|Assumption College]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]] from 1944 to 1946, then moved to [[Toronto]] in 1946 where he joined the faculty of [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]], a Catholic college of the [[University of Toronto]]. [[Hugh Kenner]] was one of his students and Canadian economist and communications scholar [[Harold Innis]] was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work.  McLuhan wrote in 1964: "I am pleased to think of my own book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of [[writing]] then of [[printing]]."&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. (2005) ''Marshall McLuhan Unbound.'' Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press v. 8, p. 8. This is a reprint of McLuhan's introduction to the 1964 edition of Innis's book ''The Bias of Communication'' first published in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, McLuhan began the Communication and Culture seminars at the University of Toronto, funded by the [[Ford Foundation]]. As his reputation grew, he received a growing number of offers from other universities and, to keep him, the university created the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology|Centre for Culture and Technology]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  He published his first major work during this period: ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man|The Mechanical Bride]]'' (1951). The work was an examination of the effect of advertising on society and culture. He and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]] also produced an important journal called ''Explorations'' throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Prins and Bishop 2002&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the [[Toronto School of communication theory]], together with [[Harold Innis]], [[Eric A. Havelock]], and [[Northrop Frye]]. During this time, McLuhan supervised the doctoral thesis of modernist writer [[Sheila Watson (writer)|Sheila Watson]] on the subject of [[Wyndham Lewis]]. He remained at the University of Toronto through 1979, spending much of this time as head of his Centre for Culture and Technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

McLuhan was named to the [[Albert Schweitzer]] Chair in Humanities at [[Fordham University]] in the Bronx for one year (1967–68).&lt;ref&gt;During the time at Fordham University, his son [[Eric McLuhan]] conducted what came to be known as the [[Fordham Experiment]] about the different effects of "light-on" versus "light-through" media.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Fordham, he was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour, and it was treated successfully. He returned to Toronto where he taught at the University of Toronto for the rest of his life and lived in [[Wychwood Park]], a bucolic enclave on a hill overlooking the downtown where [[Anatol Rapoport]] was his neighbour.  In 1970, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|2180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the [[University of Dallas]] hosted him from April to May, appointing him to the McDermott Chair.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan (n.d.).

Marshall and Corinne McLuhan had six children: [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], twins Mary and Teresa, Stephanie, Elizabeth, and Michael. The associated costs of a large family eventually drove him to advertising work and accepting frequent consulting and speaking engagements for large corporations, IBM and AT&amp;T among them.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;  [[Woody Allen]]'s Oscar-winning motion picture ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) featured McLuhan in a cameo as himself; a pompous academic arguing with Allen in a cinema queue is silenced by McLuhan suddenly appearing and saying, "You know nothing of my work."  This was one of McLuhan's most frequent statements to and about those who disagreed with him.&lt;ref&gt;''University of Toronto Bulletin'', 1979; Martin Friedland, ''The University of Toronto: A History'', University of Toronto Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1979, he suffered a stroke which affected his ability to speak. The University of Toronto's School of Graduate Studies tried to close his research centre shortly thereafter, but was deterred by substantial protests, most notably by Woody Allen. He never fully recovered from the stroke and died in his sleep on December 31, 1980.&lt;ref name=nytimesobituary&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitman|first=Alden|title=Marshall McLuhan, Author, Dies; Declared 'Medium Is the Message'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/02/home/mcluhan-obit.html|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major works ==
During his years at [[Saint Louis University]] (1937–1944), McLuhan worked concurrently on two projects: his doctoral [[doctoral thesis|dissertation]] and the manuscript that was eventually published in 1951 as the book ''The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man'', which included only a representative selection of the materials that McLuhan had prepared for it.

McLuhan's 1942 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation surveys the history of the verbal arts ([[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]—collectively known as the [[trivium]]) from the time of [[Cicero]] down to the time of [[Thomas Nashe]].&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's doctoral dissertation from 1942 was published by [[Gingko Press]] in March 2006. Gingko Press also plans to publish the complete manuscript of items and essays that McLuhan prepared, only a selection of which were published in his book. With the publication of these two books a more complete picture of McLuhan's arguments and aims is likely to emerge.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later publications, McLuhan at times uses the Latin concept of the ''trivium'' to outline an orderly and systematic picture of certain periods in the history of Western culture. McLuhan suggests that the [[Late Middle Ages]], for instance, were characterized by the heavy emphasis on the formal study of logic. The key development that led to the [[Renaissance]] was not the rediscovery of ancient texts but a shift in emphasis from the formal study of logic to rhetoric and grammar. Modern life is characterized by the re-emergence of grammar as its most salient feature—a trend McLuhan felt was exemplified by the [[New Criticism]] of Richards and Leavis.&lt;ref&gt;For a nuanced account of McLuhan's thought regarding Richards and Leavis, see McLuhan's "Poetic and Rhetorical Exegesis: The Case for Leavis against Richards and Empson" in the ''Sewanee Review'', volume 52, number 2 (1944): 266–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mechanical Bride'', McLuhan turned his attention to analysing and commenting on numerous examples of persuasion in contemporary [[popular culture]]. This followed naturally from his earlier work as both dialectic and rhetoric in the classical trivium aimed at persuasion. At this point his focus shifted dramatically, turning inward to study the influence of [[mass media|communication media]] independent of their content. His famous [[aphorism]] "[[the medium is the message]]" (elaborated in his 1964 book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'') calls attention to this intrinsic effect of communications media.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "the medium is the message" may be better understood in light of [[Bernard Lonergan]]'s further articulation of related ideas: at the empirical level of [[consciousness]], the medium is the message, whereas at the intelligent and rational levels of consciousness, the content is the message. This sentence uses Lonergan's terminology from ''Insight: A Study of Human Understanding'' to clarify the meaning of McLuhan's statement that "the medium is the message"; McLuhan read this when it was first published in 1957 and found "much sense" in it—in his letter of September 21, 1957, to his former student and friend, Walter J. Ong, S.J., McLuhan says, "Find much sense in Bern. Lonergan's ''Insight''" (''Letters of Marshall McLuhan'', 1987: 251). Lonergan's ''Insight'' is an extended guide to "making the inward turn": attending ever more carefully to one's own consciousness, reflecting on it ever more carefully, and monitoring one's articulations ever more carefully.  When McLuhan declares that he is more interested in [[percept]]s than [[concept]]s, he is declaring in effect that he is more interested in what Lonergan refers to as the empirical level of consciousness than in what Lonergan refers to as the intelligent level of consciousness in which concepts are formed, which Lonergan distinguishes from the rational level of consciousness in which the adequacy of concepts and of predications is adjudicated. This inward turn to attending to percepts and to the cultural conditioning of the empirical level of consciousness through the effect of communication media sets him apart from more outward-oriented studies of sociological influences and the outward presentation of self carried out by [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]], [[Kenneth Burke]], Hugh Duncan, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan also started the journal ''Explorations'' with anthropologist [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund "Ted" Carpenter]]. In a letter to [[Walter Ong]] dated May 31, 1953, McLuhan reported that he had received a two-year grant of $43,000 from the Ford Foundation to carry out a communication project at the University of Toronto involving faculty from different disciplines, which led to the creation of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Plummer | first=Kevin | date=May 3, 2014 | title=Historicist: ''Explorations'' at the Vanguard of Communications Studies |  work=[[Torontoist]] | url=http://torontoist.com/2014/05/historicist-explorations-at-the-vanguard-of-communications-studies/ | access-date=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Fordham lecture in 1999, [[Tom Wolfe]] suggested that a major under-acknowledged influence on McLuhan's work is the Jesuit philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] whose ideas anticipated those of McLuhan, especially the evolution of the human mind into the "[[noosphere]]".&lt;ref name="TWolfe"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzBPmRPa7ls | title = Tom Wolfe on Media, Advertising, Technology (1999) | accessdate = 23 April 2017 | last = Wolfe | first = Tom | date = December 2015 | publisher = C-SPAN | quote = 45m}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, McLuhan warns against outright dismissing or whole-heartedly accepting de Chardin's observations early on in his second published book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (p.&amp;nbsp;32): "This externalization of our senses creates what de Chardin calls the 'noosphere' or a technological brain for the world. Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and super-imposed co-existence."

In his private life, McLuhan wrote to friends saying: "I am not a fan of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The idea that anything is better because it comes later is surely borrowed from pre-electronic technologies." Further, McLuhan noted to a Catholic collaborator: "The idea of a Cosmic thrust in one direction ... is surely one of the lamest semantic fallacies ever bred by the word ‘evolution’ .... That development should have any direction at all is inconceivable except to the highly literate community."&lt;ref name="AChrystall"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mro.massey.ac.nz/handle/10179/778 | title = The New American Vortex (2007)| accessdate = 24 Jun 2018 | last = Chrystall | first = Andrew | date = December 2007 | publisher = Massey University | quote = 467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Mechanical Bride'' (1951) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
McLuhan's first book, ''[[The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man]]'' (1951), is a pioneering study in the field now known as [[popular culture]]. His interest in the critical study of popular culture was influenced by the 1933 book ''Culture and Environment'' by [[F. R. Leavis]] and Denys Thompson, and the title ''The Mechanical Bride'' is derived from a piece by the [[Dada]]ist artist, [[Marcel Duchamp]].

Like his 1962 book ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', ''The Mechanical Bride'' is composed of a number of short essays that can be read in any order—what he styled the "mosaic approach" to writing a book. Each essay begins with a newspaper or magazine article or an advertisement, followed by McLuhan's analysis thereof. The analyses bear on aesthetic considerations as well as on the implications behind the imagery and text. McLuhan chose the ads and articles included in his book not only to draw attention to their symbolism and their implications for the corporate entities that created and disseminated them, but also to mull over what such advertising implies about the wider society at which it is aimed.

=== ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962) ===
McLuhan's ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy|The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man]]'' (written in 1961, first published in Canada by [[University of Toronto Press]] in 1962) is a pioneering study in the fields of [[orality|oral culture]], [[print culture]], [[cultural studies]], and [[media ecology]].

Throughout the book, McLuhan takes pains to reveal how [[communication technology]] ([[alphabet]]ic writing, the [[printing press]], and the [[electronic media]]) affects [[cognitive]] organization, which in turn has profound ramifications for social organization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...[I]f a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been vague or opaque will become translucent.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' 1962, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Movable type ====
His episodic history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the [[Electronics|electronic age]]. According to McLuhan, the invention of [[movable type]] greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means [[phonemic orthography]]. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic [[alphabet]] from [[logographic]]/logogramic writing systems, like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] or [[ideograms]].)

Print culture, ushered in by the [[Gutenberg press]] in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from ''Prints and Visual Communication'' by [[William Ivins]], McLuhan remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, "formal" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' pp. 124–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'') &lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the [[Modern age|Modern]] period in the [[Western world]]: [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Protestantism]], [[capitalism]] and [[nationalism]]. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification."&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Global Village ====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called "electronic interdependence": when [[electronic media]] replaces [[visual culture]] with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a "tribal base." McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the ''[[global village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "global village"  specifically as such. According to McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a ''Wake'' scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term. &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm |publisher=''McLuhan Studies'' (issue 2) |title=The source of the term 'global village' |author=Eric McLuhan |year=1996 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of tending towards a vast [[Alexandrian library]] the world has become a [[computer]], an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of [[science fiction]]. And as our senses have gone outside us, [[Authoritarianism|Big Brother]] goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the [[Western world]] a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no ''per se'' moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than [[manuscript]] culture could ever do. Print is the technology of [[individualism]]. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. "But", someone says, "we didn't know it would happen." Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the "end of the book". If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that "there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies".&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the [[World Wide Web]] was invented almost thirty years after ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', and ten years after his death, McLuhan prophesied the web technology seen today as early as 1962:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The next medium, whatever it is—it may be the extension of consciousness—will include television as  its content, not as its environment, and will transform television into an art form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve the individual's encyclopedic function and flip into a private line to speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Getto |first=Erica |url=http://www.wnyc.org/articles/features/2011/jul/15/celebrating-marshall-mcluhans-legacy/ |title=The Medium is the Massage: Celebrating Marshall McLuhan's Legacy |publisher=WNYC.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, McLuhan coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term "[[surfing]]" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like "[[Heidegger]] surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as [[Descartes]] rode the mechanical wave." [[Paul Levinson]]'s 1999 book ''Digital McLuhan'' explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Paul Levinson | url=http://www.cyberchimp.co.uk/U75102/levinson.htm#ch3 |first=Paul|last=Levinson |title=Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |ISBN=0-415-19251-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan frequently quoted [[Walter Ong]]'s ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue'' (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;''America'' 107 (Sept. 15, 1962): 743, 747.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' as "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 8 (1967): 838.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan himself said of the book, "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [''The Gutenberg Galaxy'']. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of ''Understanding Media'' [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' won Canada's highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction]], in 1962.  The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Understanding Media'' (1964) ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Medeasfhsdl.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Book cover ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man'' by Marshall McLuhan, 1964. It is the source of the phrase [[The medium is the message]].]] --&gt;

McLuhan's most widely known work, ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964), is a pioneering study in media theory. Dismayed by the way people approached and used new media such as television, McLuhan famously argued that in the modern world "we live mythically and integrally ... but continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1964), 4&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan proposed that [[Mass media|media]] themselves, not the content they carry, should be the focus of study—popularly quoted as "the medium is the message". McLuhan's insight was that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not by the content delivered over the medium, but by the characteristics of the medium itself. McLuhan pointed to the [[light bulb]] as a clear demonstration of this concept. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society—in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children's shows or violent programming, to illustrate one example—the effect of television on society would be identical.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.

==== {{anchor|Hot and cool media}}"Hot" and "cool" media ====
In the first part of ''Understanding Media,'' McLuhan also stated that different media invite different degrees of participation on the part of a person who chooses to consume a medium. Some media, like the movies, were "hot"—that is, they enhance one single [[sense]], in this case [[Visual perception|vision]], in such a manner that a person does not need to exert much effort in filling in the details of a movie image. McLuhan contrasted this with "cool" TV, which he claimed requires more effort on the part of the viewer to determine meaning, and [[comics]], which due to their minimal presentation of visual detail require a high degree of effort to fill in details that the cartoonist may have intended to portray. A movie is thus said by McLuhan to be "hot", intensifying one single sense "high definition", demanding a viewer's attention, and a comic book to be "cool" and "low definition", requiring much more conscious participation by the reader to extract value.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than a dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot media usually, but not always, provide complete involvement without considerable stimulus. For example, print occupies visual space, uses visual senses, but can immerse its reader. Hot media favour analytical precision, quantitative analysis and sequential ordering, as they are usually sequential, linear and logical. They emphasize one sense (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media also include [[radio]], as well as [[film]], the [[lecture]], and [[photography]].

Cool media, on the other hand, are usually, but not always, those that provide little involvement with substantial stimulus. They require more active participation on the part of the user, including the perception of abstract patterning and simultaneous comprehension of all parts. Therefore, according to McLuhan cool media include [[television]], as well as the [[seminar]] and [[cartoons]]. McLuhan describes the term "cool media" as emerging from jazz and popular music and, in this context, is used to mean "detached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-74-342-1818/people/mcluhan/clip4 |title=CBC Archives |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Cool medium incorporates increased involvement but decreased description while hot medium is the opposite, decreased involvement and increased description. In other words, a society that appears to be actively participating in the streaming of content but not considering the effects of the tool is not allowing an "extension of ourselves." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The Playboy Interview|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|date=March 1969|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept appears to force media into binary categories. However, McLuhan's hot and cool exist on a continuum: they are more correctly measured on a scale than as dichotomous terms.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

==== Critiques of ''Understanding Media'' ====
Some theorists have attacked McLuhan’s definition and treatment of the word "medium" for being too simplistic.  [[Umberto Eco]], for instance, contends that McLuhan’s medium conflates channels, codes, and messages under the overarching term of the medium, confusing the vehicle, internal code, and content of a given message in his framework.&lt;ref name="Debray"&gt;{{cite web|last=Debray|first=Regis|title=Media Manifestos|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Debray-MediaManifestos1.pdf|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Media Manifestos'', [[Régis Debray]] also takes issue with McLuhan’s envisioning of the medium.  Like Eco, he too is ill at ease with this reductionist approach, summarizing its ramifications as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The list of objections could be and has been lengthened indefinitely: confusing technology itself with its use of the media makes of the media an abstract, undifferentiated force and produces its image in an imaginary "public" for mass consumption; the magical naivete of supposed causalities turns the media into a catch-all and contagious "mana"; apocalyptic millenarianism invents the figure of a homo mass-mediaticus without ties to historical and social context, and so on.&lt;ref name="Debray" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, when ''Wired'' interviewed him in 1995, Debray stated that he views McLuhan "more as a poet than a historian, a master of intellectual collage rather than a systematic analyst ...  McLuhan overemphasizes the technology behind cultural change at the expense of the usage that the messages and codes make of that technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joscelyne|first=Andrew|title=Debray on Technology|url=http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdebray1.htm|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dwight Macdonald]], in turn, reproached McLuhan for his focus on television and for his "aphoristic" style of prose, which he believes left ''Understanding Media'' filled with "contradictions, non-sequiturs, facts that are distorted and facts that are not facts, exaggerations, and chronic rhetorical vagueness." &lt;ref name="Mullen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullen|first=Megan|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw: Marshall McLuhan’s Understanding Media|url=http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105045526/http://www.historyoftechnology.org/eTC/v47no2/mullen.html|archivedate=5 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Brian Winston]]’s ''Misunderstanding Media'', published in 1986, chides McLuhan for what he sees as his [[technological determinism|technologically deterministic]] stances.&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;  [[Raymond Williams]] and [[James W. Carey]] further this point of contention, claiming:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The work of McLuhan was a particular culmination of an aesthetic theory which became, negatively, a social theory [...] It is an apparently sophisticated technological determinism which has the significant effect of indicating a social and cultural determinism [...] If the medium – whether print or television – is the cause, of all other causes, all that men ordinarily see as history is at once reduced to effects. (Williams 1990, 126/7)&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David Carr states that there has been a long line of "academics who have made a career out of deconstructing McLuhan’s effort to define the modern media ecosystem," whether it be due to what they see as McLuhan’s ignorance toward sociohistorical context or the style of his argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|title=Marshall McLuhan: Media Savant|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/books/review/Carr-t.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2 November 2011|work=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some critics have taken issue with McLuhan’s writing style and mode of argument, McLuhan himself urged readers to think of his work as "probes" or "mosaics" offering a toolkit approach to thinking about the media. His eclectic writing style has also been praised for its postmodern sensibilities&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grossweiler, ''The Method is the Message: Rethinking McLuhan through Critical Theory'' (Montreal: Black Rose, 1998), 155-81&lt;/ref&gt; and suitability for virtual space.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Levinson, ''Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium'' (New York: Routledge,1999), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Medium Is the Massage:&lt;!-- "MASSAGE" IS CORRECT, EDITORS, PLEASE NOTE: "The Medium is the MASSAGE" is the correct title. Please DO NOT change "Massage" to "Message" here --&gt; An Inventory of Effects'' (1967) ===
''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'', published in 1967, was McLuhan's best seller,&lt;ref name="wired saint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/saint.marshal.html?pg=1&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= |title=The Wisdom of Saint Marshall, the Holy Fool |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "eventually selling nearly a million copies worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Initiated by [[Quentin Fiore]],&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  McLuhan adopted the term "massage" to denote the effect each medium has on the human [[sensorium]], taking inventory of the "effects" of numerous media in terms of how they "massage" the sensorium.&lt;ref&gt;According to McLuhan biographer W. Terrence Gordon, "by the time it appeared in 1967, McLuhan no doubt recognized that his original saying had become a cliché and welcomed the opportunity to throw it back on the compost heap of language to recycle and revitalize it.  But the new title is more than McLuhan indulging his insatiable taste for puns, more than a clever fusion of self-mockery and self-rescue—the subtitle is 'An Inventory of Effects,' underscoring the lesson compressed into the original saying." (Gordon, p. 175.)

However, the FAQ section on the website maintained by McLuhan's estate says that this interpretation is incomplete and makes its own leap of logic as to why McLuhan left it as is. "Why is the title of the book ''The Medium Is the Massage'' and not ''The Medium is the Message''? Actually, the title was a mistake. When the book came back from the typesetter's, it had on the cover 'Massage' as it still does. The title was supposed to have read ''The Medium is the Message'' but the typesetter had made an error. When McLuhan saw the typo he exclaimed, 'Leave it alone! It's great, and right on target!' Now there are possible four readings for the last word of the title, all of them accurate: ''Message'' and ''Mess Age'', ''Massage'' and ''Mass Age''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiore, at the time a prominent graphic designer and communications consultant, set about composing the visual illustration of these effects which were compiled by Jerome Agel. Near the beginning of the book, Fiore adopted a pattern in which an image demonstrating a media effect was presented with a textual synopsis on the facing page.  The reader experiences a repeated shifting of analytic registers—from "reading" typographic print to "scanning" photographic facsimiles—reinforcing McLuhan's overarching argument in this book: namely, that each medium produces a different "massage" or "effect" on the human sensorium.

In ''The Medium Is the Massage'',&lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt; McLuhan also rehashed the argument—which first appeared in the Prologue to 1962's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''—that all media are "extensions" of our human senses, bodies and minds.

Finally, McLuhan described key points of change in how man has viewed the world and how these views were changed by the adoption of new media. "The technique of invention was the discovery of the nineteenth [century]", brought on by the adoption of fixed points of view and [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] by typography, while "[t]he technique of the [[suspension of judgement|suspended judgment]] is the discovery of the twentieth century", brought on by the [[bard]] abilities of radio, movies and television.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a [[rear-view mirror]]. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in [[Bonanza]]-land.&lt;ref&gt;''The Medium is the Massage'', pp 74,5&lt;/ref&gt;

An audio recording version of McLuhan's famous work was made by Columbia Records. The recording consists of a pastiche of statements made by McLuhan ''interrupted'' by other speakers, including people speaking in various [[phonation]]s and [[falsetto]]s, discordant sounds and 1960s incidental music in what could be considered a deliberate attempt to translate the disconnected images seen on TV into an audio format, resulting in the prevention of a connected stream of conscious thought. Various audio recording techniques and statements are used to illustrate the relationship between spoken, literary speech and the characteristics of electronic audio media.  McLuhan biographer Philip Marchand called the recording "the 1967 equivalent of a McLuhan video."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"I wouldn't be seen dead with a living work of art."—'Old man' speaking
:"Drop this jiggery-pokery and talk straight turkey."—'Middle aged man' speaking

=== ''War and Peace in the Global Village'' (1968) ===
McLuhan used [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', an inspiration for this study of war throughout history, as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future.

Joyce's ''Wake'' is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its '''Ten Thunders'''. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves [[portmanteau]]s of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in ''Wake'' represent different stages in the history of man:&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Global Village'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.'' Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*''Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.'' Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*''Thunder 3: Specialism.'' Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*''Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.'' Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*''Thunder 5: Printing.'' Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*''Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.'' Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*''Thunder 7: Tribal man again.'' All choractors end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*''Thunder 8: Movies.'' Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*''Thunder 9: Car and Plane.'' Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*''Thunder 10: Television.'' Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.

=== ''From Cliché to Archetype'' (1970) ===
In his 1970 book, ''From Cliché to Archetype'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]] [[Wilfred Watson]],&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/wilfred-watson/ |title=Watson, Wilfred |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=14 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202212727/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008487 |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; approached the various implications of the verbal [[cliché]] and of the [[archetype]].  One major facet in McLuhan's overall framework introduced in this book that is seldom noticed is the provision of a new term that actually succeeds the global village; the ''global theater''.

In McLuhan's terms, a cliché is a "normal" action, phrase, etc. which becomes so often used that we are "anesthetized" to its effects.

An example of this given by McLuhan is [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s play ''[[The Bald Soprano]]'', whose dialogue consists entirely of phrases Ionesco pulled from an [[Assimil]] language book. "Ionesco originally put all these idiomatic English clichés into literary French which presented the English in the most absurd aspect possible."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan's ''archetype'' "is a quoted extension, medium, technology or environment." "Environment" would also include the kinds of "awareness" and cognitive shifts brought upon people by it, not totally unlike the psychological context [[Carl Jung]] described.

McLuhan also posits that there is a factor of interplay between the cliché and the archetype, or a "doubleness":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another theme of the Wake [''[[Finnegans Wake]]''] that helps in the understanding of the paradoxical shift from cliché to archetype is 'past time are pastimes.' The dominant technologies of one age become the games and pastimes of a later age. In the 20th century, the number of 'past times' that are simultaneously available is so vast as to create cultural anarchy. When all the cultures of the world are simultaneously present, the work of the artist in the elucidation of form takes on new scope and new urgency. Most men are pushed into the artist's role. The artist cannot dispense with the principle of 'doubleness' or 'interplay' because this type of [[hendiadys]] dialogue is essential to the very structure of consciousness, awareness, and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McLuhan relates the cliché-to-archetype process to the [[Theatre of the Absurd|Theater of the Absurd]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pascal, in the seventeenth century, tells us that the heart has many reasons of which the head knows nothing. The Theater of the Absurd is essentially a communicating to the head of some of the silent languages of the heart which in two or three hundred years it has tried to forget all about. In the seventeenth century world the languages of the heart were pushed down into the unconscious by the dominant print cliché.&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "languages of the heart", or what McLuhan would otherwise define as oral culture, were thus made archetype by means of the printing press, and turned into cliché.

The satellite medium, McLuhan states, encloses the Earth in a man-made environment, which "ends 'Nature' and turns the globe into a repertory theater to be programmed."&lt;ref&gt;''From Cliché to Archetype'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions ("past times are pastimes"). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term ''global theater''. It serves as an update to his older concept of the global village, which, in its own definitions, can be said to be subsumed into the overall condition described by that of the global theater.

=== ''The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st Century'' (1989) ===
In his 1989 posthumous book, ''The Global Village'', McLuhan, collaborating with [[Bruce R. Powers]], provided a strong conceptual framework for understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated with the rise of a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the [[Shannon–Weaver model]]. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic with the advent of the global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow"&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.

Reading, writing, and hierarchical ordering are associated with the left brain, as are the linear concept of time and phonetic literacy. The left brain is the locus of analysis, classification, and rationality. The right brain is the locus of the spatial, tactile, and musical. "Comprehensive awareness" results when the two sides of the brain are in true balance. Visual Space is associated with the simplified worldview of Euclidean geometry, the intuitive three dimensions useful for the architecture of buildings and the surveying of land. It is too rational and has no grasp of the acoustic. Acoustic Space is multisensory.

McLuhan writes about robotism in the context of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of thinking about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and the novels of [[Philip K. Dick]]. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword'', an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: "Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.

==== Beyond existing communication models ====
"All Western scientific models of communication are—like the Shannon–Weaver model—linear, sequential, and logical as a reflection of the late medieval emphasis on the Greek notion of efficient causality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan and Powers criticize the Shannon-Weaver model of communication as emblematic of left-hemisphere bias and linearity, descended from a print-era perversion of Aristotle's notion of efficient causality.

A third term of ''The Global Village'' that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. McLuhan had begun development on the Tetrad as early as 1974.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan's Laws of the Media, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The tetrad an analogical, simultaneous four-fold pattern of transformation. "At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other." &lt;ref&gt;''The Global Village'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and ground (Earth) simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate the media or technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.

== Key concepts ==

=== Tetrad of media effects ===
{{Main|Tetrad of media effects}}

In ''Laws of Media'' (1988), published posthumously by his son [[Eric McLuhan|Eric]], McLuhan summarized his ideas about [[media studies|media]] in a concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examining the effects on society of any technology (i.e., any medium) by dividing its effects into four categories and displaying them simultaneously. McLuhan designed the tetrad as a pedagogical tool, phrasing his laws as questions with which to consider any medium:

*What does the medium enhance?
*What does the medium make obsolete?
*What does the medium retrieve that had been obsolesced earlier?
*What does the medium flip into when pushed to extremes?

The laws of the tetrad exist simultaneously, not successively or chronologically, and allow the questioner to explore the "grammar and syntax" of the "language" of media. McLuhan departs from his mentor [[Harold Innis]] in suggesting that a medium "overheats", or reverses into an opposing form, when taken to its extreme.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Visually, a tetrad can be depicted as four diamonds forming an X, with the name of a medium in the centre. The two diamonds on the left of a tetrad are the ''Enhancement'' and ''Retrieval'' qualities of the medium, both ''Figure'' qualities. The two diamonds on the right of a tetrad are the ''Obsolescence'' and ''Reversal'' qualities, both ''Ground'' qualities.&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;{{cite book |last=McLuhan |first=Eric |title=Electric language: understanding the present |publisher=Stoddart |year=1998 |isbn=0-7737-5972-7}}, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|right|thumb|250px|A blank tetrad diagram]]

Using the example of radio:

* Enhancement (figure): What the medium amplifies or intensifies. ''Radio amplifies news and music via sound.''
* Obsolescence (ground): What the medium drives out of prominence. ''Radio reduces the importance of print and the visual.''
* Retrieval (figure): What the medium recovers which was previously lost. ''Radio returns the spoken word to the forefront.''
* Reversal (ground): What the medium does when pushed to its limits. ''Acoustic radio flips into audio-visual TV.''

=== Figure and ground ===
{{Main|Figure and ground (media)}}

McLuhan adapted the [[Gestalt psychology]] idea of a ''figure and a ground'', which underpins the meaning of "The medium is the message".&lt;!--"message" is correct here--&gt; He used this concept to explain how a form of communications technology, the medium  or ''figure'', necessarily operates through its context, or ''ground''.

McLuhan believed that in order to grasp fully the effect of a new technology, one must examine figure (medium) and ground (context) together, since neither is completely intelligible without the other. McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to the technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in their turn, further affect society and individuals.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

All technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about [[Time- and space-bias|time and space]]. The message which the medium conveys can only be understood if the medium and the environment in which the medium is used—and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates—are analysed together. He believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:Marshall McLuhan Way Toronto.jpg|thumb|A portion of Toronto's St. Joseph Street is co-named Marshall McLuhan Way]]
After the publication of ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan received an astonishing amount of publicity, making him perhaps the most publicized English teacher in the twentieth century and arguably the most controversial.{{According to whom|date=January 2013}} This publicity began with the work of two California advertising executives, [[Howard Gossage]] and Gerald Feigen who used personal funds to fund their practice of "genius scouting."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Marchand, pp. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Randall (1994). ''Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign''. NY: Vintage Books, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Much enamoured with McLuhan's work, Feigen and Gossage arranged for McLuhan to meet with editors of several major New York magazines in May 1965 at the Lombardy Hotel in New York. Philip Marchand reports that, as a direct consequence of these meetings, McLuhan was offered the use of an office in the headquarters of both ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'', any time he needed it.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In August 1965, Feigen and Gossage held what they called a "McLuhan festival" in the offices of Gossage's advertising agency in San Francisco. During this "festival", McLuhan met with advertising executives, members of the mayor's office, and editors from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine. More significant was the presence at the festival of [[Tom Wolfe]], who wrote about McLuhan in a subsequent article, "What If He Is Right?", published in ''[[New York Magazine]]'' and Wolfe's own ''[[The Pump House Gang]]''. According to Feigen and Gossage, their work had only a moderate effect on McLuhan's eventual celebrity: they claimed that their work only "probably speeded up the recognition of [McLuhan's] genius by about six months."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, pp. 182–184.&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, McLuhan soon became a fixture of media discourse. ''Newsweek'' magazine did a cover story on him; articles appeared in ''Life Magazine'', ''Harper's'', ''Fortune'', ''Esquire'', and others. Cartoons about him appeared in ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="wired saint" /&gt;  In 1969, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine published a lengthy interview with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Playboy Interview: Marshall McLuhan |date=March 1969 |work=Playboy |pages=26–27, 45, 55–56, 61, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a running gag on the popular sketch comedy ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]'', the "poet" [[Henry Gibson]] would randomly say, "Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin'?"&lt;ref&gt;Marchand (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan was credited with coining the phrase ''[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]'' by its popularizer, [[Timothy Leary]], in the 1960s. In a 1988 interview with [[Neil Strauss]], Leary stated that slogan was "given to him" by McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary said McLuhan "was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that’s a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.'"&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Neil. ''Everybody Loves You When You're Dead: Journeys into Fame and Madness.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2011, p. 337–38&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime and afterward, McLuhan heavily influenced [[cultural criticism|cultural critics]], thinkers, and media theorists such as [[Neil Postman]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[William Irwin Thompson]], [[Paul Levinson]], [[Douglas Rushkoff]], [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Hugh Kenner]], and [[John David Ebert]], as well as political leaders such as [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-69-342-1826/life_society/mcluhan/clip8 |title=It's cool not to shave – Marshall McLuhan, the Man and his Message – CBC Archives |accessdate=2007-07-02 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Jerry Brown]]. [[Andy Warhol]] was paraphrasing McLuhan with his now famous "[[15 minutes of fame]]" quote. When asked in the 1970s for a way to sedate violences in [[Angola]], he suggested a massive spread of TV devices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Luttazzi]], interview at [[RAI Radio1]] show ''[http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm Stereonotte] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629015942/http://www.radio.rai.it/radio1/radiounomusica/stereonotte.cfm |date=2007-06-29 }}'', July 01 2007 2:00 am. Quote: "McLuhan era uno che al premier canadese che si interrogava su un modo per sedare dei disordini in Angola, McLuhan disse, negli anni 70, 'riempite la nazione di apparecchi televisivi'; ed è quello che venne fatto; e la rivoluzione in Angola cessò." {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The character "Brian O'Blivion" in [[David Cronenberg]]'s 1983 film [[Videodrome]] is a "media oracle" based on McLuhan.&lt;ref&gt;Lamberti, Elena. ''Marshall McLuhan's Mosaic: Probing the Literary Origins of Media Studies.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, McLuhan was named as the "patron saint" of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired Magazine'']] and a quote of his appeared on the masthead{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} for the first ten years of its publication.&lt;ref name="wired channel" /&gt; He is mentioned by name in a [[Peter Gabriel]]-penned lyric in the song "Broadway Melody of 1974".  This song appears on the [[concept album]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', from [[progressive rock]] band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].  The lyric is:  "Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin' head buried in the sand."  McLuhan is also jokingly referred to during an episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' entitled "[[House Arrest (The Sopranos episode)|House Arrest]]". Despite his death in 1980, someone claiming to be McLuhan was posting on a ''Wired'' mailing list in 1996. The information this individual provided convinced one writer for ''Wired'' that "if the poster was not McLuhan himself, it was a bot programmed with an eerie command of McLuhan's life and inimitable perspective."&lt;ref name="wired channel"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/channeling.html |title=Channeling McLuhan |last=Wolf |first=Gary |date=January 1996 |work=Wired 4.01 |accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new centre known as the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology]], formed soon after his death in 1980, was the successor to McLuhan's Centre for Culture and Technology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Since 1994, it has been part of the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information]] and in 2008 the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology incorporated in the Coach House Institute. The first director was literacy scholar and [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education|OISE]] Professor David R. Olsen. From 1983 until 2008, the McLuhan Program was under the direction of Dr. [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] who was McLuhan's student and translator. From 2008 through 2015 Professor Dominique Scheffel-Dunand of [[York University]] served Director of the Program.
In 2011 at the time of his centenary the Coach House Institute established a Marshall McLuhan Centenary Fellowship program in his honor, and each year appoints up to four fellows for a maximum of two years. In May 2016 the Coach House Institute was renamed the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology; its Interim Director was [[Seamus Ross]] (2015–16). Sarah Sharma, an Associate Professor of Media Theory from the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the Faculty of Information (St. George), began a five-year term as director of the Coach House (2017- ). Professor Sharma's research and teaching focuses on feminist approaches to technology, including issues related to temporality and media. Professor Sharma's thematic for the 2017-2018 Monday Night Seminars at the McLuhan Centre is MsUnderstanding Media which extends and introduces feminist approaches to technology to McLuhan's formulations of technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/|title=Prof. Sarah Sharma Appointed Director of McLuhan Centre - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|date=2016-12-13|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114202736/http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/#|archive-date=2017-11-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Masterpiece''', '''''magnum opus''''' ([[Latin]], ''great work'') or '''''chef-d’œuvre''''' ([[French language|French]], ''master of work'', plural ''chefs-d’œuvre'') in modern use is a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill, profundity, or workmanship. Historically, a "masterpiece" was a work of a very high standard produced to obtain membership of a guild or academy in various areas of the visual arts and crafts.
[[File:Zuccari Two painter's apprentices.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Federico Zuccari]], ''Two Painter's Apprentices'', 1609. They would have to produce a ''masterpiece'' to become masters at the end of their apprenticeships.]]

==Etymology==
The form ''masterstik'' is recorded in English or [[Scots language|Scots]] in a set of [[Aberdeen]] guild regulations dated to 1579, whereas "masterpiece" is first found in 1605, already outside a guild context, in a [[Ben Jonson]] play.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]:"Masterpiece". See also: [http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861628683/masterpiece.html Encarta]. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5TnWWs?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861628683/masterpiece.html Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Masterprize" was another early variant in English.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]:"Masterprize"&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the term rapidly became used in a variety of contexts for an exceptionally good piece of creative work, and was "in early use, often applied to man as the 'masterpiece' of God or Nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], and examples&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the term ''masterpiece'' referred to a piece of work produced by an [[apprentice]] or [[journeyman]] aspiring to become a [[master craftsman]] in the old European [[guild]] system. His fitness to qualify for guild membership was judged partly by the masterpiece, and if he was successful, the piece was retained by the guild. Great care was therefore taken to produce a fine piece in whatever the craft was, whether confectionery, [[painting]], [[goldsmith]]ing, [[Knife making|knifemaking]], or many other trades.

In [[Kingdom of England|England]], in the 17th century, the [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths]], for instance, required an apprentice to produce a masterpiece under their supervision at a "workhouse" in [[Goldsmiths' Hall]]. The workhouse had been set up as part of a tightening of standards after the company became concerned that the level of skill of goldsmithing was being diluted. The wardens of the company had complained in 1607 that the "true practise of the Art &amp; Mystery of Goldsmithry is not only grown into great decays but also dispersed into many parts, so as now very few workmen are able to finish &amp; perfect a piece of plate singularly with all the garnishings &amp; parts thereof without the help of many &amp; several hands...". The same goldsmithing organization still requires the production of a masterpiece but it is no longer produced under supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/library/archives/a-history-of-the-goldsmiths%27-company/ ''A History of the Goldsmiths' Company.''] The Goldsmiths' Company. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldsmiths-centre.org/professional-training/goldsmiths-company-apprenticeship-programme/ Goldsmiths' Company Apprenticeship Programme.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141230121155/http://www.goldsmiths-centre.org/professional-training/goldsmiths-company-apprenticeship-programme/ |date=2014-12-30 }} The Goldsmiths' Centre. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nuremberg, Germany, between 1531 and 1572, apprentices who wished to become master goldsmith were required to produce [[columbine cup]]s, dice for a steel seal, and gold rings set with precious stones before they could be admitted to the goldsmiths' guild. If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves. In some guilds, apprentices were not allowed to marry until they had obtained full membership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O91876/cup-jamnitzer-wenzel/ Cup, Silver, room 69, case 25.] Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Retrieved 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of producing a masterpiece has continued in some modern academies of art, where the general term for such works is now [[reception piece]]. The [[Royal Academy]] in London uses the term "[[diploma work]]" and it has acquired a fine collection of diploma works received as a condition of membership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4995">'''Maximally informative dimensions''' is a [[dimensionality reduction]] technique used in the statistical analyses of [[neural coding|neural responses]]. Specifically, it is a way of projecting a stimulus onto a low-dimensional [[Linear subspace|subspace]] so that as much [[mutual information|information]] as possible about the stimulus is preserved in the neural response. It is motivated by the fact that natural stimuli are typically confined by their [[statistics]] to a lower-dimensional space than that [[linear span|spanned]] by [[white noise]].&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Field. "Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells." J. Opt. Soc. am. A 4:2479-2394, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this subspace, however, [[stimulus-response model|stimulus-response functions]] may be either [[linear]] or [[nonlinear]]. The idea was originally developed by Tatyana Sharpee, Nicole Rust, and [[William Bialek]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpee, Tatyana, Nicole C. Rust, and William Bialek. "Maximally informative dimensions: analyzing neural responses to natural signals." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (2003): 277-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==
Neural stimulus-response functions are typically given as the probability of a [[neuron]] generating an [[action potential]], or spike, in response to a stimulus &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;. The goal of maximally informative dimensions is to find a small relevant subspace of the much larger stimulus space that accurately captures the salient features of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; denote the dimensionality of the entire stimulus space and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; denote the dimensionality of the relevant subspace, such that &lt;math&gt;K \ll D&lt;/math&gt;. We let &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{v}^K\}&lt;/math&gt; denote the basis of the relevant subspace, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}^K&lt;/math&gt; the [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf{v}^K \}&lt;/math&gt;. Using [[Bayes' theorem]] we can write out the probability of a spike given a stimulus:

: &lt;math&gt;P(spike|\mathbf{s}^K) = P(spike)f(\mathbf{s}^K)&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{s}^K) = \frac{P(\mathbf{s}^K|spike)}{P(\mathbf{s}^K)}&lt;/math&gt;

is some nonlinear function of the projected stimulus.

In order to choose the optimal &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf{v}^K \}&lt;/math&gt;, we compare the prior stimulus distribution &lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{s})&lt;/math&gt; with the spike-triggered stimulus distribution &lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{s}|spike)&lt;/math&gt; using the [[mutual information|Shannon information]]. The [[mean|average]] information (averaged across all presented stimuli) per spike is given by

: &lt;math&gt;I_{spike} = \sum_{\mathbf{s}} P(\mathbf{s}|spike) log_2 [P(\mathbf{s}|spike)/P(\mathbf{s})]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;N. Brenner, S. P. Strong, R. Koberle, W. Bialek, and R. R. de Ruyter van Steveninck. "Synergy in a neural code. Neural Comp., 12:1531-1552, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now consider a &lt;math&gt;K = 1&lt;/math&gt; dimensional subspace defined by a single direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. The average information conveyed by a single spike about the projection &lt;math&gt;x = \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;I(\mathbf{v}) = \int dx P_{\mathbf{v}}(x|spike)log2[P_{\mathbf{v}}(x|spike)/P_{\mathbf{v}}(x)]&lt;/math&gt;,

where the probability distributions are approximated by a measured data set via &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathbf{v}}(x|spike) = \langle \delta(x - \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v}) |spike \rangle_{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathbf{v}}(x) = \langle \delta(x - \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v})\rangle_{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., each presented stimulus is represented by a scaled [[Dirac delta function]] and the probability distributions are created by averaging over all spike-eliciting stimuli, in the former case, or the entire presented stimulus set, in the latter case. For a given dataset, the average information is a function only of the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. Under this formulation, the relevant subspace of dimension &lt;math&gt;K = 1&lt;/math&gt; would be defined by the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; that maximizes the average information &lt;math&gt;I(\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;.

This procedure can readily be extended to a relevant subspace of dimension &lt;math&gt;K &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; by defining

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathbf{v}^K}(\mathbf{x}|spike) = \langle \prod_{i=1}^K \delta(x_i - \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i) |spike \rangle_{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathbf{v}^K}(\mathbf{x}) = \langle \prod_{i=1}^K \delta(x_i - \mathbf{s} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i) \rangle_{\mathbf{s}}&lt;/math&gt;

and maximizing &lt;math&gt;I({\mathbf{v}^K})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Importance==

Maximally informative dimensions does not make any assumptions about the [[normal distribution|Gaussianity]] of the stimulus set, which is important, because naturalistic stimuli tend to have non-Gaussian statistics. In this way the technique is more robust than other dimensionality reduction techniques such as [[spike-triggered covariance]] analyses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40897">{{Sociology}}
'''Military sociology''' is a subfield within [[sociology]]. It corresponds closely to C. W. Mills's summons to connect the individual world to broader social structures&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Tyler and Segal, David. 2015. "Military Sociology" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third Edition'', Taylor and Francis. pp. 2133-2138.  DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120053116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, C.W. The Sociological Imagination; Oxford University Press: New York, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;. Military sociology aims toward the systematic study of the military as a [[social group]] rather than as a [[Military organization]]. This highly specialized sub-discipline examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with [[coercion|coerced]] [[collective action]] based on shared [[Interest group|interests]] linked to survival in [[vocation]] and [[combat]], with purposes and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns [[civil-military relations]] and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies.

==Theory and methodology==
Military Sociology reflects the diversity of methods employed by sociology itself. These include large-scale data analysis, participant observation, social network analysis, survey research, social network analysis, comparative history, case studies etc.&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Tyler and Segal, David. 2015. "Military Sociology" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third Edition'', Taylor and Francis. pp. 2133.  DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120053116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary military sociology==
Contemporary military sociology is primarily a result of the [[World War II]] and [[Cold War]] eras. These events initiated the systematic study of military sociology, though it stands to reason that the relationship between the military and society would predate these events. There are numerous topics within military sociology, and it is important to note that its scope is not exclusively limited to the military institution itself or to its members. Rather, military sociology encompasses areas such as [[civilian]]-military relations and the relationship between the military and other military groups or governmental agencies. Other topics within military sociology include:
# the dominant assumptions held by those in the military,
# changes in military members' willingness to fight,
# military unionization,
# military professionalism,
# the increased utilization of women,

==Military as a society==

===Military as an occupation===
There has been discussion about whether the military should be seen as more of an occupation rather than an institution. Although the military still retains institutional principles (patriotic values, historic traditions, etc.) the military is becoming oriented to the principles of business and [[economics]] and can be fairly categorized as a profession. This can be explored in relating to other professions in the grouping of power and compensation. There are different [[military rank|ranks]] within the military, granting some people more power. Many young people look to the military for compensation benefits and the opportunity to attend college without enormous loans. 

===Military as Profession===
Two leading scholars, [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] and [[Morris Janowitz]], influence the notion of military professionalism in military sociology. Huntington argued that there should be a high degree of autonomy within the military profession over military matters., because civilians did not possess the necessary corporate ness or expertise to oversee military matters. He called this objective control.&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Tyler and Segal, David. 2015. "Military Sociology" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third Edition'', Taylor and Francis. pp. 2133-2138.  DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120053116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, S.P. ''The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil–Military Relations''; Harvard University Press: Cambridge, MA, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Janowitz, on the other hand, asserted that the role of the military in modern society was so complex, and with such high stakes that the duty of the professional soldier went well beyond the execution of violence. The elite of the military had an obligation to maintain stable international relations, and this required management expertise and political skills in addition to the classical military officer skillset. Janowitz was concerned that the military profession could become a self-perpetuating, self-serving clique. Therefore, it was important that the military be socially representative of the citizen it served.&lt;ref&gt;Crabb, Tyler and Segal, David. 2015. "Military Sociology" in ''Encyclopedia of Public Administration and Public Policy, Third Edition'', Taylor and Francis. pp. 2133-2138.  DOI: 10.1081/E-EPAP3-120053116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janowitz,M. ''The Professional Soldier: A Social and Political Portrait''; Free Press: Glencoe IL, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sam C. Sarkesian and Robert E. Connor, the military profession holds the view that it is a unique profession. There are six key elements that are paramount in shaping the character of the military profession.  These are listed as:
# The profession has a defined area of competence based on expert knowledge;
# there is a system of continuing education designed so as to maintain professional competence;
# the profession has an obligation to society and must serve it without concern for remuneration;
# it has a system of values that perpetuate professional character and establish and maintain legitimate relationships with society;
# there is an institutional framework within which the profession functions; and
# the profession has control over the system of rewards and punishments and is in a position to determine the quality of those entering the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkesian, Sam C. and Robert E. Connor, Jr. ''The US Military Profession into the 21st Century''. Frank Cass Publishers; Portland, c.1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment practices===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

Perhaps no other institution places as much emphasis on procedures for [[wikt:assimilation|assimilating]] new members as does the armed forces. Assimilation involves the continuous process of [[recruitment]], selection, [[basic training|training]], and career development. Not only must the new recruit, officer, or enlisted officer learn new and difficult skills. He or she is also expected to master an elaborate code of professional behavior and etiquette, since membership in the military means participation in an organizational community which regulates behavior both on and off the "job". The American Military utilizes the [[Militia|citizen-soldier concept]] to gather military personnel from across the country. This term means the ability to quickly round up or call up troops for war or [[Military deployment|military tour]] at a virtual moment's notice. But once the assignment or tour is over, the military personnel are returned to civilian life.

According to [[Norman A. Hilman]] 2.5 million men were enlisted into military during the peacetime draft. During that rapid transitional period, many soldiers may have felt lost or confused by the differences in their previous life (civilian) and their new military life, which calls for a demand to conform to new orders that are expected to be followed without question. Although, there were many men and now women who have voluntarily joined in the armed forces, there are those who view joining the military and working for the government as selling out. The negative characterization of military life can be a real turn off for most people looking from the outside. Despite the negative thoughts about military life and the incentives of economic security, military recruitment practices changed from a means to help one's country into a way to attain an education back to a need to serve one's country, in recent years. Throughout its changes the enlisting numbers have not declined, they have stayed steady, if not increasing over the years.

===The effects of military life on dependants (and the influence of military dependent subcultures)===
A military family by definition is a unit that may consist of husband and wife and [[military brat|children]] (in many English-speaking countries, called [[military brat]]s, which is a term of respect and endearment, not an insult); with either the husband and/or wife as the primary military enlisted. The emotional [[Stress (biological)|stress]] that a partner can experience, before, during and after a soldier, sailor, marine or airman's deployment is perhaps just as bad mentally, as the one who is fighting in the military. Those whose husbands or wives were [[military deployment|deployed]] for the first time, rated their feelings about the whole experience as being very sad, and found it difficult to cope with the sudden absence of their loved one. However, women or men whose spouses have been deployed prior, coped with the present deployment with more positive reactions. They felt that they had a job to do away from home that was important and they and the rest of their family (children) had to be supportive and take care of things while the family member was away. Children begin taking on more adult responsibilities like: cooking, cleaning, getting groceries, etc. Despite the positive coping skills of some military families, some do not do well on their own coping with the long separation from their family and family members. Stressors and stress reactions of spouses vary over time. What is perceived as stressful before the deployment differs from what is perceived as stressful during and after the deployment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  Most deployments last 6–18 months, and during this time, the role that the members of the family believe they should hold changes.  This often makes it difficult for all members of the family.

Approximately one-fifth of all enlisted 18-year-olds and one-third of all junior personnel in the United States Army are married, compared to less than 5% of civilian 18-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Military Family: A Practice Guide for Human Service Providers|last= Martin|first= James |author2=Leora Rosen |author3=Linette Sparacino|year= 2000|publisher= Praeger Publishers|isbn= 978-0-275-96540-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, young military families experience many of the same hardships that can accompany the start of a family in greater numbers than young civilian families.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Life In the U.S. Armed Forces|last= Baker|first= Anni|year= 2008|publisher= Praeger|isbn= 978-0-275-98982-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like young civilian families, young military families may also experience maturity issues, life inexperience, low incomes, and living away from home.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; But these issues are compounded by the fact that young military families also experience special hardships not experienced by young civilian families.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; For example, while many young families, both military and civilian, often endure difficulties, civilian families are more likely to have the support of family and friends which is less likely to be an option for military families (e.g. on a [[military base]] stationed in a foreign country).&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

Another hardship experienced more commonly by military families (compared with civilian families) is frequent [[Relocation (personal)|relocation]]. Approximately 33% of military families relocate every year compared to only 5% of civilian families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Military Compensation in the Age of Two-Income Households: Adding Spouses' Earnings to the Compensation Policy Mix|last= Wardynski|first= 2. Casey|year= 2000|publisher= Rand|location= Santa Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special planning must be undertaken by families in which both parents are on active duty, as either could be (re)deployed at any time.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; (Planning for this contingency can be especially difficult.) In other military families with only one active-duty-parent, the other parent is less likely to stay at home with children as in the past.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; Rather, they are more likely to find employment and/or attend college, and therefore find constant relocations more stressful due to the commitments to working and studying, respectively.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

Military families have the option of living at the parents’ place of employment.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; For families living in an on-base house, they must follow the rules of the base command and the housing office on how to maintain their property and are afforded little privacy.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; In short, they may experience pressure to conform to the base’s standards of behavior.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt; Some families may opt not to live on base, but off-base housing is usually more expensive and can be inconvenient.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;

===Stress and military service===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}

De Soir suggests there are seven stages in the way partners of married personnel experience stress before, during and after deployment.&lt;ref&gt;p.213, Moelker and van der Kloet&lt;/ref&gt;

;Initial Shock and Protest: This period usually lasts about two weeks. In this stage family members are upset and angry at the news of deployment. This is usually a time of heightened emotions. In the past many families were only given a month's notice to get ready for deployment, but recently many families have been given a year or more of notice of deployment, which might make the stressful time of anticipation even worse. Many recent reports suggest the ideal preparation time for deployment would be 3–5 months.

;Disengagement and Alienation: During the last days prior to departure, couples enter this stage. They experience periods of distancing because of their feelings uncertainty about the future of the mission, but also during that stage, a lot of latent problems or concern may surface that could add more potential stress, such as arguments and confessions that can't be address fully in those last moments before a person's deployment. These moments create a lot of emotional distress.

;Emotional Disorganization: Shortly after the family member has been deployed, there are feelings of sadness and it is possible that symptoms of [[clinical depression]] may begin, along with issues with [[sleep disorder|sleeping]] and problems getting back into the rhythm of life ([[eating disorder]]s). These issues last for about six weeks, perhaps longer, especially, if the deployment doesn't go well or there are reports of bad news to the family. The best way to get family and spouses over this period, is for the deployed personnel to contact their family as soon as they arrive at their destinations as soon as military authority permits. This can help the family feel less stress over the deployment duration. Constant contact is a key part to decreasing a stressful family life.

;Recovery and Stabilization: Usually after six weeks the family will fall back into a more distressed family pattern, and recover by becoming accustomed to the situation of a missing family member who has been deployed. Starting and maintaining a daily routine at this stage is the best way to keep the mind off of what the deployed may be doing or where the deployed may be at this point. The involvement of "home front groups" are essential to military families who need to share and enjoy time with others who have military spouses and partners deployed for long periods of time. Seeking [[support group]]s are one of many ways people cope with stressful issues.

===Age as a factor===
{{Globalize|date=September 2010}}
In the United States, almost half of the enlisted force is below 25 for both men and women&lt;ref name="primary" /&gt; with the average age being 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2001/chapter3/chapter3_1.htm Chapter 3 - Age]&lt;/ref&gt; The trend of youth is perpetuated by the fact that most people enter into the service at 18 years of age&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2001/chapter3/chapter3_1.htm &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2005/appendixb/b_01.html&lt;/ref&gt; and leave after only a few years.&lt;ref name="primary" /&gt; This creates a situation in which those with college experience are underrepresented in military as they only make up 8.5% of the military force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2002/chapter2/c2_education.htm Chapter 2 - Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Youth inclusion in armed conflict is not a new concept or one restricted to large well organized forces such as the United States military. In various societies over time, youth has been prized in armed conflict. Such instances include the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] of the [[Sudan]], boys who received spears as an [[initiation rite]] between sixteen and eighteen years of age, the nineteenth-century [[Cheyenne]] who joined their first war parties when they were about fourteen, and the female warriors of [[Dahomey]] who were recruited between nine and fifteen.&lt;ref name="youth" /&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], it has been estimated that between 250,000 and 420,000 soldiers under 18 years of age served in Union and Confederate armies, which yields somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of recruits.&lt;ref name="youth"&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/prhome/poprep2002/chapter2/c2_education.htm &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Cite book|author= Rosen, David |year=2005 | title=Armies of the Young |publisher=Greenwood Press | location =Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-22900-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these earlier periods youth was not looked upon in the context of innocence as it is framed today, rather children were seen as naturally existing with adults, as they frequently coexisted with them through apprenticeships and other work. It was not until formal education became more widespread that a change in attitudes towards youth develop, and consequently a prolongation of the perceived youth period.&lt;ref name="youth" /&gt;

===Religion in the military===
{{see also|Religious symbolism in the United States military}}
In the past, all U.S. [[service academies]] required attendance to religious services which in 1972 was found to be unconstitutional by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] for the [[District of Columbia]] Circuit in [[Anderson v. Laird]]. Despite this, the Naval Academy still has prayer before meals and attendance is required at these meals. This has caused some students at the Naval Academy to seek legal help from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. A comparable practice of pre-meal prayers for compulsory meals at the [[Virginia Military Institute]] was found unconstitutional by the [[4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[Mellen v. Bunting]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://pewresearch.org/pubs/890/religion-in-the-military|title= Organized Religion’s Role in the Military|accessdate= 2008-07-22|author= |last= Merriam|first= Jesse|date= July 8, 2008|publisher= Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious spectrum of the United States military is comparable to that of the general population. In comparison with the nearest available age group, a demographic of 20- to 39-year-olds that make up eighty percent of the military, there are slight variations. Mainline Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, and Buddhists are underrepresented, but other Christian religions (such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, Church of God, Seventh Day Adventists, Assemblies of God, and others) disproportionately overrepresented, at nearly three times the percentage in the applicable demographic. Those reporting atheism or no religion are very slightly overrepresented. None of these differences account for more than a 10% spread, Christians self-identifying as Protestant only constituting the largest discrepancy. The data and other studies suggest that servicemembers may be less likely to identify with mainstream religious organizations than the country's general population.&lt;ref name=primary/&gt;

===Minorities in the military===
Throughout history non-indigenous members of minority groups have been absorbed into military service. Examples of this practice in ancient armies include Hannibal's use of Ethiopian soldiers, the Roman [[Auxilia]], the Byzantine Empire's recruitment of the Middle Eastern population, and the Ottoman Empire's use of religious minorities through the [[Millet system]]. In these cases where military service was voluntary, minorities saw it as an opportunity to progress socially in the society, and perhaps achieve citizenship for themselves and by extension, to their children. For most of the history of minority groups in military organizations, minorities were often segregated from the dominant racial group by forming separate contingents for such groups. This was true in ancient military organizations, but also in a more recent historical context through the French-Canadian regiments of Canada during [[World War I]], and [[World War II]], the British army and their conscription of various minority groups from their conquests during colonialism, and the segregation of minority groups into Caucasian commanded, minority composed, regiments during similar time periods as mentioned previously. In the case of the United States, African-American participation in the military after World War II was high due to the better treatment afforded African-Americans in the military by Caucasian members. With the end of job exclusion by 1954 reenlistment rates increased on average until they were close to double that of Caucasian servicemen. A similar situation arose in the United Kingdom with minority participation, but both situations saw a sharp disparity in upper rank distribution, as both had, and to a lesser extent, still have a disproportionately low level of upper ranked minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Young, Warren |year=1982 | title=Minorities and the military |publisher=Greenwood Press | location =Connecticut |isbn= 0-313-22900-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the military===
{{Main|Women in the military}}
Military and gender issues is a diverse and plural field within military sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Fasting, Kari and Trond Svela Sand eds., (2010). "Gender and Military Issues - A Categorized Research Bibliography." ''Moving Soldiers - Soldaten i bevegelse'' 01/2010. {{ISSN|1891-8751}}. [http://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/99263/01%20Gender%20and%20Military.pdf?sequence=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The roles of women can include being the transmitter of cultural values to children, reproducers of boundaries and active militants in national struggles. Women have served in the military throughout history. Women's military recruitment rejects the idea that 'women should be protected'. Recruitment is very important in Latin America, Israel, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Northern Ireland. In Turkey, the wife of the chief commander represents the mother of the military family. Some states in the developing world are [[egalitarian]] and many women are recruited into the military to achieve the modern ideal. With women's customary role as a nurturer and mother, the increased equality and inclusion of women in the military could change the reason for war or [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of wars.&lt;ref&gt;Toktas, Sule.

[[Sexual assault in the United States military]] is an issue for military women. The 2012 Pentagon survey found approximately 26,000 women and men were sexually assaulted. Of those, only 3,374 cases were reported. In 2013, a new Pentagon report found that 5,061 troops reported cases of assault. Many people are optimistic that this 50% increase in reports is indicative of victims "growing more comfortable in the system." Of these reported, however, only 484 cases went to trial, and only 376 resulted in convictions.

During [[World War II]] women served in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corp (WAAC) which was later renamed [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC). In addition, there was [[WAVES]], or Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Jane Addams]] and [[Cynthia Enloe]] have been identified as women who have contributed key ideas to military sociology &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.routledge.com/Sociology-and-Military-Studies-Classical-and-Current-Foundations/Soeters/p/book/9781138739536] Soeters, Joseph. 2018.

Enloe's influence is traced to her feminist view of the military.

===Homosexuality and the military===
{{Main|Homosexuality in the military}}
[[Homosexual]]s were not recruited into the U.S. military from [[World War II]] to the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] presidency. In 1993, the Clinton administration began the policy of "[[Don't ask, don't tell|Don't ask, Don't tell, Don't pursue]]", meaning that military personnel will be neither compelled ("Don't ask") nor allowed ("Don't tell") nor harassed ("Don't pursue") to disclose or discuss their [[sexual identity]] while serving in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Yoshino, Kenji |year=2006 | title=Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights |publisher=Random House | location =New York |isbn= 0-375-50820-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Don't ask, Don't tell, Don't pursue" policy actually had the effect of increasing discharges due to homosexuality from 617 in 1994 to 1,273 in
2001.&lt;ref&gt;Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, “Conduct Unbecoming: The Tenth Annual Report on ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue, Don’t Harass,’” (March 24, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates have been made that in 2000 there were 1 million gay and lesbian veterans in the U.S. population as based on census information.&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Gates, Gay Men and Lesbians in the U.S. Military: Estimates From Census 2000 (Washington, DC: Urban Institute Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexual women with partners reported higher rates of military service than other women, while homosexual male veterans served for a similar amount of time as heterosexual male veterans.&lt;ref name=primary&gt;David R. Segal and Mady Wechsler Segal (2004) "America’s Military Population" Population Bulletin Vol. 59, No.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military Science===
Recently there has been interest in how the modern militaries have constructed their knowledge.  Military science in modern armed forces has taken on the aura of a hard science when it is arguably a combination of hard science, sociology ("soft science"), and military history (the humanities).  Postmodern deconstructions of the assumptions behind modern military science can be effective in revealing how modern militaries have socially constructed their reality.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Paparone (2013), ''The Sociology of Military Science,'' NY: Bloomsbury.  Also, Chris Paparone (2017) "How we fight: A critical exploration of US military doctrine." Organization 24, no. 4: 516-533. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Military and society==

===Political control of the military===
In the modern relationship between the military and the state, the state relies on the military to protect it from external threats as well as violence between various internal groups. Concurrently, the military draws so-called 'violent resources' from the state and from society. Such resources can include money, technology, raw materials, and manpower. The relationship has changed somewhat from the 16th and 17th centuries, however, where internal centers of power and specific sectors of society (e.g., skilled builders or [[guild]]s) were somewhat more autonomous than the rest. These sectors were not under the direct control of the sovereign power and could avoid feeding resources to the state. This meant that pre-modern militaries were 1) somewhat weaker than the modern version due to a lack of state-funded resources but also 2) powerful sectors of society that controlled certain privately funded resources and which could raise their own mercenary forces if needed.
As this system began to evolve, states started to exert more control over society by exploiting 'existential fears' which led to the creation of various [[bureaucratic]] methods including mass conscription, [[tax system]]s, and territorial centralization. The result is that various civil sectors began to work exclusively for the state, which in turn desired a stronger military, and which used these sectors to extract more resources and more manpower for exclusive military use. This 'modern' military now was reliant on the state for its very existence, whereas, in pre-modern times, the military could be the tool of various autonomous sectors of society.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Yagil. &lt;nowiki&gt;"&lt;/nowiki&gt;Controlling the Invisible: The Deficient Political Control of the Modern Military&lt;nowiki&gt;"&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

===Military's use of research and industry===
Burkard Schmitt a Research Fellow for the [[European Union Institute for Security Studies|EU Institute for Security Studies]] identifies two types of research. [[Pure research]] is done from the bottom-up with no specific demand and are long term oriented. Capability research is done from the top down, most research of this type is defined for mostly military use with a specific goal in mind.&lt;ref name=security&gt;Schmitt, Burkard. The European Union and Armaments: Getting a bigger bang for the Euro. ''Institute for Security Studies, August 2003.'' [http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/cp063e.pdf www.iss-eu.org]. 23 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Europe
Few European countries have had significant investments in research and technology. National sensitivities and defense companies that are hesitant to share research findings has long hindered research in Europe. This is beginning to change with the formation and strengthening of the [[European Union|EU]] and the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]] (CSDP). The EU is currently implementing its "Agenda for advanced research relating to global security" which is crucial to the future of European security. The idea in Europe is that research should be undertaken by all member states. A goal for member states and something to aid future research is a "harmonization" of military requirements.&lt;ref name=security/&gt;
;United States
The American model for research is based on the old German standard, which the Americans emulated starting from the founding of the [[American Chemical Society]] in 1876. The use of research and industry to develop new and more deadly [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological weapon]]s is an intriguing aspect of the modern military. German universities were involved in early chemical gas development for use in World War I. German universities "carefully cultivated the ideal of science as an emphatically value-free activity; they bestowed upon their wards the right and the duty to serve the interests of knowledge and to brush aside other interests with which the welfare of scientific pursuits might clash." American universities also had chemical labs, [[Harvard University]] began work on [[poison gas]] in 1917. By World War I, the chemical industry began to influence politics because of the great interdependence between industry, military and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt, Bauman (2000). ''Modernity and the Holocaust.'' New York: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of research that is done relates to the U.S. economy, which includes [[Military budget of the United States|the largest military budget in the world]]. This has created a strong link between military, the state, and corporate America. This has been called the "[[military industrial complex]]", but the military has also dominated large university science departments. This concept is the military industrial academic complex, or MIA.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, C. Wright(1956). ''The Power Elite.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22681">'''Mobilities''' is a contemporary [[paradigm]] in the [[social science]]s that explores the movement of people ([[Human migration]], [[travel]], [[transport]]), ideas (see e.g. [[meme]]) and things (transport), as well as the broader social implications of those movements.

A mobility "turn" (or transformation) in the social sciences began in the 1990s in response to the increasing realization of the historic and contemporary importance of movement on individuals and society. This turn has been driven by generally increased levels of mobility and new forms of mobility where bodies combine with information and different patterns of mobility. The mobilities paradigm incorporates new ways of theorizing about how these mobilities lie "at the center of constellations of power, the creation of identities and the microgeographies of everyday life." ([[Tim Cresswell|Cresswell]], 2011, 551)

The mobility turn arose as a response to the way in which the social sciences had traditionally been static, seeing movement as a [[black box]] and ignoring or trivializing "the importance of the systematic movements of people for work and family life, for leisure and pleasure, and for politics and protest" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 208). Mobilities emerged as a critique of contradictory orientations toward both [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentarism]] and deterritorialisation in social science. People had often been seen as static entities tied to specific places, or as [[nomad]]ic and placeless in a frenetic and [[globalization|globalized]] existence. Mobilities looks at movements and the forces that drive, constrain and are produced by those movements.

Several typologies have been formulated to clarify the wide variety of mobilities. Most notably, John Urry&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. 2000 Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century. London:  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J., 2007. Mobilities. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; divides mobilities into five types: mobility of objects, corporeal mobility, imaginative mobility, virtual mobility and communicative mobility. Later, Leopoldina Fortunati and Sakari Taipale&lt;ref&gt;Fortunati, L. &amp; Taipale, S. 2017. Mobilities and the Network of Personal Technologies: Refining the Understanding of Mobility Structure. Telematics and Informatics, 34(2), 560–568. https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2016.09.011 &lt;/ref&gt; proposed an alternative typology taking the individual and the human body as a point of reference. They differentiate between ‘macro-mobilities’ (consistent physical displacements), ‘micro-mobilities’ (small-scale displacements), ‘media mobility’ (mobility added to the traditionally fixed forms of media) and ‘disembodied mobility’ (the transformation in the social order). The categories are typically considered interrelated, and therefore they are not exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Taipale, S. 2013. Mobilities in Finland’s Information Society Strategies from 1995 to 2010, Mobilities, 8(2), 293-311. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17450101.2012.655975 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taipale, S. 2014.

==Scope==

While mobilities is commonly associated with [[sociology]], contributions to the mobilities literature have come from scholars in [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[migration studies]], [[science and technology studies]], and [[tourism geography|tourism]] and [[transport]] studies. (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 207)

Mobilities as a specific body of research remains associated with a small group of largely British researchers, notably [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]], [[Mimi Sheller]], Peter Adey, Tim Edensor, David Bissell, and [[Tim Cresswell]]. However, Cresswell (2011, 555) notes that "many people involved in research on mobility topics do not see themselves as part of a new paradigm or turn" (e.g. [[Noel B. Salazar]]). The community of mobilities researchers, as well as the areas they research, have expanded across the globe.

The eponymous journal ''Mobilities'' provides a list of typical subjects which have been explored in the mobilities paradigm (Taylor and Francis, 2011):
* Mobile spatiality and temporality
* [[sustainable mobility|Sustainable]] and alternative mobilities
* Mobile rights and risks
* New [[social networks]] and [[mobile media]]
* Immobilities and [[social exclusion]]s
* [[Tourism]] and [[travel]] mobilities
* [[Human migration|Migration]] and [[diaspora]]s
* [[Transportation]] and [[communication technologies]]
* Transitions in complex systems

==Origins==

Sheller and Urry (2006, 215) place mobilities in the sociological tradition by defining the primordial theorist of mobilities as [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918). Simmel's essays, "Bridge and Door" (Simmel, 1909 / 1994) and "The Metropolis and Mental Life" (Simmel, 1903 / 2001) identify a uniquely human will to connection, as well as the urban demands of tempo and precision that are satisfied with mobility.

The more immediate precursors of contemporary mobilities research emerged in the 1990s (Cresswell 2011, 551). Historian [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] (1997) advocated for a shift from deep analysis of particular places to the routes connecting them. [[Marc Augé]] (1995) considered the philosophical potential of an anthropology of "non-places" like [[airport]]s and [[motorway]]s that are characterized by constant transition and temporality. Sociologist [[Manuel Castells]] outlined a "network society" and suggested that the "space of places" is being surpassed by a "space of flows." Feminist scholar [[Caren Kaplan]] (1996) explored questions about the gendering of metaphors of travel in social and cultural theory.

The contemporary paradigm under the moniker "mobilities" appears to originate with the work of sociologist [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]]. In his book, ''Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century'', Urry (2000, 1) presents a "manifesto for a sociology that examines the diverse mobilities of peoples, objects, images, information and wastes; and of the complex interdependencies between, and social consequences of, these diverse mobilities."

This is consistent with the aims and scope of the eponymous journal ''Mobilities'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rmob20/current#.VKZE_ZOZE_Y ''Mobilities''] ({{ISSN|1745-0101}} (print), {{ISSN|1745-011X}} (online))&lt;/ref&gt; which "examines both the large-scale movements of people, objects, capital, and information across the world, as well as more local processes of daily transportation, movement through public and private spaces, and the travel of material things in everyday life" (Taylor and Francis, 2011).

In 2006, Mimi Sheller and John Urry published an oft-cited paper that examined the mobilities paradigm as it was just emerging, exploring its motivations, theoretical underpinnings, and methodologies. Sheller and Urry specifically focused on [[automobility]] as a powerful socio-technical system that "impacts not only on local [[public space]]s and opportunities for coming together, but also on the formation of gendered subjectivities, familial and social networks, spatially segregated urban neighborhoods, national images and aspirations to modernity, and global relations ranging from transnational migration to terrorism and [[oil war]]s" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 209).

Mobilities can be viewed as an extension of the "[[spatial turn]]" in the arts and sciences in the 1980s, in which scholars began "to interpret space and the spatiality of human life with the same critical insight and interpretive power as have traditionally been given to time and history (the historicality of human life) on one hand, and to social relations and society (the sociality of human life) on the other" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 216; Engel and Nugent, 2010, 1; Soja, 1999 / 2005, 261).

Engel and Nugent (2010) trace the conceptual roots of the spatial turn to [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Henri Lefebvre]] (1974), although [[Fredric Jameson]] appears to have coined the epochal usage of the term for the 1980s paradigm shift. Jameson (1988 / 2003, 154) notes that the concept of the spatial turn "has often seemed to offer one of the more productive ways of distinguishing postmodernism from modernism proper, whose experience of temporality -- existential time, along with deep memory -- it is henceforth conventional to see as dominant of the high modern."

For Oswin &amp; Yeoh (2010) mobility seems to be inextricably intertwined with late-modernity and the end of the nation-state. The sense of mobility makes us to think in migratory and tourist fluxes as well as the necessary infrastructure for that displacement takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Oswin, N. Y., Yeoh, B. "Introduction: Mobile City Singapore". ''Mobilities'' Vol. 5 (2), 2010, pp. 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt; R. Tzanelli (2014) explains that modernity has recycled the human emotions, particularly trauma, whatever their cause may be, to generate a logic of spectacle.  Any mediated and consumed event not only destroys the previous states of conflicts and cleavages, but provides a one-sided ideological message to visitors. Tourism is for Tzanelli more than a mechanism to control, it is an instrument of [[ideology]]. The efficacy for state to reduce the discrepancy and discontent of citizenry consists in commoditizing the human suffering into affordable products.&lt;ref&gt;Tzanelli, R. (2014). "Embodied art and aesthetic performativity in the London 2012 handover to Rio (2016)". ''Global Studies Journal'', 6(2), 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

P. Vannini (2012) opted to see mobility as a projection of existent cultural values, expectances and structures that denotes styles of life. Mobility after all would not only generate effects on people's behaviour but also specific styles of life. Vannini explains convincingly that on [[Canada]]'s coast, the values of islanders defy the hierarchal order in populated cities from many perspectives. Islanders prioritize the social cohesion and trust of their communities before the alienation of mega-cities. There is a clear physical isolation that marks the boundaries between urbanity and rurality. From another view, nonetheless, this ideological dichotomy between authenticity and alienation leads residents to commercialize their spaces to outsiders. Although the tourism industry is adopted in these communities as a form of activity, many locals have historically migrated from urban populated cities.&lt;ref&gt;Vannini, P. (2012). ''Ferry Tales: Mobility, places and time on Canada's West Coast''. New York, [[Routledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobilities and transportation geography==

The intellectual roots of mobilities in sociology distinguish it from traditional transportation studies and [[transportation geography]], which have firmer roots in mid 20th century [[Positivism|positivist]] spatial science.

Cresswell (2011, 551) presents six characteristics distinguishing mobilities from prior approaches to the study of migration or transport:

* Mobilities often links science and social science to the [[humanities]].
* Mobilities often links across different scales of movement, while traditional transportation geography tends to focus on particular forms of movement at only one scale (such as local traffic studies or household travel surveys).
* Mobilities encompasses the movement of people, objects, and ideas, rather than narrowly focusing on areas like passenger [[modal shift]] or [[freight logistics]].
* Mobilities considers both motion and "stopping, stillness and relative immobility."
* Mobilities incorporates mobile theorization and methodologies to avoid the privileging of "notions of boundedness and the sedentary."
* Mobilities often embraces the political and differential politics of mobility, as opposed to the apolitical, "objective" stance often sought by researchers associated with engineering disciplines

Mobilities can be seen as a postmodern descendant of modernist [[transportation studies]], with the influence of the spatial turn corresponding to a "[[post-structuralist]] agnosticism about both naturalistic and universal explanations and about single-voiced historical narratives, and to the concomitant recognition that position and context are centrally and inescapably implicated in all constructions of knowledge" (Cosgrove, 1999, 7; Warf and Arias, 2009).

Despite these [[ontological]] and [[epistemological]] differences, Shaw and Hesse (2010, 207) have argued that mobilities and transport geography represent points on a continuum rather than incompatible extremes. Indeed, traditional transport geography has not been wholly quantitative any more than mobilities is wholly qualitative. Sociological explorations of mobility can incorporate empirical techniques, while model-based inquiries can be tempered with richer understandings of the meanings, representations and assumptions inherently embedded in models.

Shaw and Sidaway (2010, 505) argue that even as research in the mobilities paradigm has attempted to reengage transportation and the social sciences, mobilities shares a fate similar to traditional transportation geography in still remaining outside the mainstream of the broader academic geographic community.

==Theoretical underpinnings of Mobilities==

Sheller and Urry (2006, 215-217) presented six bodies of theory underpinning the mobilities paradigm:

The prime theoretical foundation of mobilities is the work of early 20th-century sociologist [[Georg Simmel]], who identified a uniquely human "will to connection," and provided a theoretical connection between mobility and materiality. Simmel focused on the increased tempo of [[urban sociology|urban life]], that "drives not only its social, economic, and [[urban infrastructure|infrastructural]] formations, but also the psychic forms of the urban dweller." Along with this tempo comes a need for precision in timing and location in order to prevent chaos, which results in [[complexity|complex]] and novel systems of relationships.

A second body of theory comes from the science and technology studies which look at mobile sociotechnical systems that incorporate hybrid geographies of human and nonhuman components. [[Automobile]], [[rail transport|rail]] or [[air transport]] systems involve complex [[transport network]]s that affect society and are affected by society. These networks can have dynamic and enduring parts. Non-transport information networks can also have unpredictable effects on encouraging or suppressing physical mobility (Pellegrino 2012).

A third body of theory comes from the [[postmodern]] conception of [[spatiality]], with the substance of places being constantly in [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and subject to constant reassembly and reconfiguration (Thrift 1996).

A fourth body of theory is a "recentring of the corporeal body as an affective vehicle through which we sense place and movement, and construct emotional geographies". For example, the car is "experienced through a combination of senses and sensed through multiple registers of motion and emotion″ (Sheller and Urry 2006, 216).

A fifth body of theory incorporates how [[topologies]] of social networks relate to how complex [[pattern formation|patterns form and change]]. Contemporary information technologies and ways of life often create broad but weak social ties across time and space, with [[interpersonal relationships|social life]] incorporating fewer chance meetings and more networked connections.

Finally, the last body of theory is the analysis of complex transportation systems that are "neither perfectly ordered nor anarchic." For example, the rigid spatial coupling, operational timings, and historical bindings of rail contrast with unpredictable environmental conditions and ever-shifting political winds. And, yet, "change through the accumulation of small repetitions...could conceivably tip the [[car dependence|car system]] into the [[car-free movement|postcar system]]."

==Mobilities methodologies==

Mimi Sheller and John Urry (2006, 217-219) presented seven methodological areas often covered in mobilities research:

* Analysis of the patterning, timing and causation of face-to-face co-presence
* Mobile [[ethnography]] - participation in patterns of movement while conducting ethnographic research
* Time-space diaries - subjects record what they are doing, at what times and in what places
* Cyber-research - exploration of virtual mobilities through various forms of electronic connectivity
* Study of experiences and feelings
* Study of memory and private worlds via photographs, letters, images and souvenirs
* Study of in-between places and transfer points like lounges, waiting rooms, cafes, amusement arcades, parks, hotels, airports, stations, motels, harbors

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17173">{{dablink|This article is about molecular photodissociation. The term "photodissociation" may also refer to nuclear photodissociation.}}

'''Photodissociation''', '''photolysis''', or '''photodecomposition''' is a [[chemical reaction]] in which a [[chemical compound]] is broken down by [[photon]]s.  It is defined as the interaction of one or more photons with one target molecule. 
Photodissociation is not limited to [[visible light]].  Any photon with sufficient [[energy]] can affect the chemical bonds of a chemical compound.  Since a photon's energy is inversely proportional to its wavelength, [[electromagnetic wave]]s with the energy of visible light or higher, such as [[ultraviolet light]], [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s are usually involved in such reactions.

==Photolysis in photosynthesis==
Photolysis is part of the [[light-dependent reaction]]s of [[photosynthesis]]. The general reaction of photosynthetic photolysis can be given as

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A + 2 photons (light) → 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A

The chemical nature of "A" depends on the type of organism.  In [[purple sulfur bacteria]], [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is oxidized to sulfur (S). In oxygenic photosynthesis, water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) serves as a substrate for photolysis resulting in the generation of [[dioxygen|diatomic oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  This is the process which returns oxygen to Earth's atmosphere. Photolysis of water occurs in the [[thylakoid]]s of [[cyanobacterium|cyanobacteria]] and the [[chloroplast]]s of [[green algae]] and [[plant]]s.

=== Energy transfer models ===
The conventional, [[First quantization|semi-classical]], model describes the photosynthetic energy transfer process as one in which excitation energy hops from light-capturing pigment molecules to reaction center molecules step-by-step down the molecular energy ladder.

The effectiveness of photons of different wavelengths depends on the absorption spectra of the [[photosynthetic pigment]]s in the organism. [[Chlorophyll]]s absorb light in the violet-blue and red parts of the spectrum, while [[accessory pigment]]s capture other wavelengths as well. The [[phycobilin]]s of red algae absorb blue-green light which penetrates deeper into water than red light, enabling them to photosynthesize in deep waters. Each absorbed photon causes the formation of an [[exciton]] (an electron excited to a higher energy state) in the pigment molecule. The energy of the exciton is transferred to a [[chlorophyll]] molecule ([[P680]], where P stands for pigment and 680 for its absorption maximum at 680&amp;nbsp;nm) in the reaction center of [[photosystem II]] via [[resonance energy transfer]]. P680 can also directly absorb a photon at a suitable wavelength.

Photolysis during photosynthesis occurs in a series of light-driven [[Redox|oxidation]] events. The energized electron (exciton) of P680 is captured by a primary electron acceptor of the photosynthetic [[electron transfer chain]] and thus exits photosystem II. In order to repeat the reaction, the electron in the reaction center needs to be replenished. This occurs by oxidation of water in the case of oxygenic photosynthesis. The electron-deficient reaction center of photosystem II (P680*) is the strongest [[Biological oxidizer|biological oxidizing agent]] yet discovered, which allows it to break apart molecules as stable as water.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Neil Campbell (scientist)|Campbell]]| first = Neil A. |author2=Reece, Jane B. | title = Biology | edition = 7th | publisher = Pearson - Benjamin Cummings | date = 2005 | location = San Francisco | pages = 186–191 | isbn = 0-8053-7171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water-splitting reaction is catalyzed by the [[oxygen evolving complex]] of photosystem II. This protein-bound inorganic complex contains four manganese ions, plus calcium and chloride ions as cofactors. Two water molecules are complexed by the manganese cluster, which then undergoes a series of four electron removals (oxidations) to replenish the reaction center of photosystem II. At the end of this cycle, free oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is generated and the hydrogen of the water molecules has been converted to four protons released into the thylakoid lumen (Dolai's S-state diagrams).&lt;ref&gt;  Dolai, U. (2017). "Chemical Scheme of Water -Splitting Process during Photosynthesis by the way of Experimental Analysis ". IOSR Journal of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences.  12(6):65-67. doi: 10.9790/3008-1206026567. ISSN 2319-7676.&lt;/ref&gt;

These protons, as well as additional protons pumped across the thylakoid membrane coupled with the electron transfer chain, form a [[proton gradient]] across the membrane that drives [[photophosphorylation]] and thus the generation of chemical energy in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). The electrons reach the [[P700]] reaction center of [[photosystem I]] where they are energized again by light. They are passed down another electron transfer chain and finally combine with the [[coenzyme]] NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and protons outside the thylakoids to form [[NADPH]]. Thus, the net oxidation reaction of water photolysis can be written as:

:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 8 photons (light) → 2 NADPH + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The free energy change (ΔG) for this reaction is 102 kilocalories per mole. Since the energy of light at 700&amp;nbsp;nm is about 40 kilocalories per mole of photons, approximately 320 kilocalories of light energy are available for the reaction. Therefore, approximately one-third of the available light energy is captured as NADPH during photolysis and electron transfer. An equal amount of ATP is generated by the resulting proton gradient. Oxygen as a byproduct is of no further use to the reaction and thus released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Raven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Raven | first = Peter H. |author2=Ray F.

==== Quantum models ====

In 2007 a quantum model was proposed by [[Graham Fleming]] and his co-workers which includes the possibility that photosynthetic energy transfer might involve quantum oscillations, explaining its unusually high [[Photosynthetic efficiency|efficiency]].&lt;ref name="QB"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Engel Gregory S., Calhoun Tessa R., Read Elizabeth L., Ahn Tae-Kyu, Mančal Tomáš, Cheng Yuan-Chung, Blankenship Robert E., Fleming Graham R. | year = 2007 | title = Evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems | url = | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 446 | issue = | pages = 782–786 | doi=10.1038/nature05678| bibcode = 2007Natur.446..782E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fleming&lt;ref name="QBC"&gt;http://www.physorg.com/news95605211.html Quantum secrets of photosynthesis revealed&lt;/ref&gt; there is direct evidence that remarkably long-lived wavelike electronic quantum coherence plays an important part in energy transfer processes during photosynthesis, which can explain the extreme efficiency of the energy transfer because it enables the system to sample all the potential energy pathways, with low loss, and choose the most efficient one. This claim has, however, since been proven wrong in several publications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. Tempelaar | author2 = T. L. C. Jansen | author3 = J.

This approach has been further investigated by Gregory Scholes and his team at the [[University of Toronto]], which in early 2010 published research results that indicate that some marine algae make use of [[quantum coherence|quantum-coherent]] electronic [[energy transfer]] (EET) to enhance the efficiency of their energy harnessing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.utoronto.ca/staff/SCHOLES/scholes_home.html Scholes Group Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Photoinduced proton transfer==
[[Photoacid]]s are molecules that upon light absorption undergo a proton transfer to form the photobase.

:&lt;chem&gt;AH -&gt;[h\nu] A^- + H^+&lt;/chem&gt;

In these reactions the dissociation occurs in the electronically excited state. After proton transfer and relaxation to the electronic ground state, the proton and acid recombine to form the [[photoacid]] again.

[[photoacid]]s are a convenient source to induce pH jumps in [[ultrafast laser spectroscopy]] experiments.

==Photolysis in the atmosphere==
Photolysis occurs in the atmosphere as part of a series of reactions by which primary [[pollutants]] such as [[hydrocarbons]] and [[nitrogen oxides]] react to form secondary pollutants such as [[peroxyacyl nitrates]]. See [[photochemical smog]].

The two most important photodissociaton reactions in the [[troposphere]] are firstly:

:O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + h&amp;nu; &amp;rarr; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lambda; &lt; 320 nm

which generates an excited oxygen atom which can react with water to give the [[hydroxyl radical]]:

:O(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;D) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; 2 &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH

The hydroxyl radical is central to [[atmospheric chemistry]] as it initiates the [[oxidation]] of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere and so acts as a [[detergent]].

Secondly the reaction:

:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + h&amp;nu; &amp;rarr; NO + O

is a key reaction in the formation of [[tropospheric ozone]].

The formation of the [[ozone layer]] is also caused by photodissociation. Ozone in the Earth's [[stratosphere]] is created by ultraviolet light striking oxygen molecules containing two oxygen [[atom]]s (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), splitting them into individual oxygen atoms (atomic oxygen).  The atomic oxygen then combines with unbroken O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to create [[ozone]], O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, photolysis is the process by which [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s are broken down in the upper atmosphere to form ozone-destroying chlorine [[free radicals]].

==Astrophysics==
In [[astrophysics]], photodissociation is one of the major processes through which molecules are broken down (but new molecules are being formed). Because of the [[vacuum]] of the [[interstellar medium]], molecules and [[free radical]]s can exist for a long time. Photodissociation is the main path by which molecules are broken down. Photodissociation rates are important in the study of the composition of [[interstellar clouds]] in which [[star]]s are formed.

Examples of photodissociation in the interstellar medium are ({{mvar|h&amp;nu;}} is the energy of a single [[photon]] of frequency {{mvar|&amp;nu;}}):

:&lt;chem&gt;H2O -&gt;[h\nu] H + OH&lt;/chem&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;CH4 -&gt;[h\nu] CH3 + H&lt;/chem&gt;

== Atmospheric gamma-ray bursts ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Currently orbiting satellites detect an average of about one [[gamma-ray burst]] per day. Because gamma-ray bursts are visible to distances encompassing most of the [[observable universe]], a volume encompassing many billions of galaxies, this suggests that gamma-ray bursts must be exceedingly rare events per galaxy.

Measuring the exact rate of gamma-ray bursts is difficult, but for a galaxy of approximately the same size as the [[Milky Way]], the expected rate (for long GRBs) is about one burst every 100,000 to 1,000,000 years.&lt;ref name="rates"&gt;[[#Podsiadlowski|Podsiadlowski 2004]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few percent of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rates of short GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown beaming fraction, but are probably comparable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guetta|Guetta 2006]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, if close enough to Earth and beamed towards it, could have significant effects on the [[biosphere]]. The absorption of radiation in the atmosphere would cause photodissociation of [[nitrogen]], generating [[nitric oxide]] that would act as a catalyst to destroy [[ozone]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorsett|Thorsett 1995]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atmospheric photodissociation
* &lt;chem&gt;N2 -&gt; 2N&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;O2 -&gt; 2O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;CO2 -&gt; C + 2O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;H2O -&gt; 2H + O&lt;/chem&gt;
* &lt;chem&gt;2NH3 -&gt; 3H2 + N2&lt;/chem&gt;
would yield
* NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (consumes up to 400 [[ozone]] molecules)
* CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (nominal)
* CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (nominal)
* CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

(incomplete)

According to a 2004 study, a GRB at a distance of about a [[parsec|kiloparsec]] could destroy up to half of Earth's [[ozone layer]]; the direct UV irradiation from the burst combined with additional solar UV radiation passing through the diminished ozone layer could then have potentially significant impacts on the [[food chain]] and potentially trigger a mass extinction.&lt;ref name="Melott2004"&gt;[[#Melott|Melott 2004]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ancient"&gt;[[#Wanjek|Wanjek 2005]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors estimate that one such burst is expected per billion years, and hypothesize that the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction event]] could have been the result of such a burst.

There are strong indications that long gamma-ray bursts preferentially or exclusively occur in regions of low metallicity. Because the Milky Way has been metal-rich since before the Earth formed, this effect may diminish or even eliminate the possibility that a long gamma-ray burst has occurred within the Milky Way within the past billion years.&lt;ref name="Stanek"&gt;[[#Stanek|Stanek 2006]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No such metallicity biases are known for short gamma-ray bursts. Thus, depending on their local rate and beaming properties, the possibility for a nearby event to have had a large impact on Earth at some point in geological time may still be significant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ejzak|Ejzak 2007]]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple photon dissociation==
Single photons in the [[infrared]] spectral range usually are not energetic enough for direct photodissociation of molecules. However, after absorption of multiple infrared photons a molecule may gain internal energy to overcome its barrier for dissociation. Multiple photon dissociation (MPD, [[Infrared multiphoton dissociation|IRMPD]] with infrared radiation) can be achieved by applying high power lasers, e.g. a [[carbon dioxide laser]], or a [[free electron laser]], or by long interaction times of the molecule with the radiation field without the possibility for rapid cooling, e.g. by collisions. The latter method allows even for MPD induced by [[black body radiation]], a technique called [[blackbody infrared radiative dissociation]] (BIRD).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1914">'''Photosynthetic capacity''' ('''A&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''') is a measure of the maximum rate at which leaves are able to [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]] during [[photosynthesis]]. It is typically measured as the amount of carbon dioxide that is fixed per metre squared per second, for example as μmol m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Limitations ==
Photosynthetic capacity is limited by carboxylation capacity and electron transport capacity. For example, in high carbon dioxide concentrations or in low light, the plant is not able to regenerate [[ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate]] fast enough (also known RUBP, the acceptor molecule in photosynthetic carbon reduction). So in this case, photosynthetic capacity is limited by electron transport of the light reaction, which generates the NADPH and ATP required for the PCR (Calvin) Cycle, and regeneration of RUBP. On the other hand, in low carbon dioxide concentrations, the capacity of the plant to perform [[carboxylation]] (adding carbon dioxide to [[RuBisCO|Rubisco]]) is limited by the amount of available carbon dioxide, with plenty of Rubsico left over.¹ Light response, or photosynthesis-irradiance, curves display these relationships.

== Current Research ==
Recent studies have shown that photosynthetic capacity in leaves can be increased with an increase in the number of [[stoma]]ta per leaf. This could be important in further crop development engineering to increase the photosynthetic efficiency through increasing diffusion of carbon dioxide into the plant.²

A '''pioneer organism'''—also called a '''disaster taxon'''—is an [[organism]] that populates a region after a (short-term) natural disaster, mass extinction, or any other event that kills off most life in that area.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural disaster==
After a natural disaster, common pioneer organisms include [[lichen]]s and [[algae]]. [[Moss]]es usually follow lichens in colonization, but cannot serve as pioneer organisms.  Pioneer organisms modify their environment and establish conditions that accommodate other organisms. In some circumstances, other organisms can be considered pioneer organisms. Birds are usually the first to inhabit newly created islands, and seeds, such as the [[coconut]], may also be the first arrivals on barren soil.

==Extinction event==
Since the resolution of the fossil record is low, pioneer organisms are often identified as those that lived within hundreds, thousands, or a million years of the extinction event. For example, after the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] 252 million years ago, [[Lystrosaurus]], a tusked-reptile, was considered a disaster taxon.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"/&gt;

'''Plasma deep drilling technology''' is one of several different variants of recently explored [[new drilling technologies]] which would be able to substitute conventional, contact-based rotary systems.
These new technologies, including plasma deep drilling, [[Water jet cutter|water jet]], [[Spallation|hydrothermal spallation]] or [[laser]], are matter of active research. Only a very small number of companies have embraced plasma-drilling method, e.g. [[Geothermal Anywhere|GA Drilling]], headquartered in Bratislava, Slovakia.

==High-energetic electrical plasma==

High-energetic electrical plasma is a technology currently being developed in deep drilling applications to address many issues related to drilling in water environment or in the production of boreholes with a wide range of diameters.

==Physical principle of electrical plasma==
[[Image:Drilling using electrical plasma.jpg|thumb|Drilling using electrical plasma]]
An [[electric arc]] is an electrical breakdown of a gas that produces an ongoing [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] discharge, resulting from a current flowing through normally nonconductive media such as air or gas. An arc discharge is characterized by a lower voltage than a glow discharge, and relies on thermionic emission of electrons from the electrodes supporting the arc. The electric arc is influenced by factors such as: the gas flow, inner and outer magnetic fields, and construction elements of the chamber which confine the arc. The development of highly effective plasma torches to be used as a source of the thermal plasma, demands a deep understanding of a wide spectrum of the processes taking place in the discharge chamber.

==Advantages of Plasma deep drilling technology==

# Higher drilling energy efficiency
# Continuous drilling process without replacement of mechanical parts
# Constant casing diameter
# Effective transport of disintegrated rock

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5716">'''Risk inclination (RI)''' is defined as a mental disposition (i.e., confidence) toward an eventuality (i.e., a predicted state) that has consequences (i.e., either loss or gain). The '''risk inclination model (RIM)''' is composed of three constructs: confidence weighting, restricted context, and the risk inclination formula. Each of these constructs connects an outside observer with a respondent’s inner state of risk taking toward knowledge certainty.

[[File:Risk Inclination Model (RIM).jpg|thumb|'''RIM''']]

==Confidence weighting==
{{Main|Confidence weighting}}
The [[Confidence weighting|confidence weighting ('''CW''')]] construct is concerned with indices that connect an outside observer to the respondent’s inner state of knowledge certainty toward specific content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ebel |first=R.L. |title=Confidence Weighting and Test Reliability |journal=[[Journal of Educational Measurement]]|volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1965.tb00390.x |pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Kenneth D. |author2=A. Ralph Hakstian |author3=B.R. Hopkins|title=Validity and Reliability Consequences of Confidence Weighting|journal=[[Educational and Psychological Measurement]]|year=1973|volume=33|pages=135–141|doi=10.1177/001316447303300114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beasley|first=Robert E.|title=The Effects of Confidence Weighting on Test Scores and Confidence Weighting Perceptions in the Computing Curriculum|journal=[[Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges]]|year=2012|volume=28|issue=1|pages=91–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jack|first=B.M|author2=Liu, C.J. |author3=Chiu, H.L. |author4=Tsai, C.W. |title=Measuring the Confidence of 8th Grade Taiwanese Students' Knowledge of Acids and Bases|journal=[[International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education]]|year=2012|volume=10|issue=4|pages=889–905|doi=10.1007/s10763-011-9300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underpinning the CW construct of the risk inclination model is the individual's experience of coherence or rightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mangan |first=B |title=Sensation's Ghost: The Non-Sensory "Fringe" of Consciousness |journal=Psyche |volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to calibrate the relationship between a respondent’s objective and observable measures of risk taking (i.e., weighted indices toward answer selections) with his or her subjective inner feelings of knowledge certainty (i.e., feelings of rightness).

==Restricted context==

The restricted context ('''RC''') construct is based on [[Jean Piaget]]’s theory of equilibration&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book 
|title=Handbook of Child Psychology 
|last=Piaget 
|first=J. 
|year=1983 
|publisher=Wiley 
|location=New York
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and allows the outside observer to measure the way a respondent manages competing inner states of knowledge certainty during the application of confidence weights among items within the restricted total point value (TPV) context of the test. RC sets the parameters where risk taking toward knowledge certainty occurs. These parameters are important because they allow an observer to scale and thereby measure the respondent’s inner state of equilibration among related levels of knowledge certainty. Equilibration is defined as a self-regulatory process that reflects the biological drive to produce an optimal state of balance between a person’s cognitive structures (i.e., inner state) and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=R. M.|title=Piaget and Vygotsky revisited: Dialogue or assimilation?|journal=Developmental Review|year=1995|volume=15|pages=458–472|doi=10.1006/drev.1995.1019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk inclination formula==

The [[risk inclination formula]] ('''RIF''') construct is based upon [[Varignon's theorem]] and quantifies feelings of rightness toward knowledge certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?searchtype=basic&amp;pageSize=10&amp;ERICExtSearch_Facet_0=facet_au&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=Brady+Michael+Jack&amp;ERICExtSearch_FacetValue_0=%22Jack%2C+Brady%22&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=au&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;objectId=0900019b8046c889&amp;accno=ED519174&amp;_nfls=false |title=Utilitarian Model of Confidence Testing for Knowledge-based Societies |last1=Jack |first1=B.M. |last2=Hung |first2=K.M.|last3=Liu |first3=C.J.|last4=Chiu |first4=H.L.|publisher=ERIC |id= ED519174}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Coxeter|Coxeter, H. S. M.]] and Greitzer, S. L. "Quadrangle; Varignon's theorem" §3.1 in Geometry Revisited. Washington, DC: Math. Assoc. Amer., pp. 52&amp;ndash;54, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; RIF uses the Principle of Moments or Varignon’s Theorem to calculate the first factorial moment of probability in order to define this center point of balance among all confidence weights (i.e., the point of Risk Equilibration).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coxeter|first=H. S. M.|title=Quadrangles: Varignon's Theorem. Geometry Revisited|year=1967|publisher=The Mathematical Association of America|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=D. P.|title=Engineering Mechanics|year=2010|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=New Delhi, India|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal derivation of the RIF is divided into three separate calculations: (1) calculation of the first factorial moment, (2) calculation of inclination, and (3) calculation of the risk inclination score.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15585">Many engineering educators see [[service-learning]] as the solution to several prevalent problems in engineering education today.  In the past, engineering curriculum has fluctuated between emphasizing engineering science to focusing more on practical aspects of engineering.  Today, many engineering educators are concerned their students do not receive enough practical knowledge of engineering and its context.  Some speculate that adding context to engineering help to motivate engineering students' studies and thus improve retention and diversity in engineering schools.  Others feel that the teaching styles do not match the learning styles of engineering students.  

Many engineering faculty members believe the educational solution lies in taking a more constructivist approach, where students construct knowledge and connections between nodes of knowledge as opposed to passively absorbing knowledge.  Educators see service-learning as a way to both implement a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] in engineering education as well as match the teaching styles to the learning styles of typical engineering students.  As a result, many engineering schools have begun to integrate service-learning into their curricula.

==History==

The end of World War II marked the beginning of a movement toward increased emphasis on engineering science in engineering education.  Initially, this movement enhanced the quality of engineering education.  However, after decades of rising focus on science engineering, undergraduate [[engineering education]] began to lack instruction on practical engineering applications.  Concurrently, the undergraduate engineering experience became increasingly fragmented.&lt;ref name="fromm"&gt;E. Fromm, ''The Changing Engineering Education Paradigm,'' J. Eng. Educ., vol. 92, April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  As one author described it, "Schools break knowledge and experience into subjects, relentlessly turning wholes into parts, flowers into petals, history into events, without ever restoring continuity."&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferguson, ''The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s'', St. Martin's Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, many different organizations, including both research institutions and professional associations, conducted studies in attempts to resolve the educational problems in the engineering field.  Though they conducted their research independently, they arrived at several common conclusions.  Researchers agreed that the engineering schools should continue to provide solid basic theory knowledge.  However, they also called for added emphasis on synthesis and design understanding as well as increased exposure to societal context and interdisciplinary teamwork.&lt;ref name="fromm"/&gt;  Later reports reiterated the need for more exposure to engineering's context as well as a need to make engineering more attractive and relevant to students.&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Deans Council and Corporate Roundtable of the American Society for Engineering Education, ''The Green Report: Engineering Education for a Changing World,'' [[American Society for Engineering Education]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Papers also reported the need for engineering students to develop professional and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Hissey, ''Education and Careers 2000,'' Proceedings of the [[IEEE]], vol. 88, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering education today==

Today, requirements for engineering programs reflect a movement to resolve the engineering education problems found in past studies.  Many engineering educators see service-learning as a way to enhance their programs by exposing students to engineering context while also giving them a chance to develop professional and interpersonal skills.  These values are reflected in the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) standards for engineering schools.  For an engineering program to maintain accreditation, ABET requires that they "demonstrate that their students attain the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context".&lt;ref&gt;ABET, ''Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs,'' The Engineering Accreditation Commission of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]]., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedagogical implications===

;Constructivism

The service-learning method ties in well with a teaching philosophy known as [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]].  Constructivism is an educational theory rooted in psychology and sociology.&lt;ref name="mariappan"&gt;J. Mariappan, S. Monemi and U. Fan, ''Enhancing Authentic Learning Experiences through Community-based Engineering Service-Learning'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ben-ari"&gt;M. Ben-Ari, ''Constructivism in Computer Science Education,'' SIGCSE, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  It asserts that learners construct knowledge from previous knowledge rather than passively absorbing knowledge from outside sources.&lt;ref name="mariappan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ben-ari" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Smith III, A. A. diSessa and J. Roschelle, ''Misconceptions Reconceived: A Constructivist Analysis of Knowledge in Transition,'' Journal of the Learning Sciences, vol. 3, pp. 115–163, 1993–1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, learning includes both creation of new factual knowledge and understanding the connections between different nodes of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Bransford and B. S. Stein, ''The IDEAL Problem Solver'', [[New York City]], Bice-Heath, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Service-learning provides an environment where students can actively construct knowledge while engaging in actual projects.  The reflection portion of service-learning gives students time to create connections between old and new knowledge.  

While accepted by many, some educators have criticized constructivism both [[epistemological]]ly and pedagogically.  Pedagogically, critics claim that a constructivist approach gives students in-depth knowledge but not breadth of knowledge.  Since in a constructivist approach takes a significant amount of time to allow students to create new knowledge and relate it to previous knowledge through reflection, instructors usually cannot cover a large amount of material.&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Coll and T. G. N. Taylor, ''Using Constructivism to Inform, Tertiary Chemistry Pedagogy,'' Chemistry Education: Research and Practice in Europe, vol. 2, pp. 215–226, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while this may become a real concern for many courses, the specific role of service-learning plays in engineering school courses mitigates these concerns.  Service-learning typically appears in introductory or optional courses in the engineering school.  The goals of these courses is not so much to gain a detailed and broad understand of a field, but rather to have a real world engineering experience.  This is notably different from courses where students must obtain vast amounts of accurate knowledge for precise calculations.

Critics also worry that a constructivist approach to education leaves the learner too disconnected from reality since it constantly focuses on building new knowledge based on pre-existing knowledge.  Thus, theoretically, as they continue building knowledge off of their pre-existing knowledge in isolation, their view of the world could slowly become skewed from reality.&lt;ref name="olssen"&gt;M. Olssen, ''Radical Constructivism and Its Failing: Anti-Realism and Individualism,'' British Journal of Educational Studies, vol. 44, pp. 275–295, Sept., 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  While this may be a weakness for many courses, in service-learning, students work to create real solutions for a real customer.  Thus their ideas must be resolved, not only with fellow engineering team members, but also with reality.  

;Learning styles

In past years, studies on engineering education revealed the [[learning styles]] of most engineering students and the teaching styles of many engineering professors were incompatible.   The five well known learning style dimensions include: sensing/intuitive, visual/auditory, inductive/deductive, active/reflective, and global/sequential.  

According to Richard Felder from North Carolina State University and Linda Silverman from the Institute for the study of Advanced Development, most engineering students are visual, sensing, inductive, and active learners.  Also, many of the creative students are global learners.  However, most engineering education is auditory, intuitive, deductive, passive and sequential.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Felder and L. K. Silverman, ''Learning and Teaching Styles In Engineering Education,'' Engr. Education, vol. 78, pp. 674–681, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such conclusions are not well-supported by research.  There is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes, and there is significant evidence that the widespread "meshing hypothesis" (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style) is invalid.&lt;ref name="pashler"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pashler | first1 = H. | last2 = McDaniel | first2 = M. | last3 = Rohrer | first3 = D. | last4 = Bjork | first4 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Learning styles: Concepts and evidence | url = | journal = Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 105–119 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01038.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Well-designed studies "flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis".&lt;ref name=pashler /&gt;

;Online service learning

Though the interest in service learning at educational institutions has increased, these projects are often very costly to students and universities.  However, there have been some examples of successful service learning projects facilitated over the Internet.

===Engineering programs with service-learning===

Many different universities have incorporated service-learning into their curricula to address the contextual, motivational, and multi-disciplinary team needs.  Purdue University created the Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program in 1995.  Under this program, freshman to senior undergraduate engineering students form multi-disciplinary teams to meet community needs.  Students earn a variable number of credit hours based on their year in school and related contribution to the project.  At Purdue, the service projects are long-term and students earn up to seven semesters worth of credit working on the service project.  The program began with 40 students on 5 teams but has quickly grown to 400 students on 24 teams.&lt;ref name="olssen" /&gt;

The EPICS program at Purdue as well as service-learning programs at other universities, have succeeded in offering students practical experience, context, and motivation for engineering.  Seventy seven percent of the students who were able to come back to the EPICS program stayed for additional semesters.  On student evaluations, 70% of students indicated that the program positively impacted their decision to stay in engineering; of the 30% that responded differently, several indicated they had previously decided to stay in the engineering before the program and thus, the program did not affect their decision to stay in engineering.  Student responses also returned favorable results for the educational objectives.  The table below summarizes the responses:

On evaluation comments, students also expressed that EPICS had completely changed their view of engineering, giving them both meaning and direction in all of their engineering studies.&lt;ref name="olssen" /&gt;

Penn State University has created a certificate program entitled 'Humanitarian Engineering'.  The emphasis of the program is on relationship building – and are not simply project-driven exercises.  Long-term, sustainable, [[collaborative partnerships]] are formed with host universities and marginalized communities.  This enables development of outreach programs at the universities reaching into local communities.  The Penn State program is vertically integrated across the four-year engineering program allowing students to form these long-term relationships with the host communities.  This method allows for greater understanding of the cultural aspects of engineering design and its impact, as well as development of technical proficiency.  There is also a very strong emphasis on entrepreneurship in the program.  Engineering design solutions are developed and students are encouraged to develop business plans and implement them in the host community.\

[[Clemson University]] also hosts Clemson Engineers for Developing Countries (CEDC), a multi-level immersive student-led organization and class that provides Clemson students of any major with service-learning and project experience. The focus of the program is to provide sustainable solutions aimed at improving the quality of life for those living in the emerging world while using students for all design, planning, and project implementation. CEDC has a student-led corporate organizational structure, including vertical integration from freshmen to graduate students and horizontal integration from over 30 majors, and works on between 15 and 20 projects per semester.  The program also features multidisciplinary teams of 2–4 student interns who live in [[Haiti]] year- round, fall and spring break trips to Haiti for groups of 10–14 students to collect data for their projects, and a course at Clemson University for students to work on their multi-semester projects. The program has designed and managed over $2 million in construction projects in Haiti, all with direct oversight and management from the CEDC interns who are housed by [[Partners in Health]]. To date, CEDC students have implemented projects all over Haiti's rural Central Plateau (including several in [[Cange]]), which include several water systems, a fish hatchery, a [[biodigester]] system, and repairing public schools. 

==Social and ethical implications==

The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Code of Ethics lists contributing to society and human well-being as well as improving public understanding of an engineer's practice area.  Through service-learning provides engineers with the opportunity to both contribute to society and educate the public. 

Along with fostering a good community-university relationship, educators hope incorporating service-learning will increase diversity and retention in the engineering school.  Diversifying the engineering population will allow engineering teams to maintain a better understanding of the needs in a society.  So diversifying engineering teams will allow engineers to both meet real needs as well as provide interfaces to their solutions which the public can understand.  Likewise, a society needs a vast population of engineers to meet the needs of a vast society.

'''Spongiosum''' is the Latin adjective for "spongy".  The term is used in [[anatomy]] for tissues that become filled with blood:  ''[[corpus spongiosum]]'', ''stratum spongiosum'' of the [[decidua]].  It is also used in [[binomial nomenclature]] of organisms, such as the seaweed ''[[Codium]] spongiosum''.

The winds, passage and gravity of newly born stars strip superbubbles of any other dust or gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1789525419|title=Sublime image reveals superbubbles, star formation, and satellite galaxies|last=Thomson|first=Jason|date=2016-05-18|work=|access-date=2016-10-03|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solar System]] lies near the center of an old superbubble, known as the [[Local Bubble]], whose boundaries can be traced by a sudden rise in [[Cosmic dust|dust]] [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] of exterior stars at distances greater than a few hundred light years.

==Formation==
The most massive stars, with masses ranging from eight to roughly one hundred solar masses and [[stellar classification|spectral type]]s of O and early B, are usually found in groups called OB associations.  Massive O stars have strong stellar winds, and most of these stars explode as [[supernova]]e at the end of their lives.

The strongest stellar winds release kinetic energy of 10&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt; [[erg]]s (10&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule|J]]) over the lifetime of a star, which is equivalent to a supernova explosion.  These winds can form [[stellar wind bubble]]s dozens of light years across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| bibcode=1975ApJ...200L.107C |last=Castor|first=J. |last2=McCray|first2=R. |last3=Weaver|first3=R. |title=Interstellar Bubbles| date=1975| journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters| volume=200| pages=L107–L110| doi=10.1086/181908}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Inside [[Stellar kinematics#OB associations|OB associations]], the stars are close enough that their wind bubbles merge, forming a giant bubble called a superbubble. 
When stars die, supernova explosions, similarly, drive [[shock wave|blast wave]]s that can reach even larger sizes, with expansion velocities up to several hundred km&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Stars in OB associations are not gravitationally bound, but they drift apart at small speeds (of around 20&amp;nbsp;km&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), and they exhaust their fuel rapidly (after a few millions of years). As a result, most of their supernova explosions occur within the cavity formed by the stellar wind bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| bibcode=1981Ap&amp;SS..78..273T |last=Tomisaka|first= K. |last2=Habe|first2=A. |last3=Ikeuchi|first3=S. | title=Sequential explosions of supernovae in an OB association and formation of a superbubble| date=1981| journal=Astrophys.

Both stellar winds and stellar explosions thus power the expansion of the superbubble in the interstellar medium.

The interstellar gas swept up by superbubbles generally cools, forming a dense shell around the cavity.  These shells were first observed in line emission at [[Hydrogen line|twenty-one centimeters]] from [[hydrogen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| date=1979| bibcode=1979ApJ...229..533H| last= Heiles| first=C. | authorlink = Carl E.

They are also observed in [[X-ray]] emission from their hot interiors, in optical line emission from their ionized shells, and in infrared continuum emission from dust swept up in their shells.  X-ray and visible emission are typically observed from younger superbubbles, while older, larger objects seen in twenty-one centimeters may even result from multiple superbubbles combining, and so are sometimes distinguished by calling them '''supershells'''.

Large enough superbubbles can blow through the entire galactic disk, releasing their energy into the surrounding galactic halo or even into the [[intergalactic medium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| bibcode=1986PASJ...38..697T| last= Tomisaka| first=K.|author2=Ikeuchi, S. | title=Evolution of superbubble driven by sequential supernova explosions in a plane-stratified gas distribution| date=1986| journal=Publ.

'''Temporal logic of actions''' ('''TLA''') is a logic developed by [[Leslie Lamport]], which combines [[temporal logic]] with a [[logic of action]]s.
It is used to describe behaviours of [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent systems]].

== Details ==
Statements in temporal logic are of the form &lt;math&gt;[A]_t&lt;/math&gt;, where ''A'' is an action and ''t'' contains a subset of the variables appearing in ''A''. An action is an expression containing primed and non-primed variables, such as &lt;math&gt;x+x'*y=y'&lt;/math&gt;. The meaning of the non-primed variables is ''the variable's value in this state''. The meaning of primed variables is ''the variable's value in the next state''.
The above expression means the value of ''x'' ''today'', plus the value of ''x'' ''tomorrow'' times the value of y ''today'', equals the value of ''y'' ''tomorrow''.

The meaning of &lt;math&gt;[A]_t&lt;/math&gt; is that either A is valid now, or the variables appearing in t do not change. This allows for stuttering steps, in which none of the program variables change their values.

'''The Context Group''' is a working group of international [[Bible|biblical]] scholars who promote research into the Bible using [[Social sciences|social-scientific]] methods such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]].

==Founding==

The Context Group is an international team of scholars that merges historical [[exegesis]] and the social sciences to [[Hermeneutics|interpret the Bible]] in its social and cultural contexts. It initially organized in 1986 as the "Social Facets Seminar," headed by John H. Elliott as Chair, meeting in conjunction with [[The Jesus Seminar]] under the direction of Robert W. Funk and the Westar Institute. In 1989 it broke ties with the Jesus Seminar and reorganized in Portland, Oregon, as The Context Group, A Project on the Bible in its Social and Cultural Environment.

Two seminal publications by founding members were [[Bruce J. Malina]]'s ''The New Testament World: Insights from Cultural Anthropology'' (1981) and [[John H. Elliott]]'s ''Home for the Homeless: A Sociological Exegesis of 1 Peter'' (1981). Elliott's ''What is Social-Scientific Criticism of the Bible?'' (1993) coined a new term for the group's methodology and provided a bibliographic survey. Other key figures who published on the subject during this era (all of whom eventually became part of the Context Group) include Dennis Duling, Philip Esler, Douglas E. Oakman, Jerome Neyrey SJ, John J. Pilch, Richard L. Rohrbaugh, and Wolfgang Stegemann.

The work of the group has had considerable influence in the field, but also has attracted a variety of criticisms.

==Main ideas==

At the root of the Context Group's social-scientific method is the belief that biblical scholars have taken [[Western culture|western]] [[culture|cultural]] assumptions for granted when interpreting the Bible, an ancient document produced in a much different culture.

The key difference is that the modern western world is an [[individualism|individualistic]], [[industrialism|industrial]] society, whereas the society of the ancient [[Mediterranean]] world was [[collectivism|collectivistic]] and [[Agrarian society|agrarian]].

The ancient Mediterranean was also a [[High context culture|high-context society]], where discourse took shared cultural values for granted. This contrasts with the modern western world, which is a low-context society in which discourse tends to be more specific and specialized (i.e. to particular groups, subcultures, etc.). According to the Context scholars, the interpreter must learn the cultural assumptions and values behind the text in order to understand it correctly. This involves understanding values such as [[honor]] and [[shame]], for example, which Malina calls "pivotal cultural values."

Other common themes in Context analysis of the Bible include patron-client relationships, the "[[evil eye]]", [[kinship]], [[Virtue|purity]] codes, and dyadic/group-oriented personalities.

==Context scholars and publications==
The Context Group’s founding and early members include important scholars in the field today: [[Bruce J. Malina]], [[Philip Esler]], [[Jerome H. Neyrey]] SJ, [[John J. Pilch]], [[:de:Wolfgang Stegemann|Wolfgang Stegemann]], [http://www.kchanson.com/ K.C. Hanson], [https://community.plu.edu/~oakmande/ Douglas E. Oakman], [http://www3.canisius.edu/~duling/ Dennis C.

'''Theodric Romeyn Beck''' (April 11, 1791 – November 19, 1855), alternatively '''Theodoric Romeyn Beck''' or '''T. Romeyn Beck''', was an [[United States|American]] physician in [[Albany, NY|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]] specializing in [[medical jurisprudence]] who authored the first significant American book on [[forensic medicine]], ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'' in 1823.

==Biography==
Beck was born in [[Schenectady, New York]], to the family of Caleb Beck of English descent. He graduated from [[Union College]] at the age of 16 and the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] with an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] at the age of 20 before going into practice in [[Albany, NY|Albany]] in 1811.  In 1813 he presented to the Albany Society of Arts a comprehensive paper on the mineral resources of the United States.  In 1815 he was appointed professor of the institutes of medicine, and lecturer on medical jurisprudence in the [[Fairfield Academy|College of Physicians and Surgeons of Western New York]], at [[Fairfield, New York|Fairfield]]. Blake was also elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlist American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as the [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of [[The Albany Academy]] from 1817 to 1848, where he encouraged the future curator of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Joseph Henry]], to enroll as a student and later serve as a professor of mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] in 1826.  Also during this time, he was a professor of medical jurisprudence at Fairfield Medical College from 1826 until 1836, and professor of [[materia medica]] in that institution from 1836 till 1840, and at [[Albany Medical College]] from 1840 until 1854.

[[File:Elements of Medical Jurisprudence.jpg|thumb|left|''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence'']] In 1823, while secretary of the Society for the Promotion of Useful Arts (SPUA), he founded the Albany Lyceum of Natural History, which  focused on the preservation of mineral and botanical specimens collected in New York State surveys.  The following year, SPUA and the Albany Lyceum of Natural History merged to form the Albany Institute; [[Stephen Van Rensselaer III]] was appointed its President and Beck was appointed its Vice President.   He was chosen [[President]] of the New York State Medical Society in 1829, and became a manager of the state [[lunatic asylum]] before becoming President of the Board of Managers in 1854.  During his service, he collected statistics on deaf-mutes, which influenced the legislature to pass laws for the education of the [[mentally ill]].  In addition, from 1849 to 1853 he edited the ''American Journal of Insanity''.

His principal work was ''Elements of Medical Jurisprudence''. His brother [[John Brodhead Beck]], also a physician, contributed the material on infanticide.  The first edition was printed in 1823, a seventh edition was issued in [[London]] in 1842, with notes by Dunlap and Darwell, and a tenth in [[Albany, NY|Albany]] in 1850.

Beck also contributed to numerous scientific journals.  Another of his brothers, [[Lewis Caleb Beck]], wrote a noted book on the ''Mineralogy of New York'' (1842).

The '''Van Cittert–Zernike theorem''', named after physicists [[Pieter Hendrik van Cittert]] and [[Frits Zernike]], is a formula in [[coherence theory (optics)|coherence theory]] that states that under certain conditions the [[Fourier transform]] of the [[mutual coherence (physics)|mutual coherence]] function of a distant, incoherent source is equal to its complex [[Interferometric visibility|visibility]].  This implies that the [[wavefront]] from an incoherent source will appear mostly coherent at large distances.  Intuitively, this can be understood by considering the wavefronts created by two incoherent sources.  If we measure the wavefront immediately in front of one of the sources, our measurement will be dominated by the nearby source.  If we make the same measurement far from the sources, our measurement will no longer be dominated by a single source; both sources will contribute almost equally to the wavefront at large distances.

This reasoning can be easily visualized by dropping two stones in the center of a calm pond.  Near the center of the pond, the disturbance created by the two stones will be very complicated.  As the disturbance propagates towards the edge of the pond, however, the waves will smooth out and will appear to be nearly circular.

The van Cittert–Zernike theorem has important implications for [[radio astronomy]].  With the exception of [[pulsars]] and [[masers]], all astronomical sources are spatially incoherent.  Nevertheless, because they are observed at distances large enough to satisfy the van Cittert–Zernike theorem, these objects exhibit a non-zero degree of coherence at different points in the imaging plane.  By measuring the [[degree of coherence]] at different points in the imaging plane (the so-called "[[interferometric visibility|visibility]] function") of an astronomical object, a radio astronomer can thereby reconstruct the source's brightness distribution and make a two-dimensional map of the source's appearance.

==Statement of the theorem==
Consider two very distant parallel planes, both perpendicular to the line of sight, and let's call them ''source plane'' and ''observation plane''; If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{12}(u,v,0)&lt;/math&gt; is the mutual coherence function between two points in the observation plane, then

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{12} (u,v,0) = \iint I(l,m) e^{-2\pi i(ul+vm)} \, dl \, dm&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Direction_cosine|direction cosines]] of a point on a distant source in the source plane, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the x-distance and the y-distance between the two observation points on the observation plane ''in unit of wavelength''  and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the intensity of the source.  This theorem was first derived by [[Pieter Hendrik van Cittert]]&lt;ref name="vancittert"&gt;{{cite journal | author = P.H. van Cittert | date = 1934 | title = Die Wahrscheinliche Schwingungsverteilung in Einer von Einer Lichtquelle Direkt Oder Mittels Einer Linse Beleuchteten Ebene | journal = Physica | volume = 1 | pages = 201–210 | doi =  10.1016/S0031-8914(34)90026-4|bibcode = 1934Phy.....1..201V }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1934 with a simpler proof provided by [[Frits Zernike]] in 1938.&lt;ref name="zernike"&gt;{{cite journal | author = F. Zernike | date = 1938 | title = The concept of degree of coherence and its application to optical problems | journal = Physica | volume = 5 | pages = 785–795 | doi =  10.1016/S0031-8914(38)80203-2|bibcode = 1938Phy.....5..785Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mutual coherence function==

The space-time mutual coherence function for some [[electric field]] &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; measured at two points in a plane of observation (call them 1 and 2), is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{12} (\tau) = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{2T} \int_{-T}^T E_1(t) E_2^*(t-\tau) dt&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the time offset between the measurement of &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; at observation points 1 and 2. The mutual coherence between two points may be thought of as the time-averaged cross-correlation between the electric fields at the two points separated in time by &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, if we are observing two fully incoherent sources we should expect the mutual coherence function to be relatively small between the two random points in the observation plane, because the sources will interfere destructively as well as constructively.  Far away from the sources, however, we should expect the mutual coherence function to be relatively large because the sum of the observed fields will be almost the same at any two points.

Normalization of the mutual coherence function to the product of the square roots of the intensities of the two electric fields yields the complex degree of second-order coherence (correlation coefficient function):

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{12} (\tau) = \frac{\Gamma_{12}(\tau)}{\sqrt{I_1} \sqrt{I_2}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of the theorem==

Let &lt;math&gt;XY&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; be respectively the cartesian coordinates of the source plane and the observation plane.  Suppose the electric field due to some point from the source in the source plane is measured at two points, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, in the observation plane.  The position of a point in the source may be referred to by its direction cosines &lt;math&gt;(l, m)&lt;/math&gt;.  (Since the source is distant, its direction should be the same at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; as at &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.)  The electric field measured at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; can then be written using [[phasor]]s:

[[File:Van Cittert-Zernike theorem.jpg|thumb|The source is in the ''XY''-plane, shown at the top of the figure, and the detector is in the ''xy''-plane, shown at the bottom of the figure. Consider the electric field at two points, &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, in the detection plane due to some point in the source whose coordinates are given by the direction cosines &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;]]

:&lt;math&gt;E_1(l, m, t) = A \left( l, m, t - \frac{R_1}{c} \right) \frac{e^{-i \omega \left( t - \frac{R_1}{c} \right) }}{R_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the source to &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the [[light]], and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the [[complex amplitude]] of the electric field.  Similarly, the electric field measured at &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;E_2(l, m, t) = A \left( l, m, t - \frac{R_2}{c} \right) \frac{ e^{-i \omega \left( t - \frac{R_2}{c} \right) }}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Let us now calculate the time-averaged cross-correlation between the electric field at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\big \langle E_1(l, m, t) E_2^*(l, m, t) \big \rangle = \Bigg \langle A \left( l, m, t - \frac{R_1}{c} \right) A^* \left( l, m, t - \frac{R_2}{c} \right) \Bigg \rangle \times \frac{e^{i \omega \frac{R_1}{c} }}{R_1} \times \frac{e^{-i \omega \frac{R_2}{c} }}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the quantity in the angle brackets is time-averaged an arbitrary offset to the temporal term of the amplitudes may be added as long as the same offset is added to both.  Let us now add &lt;math&gt;\frac{R_1}{c}&lt;/math&gt; to the temporal term of both amplitudes.  The time-averaged cross-correlation of the electric field at the two points therefore simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\big \langle E_1(l, m, t) E_2^*(l, m, t) \big \rangle = \Bigg \langle A (l, m, t) A^* \left( l, m, t - \frac{R_2 - R_1}{c} \right) \Bigg \rangle \times \frac{ e^{i \omega \left( \frac{R_1 - R_2}{c} \right)}}{R_1 R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

But if the source is in the [[far field]] then the difference between &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; will be small compared to the distance light travels in time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is on the same order as the inverse [[Band matrix|bandwidth]].)  This small correction can therefore be neglected, further simplifying our expression for the cross-correlation of the electric field at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; to

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E_1(l, m, t) E_2^*(l, m, t) \rangle = \langle A(l, m, t) A^*(l, m, t) \rangle \times \frac{e^{i \omega \left( \frac{R_1 - R_2}{c} \right)}}{R_1 R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;\langle A(l, m, t) A^*(l, m, t) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is simply the intensity of the source at a particular point, &lt;math&gt;I(l, m)&lt;/math&gt;.  So our expression for the cross-correlation simplifies further to

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E_1(l, m, t) E_2^*(l, m, t) \rangle = I(l, m) \frac{e^{i \omega \left( \frac{R_1 - R_2}{c} \right) }}{R_1 R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the mutual coherence function from this expression, simply integrate over the entire source.

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{12} (u, v, 0) = \iint_{\textrm{source}} I(l, m) \frac{e^{i \omega \left( \frac{R_1 - R_2}{c} \right) }}{R_1 R_2} \, dS&lt;/math&gt;

Note that cross terms of the form &lt;math&gt;\langle A_1 (l, m, t) A_2^* (l, m, t) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; are not included due to the assumption that the source is incoherent.  The time-averaged correlation between two different points from the source will therefore be zero.

Next rewrite the &lt;math&gt;R_2 - R_1&lt;/math&gt; term using &lt;math&gt;u, v, l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  To do this, let &lt;math&gt;P_1 = (x_1, y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2 = (x_2, y_2)&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives

:&lt;math&gt;R_1 = \sqrt{R^2 + x_1^2 + y_1^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_2 = \sqrt{R^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the center of the plane of observation and the center of the source.  The difference between &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; thus becomes

:&lt;math&gt;R_2 - R_1 = R \sqrt{1 + \frac{x_2^2}{R^2} + \frac{y_2^2}{R^2}} - R \sqrt{1 + \frac{x_1^2}{R^2} + \frac{y_1^2}{R^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

But because &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; are all much less than &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the square roots may be [[Taylor series|Taylor expanded]], yielding, to first order,

:&lt;math&gt;R_2 - R_1 = R \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x_2^2 + y_2^2}{R^2} \right) \right) - R \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x_1^2 + y_1^2}{R^2} \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

which, after some algebraic manipulation, simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;R_2 - R_1 = \frac{1}{2R} \left( (x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1) + (y_2 - y_1)(y_2 + y_1) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(x_2 + x_1)&lt;/math&gt; is the midpoint along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis between &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2R}(x_2 + x_1)&lt;/math&gt; gives us &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, one of the direction cosines to the sources.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{1}{2R}(y_2 + y_1)&lt;/math&gt;.  Moreover, recall that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; was defined to be the number of wavelengths along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis between &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;.  So

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{\omega}{2 \pi c} (x_1 - x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the number of wavelengths between &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; along the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axis, so

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{\omega}{2 \pi c} (y_1 - y_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;R_2 - R_1 = \frac{2 \pi c}{\omega}(ul + vm)&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, y_1,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; are all much less than &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_1 \simeq R_2 \simeq R&lt;/math&gt;.  The differential area element, &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt;, may then be written as a differential element of [[solid angle]] of &lt;math&gt;R^2 \, dl \, dm&lt;/math&gt;.  Our expression for the mutual coherence function becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{12}(u, v, 0) = \iint_{\textrm{source}} I(l, m) e^{- \frac{i \omega}{c} \frac{2 \pi c}{ \omega} (ul + vm)} \, dl \, dm&lt;/math&gt;

Which reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{12} (u, v, 0) = \iint_{\textrm{source}} I(l, m) e^{-2 \pi i (ul + vm)} \, dl \, dm&lt;/math&gt;

But the limits of these two integrals can be extended to cover the entire plane of the source as long as the source's intensity function is set to be zero over these regions.  Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{12}(u, v, 0) = \iint I(l, m) e^{-2 \pi i (ul + vm)} \, dl \, dm&lt;/math&gt;

which is the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the intensity function.  This completes the proof.

==Assumptions of the theorem==

The van Cittert–Zernike theorem rests on a number of assumptions, all of which are approximately true for nearly all astronomical sources.  The most important assumptions of the theorem and their relevance to astronomical sources are discussed here.

===Incoherence of the source===

A spatially coherent source does not obey the van Cittert–Zernike theorem.  To see why this is, suppose we observe a source consisting of two points, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  Let us calculate the mutual coherence function between &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; in the plane of observation.  From the [[superposition principle|principle of superposition]], the electric field at &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;E_1 = E_{a1} + E_{b1}&lt;/math&gt;

and at &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;E_2 = E_{a2} + E_{b2}&lt;/math&gt;

so the mutual coherence function is

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E_1(t) E_2^*(t - \tau) \rangle = \langle ( E_{a1}(t) + E_{b1}(t) ) ( E_{a2}^*(t - \tau) + E_{b2}^*(t - \tau)) \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Which becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E_1(t) E_2^*(t - \tau) \rangle = \langle E_{a1}(t) E_{a2}^*(t - \tau) \rangle + \langle E_{a1}(t) E_{b2}^*(t - \tau) \rangle + \langle E_{b1}(t) E_{a2}^*(t - \tau) \rangle + \langle E_{b1}(t) E_{b2}^*(t - \tau) \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

If points &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are coherent then the cross terms in the above equation do not vanish.  In this case, when we calculate the mutual coherence function for an extended coherent source, we would not be able to simply integrate over the intensity function of the source; the presence of non-zero cross terms would give the mutual coherence function no simple form.

This assumption holds for most astronomical sources.  Pulsars and masers are the only astronomical sources which exhibit coherence.

===Distance to the source===

In the proof of the theorem we assume that &lt;math&gt;R \gg x_1 - x_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R \gg y_1 - y_2&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, we assume that the distance to the source is much greater than the size of the observation area.  More precisely, the van Cittert–Zernike theorem requires that we observe the source in the so-called far field.  Hence if &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic size of the observation area (e.g. in the case of a two-dish [[radio telescope]], the length of the baseline between the two telescopes) then

:&lt;math&gt;R \gg \frac{D^2}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

Using a reasonable baseline of 20&amp;nbsp;km for the [[Very Large Array]] at a wavelength of 1&amp;nbsp;cm, the far field distance is of order &lt;math&gt;4 \times  10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; m.  Hence any astronomical object farther away than a [[parsec]] is in the far field.  Objects in the [[Solar System]] are not necessarily in the far field, however, and so the van Cittert–Zernike theorem does not apply to them.

===Angular size of the source===

In the derivation of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem we write the direction cosines &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(x_1+x_2)/R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(y_1+y_2)/R&lt;/math&gt;.  There is, however, a third direction cosine which is neglected since &lt;math&gt;R \gg \frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R \gg \frac{1}{2}(y_1 + y_2)&lt;/math&gt;; under these assumptions it is very close to unity.  But if the source has a large angular extent, we cannot neglect this third direction cosine and the van Cittert–Zernike theorem no longer holds.

Because most astronomical sources subtend very small angles on the sky (typically much less than a degree), this assumption of the theorem is easily fulfilled in the domain of radio astronomy.

===Quasi-monochromatic waves===

The van Cittert–Zernike theorem assumes that the source is quasi-monochromatic.  That is, if the source emits light over a range of frequencies, &lt;math&gt;\Delta \nu&lt;/math&gt;, with mean frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, then it should satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} \lesssim 1&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the bandwidth must be narrow enough that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} \ll \frac{1}{l u}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is again the direction cosine indicating the size of the source and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the number of wavelengths between one end of the aperture and the other.  Without this assumption, we cannot neglect &lt;math&gt;(R_2 - R_1)/c&lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;

This requirement implies that a radio astronomer must restrict signals through a [[bandpass filter]].  Because radio telescopes almost always pass the signal through a relatively narrow bandpass filter, this assumption is typically satisfied in practice.

===Two-dimensional source===

We assume that our source lies in a two-dimensional plane.  In reality, astronomical sources are three-dimensional.  However, because they are in the far field, their angular distribution does not change with distance.  Therefore when we measure an astronomical source, its three-dimensional structure becomes projected upon a two-dimensional plane.  This means that the van Cittert–Zernike theorem may be applied to measurements of astronomical sources, but we cannot determine structure along the line of sight with such measurements.

===Homogeneity of the medium===

The van Cittert–Zernike theorem assumes that the medium between the source and the imaging plane is homogeneous.  If the medium is not homogeneous then light from one region of the source will be differentially [[refraction|refracted]] relative to other regions of the source due to the difference in light travel time through the medium.  In the case of a heterogeneous medium one must use a generalization of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem, called Hopkins's formula.

Because the wavefront does not pass through a perfectly uniform medium as it travels through the [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] (and possibly [[intergalactic medium|intergalactic]]) medium and into the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the van Cittert–Zernike theorem does not hold exactly true for astronomical sources.  In practice, however, variations in the [[refractive index]] of the interstellar and intergalactic media and Earth's atmosphere are small enough that the theorem is approximately true to within any reasonable experimental error.  Such variations in the refractive index of the medium result only in slight perturbations from the case of a wavefront traveling through a homogeneous medium.

==Hopkins' formula==

Suppose we have a situation identical to that considered when the van Cittert–Zernike theorem was derived, except that the medium is now heterogeneous.  We therefore introduce the transmission function of the medium, &lt;math&gt;K(l, m, P, \nu)&lt;/math&gt;.  Following a similar derivation as before, we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{12}(l, m, 0) = \lambda^2 \iint I(l, m) K(l, m, P_1, \nu) K^*(l, m, P_2, \nu) \, dS&lt;/math&gt;

If we define

:&lt;math&gt;U(l, m, P_1) \equiv i \lambda K(l, m, P_1, \nu) \sqrt{I(l, m)}&lt;/math&gt;

then the mutual coherence function becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{12}(l, m, 0) = \iint U(l, m, P_1) U^*(l, m, P_2) \, dS&lt;/math&gt;

which is Hopkins's generalization of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem.&lt;ref name="born"&gt;Born and Wolf, ''Principles of Optics'', pp. 510&lt;/ref&gt;  In the special case of a homogeneous medium, the transmission function becomes

:&lt;math&gt;K(l, m, P, \nu) = -\frac{i e^{ikR}}{\lambda R}&lt;/math&gt;

in which case the mutual coherence function reduces to the Fourier transform of the brightness distribution of the source.  The primary advantage of Hopkins's formula is that one may calculate the mutual coherence function of a source indirectly by measuring its brightness distribution.

==Applications of the theorem==

===Aperture synthesis===

The van Cittert–Zernike theorem is crucial to the measurement of the brightness distribution of a source.  With two telescopes, a radio astronomer (or an infrared or submillimeter astronomer) can measure the correlation between the electric field at the two dishes due to some point from the source.  By measuring this correlation for many points on the source, the astronomer can reconstruct the visibility function of the source.  By applying the van Cittert–Zernike theorem, the astronomer can then take the inverse Fourier transform of the visibility function to discover the brightness distribution of the source.  This technique is known as [[aperture synthesis]] or synthesis imaging.

In practice, radio astronomers rarely recover the brightness distribution of a source by directly taking the inverse Fourier transform of a measured visibility function.  Such a process would require a sufficient number of samples to satisfy the [[Nyquist sampling theorem]]; this is many more observations than are needed to approximately reconstruct the brightness distribution of the source.  Astronomers therefore take advantage of physical constraints on the brightness distribution of astronomical sources to reduce the number of observations which must be made.  Because the brightness distribution must be real and positive everywhere, the visibility function cannot take on arbitrary values in unsampled regions.  Thus, a non-linear deconvolution algorithm like [[CLEAN (algorithm)|CLEAN]] or Maximum Entropy may be used to approximately reconstruct the brightness distribution of the source from a limited number of observations.&lt;ref name="burke"&gt;Burke and Graham-Smith, ''Introduction to Radio Astronomy'', pp. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptive optics===

The van Cittert–Zernike theorem also places constraints on the sensitivity of an [[adaptive optics]] system.  In an adaptive optics (AO) system, a distorted wavefront is provided and must be transformed to a distortion-free wavefront.  An AO system must make a number of different corrections to remove the distortions from the wavefront.  One such correction involves splitting the wavefront into two identical wavefronts and shifting one by some physical distance &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;  in the plane of the wavefront.  The two wavefronts are then superimposed, creating a fringe pattern.  By measuring the size and separation of the fringes, the AO system can determine phase differences along the wavefront.&lt;ref name="roddier"&gt;F. Roddier, ''Adaptive Optics in Astronomy'', pp. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique is known as "shearing."

The sensitivity of this technique is limited by the van Cittert–Zernike theorem.&lt;ref name="hardy"&gt;J. Hardy, ''Adaptive Optics for Astronomical Telescopes'', pp. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  If an extended source is imaged, the contrast between the fringes will be reduced by a factor proportional to the Fourier transform of the brightness distribution of the source.&lt;ref name="koliopoulos"&gt;Koliopoulos, ''Appl. Opt'', '''19''', 1523 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  The van Cittert–Zernike theorem implies that the mutual coherence of an extended source imaged by an AO system will be the Fourier transform of its brightness distribution.  An extended source will therefore change the mutual coherence of the fringes, reducing their contrast.

===Free-electron laser===
The Van Cittert–Zernike theorem can be used to calculate the partial spatial coherence of radiation from a [[free-electron laser]].

While primarily dominated by men throughout history, women have been represented in the field of comedy since the mid 1700s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/laughing-feminism|title=Laughing Feminism Subversive Comedy in Frances Burney and Maria Edgeworth|date=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|last1=Bilger|first1=Audrey|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy|date=2002|publisher=Sarah Crichton Books|last1=Kohen|first1=Yael}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy]], or creative works with the intention of humor, is thought to have originated in ancient Greek theatre in 425 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9|title=Lysistrata|last=Aristophanes|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Nick Hern Books|isbn=978-1-85459-325-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the first figures to enter the field, however, were faced with resistance and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|work=MAKERS|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/01/hitchens200701|title=Why Women Aren't Funny|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of humor in women was previously thought to have meant the ability to laugh at a man's joke, rather than tell the joke herself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When women did finally enter comedy (in its various forms), it was seen as niche, thus making bookings hard to come by.

Early acts were often based in the standard roles of women as a housewife and mother.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Comedy was tailored to what men would find to be both funny and non-threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As women gained slow acceptance to their presence in comedy, they were able to expand the topics that they covered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since then, women have made significant gains in the field, having found fame through stand-up, television, movies, and writing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women such as [[Amy Schumer]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Gina Barreca]] and many others have contributed to the world of comedy, spanning both time and medium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As comedic license has grown, comedy has become a tool within the scope of [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; By reclaiming a previously male-exclusive art form, female comedians are able to use patriarchal structure against itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Today, feminist comedy draws attention to female issues such as [[menstruation]], [[rape]], [[gender inequality]], beauty norms, and [[machismo]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As a readily acceptable and understandable medium of communication, comedy lends itself to the feminist movement, allowing women's issues to be more wide-spread in general society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Comedic forms==

===Stand-up===
Stand-up comedy is a form of comedy in which performers act in front of a live audience, creating an interactive dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dz-hsuL3r_QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=stand%20up&amp;f=false|title=Look Who's Laughing: Gender and Comedy|last=Finney|first=Gail|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9782881246449|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes range from short one-liners to longer monologues. The comedic form requires a takeover the stage, in order for the comedian's material to "kill."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For women, the direct contact with the audience puts their womanhood on display. Many female comedians choose to wear loose-fitting clothing to take their femininity out of the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitchmedia.org/post/here-is-whats-scary-about-being-a-female-stand-up-comic|title=Here is What's Scary About Being a Female Stand-Up Comic. {{!}} Bitch Media|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late night television===
[[File:SamanthaBeeFeb2011.jpg|thumb|[[Samantha Bee]] at a [[Hudson Union Society]] event in February 2011]]
American late night television (''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' etc...) has been dominated by white men for almost its entire existence. With the exception of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee|Full Frontal]]'' with [[Samantha Bee]], no woman has had a late night show on a major network of her own. The platform allows a variety of comedic  (monologues and shorts) and political (interviews and exposés) opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandra-popken/why-its-time-for-a-woman-_b_6813704.html|title=Why It's Time for a Woman to Host a Late Night Talk Show|last=Popken|first=Alexandra|date=2015-03-06|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/137160/why-are-there-so-few-female-late-night-hosts#.migMKG8nY|title=Why Are There So Few Female Late-Night Hosts?|last=Mic|work=Mic|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Film in general, as well as comedic film, continues to show the gender imbalance of other forms of comedy. In 2014, a study found that there were 2.24 male characters for every one female character. Of the movies surveyed, only 30.9% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/20-mustknow-facts-about-g_b_5869564.html|title=20 Facts Everyone Should Know About Gender Bias in Movies|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|date=2014-09-24|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the major storylines in the film industry (the romantic comedy), consistently follows traditional female roles, relegating women to simply searching for a male partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/14/romantic-comedies-failing-women_n_7026302.html|title=How Romantic Comedies Are Failing Women (And How To Fix It)|last=Karlin|first=Lily|date=2015-04-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender imbalance==
The gender imbalance between men and women can be found all over, even on Wikipedia. The page: [[list of comedians]] show a much higher number of males than females.

===In pay===
In the [[United States]], there is a large gender gap between men and women in comedy with regards to both pay and number.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/acumen/stand-ups-gender-gap/4661|title=It's Really No Joke|last=Humphries|first=Will|work=OZY|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, all ten of the top ten paid comedians were male, bringing in a total of $173 million.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2016, one female entered the list: [[Amy Schumer]], at number two.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etcanada.com/photos/170240/forbes-list-of-highest-paid-comedians-for-2016/#image-170249|title=Forbes’ List Of Highest-Paid Comedians For 2016|last=Crisp|first=Gavin|website=etcanada.com|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In appearances===
A study in 2017 found a large gender imbalance in UK comedic panel shows, with only 31% of the appearances. However, the same study also found marked improvement since 1989, when the statistic was 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strudel.org.uk/panelshows/index.html|title=UK Panel Show Gender Breakdown|website=strudel.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the UK industry website Chortle lists 269 female comedian as compared to 1,279 male comedians.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Imbalance can also be seen at the level of the comedy club. For example, the prestigious New York comedy club [[Carolines on Broadway|Carolines]] featured 20% female performers to 80% male in 2014.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Within the writers room, gender imbalance persists. Women made up only 10 percent of writers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films of 2010 and 15 percent of writers and 18 percent of creators in prime-time television during the 2010–2011 season.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In South Korea, of 70 comedic variety shows, 13 had all male hosts and guests, and 23 with all male hosts, meaning that more than half of these shows lack female hosts.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Only two shows had all females hosts and guests.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Shows without hosts often try to model marriages by pairing up male and female celebrities.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; While this does achieve some sense of gender balance, it uses very traditional roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Gendering of humor==
The early female figures in stand up, such as [[Phyllis Diller]], were able to enter the mainstream through their willingness to self-deprecate and declare themselves ugly. Other early female comediennes, such as [[Mae West]] and [[Helen Kane]], used [[sex appeal]] to attract male audiences. In other words, they were able to enter, but on the terms of male comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queens of comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the new generation of funny women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern female comedians cite a need to tailor their comedy to what men would find to be funny, with change in this mentality only coming very recently.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===In stand-up===
[[Stand-up comedy|Stand up comedy]], in particular, is described as a masculine art form.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=MAKERS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words that are used to describe success are often violent, such as ''killed'' or ''annihilated.''&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The performer must take charge of the stage, claiming it as their own via the phallic symbol of the microphone.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The structure of joke is often centered on an attack on another party. The aggression that such an art form necessitates is encouraged in males but discouraged in females.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karen|first=Stoddard|year=1977|title="WOMEN HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR" AND OTHER MYTHS: A CONSIDERATION OF FEMALE STAND-UP COMICS, 1960–1976|journal=American Humor|volume=4|pages=|jstor=42594582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination against women==
In many societies around the world, a woman's role has affected her flexibility in comedy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caliskan|first=Sevda|date=1995-01-01|title=Is There Such a Thing as Women's Humor?|journal=American Studies International|volume=33|issue=2|pages=49–59|jstor=41279344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries that historically view women as inferior to men, comedy is seen as a masculine discipline.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The common perception that women aren't funny pervades all aspects of comedy, including stand-up, television, and movies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The comedy establishment, influenced by patriarchal society, has relegated women to the "side of tears and loss." Systematic sexism can be found at the level of audience members, bookers, agents, and male comics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/10/discrimination-female-comedians/|title=The unfunny things that happen to funny women|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a powerful social tool, comedy brings women outside of the traditional role that has been defined as theirs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Women have experience everything from [[Heckler|heckling]] audience members calling them gendered terms like bitches or sluts, to being invited to fake comedic festivals (so the organizer could have sex with the female comedian), to being introduced in roasts as the girl that "slept with one of the judges."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Feminist tool==
Humor has been used a tool of feminism both for its ability to point out patriarchy and the structures it creates as well as identify the common female experience.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bing|first=Janet|year=2004|title=Is Feminist Humor an Oxymoron?|url=http://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=english_fac_pubs|journal=Women and Language|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction must be made between female humor and feminist humor. Female humor is self-deprecatory, turning inwards to the performer herself.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor, by contrast, looks outwards at the societal structures that demean women. It is aggressive and pointed, using comedic language formerly reserved for men only as a tool of liberation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor is to be an agent of change for women by drawing attention to their lowered position in society.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knobloch|first=Susan|date=1996-01-01|title=Review of The Unruly Woman: Gender and the Genres of Laughter|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=50|issue=2|pages=58–60|doi=10.2307/1213431|jstor=1213431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Bing argues that for feminist humor to be most effective at its goal of change, it should be inclusive, rather than divisive.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Divisive humor, or jokes that focus on male structures or male-bashing, do not advance feminism, but rather continue to marginalize females.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Inclusive humor that riffs off of the shared experience of women, can be subversive without the negative effects of divisive humor.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Bing continues to say that when humor falls into this inclusive comedy it contributes to feminism by first, contradicting the age old stereotype that women cannot be funny, and second, by undermining the status quo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Humor itself can be used to make strong structural changes in a society. Many times humor has been used to subvert hierarchical structures. For example, the [[Guerrilla Girls]] used humor to point out the patriarchal, unchanging nature of the Tony awards, which give the majority of their prizes to men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It also functions to establish an in-group (those making and understanding the joke) and an out-group (those on the receiving end).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Through this process, humor can create solidarity within a group, but can also make another feel excluded.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For women, this can serve to strengthen them as a community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Representation worldwide==

===Bangladesh===
Outside of the United States, women have been having similar experiences in their attempts to enter field of comedy, colored by their own cultural influences. One such women is [[Farhana Muna]], a Bangladeshi Muslim comic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Her material is focused on Bangladeshi life and culture, from parties to relatives commenting on weight loss. According to Muna, she often feels constrained by what is deemed appropriate or not for a Bangladeshi Muslim women. She must watch what she says and wears. Muna reemphasized the sentiment that there is a wider range of comedy acceptable for men. She has also faced criticism for her actions, including her choice to not wear the [[hijab]], with people calling her a bad Muslim. However, she continues her comedic work due to the community of women that she has met through it. Muna sees comedy as a collective platform of expression, a way to share her experiences in a relatable way.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anushay-hossain/becoming-munatic-how-a-ba_b_9283354.html|title=Becoming Munatic: How a Bangladeshi Woman is Changing the Rules of Comedy Online|last=Hossain|first=Anushay|date=2016-02-22|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Women have been on the rise in India's comedy as recently as 2016. In a country that has deeply entrenched patriarchal values, these female comedians face great amounts of cultural animosity.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Female-Stand-Up-Comedians-India/#.n0ztf1urd|title=These Female Comedians Are Taking The Stand-Up Industry By Storm, One Joke At A Time|last=ScoopWhoop|date=2016-04-22|work=ScoopWhoop|access-date=2017-04-07|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this discrimination women such as [[Aditi Mittal]] and [[Neeti Palta]] have found success in an industry that did not readily accept them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], female comedians do not encounter many comedic opportunities.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/korean-tv-gender-imbalance-1202019919/|title=Korean TV’s Gender Imbalance No Laughing Matter|last=Kil|first=Sonia|date=2017-04-03|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two television programs are completely hosted by females, with the other major television opportunity being couples shows. South Korean TV shows only offer gender balance when women are in gendered roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Producers see men as more advantageous hires as the shows' audiences are majority women. Additionally, there was a worry that audiences would react badly to strong women in television.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; As the woman's movement grows in South Korea, so too do the opportunities for women. Rather than featuring beautiful women as prizes to be won by males contestants, new shows such as ''[[Sister's Slam Dunk|Sisters' Slam Dunk]]'' (which premiered in 2016) feature women working together to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Figures==
=== Phyllis Diller ===
One of the most prominent early figures in American female comedy, [[Phyllis Diller]] made her comedic debut at the Purple Onion Comedy Club in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/phyllis-diller-9542308#breakthrough-role|title=Phyllis Diller|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stand-up routines focused on the problems of the suburban [[housewife]], a previous unaddressed area by male comics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By opening acknowledging her lack of physical attractiveness and by incorporating self-deprecation into her routines, Diller was able to enter comedy in a time when funny and attractive women were seen as threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, by confining her comedy to her inability to fulfill her traditional role, she reinforced female stereotypes rather than dismissing them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Joan Rivers===
[[Joan Rivers]] (active from 1959–2014) was one of the first female comedians to utilize the "talk/conversational" method, one that was suited to television talk shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike [[Phyllis Diller]], who was quite unlike her comedic personality, the comedy of Joan Rivers more closely reflected her personality. She often drew on her own personal experiences as a self-proclaimed Jewish princess.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike her predecessors, Rivers did not downplay her attractiveness, but rather incorporated it into her riffs on life as a single woman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Still, her comedy was focused on the traditional problems of a women (trying to find a boyfriend and husband, being a good wife etc).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Jane Curtin===
[[Jane Curtin]] was a part of the inaugural class of [[Not Ready For Prime Time Players|Not Ready for Prime Time Players]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975. On SNL, she was the anchor for Weekend Update and started in many well known skits including ''Coneheads''.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-curtin-222399|title=Jane Curtin|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Weekend Update, she served as the liberal counterpart to Dan Aykroyd’s conservative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, when asked about the environment at [[Saturday Night Live]], Curtin said that female writers faced an extremely difficult battle, especially when cast member like [[John Belushi]] were actively working against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fundamentally believing that women are not capable of humor, he also would sabotage pieces written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/04/jane_curtain_reveals_john_belu.html|title=Jane Curtin Says John Belushi Was a Total Sexist|date=2011-04-12|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this atmosphere, Jane Curtin had a very successful career at SNL and went on to work on sitcoms, Broadway, and various movies.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

===Tina Fey===
[[File:Amy Poehler and Tina Fey by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Female comedians [[Tina Fey]] (left) and [[Amy Poehler]] (right) at an event from the movie ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'']]
Figures such as [[Tina Fey]] have paved the way in the modern era for large-scale growth in female comedy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauzen|first=Martha|date=2014-01-02|title=The Funny Business of Being Tina Fey: Constructing a (feminist) comedy |journal=Feminist Media Studies| volume=14|issue=1|pages=106–117|doi=10.1080/14680777.2012.740060|issn=1468-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her public appointment as the first female head writer of [[Saturday Night Live]] placed her in a position to serve as a feminist comedy icon.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many of her sketches became iconic, particularly her satirical portrayal of Vice Presidential Candidate [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flowers|first=Arhlene A.|last2=Young|first2=Cory L.|date=2010-01-01|title=Parodying Palin: How Tina Fey’s Visual and Verbal Impersonations Revived a Comedy Show and Impacted the 2008 Election|journal=Journal of Visual Literacy|volume=29|issue=1|pages=47–67|doi=10.1080/23796529.2010.11674673|issn=1051-144X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her comedic writing ([[Mean Girls]], [[30 Rock]], [[Bossypants]], [[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]], Date Night etc...), in addition to achieving great public notice, was well received by critics.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Miranda Hart===
[[Miranda Hart]] is a female comedian from the UK. She is most well-known for her television series ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]].'' Her awkward and clumsy character in the show is a embodiment of all the society neuroses that women face in daily life.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/01/miranda-hart-tv-queen-uncool|title=Miranda Hart – TV's queen of uncool|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=2010-12-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a style of comedy makes her into an everywoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gd6_BwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=miranda+hart+comedy&amp;ots=V1My1fB1Yb&amp;sig=Fsgbg21vUl-k_8m6zx_oWUIfwr4#v=onepage&amp;q=miranda%20hart%20comedy&amp;f=false|title=Twenty-first Century Feminism: Forming and Performing Femininity|last=Nally|first=C.|last2=Smith|first2=A.|date=2015-02-27|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137492852|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart herself sees a divide in comedy, with some using comedy as a tool to increase their coolness (others) and some using comedy as a tool for clowning around (her).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; By staying within the clowning realm of comedy, she achieved a cult following.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Amy Schumer===
[[Amy Schumer]] is a female comedian from the United States, and was the highest paid entertainer in her field in 2016.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; She has been one of the most successful female comedians of all time, appealing to a wide audience of both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/45771/how-amy-schumer-got-guys-to-think-feminists-are-funny/|title=Inside Amy Schumer and Broad City: How to Get Guys Watch to Feminist Comedy|website=Time|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumer is most well-known for her movie ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]'' (2015) and her [[Comedy Central]] show, ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]].''

The '''Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution''' ('''WHOI''', acronym pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|uː|i}} {{respell|HOO|ee}}) is a private, [[nonprofit]] research and higher education facility dedicated to the study of [[marine science]] and [[engineering]]. Its agenda includes: geological activity deep within the earth; plant, animal, and microbial populations and their interactions in the ocean; coastal erosion; ocean circulation; ocean pollution; and global climate change.

Established in 1930 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, it is the largest independent oceanographic research institution in the U.S., with staff and students numbering about 1,000.

==Constitution==
The Institution is organized into six departments,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/main/departments-centers-labs|title=Departments, Centers, and Labs|work=whoi.edu|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Ocean Research, and a marine policy center. Its shore-based facilities are located in the village of [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]], United States and a mile and a half away on the Quissett Campus. The bulk of the Institution's funding comes from grants and contracts from the [[National Science Foundation]] and other government agencies, augmented by foundations and private donations.

WHOI scientists, engineers, and students collaborate to develop theories, test ideas, build seagoing instruments, and collect data in diverse marine environments. Ships operated by WHOI carry research scientists throughout the world’s oceans. The WHOI fleet includes two large research vessels (''[[RV Atlantis (AGOR-25)|Atlantis]]'') and ''[[RV Neil Armstrong (AGOR-27)|Neil Armstrong]]'' , the coastal craft ''[[R/V Tioga|Tioga]]'', small research craft such as the dive-operation work boat Echo, the deep-diving human-occupied submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', the tethered, remotely operated vehicle [[Jason (ROV)|Jason/Medea]], and autonomous underwater vehicles such as the [[REMUS (AUV)|REMUS]] and [[SeaBED]]. 

WHOI offers graduate and post-graduate studies in marine science. There are several fellowship and trainee-ship programs, and graduate degrees are awarded through a joint program with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) or by the Institution itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|title=Ensuring the future of ocean science
|work=whoi.edu
|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
|accessdate=15 December 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHOI also offers other outreach programs and informal public education through its Exhibit Center and summer tours. The Institution has a volunteer program and a membership program, WHOI Associate.

On October 1, 2015, Mark Abbott became the institution's tenth president and director.&lt;ref name="president"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/main/president-director|title=President and Director|website=whoi.edu|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:RVAtlantis.jpg|thumb|[[RV Atlantis|R/V ''Atlantis'']], the first [[research vessel]] operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.]]
In 1927, a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] committee concluded that it was time to "consider the share of the United States of America in a worldwide program of oceanographic research." The committee's recommendation for establishing a permanent independent research laboratory on the East Coast to "prosecute oceanography in all its branches" led to the founding in 1930 of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.&lt;ref name="whoi_history"&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.whoi.edu/main/history-legacy
|title=History and Legacy
|work=whoi.edu
|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
|accessdate=15 December 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A $2.5 million grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] supported the summer work of a dozen scientists, construction of a laboratory building and commissioning of a research vessel, the {{convert|142|ft|m|adj=on}} ketch ''Atlantis'', whose profile still forms the Institution's logo.&lt;ref name="whoi_history"/&gt;

WHOI grew substantially to support significant defense-related research during World War II, and later began a steady growth in staff, research fleet, and scientific stature. Over the years, WHOI scientists have made seminal discoveries about the ocean that have contributed to improving US commerce, health, national security, and quality of life.

In 1977 the institute appointed the influential oceanographer [[John Steele (oceanographer)|John Steele]] as director, and he served until his retirement in 1989.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10599939/John-Steele-obituary.html | title=John Steele – obituary | work=The Telegraph | date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 1985, a joint French-American expedition led by [[Jean-Louis Michel (oceanographer)|Jean-Louis Michel]] of [[IFREMER]] and [[Robert Ballard]] of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution identified the location of the wreck of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] which sank off the coast of [[Newfoundland]] 15 April 1912.

On 3 April 2011, within a week of resuming of the search operation for [[Air France Flight 447]], a team led by WHOI, operating full ocean depth [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUVs) owned by the Waitt Institute discovered, by means of [[sidescan sonar]], a large portion of debris field from flight AF447.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;[http://www.informs.org/ORMS-Today/Public-Articles/August-Volume-38-Number-4/In-Search-of-Air-France-Flight-447 In search of Air France Flight 447] Lawrence D. Stone Institute of Operations Research and the Management Sciences 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 the institution effected an [[open-access policy]] to make its research [[open access|publicly accessible]] online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://roarmap.eprints.org/1333/ |title= Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |work=[[ROARMAP]]: Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies |publisher=[[University of Southampton]] |location=UK |accessdate= July 24, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institution has maintained a long and controversial business collaboration with the treasure hunter company Odyssey Marine &lt;ref&gt;https://www.abc.es/cultura/abci-trama-financiera-cazatesoros-detras-rescate-galeon-san-jose-201807090244_noticia.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Likewise, WHOI has participated in the location of the San José galleon in Colombia for the commercial exploitation of the shipwreck by the Government of President Santos and a private company.
