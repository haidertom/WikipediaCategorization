      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1668">'''Accumulative roll bonding''' (ARB) is a [[severe plastic deformation]] (SPD) process. It is a method of rolling a stack of metal sheets, which are repeatedly rolled to a severe reduction ratio, sectioned into two halves, piled again and rolled. It has been often proposed as a method for the production of metal materials with ultrafine grain [[microstructure]]. The earliest works on ARB were by Nobuhiro Tsuji, Y. Saito and co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saito|first=Y|author2=Utsunomiya, H |author3=Tsuji, N |author4=Sakai, T|title=Novel Ultra-High Straining Process for Bulk Materials - Development of the Accumulative Roll-Bonding (ARB)|journal=Acta Materialia|year=1999|volume=47|issue=2|pages=579–583|doi=10.1016/s1359-6454(98)00365-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adem.200310077|title=ARB (Accumulative Roll-Bonding) and other new Techniques to Produce Bulk Ultrafine Grained Materials|year=2003|last1=Tsuji|first1=N.|last2=Saito|first2=Y.|last3=Lee|first3=S.-H.|last4=Minamino|first4=Y.|journal=Advanced Engineering Materials|volume=5|issue=5|pages=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain a single slab of a solid material, the rolling involves not only [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]], but also [[roll bonding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2003.10.082| title=Accumulative roll-bonding: first experience with a twin-roll cast AA8006 alloy | author=Karlik | author2=Slamova | author3=Homola| journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds | year=2004 | volume=378 | issue=1–2 | pages=322–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al Ries''' is a [[marketing]] professional and author. He is also the cofounder and chairman of the Atlanta-based [[Consultant|consulting]] firm Ries &amp; Ries with his partner and daughter, [[Laura Ries]].  Along with [[Jack Trout]], Ries is crediting with coining the term "[[Positioning (marketing)|positioning]]", as related to the field of marketing,&lt;ref name="Brand Strategy Insider"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brand Strategy Insider |url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2007/08/great-moments-2-5.html#.VvAOpnra1aY|publisher=The Blake Project |accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ries|first=Al|last2=Trout|first2=Jack|date=April 1972|title=The Positioning Era Cometh|url=http://www.ries.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Positioning-Articles002.pdf|journal=Advertising Age|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and authored ''Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind'', an industry standard on the subject.

Ries graduated from [[DePauw University]] in 1950 with a degree in [[liberal arts]] and accepted a position with the advertising department of [[General Electric]] before founding his own advertising agency in [[New York City]], Ries Cappiello Colwell, in 1963. The agency later changed to a marketing strategy firm, Trout &amp; Ries.

In 1972, again cooperating with Trout, Ries co-authored a three-part series of articles declaring the arrival of the "Positioning Era" in ''[[Advertising Age]]'' magazine, promoting their concept of positioning.

In 1994, Ries founded Ries &amp; Ries with his daughter Laura a recent graduate of [[Northwestern University]] and TBWA advertising account executive.

Ries was selected as one of the most influential people in the field of [[public relations]] in the 20th century by ''[[PR Week]]'' magazine in 1999. Ries has also written a number of books that have made the  ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' best seller list &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/02/b3611179.htm |title=The Business Week Best-Seller List |date=1999-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201914/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/02/b3611179.htm |archivedate=2008-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_44/b3806033.htm |title=The BusinessWeek Best Seller List |date=2002-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302204204/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_44/b3806033.htm |archivedate=2008-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a number of occasions.

The [[American Marketing Association]], NY Chapter announced Al Ries a one of the 2016 inductees to the [[Marketing Hall of Fame]]®.&lt;ref name="2016 Marketing Hall of Fame Inductee"&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 Marketing Hall of Fame Inductee |url=http://www.marketinghalloffame.org/al-ries-2016-marketing-hall-of-fame-inductee/

On the need for the directive, an explanatory document from the European Commission stated that AIFMs had become "very significant actors in the European financial system, managing a large quantity of assets on behalf of pension funds and other investors; accounting for a significant proportion of trading activity in financial markets; and constituting an important source of counterparty risk for other market participants" and that they had "contributed to the build-up of leverage in the financial system, the consequences of which for the stability of financial markets became apparent when leverage in the hedge fund sector was rapidly unwound during the crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=16 September 2015|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-10-572_en.htm?locale=en|title= Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers ('AIFMD'): Frequently Asked Questions|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the directive was approved by the [[European Parliament]], [[José Manuel Barroso]], then [[President of the European Commission]], said "The adoption of the directive means that hedge funds and private equity will no longer operate in a regulatory void outside the scope of supervisors. The new regime brings transparency and security to the way these funds are managed and operate, which adds to the overall stability of our financial system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=16 September 2015|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-10-573_en.htm?locale=en|title= European Commission statement at the occasion of the European Parliament vote on the directive on hedge funds and private equity|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
===Ch I, General provisions===

{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
The scope of the application of the directive is defined. The directives apply to EU AIFMs which manage one or more AIFs irrespective of whether such AIFs are EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs; non-EU AIFMs which manage one or more EU AIFs; and non-EU AIFMs which market one or more AIFs in the Union irrespective of whether such AIFs are EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L:2011:174:FULL&amp;from=EN|title=Official Journal L 174/2011|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific entities that are exempt from the directives are also listed.

===Ch II, Authorisation===
An AIFM must be authorised with the AIFM's home state regulator for AIFMs that have assets under management in AIFs above the thresholds of: (1) 100 million EUR, if the AIF uses leverage; or (2) 500 million EUR, if the AIF does not use leverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFM Directive for US Private Fund Managers |author=Neil Robson |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/print/article/aifm-directive-us-private-fund-managers |work=The National Law Review |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ch III, Operating conditions for AIFMs===
The AIFMD's reporting regulations require each AIF to be named using a series of codes, including its national identification code, the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) and the Legal Entity Identifier code.&lt;ref name=EC2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAconsult13&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Consultation paper: guidelines on reporting obligations under Article 3 and Article 4 of the AIFMD |publisher=European Securities and Market Authority |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/system/files/2013-592_consultation_paper_on_esma_guidelines_on_aifmd_reporting_for_publication.pdf |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIFMs must select only brokers and counterparties that are subject to regulatory supervision, that are financially sound, and that have the necessary organizational structure to provide services to the AIFM or the AIF.&lt;ref name=EC2/&gt; All AIFMs must submit quarterly, semi-annual, or annual reports to their respective member state regulator with information about the AIFM and its AIFs as well as an annual report with information such as the fund's financial statements, activities, and information about the total amount of remuneration paid by the AIFM to its staff.&lt;ref name=EC2/&gt;

===Chs IV-V, Transparency requirements===
Special requirements apply to AIFMs using leverage. AIFMs are required to disclose the extent of the leverage employed within their funds, and prove that leverage in any fund has been limited to a reasonable amount.&lt;ref name=PDF&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive: AIFMs managing leveraged AIFs |pages=3–5 |publisher=Financial Services Commission |url=http://www.fsc.gi/download/AIFMD/AIFMDManagingSpecificTypesOfAIFsAIFMsManagingLeveragedAIFs.pdf |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of AIFMD requirements that apply to AIFMs are different, depending on whether the AIFM is engaged in portfolio or risk management activities within the EU or markets its funds to EU investors. Each fund can only have one AIFM, though the AIFM can delegate certain functions to other entities. EU AIFMs became subject to all of the provisions of the AIFMD once it was implemented at the EU Member State level.&lt;ref name=Yonge13&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD's Impact on Non-EU Managers of Non-EU Alternative Investment Funds |author=William Younge |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-338211304.html |work=Mondaq Business Briefing |date=30 July 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorised fund managers located within the EU are permitted to market their EU funds to professional investors in any EU member state under what the AIFMD calls a passport.&lt;ref name=Yonge13/&gt;

The reporting requirements of the AIFMD apply to all AIFMs who manage or market alternative funds within the EU.&lt;ref name=Hedgeweek14&gt;{{cite news |title=SEI introduces AIFMD Annex IV reporting solution |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2014/12/09/214424/sei-introduces-aifmd-annex-iv-reporting-solution |work=HedgeWeek |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill the reporting requirements, AIFMs must file an Annex IV report within 30 days of the end of the applicable reporting period, which is determined by the amount of an AIFM's assets under management. Reporting periods range from quarterly to half-yearly to annually.&lt;ref name=ESMAconsult13/&gt; The Annex IV report is a government regulatory document comprising 41 questions, analysing a fund's investment portfolios, exposures, leverage ratios, liquidity and risk analysis.&lt;ref name=Lipman14&gt;{{cite news |title=This is Why AIFMD Annex IV Reports Demand More Attention |author=Becca Lipman |url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/this-is-why-aifmd-annex-iv-reports-demand-more-attention/d/d-id/1268695? |work=Wallstreet &amp; Technology |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COOwebinar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cooconnect.com/webinar-review/how-ready-are-aifms-for-annex-iv-reporting-under-aifmd |title=2014 Q2 Webinar Programme |author=CME Group |date=7 July 2014 |work=COOConnect |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter V, section 2, articles 26–30, additional obligations apply for AIFs acquiring controlling influence in non-listed companies. This is essentially directed at [[private equity]] firms, and partly aims to stop [[asset stripping]]. Article 26(5) defines "control" as holding over 50% of voting rights, including as a ‘club deal’. This was watered down from 30% in the AIFMD draft (formerly in article 26(1)(a)). Article 27(1) states that funds have to notify investee companies and shareholders when they acquire control, and article 28(4) requires them to disclose the acquisition to stakeholder groups including employees or representatives via the investee's board. Article 29 places an obligation on the central Private Equity management company (rather than an investee companies) to give information on operational and financial developments in firm's annual reports. Article 30 lists distribution requirements, which are intended to prevent [[asset stripping]] in the first 24 months from acquiring control).

===Chs VI-VIII, Marketing and the AIFMD passport===
For the purposes of the directive, marketing is defined as any offering or placement (sale) of an AIF at the initiative of the AIFM, or on behalf of the AIFM, to investors domiciled in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFM Directive for US Private Fund Managers |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/aifm-directive-us-private-fund-managers |work=The National Law Review |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawrence14&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD: Time to Back Up on Reverse Solicitation |author=David Lawrence |url=http://www.finalternatives.com/node/26688 |work=FIN Alternatives |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member state laws and rules determine whether a fund is engaged in marketing for purposes of the directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The British Virgin Islands – AIFMD one year on |author=Tim Clipstone |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2014/06/27/205833/british-virgin-islands-%E2%80%93-aifmd-one-year |work=HedgeWeek |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU funds managed by EU managers may be marketed across the EU under the AIFMD passport, provided the manager complies with all of the requirements of the directive.&lt;ref name=Lawrence14/&gt; EU or non-EU funds managed by non-EU managers may currently be marketed within the EU only under national private placement regimes, as non-EU managers cannot obtain the marketing passport.&lt;ref name=Moran15&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD offers passport to European markets |author=Michelle Moran |url=http://www.ftadviser.com/2015/03/30/investments/fixed-income/aifmd-offers-passport-to-european-markets-maFHbHp1XZ0R07MAUizxnK/article.html |work=Financial Times Advisor |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, non-EU funds managed by EU managers may only be marketed under the private placement regimes. Funds marketed under national private placement regimes are subject to compliance with certain provisions of the AIFMD related to reporting, regulatory co-operation agreements, and the jurisdiction of the fund and the manager not being listed as a "non-cooperative country and territory" by the [[Financial Action Task Force]] (FATF).&lt;ref name=EurActiv15&gt;{{cite news |title=Why competition is vital to Europe's investors |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/why-competition-vital-europes-investors-311308 |work=''EurActiv.com'' |date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-EU AIFMD Passports==

In 2015, an analyst for EurActiv.com, a European news and policy website, expressed concern that the directive puts non-EU funds at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name=EurActiv15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffith14&gt;{{cite news |title=The AIFMD Deadline Tomorrow: Is The Industry Ready? |author=Saul Griffith |url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/07/aifmd-hedge-funds/ |work=ValueWalk |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the European Securities and Markets Authority initiated a consultation to discuss issuing new rules to allow EU AIFMs to market their non-EU AIFs under the AIFMD passport, and likewise for non-EU managers to market their funds under the AIFMD passport.&lt;ref name=EurActiv15/&gt;&lt;ref name=COO&gt;{{cite news |title=Uncertainty over extent to which AIFMD passport will be afforded to non-EU managers |url=http://cooconnect.com/news/uncertainty-over-extent-to-which-aifmd-passport-will-be-afforded-to-non-eu-managers |work=COO Connect |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAevidence&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/consultation/Call-evidence-AIFMD-passport-and-third-country-AIFMs |title=Call for evidence on AIFMD passport and third country AIFMs |publisher=ESMA |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016 AIFM concluded that there were no fundamental obstacles to issuing AIFMD passports to Canada, [[Guernsey]], Japan, [[Jersey]] and [[Switzerland]], seven other non-EU countries are also under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-advises-extension-funds-passport-12-non-eu-countries |title=EXTENSION OF FUNDS PASSPORT TO 12 NON-EU COUNTRIES |publisher=ESMA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In a study conducted by Multifonds in June 2014, 72% of respondents from the EU and Canada said they expected non-EU managers to set up European operations in order to take advantage of AIFMD.&lt;ref name=Multifonds12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multifonds.com/media-centre/news/two-thirds-fund-admin-industry-believes-aifmd-will-be-catalyst-convergence-long-on |title=Two-thirds of fund admin industry believes AIFMD will be a catalyst for the convergence of long-only and hedge funds |author=Fishburn Hedges |date=10 September 2012 |work=Media Centre |publisher=Multifonds |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 study conducted by [[Preqin]], 71% of American fund managers said they believed the AIFMD would have a negative effect on the industry.&lt;ref name=Schmerken14b&gt;{{cite news |title=Hedge Fund Readiness for AIFMD Is Lacking as Deadline Approaches |author=Ivy Schmerken |url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/compliance/hedge-fund-readiness-for-aifmd-is-lacking-as-deadline-approaches/d/d-id/1297376 |work=Wall Street &amp; Tech |date=17 July 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jessop14&gt;{{cite news |title=Foreign hedge funds could lose as Europe tightens rules |author=Simon Jessop |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/21/uk-hedgefunds-aifmd-idUSKBN0FQ15G20140721 |agency=Reuters |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fund managers from within the EU, Asia and the rest of the world excluding the United States reported in 2014&lt;ref name=Hernandez14&gt;{{cite news |title=Minority of Infrastructure and Real Estate Fund Managers Believe AIFMD Has Positive Impact |author=Vittorio Hernandez |url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/minority-infrastructure-real-estate-fund-managers-believe-aifmd-has-positive-impact-1350071 |work=International Business Times |date=11 August 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2015&lt;ref name=Kumar15&gt;{{cite news |title=European hedge funds close at record pace as higher costs, poor returns bite |author=Nishant Kumar |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/16/hedgefunds-europe-closures-idUSL3N0U62N620150216 |agency=Reuters |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the AIFMD was costing them more than they had expected it to.&lt;ref name=Kilhof14&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD compliance falls behind |author=Sandra Kilhof |url=http://www.worldfinance.com/wealth-management/aifmd-compliance-falls-behind |work=World Finance: The Voice of the Market |date=15 November 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the costs of the legislation comes partly from industry lobbyists.&lt;ref name=Griffith14/&gt;

According to a study conducted by [[Deloitte]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_LU/lu/market-challenges/aifmd/index.htm|title=AIFMD|work=Deloitte Luxembourg}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the UK-based [[asset management|asset managers]] think that the AIFM Directive could reduce the competitiveness of the EU's alternative investment funds industry because of the compliance the regulations impose on the industry. In addition, these managers from the hedge fund, private equity and real estate sectors believe that the directive will reduce the number of non-EU managers operating within the EU.  The AIFMD passed after contentious negotiations, especially between UK and French authorities, and because of its third-country provisions, which attracted considerable interest and engagement from U.S. authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2383445 |title=Varieties of Regulation: How States Pursue and Set International Financial Standards |last1=Prabhakar |first1=Rahul |date=1 June 2013 |publisher=Oxford University GEG |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Bachelor of Business''' ('''BBus, BBus (Major)''') is a three-year undergraduate business [[Bachelor's degree|degree]] offered by traditional and newer universities from the post-Dawkins era in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and [[Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dbs.ie/course/full-time-undergraduate/full-time-undergraduate-bachelor-of-business|title=Full-time Undergraduate - Bachelor of Business|website=www.dbs.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is similar in format and structure to a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (BCom).

In Australia, it was traditionally awarded by former non-university tertiary institutions which include institutes of technologies, such as [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[RMIT University]] and the [[University of Technology, Sydney]]. Some former Institute of Technologies and Colleges such as Ballarat College of Advanced Education ([[University of Ballarat]]), Swinburne Institute of Technology ([[Swinburne University]]) the South Australia Institute of Technology ([[University of South Australia]]) and the Western Australia Institute of Technology ([[Curtin University of Technology]]) have renamed their Bachelor of Business programs to Bachelor of Commerce after achieving university status.

Many universities such as [[Monash University]] and the [[University of Queensland]] are offering Bachelor of Business degrees as a way to further specialise students study needs while other universities such as [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[University of Tasmania]], [[James Cook University]], [[Griffith University]] and [[La Trobe University]] have replaced many of their traditional general Commerce programs with Business programs.  Within Australia, Bachelor of Business degrees are as common as Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Economics degrees.

In Ireland this award can also be offered as an honours degree '''B Business (Hons)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dorset-college.ie/course/131/bachelor-of-business-honours-in-international-business|title=HETAC/QQI Bachelor of Business in International Business Level 8 - Dorset College Dublin|website=www.dorset-college.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a further one year study than the ordinary level Bachelor degree.

'''Bontempi''' is an Italian musical instrument manufacturer, best known for manufacturing low-priced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Purchaser's Guide to the Music Industries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_E5AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=1986|publisher=Music Trades Corporation}} - ''Bontempi, a worldwide leader in the manufacture of electronic keyboards, home organs, and musical toys, entered the U.S. market''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Toy &amp; Hobby World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3dQAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=1977|publisher=Charleson Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; plastic-cased [[chord organ]]s: small keyboard instruments in which the sound is produced by air being forced over reeds by an [[electric fan]].

Such instruments were popular in the 1970s and early 1980s, and continued to be made until the mid-1980s, when Bontempi moved to manufacturing small, home [[electronic keyboard]]s. The company continues to make low-priced musical instruments aimed at the educational and toy market, including [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[guitar]]s, [[drum kit]]s and various items of [[Percussion instrument|tuned percussion]].

Bontempi has been manufacturing musical instruments and toys for over 80 years;{{citation needed|date=December 2016|website=http://www.bontempi.com}} some of its fan-blown reed organs were built by [[Comus S.p.A.]].&lt;ref name="Gellerman1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert F.

Some European musicians{{who|date=November 2015}} use the expression "having a Bontempi sound" to describe an electronic instrument that sounds like a young child's toy, as they were children when Bontempi instruments were extremely popular in western  Europe.

'''Boutique manufacturing''' is a method used for the custom production of certain products in limited quantities by hand or with a restricted level of automation. Products produced this way often include ceramics, furniture, amplifiers, yachts, boats, leather goods or watches and jewellery among others. In industrial countries, boutique manufacturing is being selected generally for high class goods in upper price levels and only for single products or small batches.

==Benefits and disadvantages==

The key advantages of boutique manufacturing in comparison to traditional factory manufacturing with batch fabrication, large or mass production are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
* low investment in factory automation
* high flexibility during manufacturing
* quick alteration of product types produced on every workplace or production line
* supports build to order without the necessity of using many pre-assembled components; creation of value caused by assembly takes place mainly at the end of the production flow.
* allows an unachieved level of product individualization

Consequently, boutique manufacturing closes the gap between piece production and small batch/low volume production. The workflow organization of a boutique manufacturing entity can be a mixture of both – elements of jobbing or batch production, however involving higher standardization than the first one. Often boutique manufacturing workshop and factories are organized with single workplaces or production cells carrying out a number of subsequent production steps until completion of certain components or even the whole product. Flexibility and variety of products being able to produce in the entity therefore are much higher than with the more standardized method batch production. 

However, with this method, manufacturing of larger quantities of unified products is not possible at reasonable costs. Serial fabrication or large production of goods then would be suitable alternative production methods involving higher grades of automation and standardization.

{{Banking in the United States}}

The '''Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act''' (or '''Check 21 Act''') is a [[United States federal law]], {{USPL|108|100}}, that was enacted on October 28, 2003 by the [[108th United States Congress|108th U.S. Congress]]. The Check 21 Act took effect one year later on October 28, 2004.  The law allows the recipient of the original paper [[cheque|check]] to create a digital version of the original check, a process known as [[Cheque truncation|check truncation]], into an electronic format called a "[[substitute check]]", thereby eliminating the need for further handling of the physical document. In essence, the recipient bank no longer returns the paper check, but effectively e-mails an image of both sides of the check to the bank it is drawn upon. 

[[Consumer]]s are most likely to see the effects of this act when they notice that certain checks (or images thereof) are no longer being returned to them with their monthly statement, even though other checks are still being returned. Another effect of the law is that it is now legal for anyone to use a computer scanner or [[mobile phone]] to capture images of checks and deposit them electronically, a process known as [[remote deposit]].

Check 21 is not subject to [[ACH Network|ACH]] rules, therefore transactions are not subject to [[NACHA]] (The Electronic Payments Association) rules, regulations, fees and fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aba.com/Tools/Function/Payments/Documents/e384418906ca4bda86080c78bc729996ResourceDocument.pdf|title=Check 21 Resource Document|last=|first=|date=|website=aba.com|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Truncation ==
{{main | Cheque truncation}}

The Act lets banks take advantage of image technologies and electronic transport while not being dependent on other banks being ready to settle transactions with images instead of paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wbsarchive.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/check-21-e28093-check-based-payments-in-transition-in-the-u-s-a.doc|title=Check 21 – US Check based payments in transition|accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of removing the paper check from its processing flow is called "[[check truncation]]". In truncation, both sides of the paper check are scanned to produce a digital image. If a paper document is still needed, these images are inserted into specially formatted documents containing a photo-reduced copy of the original checks called a "[[substitute check]]".

Once a check is truncated, businesses and banks can work with either the digital image or a print reproduction of it. Images can be exchanged between member banks, [[savings and loan]]s, [[credit union]]s, servicers, [[clearing house (finance)|clearinghouses]], and the [[Federal Reserve Bank]].

{{cns|Not all banks have the ability to receive image files, so there are companies who offer the service. At the item processing center, the checks are sorted by machine according to the routing/transit ([[ABA routing transit number|RT]]) number as presented by the [[magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) line, and scanned to produce a digital image. A batch file is generated and sent to the Federal Reserve Bank or presentment point for settlement or image replacement. If a substitute check is needed, the transmitting bank is responsible for the cost of generating and transporting it from the presentment point to the Federal Reserve Bank or other corresponding bank.|date=December 2015}}

==Effects and developments==
===Remote deposit===
{{cns|Check 21 has also spawned a new bank treasury management product known as [[remote deposit]].  This process allows depositing customers the ability to capture front and rear images of checks along with their respective [[MICR]] data for those being deposited.  This data is then uploaded to their depositing institution, and the customer's account is then credited.  Remote deposit therefore precludes the need for merchants and other large depositors to travel to the bank (or branch) to physically make a deposit.|date=December 2015}}

{{cns|In addition to remote deposit, other such electronic depositing options are available to qualifying bank customers through [[NACHA]].  These options include "[[Point of Purchase]] Entry" (POP) and "Back Office Conversion Entry" (BOC) for retailers, and "Accounts Receivable Entry" (ARC) for high volume remittance receivers.  These transactions are not covered under the Check 21 legislation, but rather are electronic conversions of the checks' MICR data into an [[ACH Network|ACH]] debit.  This can help the depositor save on the costs of transporting checks and in bank fees.  However, the liability changes from [[Regulation CC]] of the Federal Reserve to [[Regulation E]], which provides much more protection for the account being debited and therefore more risk to the merchant and originating bank.|date=December 2015}}

==Patents==

There are a number of patents relating to "check collection systems",&lt;ref name="budget"&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8981/s1145.pdf Congressional Budget Office Cost Report], pages 2, 5 and 11&lt;/ref&gt; including some owned by [[DataTreasury]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Lerer, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9202.html "Senate, old legal woes drawn into patent fight"], politico.com, March 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Group of Fortune 500 CEOs in 2015 (cropped to remove non-CEO).jpg|thumb|A group of [[Fortune 500]] CEOs in 2015.|alt=]]
The '''chief executive officer''' ('''CEO''')&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2428371|title=CEOs and Presidents|first=Tom C. W.|last=Lin|date=April 23, 2014|publisher=|access-date=June 29, 2017|via=papers.SSRN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or just '''chief executive''' ('''CE'''), is the most senior [[corporate]], [[executive officer|executive]], or administrative officer in charge of managing an [[organization]]{{snd}} especially an independent [[legal entity]] such as a [[company]] or [[nonprofit institution]]. CEOs lead a range of organizations, including public and private [[corporations]], non-profit organizations and even some government organizations (e.g., [[Crown corporation]]s). The CEO of a corporation or company typically reports to the [[board of directors]] and is charged with maximizing the value of the entity,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; which may include maximizing the share price, market share, revenues, or another element. In the non-profit and government sector, CEOs typically aim at achieving outcomes related to the organization's mission, such as reducing poverty, increasing literacy, etc.

In the early 21st century, top executives typically had technical degrees in science, engineering, or law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Marianne |last=Bertrand |title=CEOs |journal=[[Annual Review of Economics]] |volume=1 |publisher= [[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | year = 2012 | pages = 121–150 |doi=10.1146/annurev.economics.050708.143301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The responsibility of an organization's CEO are set by the organization's [[board of directors]] or other authority, depending on the organization's legal structure. They can be far-reaching or quite limited and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority. Typically, responsibilities include being a decision maker on strategy and other key policy issues, [[leadership|leader]], manager, and executor. The communicator role can involve speaking to the press and the rest of the outside world, as well as to the organization's management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy. As a leader of the company, the CEO or MD advises the board of directors, motivates employees, and drives change within the organization. As a manager, the CEO/MD presides over the organization's day-to-day operations.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceo.asp |title=Chief Executive Officer - CEO |work=Investopedia |publisher=Investopedia US, a Division of IAC |access-date=2014-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BusinessDictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/Chief-Executive-Officer-CEO.html |title=Chief Executive Officer (CEO) |work=BusinessDictionary.com |publisher=WebFinance Inc. |access-date=October 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Capstone Encyclopaedia of Business|last=Capstone Publishing|publisher=Capstone Publishing|year=2003|isbn=1-84112-053-7|location=Oxford, U.K|pages=79–80}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-05-17 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to the person who makes  all the key decisions regarding the company, which includes all sectors and fields of the business, including operations, marketing, business development, finance, human resources, etc.  The CEO of a company is not necessarily the owner of the company.

==International use==
In some countries, there is a [[dual board]] system with two separate boards, one [[Board of directors|executive board]] for the day-to-day business and one [[supervisory board]] for control purposes (selected by the shareholders). In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the [[chairman]] presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board. This allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person.

In the United States, the [[board of directors]] (elected by the [[shareholder]]s) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the [[executive committee]] (the division/subsidiary heads and [[Corporate title|C-level]] officers that report directly to the CEO).

In the United States, and in business, the executive officers are usually the top officers of a corporation, the chief executive officer (CEO) being the best-known type. The definition varies; for instance, the California Corporate Disclosure Act defines "executive officers" as the five most highly compensated officers not also sitting on the board of directors. In the case of a sole proprietorship, an executive officer is the sole proprietor. In the case of a partnership, an executive officer is a managing partner, senior partner, or administrative partner. In the case of a limited liability company, executive officer is any member, manager, or officer.

==Related positions==
{{Main article|Corporate title}}
Typically, a CEO has several subordinate executives, each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Markus Menz |url=http://jom.sagepub.com/content/38/1/45.abstract |title=Menz, M. 2012. Functional Top Management Team Members: A Review, Synthesis, and Research Agenda. Journal of Management, 38(1): 45-80 |publisher=Jom.sagepub.com |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; executive officers or corporate officers. Subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations, but one common category of subordinate executive, if the CEO is also the president, is the [[vice-president]] (VP). An organization may have more than one vice-president, each tasked with a different area of responsibility (e.g., VP of [[finance]], VP of [[human resources]], VP of [[research and development]]). Some organizations have subordinate executive officers who also have the word ''chief'' in their job title, such as [[chief operating officer]] (COO), [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) and [[chief technology officer]] (CTO).

===US===
In the US, the term ''chief executive officer'' is used primarily in business, whereas the term ''executive director'' is used primarily in the not-for-profit sector. These terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities. Implicit in the use of these titles, is that the public not be misled and the general standard regarding their use be consistently applied.

===UK===
In the UK, ''chief executive'' and ''chief executive officer'' are used in both business and the [[philanthropy|charitable sector]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.acevo.org.uk/ |title=Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations |publisher=Acevo.org.uk |date=2012-11-16 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of | 2013}}, the use of the term ''[[Director (business)|director]]'' for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee, which are normally non-executive (unpaid) roles. In the United Kingdom, the term ''director'' is used instead of ''chief officer".

==Famous CEOs==
Business publicists since the days of [[Edward Bernays]] and his client [[John D. Rockefeller]] and even more successfully the corporate publicists for [[Henry Ford]], promoted the concept of the "[[celebrity]] CEO".  Business journalists have often adopted this approach, which assumes that the corporate achievements, especially in the arena of manufacturing, were produced by unique talented individuals, especially the "heroic CEO". In effect, journalists celebrate a CEO who takes distinctive strategic actions. The model is the celebrity in entertainment, sports, and politics.  Guthey et al. argue that "...these individuals are not self-made, but rather are created by a process of widespread media exposure to the point that their actions, personalities, and even private lives function symbolically to represent significant dynamics and tensions prevalent in the contemporary business atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Guthey and Timothy Clark, ''Demystifying Business Celebrity'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the CEO and tends to neglect the harder-to-describe broader corporate factors. There is little attention to the intricately organized  technical bureaucracy that actually does the work. Hubris sets in when the CEO internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively self-confident in making complex decisions. Indeed, there may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Mathew L.A. Hayward, Violina P. Rindova, and Timothy G. Pollock. "Believing one's own press: The causes and consequences of CEO celebrity." ''Strategic Management Journal'' 25#7 (2004): 637-653.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Executive compensation===
{{Main|Executive compensation#Controversy}}
Executive compensation has been a source of criticism following a dramatic rise in pay relative to the [[average worker's wage]]. The relative pay was 20-to-1 in 1965 in the US, but rose to 376-to-1 by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelliekarabell/2018/02/14/executive-compensation-is-out-of-control-what-now/#79da2410431f|title=Executive Compensation Is Out Of Control. What Now?|date=14 February 2018|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative pay differs around the world, and in some smaller countries is still around 20-to-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/ceos-in-u-s-india-earn-the-most-compared-with-average-workers#gs.37kAijc|title=CEOs in U.S., India Earn the Most Compared With Average Workers|date=28 December 2017|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers differ as to whether the rise is due to competition for talent or due to lack of control by compensation committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/great-men-great-pay-why-ceo-compensation-is-sky-high/2014/06/12/6e49d796-d227-11e3-9e25-188ebe1fa93b_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.87e725daf985|title=Great Men, great pay? Why CEO compensation is sky high.|date=12 June 2014|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, investors have demanded more say over executive pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f6dff44d-204f-30b7-a164-537f9214095c|title=European investors beef up stance over high executive pay|date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity===

{{main|Gender diversity#In the boardroom}}

Lack of diversity amongst chief executives has also been a source of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.managers.org.uk/insights/news/2018/november/the-government-must-act-on-ftse-gender-stats-says-cmis-ceo|title=‘THE GOVERNMENT MUST ACT ON FTSE GENDER STATS’ SAYS CMI’S CEO|date=14 November 2018|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, 5% of [[Fortune 500]] CEOs were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/filtered?ceowoman=true|title=Fortune 500|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this are multi factorial, and may include natural [[Sex_differences_in_humans|sex differences]], the existence of [[old boy network]]s and the lack of female role models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/workforce-management/hr-management-skills/women-ceos.aspx|title=It’s 2017 – So Why Aren’t there More Women CEOs?|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have passed laws mandating boardroom gender quotas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/world/europe/28iht-quota.html?pagewanted=all|title=Getting Women Into Boardrooms, by Law|date=27 January 2010|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Lovelock''' (12 July 1940 – 24 February 2008) was born in the town of [[Saltash|Saltash, Cornwall]] in [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]]. He was best known as a pioneer in the field of [[Services marketing|Services Marketing]] among other titles such as author, professor and consultant.  Lovelock was also known for his excellent [[Case study|case studies]].

Christopher Lovelock attained a PhD from [[Stanford University]], publishing his thesis on the topic of "Marketing Public Transportation". Lovelock had earlier graduated with an MBA from [[Harvard University]] after arriving in the US in 1967. Lovelock had also obtained a [[Master's degree|Master of Arts]] in Economics and a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Communications from the [[University of Edinburgh]].

Lovelock embarked on his academic career serving, most significantly, on the faculty of the [[Harvard Business School]] (USA) for 11 years in addition to other academic appointments at distinguished institutions to include [[University of California]] Berkeley (USA), [[Stanford University]] (USA) and the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] (USA). Lovelock’s other visiting appointments include those at [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]] (Switzerland), [[INSEAD]] (France) and [[University of Queensland]] (Australia). In total, Lovelock had taught in over 30 countries in every continent except Antarctica.
Besides that of his teaching appointments, Christopher Lovelock was also an author or co-author of numerous books, articles and teaching cases. Lovelock’s last [[Academic publishing|academic publication]], "Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy 6th edition," co-authored together with Jochen Wirtz, has been translated into ten languages. Other books include "Product Plus", "Marketing Challenges" and "Public and Nonprofit Marketing" (the latter two co-authored with Charles Weinberg).

Lovelock’s 60 odd articles were also internationally acclaimed. His paper, "Whither Services Marketing? In Search of a New Paradigm and Fresh Perspectives" co-written with Evert Gummesson won the Best Services Article Award in the [[American Marketing Association]] and was a finalist for the IBM award for the best article in the Journal of Service Research. For that and other recognitions, Christopher Lovelock was honoured with the prestigious American Marketing Association’s Award for Career Contributions in the Services Discipline.

The 100 or more teaching cases he wrote were also much heralded. Twice, he won top honours in the [[BusinessWeek]] "European Case of The Year" awards. Famous series include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[FedEx]]. The latter, written in the 1970s, gained FedEx the wide exposure of potential clients, indirectly contributing to FedEx’s success today. His teaching cases, revered for their acute insights into marketing challenges, retain their positions on bestsellers’ lists more than a quarter of a century after they were published, displaying a strong relevance even in today’s context.
Moving to Eastham, [[Cape Cod]], in 1990, Christopher Lovelock became actively involved with his adopted community. Lending his expertise in areas like education, [[health care]], [[Conservation movement|environmental conservation]] and regional transportation, he became an advocate for a variety of issues such as summer traffic to underground utility lines. Most of these can be traced back to pieces found in the Cape Cod Times for which he was an [[Editorial|Op Ed]] or his advisory position for various local organizations.

In 2007, a private international group of companies, [[Group DF]] ("the Firtash group of companies") was formed to consolidate Firtash's business assets in different sectors. Presently, Group DF incorporates assets in the chemical industry, energy sector and real estate, and this consolidation effort is still underway.

Nadra Bank had gone into default in 2009, but it has since restructured its foreign debt with significant write-offs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/04/dcukraine-banknadra-idUSLDE7431PF20110504 Ukrainian tycoon Firtash takes over bank Nadra], [[Reuters]]. 4 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2002, Firtash ran for parliament as a member of the all-Ukrainian political association [[Women for the Future]], under the patronage of Lyudmila Kuchma, a wife of Ukrainian President [[Leonid Kuchma]]. The party won 2.11% of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vd2002/webproc0e Voting results for parties (blocs). Online CEC. Archive for 27/06/2013 Source.

In 2010, Firtash was involved in financing [[Viktor Yanukovych]]'s presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/russian/international/2014/03/140313_austria_firtash_arrest.shtml In Vienna arrested a Ukrainian businessman Dmitry Firtash]&lt;/ref&gt; Firtash stated that he sincerely believed that Yanukovych would learn from the events of 2003–2004 and adopt different policies. Since 2011, they have been at odds on questions of public policy. In 2011, Firtash said that Yushchenko had planned good reforms, but Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] had not allowed him to implement them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27213404| work=BBC News |title=Profile: Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash| date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, on behalf of the business circles of Ukraine, Firtash addressed Aleksandr Shokhin, the Head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the wider business community concerning the situation in the political arena and urged Russian businessmen to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dt.ua/UKRAINE/firtash-zaklikav-rosiyskih-biznesmeniv-zupiniti-viynu-mizh-rosiyeyu-ta-ukrayinoyu-138753_.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2014, Firtash announced that he hoped the [[2014 Ukrainian presidential election|forthcoming presidential elections]] would overcome the chaos in Ukraine and strengthen the country on the international political scene. He said: "I will not allow for my reputation to be ruined by those who are driven by political motivations and are not interested in Ukraine and its people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://molbuk.ua/ukraine/71550-ya-opynyvsya-v-epicentri-protystoyannya-ssha-i-rosiyi-firtash.html "Я опинився в епіцентрі протистояння США і Росії", – Фірташ].

A profile piece published about Firtash by the BBC on 30 April 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27213404|title=Profile: Oligarch Dmytro Firtash|date=2014-04-30|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that because he acted as a go-between in east-west gas trade Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine prime minister at the time, made hostile attempts to push Firtash and his firm out of Ukraine-Russia gas control negotiations in 2009. Firtash said that the unstable situation in the east of Ukraine was coordinated by Tymoshenko, that she needed disorder to allow her to declare a state of emergency and disrupt the presidential elections which she had no chance of winning. He said that Tymoshenko had already practically usurped power due to the size of her parliamentary majority, with her party allies [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] and [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] heading the government.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In an interview given to the BBC in May 2014, Firtash protested his innocence, denied paying bribes and any links to organized crime. He reiterated his belief that he is a pawn in the geo-political struggle between the United States and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27235510|title=Dmytro Firtash breaks silence to protest his innocence|last=Galpin|first=Richard|date=2014-05-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Firtash also stated that Ukraine must be strong, neutral and independent. He also pointed out that the top priority faced by Ukraine is to legitimize the government, which can only become a possibility after having the elections.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

====Denial of U.S. extradition ====
The Vienna Regional Criminal Court rejected the U.S. request for the extradition of Firtash on 30 April 2015. Judge Christoph Bauer said that the request for extradition was "politically motivated".&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herszenhorn|first1=David M.|title=Judge Rebuffs U.S. in Rejecting Extradition of Ukraine Billionaire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/world/europe/dmitry-v-firtash-extradition.html|accessdate=22 February 2017|work=New York Times|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/austrian-court-refuses-extradition-of-ukrainian-oligarch-dmytro-firtash-to-us/a-18422693&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter described the decision as a "scathing rebuke of the Justice and State Departments", reflecting the diminished credibility of the United States authorities in the eyes of a European ally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/world/europe/dmitry-v-firtash-extradition.html |title=Judge Rebuffs U.S. in Rejecting Extradition of Ukraine Billionaire |work=New York Times | first= David M. | last=Herszenhorn |date=30 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Leo Levnaic-Iwanski noted that U.S. authorities had provided additional documentation since the lower court had ruled against them.

Vienna's Higher Regional Court issued its decision on December 19, citing insufficient documentation linking Firtash to alleged money laundering and organized crime. A court in Vienna has decided against extraditing Ukrainian oligarch Dymitro Firtash from Austria to Spain, saying Madrid had not provided enough proof linking Firtash to alleged crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/a/vienna-court-rejects-spain-extradition-request-ukrainian-oligarch-firtash/28928162.html Vienna Court Rejects Spain's Extradition Request For Ukrainian Oligarch Firtash]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2017, a few minutes after the announcement of the High Court's decision, Austrian police detained Dmytro at the courthouse on the basis of an EU arrest warrant issued by Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/21/austria-grants-us-request-to-extradite-ukrainian-mogul-dmytro-firtash|title=Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Firtash arrested after extradition ruling|last=Walker|first=Shaun|date=2017-02-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish warrant was issued as part of an investigation into money laundering. The prosecutor's office in Vienna detained Firtash for 48 hours to determine its course of action.

On 23 February, Firtash was released from custody on the {{Euro|125}}&amp;nbsp;million bail deposited in 2014. However, that same day he was arrested and held in custody in connection with the U.S. extradition request.

On 24 February, Vienna Regional Court dismissed the Vienna prosecutor's application to impose provisional detention pending surrender regarding the U.S. extradition case. The question where Firtash was to be extradited – to Spain or the United States – is in the jurisdiction of the Minister of Justice of Austria, Wolfgang Brandstetter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39043117|title=Ukraine oligarch faces extradition to US|date=2017-02-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 2017, Yevhen Yenin, Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, noted that Firtash's return to the Ukraine was "an unrealistic event". Proceedings to hear extradition cases from the United States and Spain would be lengthy. Yenin also noted, "there is a political side to the case. If we consider the level of Firtash's defense, it includes Austria's former justice minister."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/general-prosecutors-office-says-firtashs-imminent-return-ukraine-unlikely.html|title=General Prosecutor’s Office says Firtash's imminent return to Ukraine unlikely - Sep. 04, 2017|date=2017-09-04|work=KyivPost|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, anti-corruption groups including Human Rights Watch, proposed that Firtash be placed on the [[Magnitsky Act|Magnitsky List]] and sanctioned by the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/rights-anti-corruption-groups-propose-placing-firtash-magnitsky-list.html|title=Rights, anti-corruption groups propose placing Firtash on Magnitsky List - Sep. 15, 2017|date=2017-09-15|work=KyivPost|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-rights-magnitsky/rights-groups-target-police-spy-chiefs-globally-under-new-u-s-law-idUSKCN1BO126|title=Rights groups target police, spy chiefs globally under new U.S. law|last=|first=|date=2017-09-13|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dragons' Den''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] television programme, hosted by [[Evan Davis]]. The format of the show is owned by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and is based on the original [[Dragons' Den#Japan|Japanese programme]], which has been sold around the world. The programme has been produced by [[BBC Manchester]] since its inception and was first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 4 January 2005.

The show allows several [[entrepreneurs]] an opportunity to present their varying business ideas to a panel of five wealthy investors, the "Dragons" of the show's title, and pitch for financial investment while offering a stake of the company in return.

==Programme==

===Format===
Contestants have what they perceive to be a viable and potentially profitable business idea but lack funding, or are already operating their business but need additional funds for promotion or expansion. As part of their opening pitch, they are required to specify the amount of money they require from the Dragons. The rules stipulate that if they do not raise at least this amount from one or more Dragons, then they would leave with nothing. In exchange for the investment, the contestants offer [[Stock|equity]] in their business, the percentage of which is also stipulated at the beginning of the pitch. If the Dragons see potential in the business idea or product, negotiations then take place around the amount of equity on offer, with the contestant having the opportunity to negotiate further, accept any offers, or simply walk away. Dragons can also offer a percentage of the money requested if they do not wish to commit the full amount, leaving the other Dragons free to do the same. This can lead to the contestant receiving the financial backing of more than one Dragon, with the benefit of a broader range of expertise. However, for this to occur, the contestant usually has to agree to relinquish a larger share in their business than they had first planned.

A Dragon who, having heard the pitch, does not wish to invest, must declare themselves "out", implying that they leave the discussion. (However, on one occasion in series 4, [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]] continued to question an entrepreneur after his own declaration.) This concluding phase may range from a few minutes if the Dragons don't perceive the business plan as credible, to much longer when complex conditions are negotiated. The Dragons often ridicule contestants, on grounds that vary widely, but especially for over-valuation of their respective enterprises.

===Set and theme===
The opening sequence was shot in [[Ancoats]], [[Manchester]], an area transformed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] which helped give the city its nickname [[Cottonopolis]].&lt;ref name="ancoats"&gt;{{cite web |title=New lair for Dragon's Den? |last=Bourne |first=Dianne |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1268619_new_lair_for_dragons_den |publisher=Manchester Evening News Media |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence features shots of [[Brunswick Mill, Ancoats|Brunswick Mill]], [[Murrays' Mills]] and [[McConnel &amp; Kennedy mills]] - all three are Manchester's most famous [[cotton mills]] in production at the time of the Industrial Revolution and keeps in line with the programme's [[warehouse]] theme.&lt;ref name="ancoats" /&gt; The location at which the pitches are filmed has varied over the years. It was originally filmed inside a furniture depository in [[Stoke Newington]]. The production were forced to move after the first series owing to building work next door. For the second series shooting took place in a disused warehouse, [[Wool House]]. It was then that the first set was created by production designer Laurence Williams, requiring the construction of a section of the window wall and the staircase down to the lower floor. The owner of this warehouse converted it into flats necessitating a further move to Tanner Street for the next few series. Here another more extensive set was created including cutting a hole in the floor and again creating the stairs down to the lower floor. Building work required yet again a move to Pinewood Studios only two weeks before a series was due to be shot and the production designer had to create a complete set on the film stage including a staircase which descended down into the underfloor tank. After several more series were shot at Pinewood, the production was moved to the [[BBC]]'s new home in [[Salford Quays]] at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]]. A brand new set was created for the move and was screened in the latter part of 2012 for Series 10.&lt;ref name="newhome"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dragons, we've moved your chairs ... |last=Lewens |first=Sam |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/2012/01/dragons-weve-moved-your-chairs.shtml |publisher=BBC |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special episodes==

===''Where Are They Now?''===
''Where Are They Now?'' is a companion series to the main programme, often broadcast after each respective series, taking a look back at some of the show's success stories - and biggest failures - and finding out what the participants are up to six months on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/wherearetheynow/ Dragons' Den | Where Are They Now?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828030636/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/wherearetheynow/ |date=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series began with a one-off two part special, broadcast on 21 and 28 December 2005, in which presenter Evan Davis reviewed the programme's success stories from series one and two, and looked at the entrepreneurs who received funds to market their ideas. Cameras followed Charles Ejogo, who planned to put umbrella vending machines in [[London Underground]] stations, jewellery designer Elizabeth Galton, magazine publisher Huw Gwyther and Rachel Lowe, whose London-based board game caught their eye. Following this, another one-off two part special was broadcast on 28 September – 8 October 2006. Later, two full series of the show were commissioned, with series one, of four episodes, being broadcast between 18 July and 2 August 2007.

Series two, of five episodes, each following a respective dragon and their investments, was broadcast between 17 September and 24 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tvb0v |title=BBC Two - Dragons' Den, What Happened Next, Peter Jones |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jones' episode followed him meeting with Kirsty Henshaw, who made an emotional pitch in the Den when she came in with her frozen dessert business, and was determined to get her product on the supermarket shelves as soon as possible, and also meeting up with condiment king Levi Roots. Duncan Bannatyne's episode followed him as he travelled to the south of France to oversee his daughter's wedding, and then went back to work to follow up on some of his investments. Theo Paphitis' episode followed him as he took 90 employees to Greece for a week of team-building exercises, and also visited two companies he invested in to see how they were getting on. Series five, episode nine also featured at a look back at deals from the series, in a similar vein to ''Where Are They Now?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/h2nj/dragons-den--series-5---episode-9|title=Dragons' Den|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Outside the Den''===
''Outside the Den'' takes a step back from the world of Dragons' Den, to take a personal look at the Dragons themselves, including personal and intimate interviews, a look behind their business credentials, and taking the cameras into their personal lives. Six episodes of the series have been produced - with the first set of five episodes airing between 27 October and 23 November 2008, and following Theo Paphitis, James Caan, Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne in their own respective programmes. A further episode, focusing on new dragon Hilary Devey, was broadcast over three years later on 29 December 2011.

===''The Best of Dragons' Den''===
''The Best of Dragons' Den'' focuses on presenter Evan Davis taking a look back at the best and worst pitches from the past series of the show, as well as revealing some unseen pitches that were so bad, they didn't make it to broadcast, and talking candidly with the Dragons involved. Two series of the show were produced, the first accompanying series two, with three episodes being broadcast between 19 January and 2 February 2006, and the second accompanying series six, with three episodes being broadcast between 23 February and 9 March 2009.

===''Dragons' Den: On Tour''===
''Dragons' Den: On Tour'' was a series of five episodes which aired between 6 September and 7 October 2009. Each episode follows the Dragons (James Caan, Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones, Theo Paphitis and Duncan Bannatyne) as they travel by bus around the United Kingdom to find out what some of the budding entrepreneurs who had appeared on the show have been up to since, including success stories, awful failures, and some very obvious missed opportunities.

===''Dragons' Den: Online''===
''Dragons' Den: Online'' was a special, online version of the show, which follows the same format as the main show, but is presented by [[Dominic Byrne]], and features Shaf Rasul and [[Julie Meyer]] as the Dragons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/onlineden/ |title=Dragons' Den - The Dragons |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of being set inside a Den, entrepreneurs pitch to the two Dragons via online video pitches, and subsequent interaction through webcam chat. The highest amount of money on offer is £50,000, which the Dragons can only individually invest in any one business. Episodes were posted weekly, for six weeks from 16 September 2009 to 7 October 2009, and viewers could participate by rating business plans before the two dragons offered their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-ariadnes-julie-meyer-becomes-dragon-for-new-online-only-den/ |title=Ariadne’s Julie Meyer Becomes Dragon for New Online-Only Den |accessdate=18 March 2009 |publisher= |last=Andrews |first=Robert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716153956/http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-ariadnes-julie-meyer-becomes-dragon-for-new-online-only-den/ |archivedate=16 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other programmes===
A number of one-off specials accompanying the broadcast of the main show have also been produced, often as Christmas specials or charity specials. The following eight programmes have been aired thus far:

===''Pitches to Riches''===
Two episode of ''Dragons' Den: Pitches to Riches'' were presented by TV host [[Richard Osman]] and aired on 28 February and 31 December 2016. The show looked back on some of the most successful pitches in the den.

Some contestants have gone on to reach the market with their products despite being turned down by the Dragons and have met with a range of success. Examples include [[hungryhouse.co.uk]], a website for online ordering of home delivered takeaway food, ''[[Destination (game)|Destination London]]'', a [[board game]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/small-business/article.html?in_article_id=450663&amp;in_page_id=10|title=Dragons' Den: The rejects that got rich|work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tangle Teezer]], a hairbrush designed to smooth knotted hair;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tangleteezer.com/timeline.php|title=Tangle Teezer Timeline|website=www.tangleteezer.com|access-date=8 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708091917/http://www.tangleteezer.com/timeline.php|archive-date=8 July 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1046966/Dragons-Den-reject-laugh-hair-Tangle-Teezer-stocked-Boots.html|title=Dragons' Den reject has the last laugh after hair Tangle Teezer is stocked by Boots|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trunki]], travel luggage designed for children;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/work/small-business/article.html?in_article_id=429316&amp;in_page_id=10|title=Dragons' Den reject now on top: Rob Law and Trunki luggage - This is Money|work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smarterproducts.co.uk/acatalog/SmarterProducts-Designers.html|title=Rob Law profile|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071101075813/http://www.smarterproducts.co.uk/acatalog/SmarterProducts-Designers.html|archivedate=1 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the BarbeSkew, a rotisserie [[barbecue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbeskew.com/2010/08/dragons-den/|title=Dragons Den - Dragons Den BBQ - Dragons Den Barbeque - BarbeSkew on Dragons Den - barbeskew|work=barbeskew.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejected offers===
In Series 2, Danny Bamping accepted an offer of £100,000 for 30% of his company Bedlam Puzzles, offered in a joint deal with both Rachel Elnaugh and Theo Paphitis investing, but rejected it after the show, opting to get a bank loan instead, claiming that he had a stronger vision for the company than either of his investors. His strategy was successful, as the show generated enough publicity to boost online sales of his [[Bedlam cube]], increasing from his then current sales tally of 23 to 4,500 sales on the days after the show's airing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WtaKvWS9Jh0|title=DragonsDen - Where Are They Now (S02E01)|first=|last=Dragons' Den|date=1 April 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Series 3, Fenella Lindsell and Lara Goodbody rejected an offer of £200,000 for 30% from Richard Farleigh, to invest in their [[Yogabugs]] workout company. They also rejected an offer of £100,000 for 15% of the business made by Peter Jones, in a joint deal with Farleigh, and left the den without investment, stating their reason to be that they believed the company was worth more than what the dragons valued it at. Since then, the pair have gone on to build a franchise operation, with over 150 stores in the UK selling the product. Tamlyn Thompson rejected Richard Farleigh's offer of 50% for [[Document imaging|ID Scan Biometric]], the company was worth over 2 million in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://companycheck.co.uk/company/04779960/ID-SCAN-BIOMETRICS-LIMITED/group-structure|title=ID SCAN BIOMETRICS LIMITED.

In Series 6, Episode 2 - an entrepreneur made history on the show. Up to this point, it was the biggest offer ever made in the series and he said No. The company was called Diamond Geezer - an online company selling a wide range of jewellery online. They offered him a staggering £255k for 40% of his business. He was only willing to meet them at 30% but no deal could be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/jul/28/dragonsdenseries6episode2|title=Dragons' Den - Series 6, Episode 2|last=Stephens|first=Heidi|date=28 July 2008|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Series 10, father and son team Michael and Joe Smith rejected an offer of £50,000 for 50% of their Wheelbarrow Accessory company, offered by Duncan Bannatyne, and again rejected an offer for the same amount of money and equity, but split down the middle, with Duncan and Hilary Devey each bringing £25,000 and asking for 25%. The pair valued their company at £500,000, and Michael failed to deny claims that he was more interested in the money than help from an investor, when challenged by Deborah Meaden. Also in series 10, Dustin Toland rejected an offer of £100,000 from both Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis for 45% of his company Gigwam, a new tent system for outdoor events. He revealed the maximum amount of equity he would be prepared to give away was 25%, and subsequently declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovate-design.co.uk/news/index.php/inventor-turns-down-dragons-and-braves-it-alone/ Inventor turns down Dragons and braves it alone], 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In episode 8, A to E Training &amp; Solutions Ltd turned down an offer for the full £50,000 from Duncan Bannatyne for 32% of their resuscitation and life support business. The trio felt that the equity asked for was too great and left the Den with nothing.

In Series 11, Duncan Bannatyne offered £50,000 to Linkee Ltd for 40% of its board game business, but the trio behind the company felt it was too great a percentage and were unable to negotiate with Bannatyne, and so turned him down. Also in series 11, Deborah Meaden offered Tim Morgan £100,000 for 15% of his Mountain Trike Company. However, the maximum he and his shareholders had already agreed to give away was 5%, and so he had to turn her down. Also in Series 11, husband and wife team Roger and Leslie rejected a combined offer from Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne of 50% of their wool bedding company Baavet, for £130,000. In the final episode of Series 11, after accepting Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden's offer of £50,000 for 40% (later dropping to 30%) of his company Bobo Buddies, James Roupell turned the deal down after filming. Instead, he found the financial help he required elsewhere, without giving up any equity of his company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10669753/Dragon-slayer-rejects-the-entire-Den.html Dragon slayer rejects the entire Den], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 2 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In series 12, Daniel and Mat of Pure Pet Food turned down both Deborah Meaden and Kelly Hoppen's offers of £40,000 for 30% and 20% respectively, as they thought the equity levels being asked for were too high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thetalentzone.co.uk/blog/daniel-eha-and-matthew-cockcroft-from-pure-pet-foods-rejects-investment-for-their-dog-food-business-on-dragons-den/ http://thetalentzone.co.uk/blog/daniel-eha-and-matthew-cockcroft-from-pure-pet-foods-rejects-investment-for-their-dog-food-business-on-dragons-den/], 27 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in series 12, owner of gourmet marshmallow company Mallow &amp; Marsh,
Harriet Pleydell-Bouverie, turned down both Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden who wanted 40% and 33⅓% of the company respectively in exchange for £65,000 (although Peter offered her £80,000), as she felt that would be undervaluing the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/marshmallow-maker-proves-shes-no-soft-touch-telling-tv-dragons-im-out-9665453.html Marshmallow maker proves she's no soft touch telling Dragons Den: I’m out], 13 August 2014, ''[[London Evening Standard]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In Episode 10, Cally Russell rejected Peter Jones' offer of £75,000 for 20% of his company Mallzee, a mobile shopping app, even after Peter offered to drop to 15% once investment was repaid.

In series 13, Ellen Green, company director of the Blue Badge Company, declined Touker Suleyman's offer of £70,000 for 35% of her company, as it was "simply too high" for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/aug/23/dragons-den-turned-down-touker-suleyman-investment|title=Dragons' Den: Why I turned down Touker Suleyman's £70,000 investment|author=Kitty Dann|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in series 13 Jo Hilditch rejected Peter Jones' offer of £50,000 for 30% of her wine-making company, British Cassis, as it was over her upper limit of 25% on advice from her accountant. In episode 10 of the same series, Roy Fitter rejected Peter Jones' offer of £80,000 for 30% of his company, Ram Training Ltd, a horror events company. In episode 13, Yann Morvan and Richard Lee rejected Peter Jones and Nick Jenkins offer of £75,000 for 30% of their portable drumming business Aerodrums, as the maximum amount of equity they were prepared to give away was 20%.

In series 14, Sam Coley and Steve Pearce, co-founders of [[TickX]], the event and ticketing search engine, rejected offers of £75,000 from Nick Jenkins and Peter Jones for 20% equity and one from Touker Suleyman for 15% as they felt the dragons had undervalued the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roue|first1=Lucy|title=Pair turn down THREE offers on Dragons' Den, but are still flying high|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/dragons-den-tickx-reject-investment-12397923|website=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since filming, the duo went on to raise £750,000 through 24Haymarket and have launched the world's first [[Facebook]] Messenger [[chatbot]] for live events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Julia|title=Dragons’ Den success stories: TickX|url=https://startups.co.uk/dragons-den-success-stories-tickx/|website=Startups|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

=== ''Sunday Mirror'' investigation ===
Although the BBC has never made any secret of deals that succeeded or fell through, usually offering a follow up in the final episode of the series, in September 2006 an investigation by the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' newspaper criticised the show, reporting that most of the deals were unfulfilled after the programmes were shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20060917/ai_n16735087/ | work=Sunday Mirror | first=Nick | last=Owens | title=Dragons' Con | date=17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article claimed that the Dragons either pulled out of the deals over minor technicalities, deliberately offered heavily unfavourable terms to the entrepreneurs in an effort to make them withdraw, or simply broke off all contact with them after the recording. The Dragons however defended their record, blaming the failures on the entrepreneurs themselves who were dishonest about their products, with Duncan Bannatyne stating: "We don't hand over money to people who don't tell the truth.", while Theo Paphitis added: "I kept up my end of the bargain. The show is not about a cash prize, it is about us pledging to invest. But people must tell the truth. Simple."

A BBC spokesman said: "After the initial agreement is made on camera, both parties enter a period of [[due diligence]]. Sometimes during this period the deals fall through."&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Mirror (2006) [http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17762194%26method=full%26siteid=62484%26headline=dragons%2d%2dcon-name_page.html Sunday Mirror] Retrieved 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Sunday Telegraph'' research ===

In February 2015, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' newspaper published a report that revealed that half of ''Dragons' Den'' investments fall through after the show once the cameras stop rolling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/money/11425328/Half-of-Dragons-Den-investments-fall-through-after-the-show.html | work=Sunday Telegraph | first=Rebecca | last=Burn-Callander | title=Half of Dragons' Den investments fall through after the show | date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study, carried out by Tiger Mobiles, who unsuccessfully applied to appear on the show in 2008, looked in depth at all 143 businesses that won cash on the show between series 1 and 11, revealing just £5.8m of the £13m pledged was ever invested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragons' Den - Where Are They Now?|url=https://www.tigermobiles.com/dragons-den/|publisher=Tiger Mobiles|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When quizzed about the numbers, [[Deborah Meaden]] defended her position informing the ''Telegraph'': "I've had entrepreneurs with extremely unfortunate health issues, patent issues, and two or three silences where I never hear from them again." Meaden also added that "The world explodes for businesses after Dragons’ Den, they get offered better deals in some cases, or think they don’t need the Dragons. But what they find when the publicity dies down is that they still need help running the business."

From Series 1 to 11 the research uncovered:

* 76 out of the total 143 agreed investments never went through after the den.
* 23 of the 143 business that successfully pitched are no longer trading.
* Of the £13 million pledged by the Dragons, only £5.8 million was ever invested.
* £250,000 is the highest amount ever successfully pitched for in the Den.
* However, on the two occasions £250,000 was offered, neither investment went through after the show.
* £100,000 is the most common investment figure asked for by pitchers (30 of 143 pitches)
* £35,000 is the lowest ever amount offered for a successful pitch, for the youdoodoll, Deborah Meaden did invest.
* [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]] was the most prolific investor, offering investment to 54 of the 143 businesses who successfully pitched on the show.
* The highest amount of equity ever given away in the den was 79% by RKA Records, which has since renamed to Bannatyne Music Ltd.
* The most common amount of equity given away in successful pitches was 40%, with 42 of 143 pitches giving up that share in their company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Interactive Dragons’ Den Content – How We Made It and Why We Did It|url=https://www.tigermobiles.com/2015/02/dragons-den-how-we-made-it-and-why-we-did-it/|publisher=Tiger Mobiles|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Forster, who compiled the research for Tiger Mobiles, claimed that the issue was less about the structure of deals and more about the kind of companies that the BBC invites to take part in the show. "The problem lies with the BBC, who, in a bid to keep the viewer count high, have turned the show into a contrived affair that’s more about viewer entertainment than genuine business success. They tend to pick pitchers who are TV-friendly rather than those who are investible with a healthy balance sheet." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cett|first1=Hans|title=Tiger Mobiles exposes Den of inequality|url=http://www.gomonews.com/tiger-mobiles-exposes-den-on-inequality/|accessdate=23 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223163053/http://www.gomonews.com/tiger-mobiles-exposes-den-on-inequality/|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A BBC spokesman commented on Forster's claims, saying: "We are proud of our record of achieving investment offers in the den and we look into every detail of a business before they are offered a slot on the show. The BBC plays no role in the deal after recording, and we accept that it is typical for some angel investments to fall down at the due diligence stage." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burn-Callander|first1=Rebecca|title=Welcome to the Dragons' Den of broken dreams|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/festival-of-business/11425274/Welcome-to-the-Dragons-Den-of-broken-dreams.html|accessdate=23 February 2015|publisher=Sunday Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departures==

===Simon Woodroffe===
After only one series of the programme, Simon Woodroffe left the panel. Woodroffe stated that the reason behind his departure was "The show became a battle of egos — not a forum for business innovation. The thing to remember was that when you walk up the stairs to pitch, it’s not five people necessarily thinking 'How am I going to be able to make an investment here?', they’re also thinking: 'Am I going to be the star of this next little piece?'. That's not how I was told the show would go down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Zoe Brennan |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1354734/Den-dashed-dreams-How-Dragons-dont-word-cameras-stop-rolling.html |title=Den of dashed dreams: How the Dragons don't always keep their word when the cameras stop rolling &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rachel Elnaugh===
Shortly before the launch of the second series in 2005, Rachel Elnaugh's company [[Red Letter Days]] went into [[Administration (insolvency)|administration]] and its remaining assets were bought by fellow dragons Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis. Although Elnaugh was at the helm before and at the time of the company's failure, she blamed the problems on the actions of the last CEO whom she appointed in 2002, whilst she took a non-executive role to have her fourth child. Following making only five investments over the course of two series, as a result of disputes with various Dragons, and the continuing uncomfortable position of the BBC allowing a perceived "failed" business person to continue investing on the show, she agreed to leave the ''Dragons' Den'' panel.&lt;ref&gt;Real Business October 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.realbusiness.co.uk/news/business-woman/5701456/rachel-elnaugh-i-thought-my-life-was-over.thtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228035844/http://www.realbusiness.co.uk/news/business-woman/5701456/rachel-elnaugh-i-thought-my-life-was-over.thtml |archivedate=28 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doug Richard===
Shortly after the conclusion of the second series in 2005, Doug Richard announced his departure from the show. Richard stated in an interview that his departure was due to "six hours of TV taking six weeks to film", and not being able to split his time between filming and running all of his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tara Evans |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-1630204/Interview-Doug-Richard.html |title=Dragon's Den interview: Doug Richard on entrepreneurs |publisher=Thisismoney.co.uk |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Farleigh===
It was announced on 18 May 2007 that [[Richard Farleigh]] had been dropped from the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/18/bbc.broadcasting1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ben | last=Dowell | title=I'm out: dragon dropped from den | date=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' suggested that this might have been in order to have a new Dragon from an ethnic minority.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-455837/Dragons-Den-panelist-ousted-wrong-colour.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Dragon's Den panelist ousted for being the 'wrong colour' | date=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farleigh said, "It would be disappointing if that was the reason - rather than anything fundamental - if it was because I was the wrong colour. I don't know why this has happened and I am very disappointed and bemused - I wasn't expecting it because all the feedback I got was very positive. I had even moved back to the UK to focus on commitments for the show. I am gutted that I have not been invited back."&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk" /&gt;  The suggestions in the ''Daily Mail'' report were rejected by the BBC who said the new Dragon would be chosen by their "business credentials" and not ethnicity. A BBC spokesman said it was normal that the show sometimes changed its team. Farleigh's replacement was the British-Pakistani businessman [[James Caan (entrepreneur)|James Caan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===James Caan===
In April 2010, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that James Caan and Duncan Bannatyne were involved in a 'bitter row' over tax. Bannatyne claimed Pakistan-born Caan had an 'unfair' business advantage due to his non-domiciled tax status. He complained that, because Caan does not pay UK tax on his overseas earnings, he has more money to invest in his UK ventures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1268284/Dragons-Den-Duncan-Bannatyne-demands-apology-James-Caan.html James Caan owes ME an apology after refusing to shake my hand, says Duncan Bannatyne as row between Dragons takes another ugly turn], 23 April 2010, ''[[Daily Mail]]''.

===Hilary Devey===
In June 2012, it was announced that after only two series in the show, [[Hilary Devey]] would be departing the show to front her own business series for [[Channel 4]]. She appeared in the tenth series which aired in Autumn 2012. Devey was replaced by [[Kelly Hoppen]] for the eleventh series in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a385057/hilary-devey-quits-dragons-den-after-two-series.html |title=Hilary Devey quits 'Dragons' Den' after two series - TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linney announced that he would be departing the show at the end of series twelve, in order to focus on various other projects and work related to enterprise, diversity and inclusion, including his not-for-profit digital platform, workinsight.org

===Kelly Hoppen===
On 11 August 2013, Hoppen became one of the new dragons on BBC Two's ''Dragons' Den'' following the departure of Hilary Devey. On 23 January 2015, she announced her departure from the show after two series.

===Duncan Bannatyne===
It was announced in July 2014 that, due to "other business commitments", Bannatyne would be departing from the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28216556|title=Duncan Bannatyne quits Dragons' Den|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final appearance was in the last episode of series 12, in which he made an investment jointly with Peter Jones in a cash-and-carry business seeking finance for a new sports drink. This leaves Jones as the only remaining original Dragon.

Willingham departed the show on 31 January 2017 after 2 series, confirming that she had decided to take a year out travelling with her family and was unable to take part in the programme.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4177598/Nick-Jenkins-Sarah-Willingham-axed-Dragons-Den.html|title=Dragons' Den stars Nick Jenkins and Sarah Willingham axed from series|newspaper=Mail Online|access-date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nick Jenkins===
Jenkins confirmed he was leaving on 31 January 2017 alongside Sarah Willingham, also after 2 series. On the decision, he commented that he was leaving the den to concentrate on his educational technology businesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Spoofs==
[[Duncan Bannatyne]] appeared as himself in a recurring sketch in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television show ''[[Al Murray's Multiple Personality Disorder]]'' titled "Duncan's Den", a parody of ''Dragons' Den'', where Duncan is the only Dragon. [[Al Murray]] plays the role of [[Evan Davis]], and in each successive sketch there is only one applicant, the hopelessly nervous and commercially inept, recent divorcee Carole Price, played by [[Laura Solon]].

[[Kayvan Novak]] created a parody of the show called "Lizard's Lair" for his character Terry Tibbs on an episode of his show ''[[Facejacker]]'' where unsuspecting entrepreneurs were led to believe they could receive an investment from Terry in a very similar style to ''Dragons' Den''.

[[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]], [[Deborah Meaden]], and [[Duncan Bannatyne]] appear as themselves in a satirical dream sequence in a series 6 episode titled "Conned Out of Luck" of the BBC show, ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]''.

The sketch show ''[[Harry &amp; Paul]]'' has featured a series of parodies by [[Harry Enfield]] and [[Paul Whitehouse]], where through careful editing the pair portray all the characters, including Davis (Whitehouse), the contestants unsuccessfully pitching various bizarre ideas (e.g. a '[[kitten]] stomper' device) and a parodied cast of the Dragons. The emphasis is particularly on the entrepreneurs' names (e.g. 'Duncan [[Guillotine]]') and personalities (Meaden is simply 'The Grumpy Woman' – Enfield in drag). In one sketch parodying the [[banking crisis]], Enfield's old character [[Harry Enfield and Chums|Tim Nice-But-Dim]] made an appearance and was revealed to be "obviously" the brother of 'Peter Jones (John Lewis)'. Enfield and Whitehouse brought back their portrayals of the characters for three [[Comic Relief]] sketches, where they play Victorian counterparts of the Dragons, and in each sketch, the entrepreneurs are in fact played by the actual Dragons presenting a modern item as an invention, with Jones presenting the toothbrush, Bannatyne and Caan presenting the toilet (or 'the Crapper'), and Meaden and Paphitis presenting the television.

''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' parodied the show with strange investments such as a tramp wanting investment in tea and a sketch where a man wants £100,000 and his pitch is a gun. They also parodied Dragon responses with Rachel Elnaugh seeing a product which turns base metal to gold and saying "How do you make any money out of this?".

The [[talkSPORT]] weekday afternoon show presented by [[Paul Hawksbee]] and [[Andy Jacobs]] has recently begun a weekly spoof slot wherein "Hilary Devey" (Jacobs) makes obvious comments to (absent) sporting personalities who have recently been in the news for making poor decisions. These comments usually deride said personality, ending with the Dragons' common final phrase, "I'm out!"

The British sitcom ''[[The IT Crowd]]'' features a brief parody of the show in episode 5 of series 2.

[[Ricky Gervais]] referenced the show and impersonated Evan Davis and Duncan Bannatyne in his live stand-up show ''Fame''. Gervais had also previously performed a sketch in the show ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', which featured the current line-up of Dragons.

Disney Channel's ''[[I Didn't Do It (TV series)|I Didn't Do It]]'' based their [[I Didn't Do It (TV series)#Episode List|5th episode]] on the concept featuring a show called ''Boardroom Barracudas'' where the characters demo their vegetable flavor enhancer.

Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden, Nick Jenkins, Touker Suleyman and Sarah Willingham appeared as themselves in the first episode of the [[mockumentary]] series ''[[People Just Do Nothing]]'' when the protagonists visit the Deagons' Den to seek funding for their illegal [[pirate radio]] station. Jenkins offers them £50 to get out of the room.

In the summer of 2015, ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]] began a segment known as 'Instant Dragon's Den', where a caller is put through to the personal phone of [[Deborah Meaden]], one of the TV show's current Dragons, with the caller then pitching their idea to Meaden, who always starts by asking how the caller got her number.

==DVD release==
The first two series of the show are available to buy on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001DLUC5I|title=Dragons' Den Complete BBC Series 1 &amp; 2 [DVD]|work=amazon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether the remaining series of the show will also be released.

'''Eberhard von Brauchitsch ''' (28 November 1926 &amp;ndash; 7 September 2010) was a [[Germany|German]] industrial manager. In his work for Flick KG, he was responsible for the donation of about 26 million [[Deutsche Mark]] to all the major German political parties and their associated foundations between 1969 and 1981. As a result of this scandal, he was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment on probation and 550,000 DM financial penalty for tax evasion. In 1982 he became a lawyer and management consultant.

==Biography==
Brauchitsch was born in [[Berlin]], [[Weimar Germany]] to Konrad von Brauchitsch and Edith, née de la Barre.&lt;ref name=Munz&gt;[http://www.munzinger.de/search/portrait/Eberhard+von+Brauchitsch/0/11115.html Biography] at munzinger.de {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Brauchitsch]] family is a [[Silesia]]n noble family originating from [[Chróstnik|Brauchitschdorf]], Silesia (modern Chróstnik, Poland). Brauchitsch attended school in Berlin and [[Bad Tölz]], where he was a classmate of [[Friedrich Karl Flick]].&lt;ref name=FAZ&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/RubD16E1F55D21144C4AE3F9DDF52B6E1D9/Doc~E3BC68CC2F20349E380E2A201EFEF7156~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Eberhard von Brauchitsch beging Selbstmord] [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] 11 September 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was conscripted as a [[Flakhelfer]] in 1943 and to the [[Wehrmacht]] in 1944. After [[World War II]] he passed his [[Abitur]] in 1946 and studied law at the [[University of Mainz]] and political sciences at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name=Munz/&gt; He also studied at the [[London School of Economics]] and in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name=FAZ/&gt;

In the 1950s Brauchitsch worked for [[Deutsche Lufthansa]] and became the first chief executive of the [[Condor Flugdienst|Deutsche Flugdienst GmbH]]. In 1960 he became the personal consultant of Friedrich Karl Flick and executive partner of the Flick KG in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-09/brauchitsch-nachruf Eberhard von Brauchitsch hatte das Ruder stets in der Hand] [[Die Zeit]] 11 September 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1971 to 1973 he was the chief representative of the [[Axel Springer AG]] but returned to the Flick KG after the death of Friedrich Flick (senior). He was responsible for the donation of about 26 million DM to all major German political parties and their associated foundations between 1969 and 1981.&lt;ref name=FAZ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftd.de/politik/deutschland/:freitod-mit-83-eberhard-von-brauchitsch-und-seine-frau-sind-tot/50168072.html Eberhard von Brauchitsch und seine Frau sind tot] [[Financial Times Deutschland]] 11 September 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]] and the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] received about 15 million DM, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] about 6.5 million and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Liberals]] about 4.3 million.&lt;ref name=Spiegel06/&gt; Sums between 40,000 and 250,000 DM were directly paid to politicians like [[Franz Josef Strauss]], [[Willy Brandt]] and CDU bursar Walther Leisler Kiep.&lt;ref name=Welt&gt;[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article9539030/Eberhard-von-Brauchitsch-ein-Stueck-Bonner-Republik.html Eberhard von Brauchitsch, ein Stück Bonner Republik] [[Die Welt]] 11 September 2010 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helmut Kohl]] received in total 565,000 DM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15239605.html Die gepflegte Landschaft] [[Der Spiegel]] 13 December 1999 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brauchitsch called this practise "cultivating the political scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXflC2Ipo_QC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=brauchitsch+Flick&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=B7WLTPTYJM_Jswbj9dGYAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&amp;q=brauchitsch%20&amp;f=false

These donations led to the [[Flick affair]] and the demission of [[Otto Graf Lambsdorff]] and [[Hans Friderichs]], who had granted tax advantages to Friedrich Karl Flick after he had realized his 40 percent share of [[Mercedes-Benz]] stocks valuing 1.9 billion DM.&lt;ref name=Spiegel06&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,441136,00.html Ein Mann kaufte die Republik] [[Der Spiegel]] 6 October 2006 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Welt/&gt; Brauchitsch was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment on probation and 550,000 DM financial penalty for tax evasion. He left the Flick KG in 1982 and worked as a lawyer and management consultant.

Brauchitsch was married to Helga née Hempe since 1952, they had three daughters and one son. After both had suffered from long and severe illnesses, Brauchitsch and his wife committed suicide together in Zürich, aided by the Swiss pro-euthanasia group EXIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/ExFlickManager-nahm-sich-in-Zuerich-das-Leben/story/27725389|title=Ex-Flick-Manager nahm sich in Zürich das Leben|date=12 September 2010|newspaper=Tages Anzeiger|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010}}   [[File:Closed gm dealer.jpg|thumb|280px|right|An [[automobile dealership]] in [[Orland, California]] which closed after [[General Motors]] cut ties with it and several hundred other dealers as part of its [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy restructuring efforts in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rick Longley |url=http://www.willows-journal.com/news/january-3017-business-franchise.html |title=Car dealer may lose GM franchise|work=willows-journal.com/|date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Beginning in the later half of 2008, a global-scale [[Late 2000s recession|recession]] adversely affected the [[economy of the United States]].  A combination of several years of declining automobile sales and scarce availability of credit led to a more widespread '''[[automotive industry crisis of 2008–2009|crisis]] in the [[Automobile industry in the United States|United States auto industry]]''' in the years of 2008 and 2009.

Following dramatic drops in automobile sales throughout 2008, two of the "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" U.S. automakers – [[General Motors]] (GM), and [[Chrysler]] – requested emergency loans in order to address impending cash shortages.  By April 2009, the situation had worsened such that both GM and Chrysler were faced with imminent bankruptcy and liquidation.  With the intent to prevent massive job losses and destabilizing damage to the entire [[manufacturing sector]], the [[United States government|U.S.]] and [[Government of Canada|Canadian]] governments provided unprecedented financial [[bailout]] ($85 billion) support to allow the companies to restructure and jettison legacy debt via [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]].  Both companies separately filed for this protection by June 1.

General Motors emerged from bankruptcy as a new company majority owned by the [[United States Treasury]], and Chrysler emerged owned primarily by the [[United Auto Workers]] union and by Italian automaker [[Fiat S.p.A.]].  Both companies terminated agreements with hundreds of their [[automobile dealership|dealerships]] and GM discontinued several of its brands as part of bankruptcy proceedings.  Ford Motor Company was able to survive without entering bankruptcy partly due to a large line of credit which it obtained in 2007.

The U.S. automakers were more heavily affected by the crisis than their foreign counterparts, such as [[Toyota]].  Following the [[2000s energy crisis]], the U.S. automakers failed to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles as opposed to the high-profit [[sport utility vehicles]] that were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s which led to excess inventory and undesirable product.  Since the automotive crisis abated, all three American automakers have increased sales of vehicles and have posted a profit.

As of 2012, the industry has recovered to some extent. GM had 2011 sales of more than 9 million vehicles, more than Toyota. According to a May 2011 report by the White House National Economic Council, however, the US government may have to write off about $14 billion of its $80 billion loan.

By 2012, polls from [[Pew Research Center]] and [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] show that the American public now believes that the bailouts have been helpful for the American economy.

==Background==
Some note that the crisis occurred mainly as a result of business of the Big Three U.S. automakers which had limited access to offshore production as opposed to their Asian counterparts. Analysts point out that Asian companies that manufacture automobiles mostly in Asia but also in the U.S. were not experiencing similar problems. They were able to produce compact automobiles in the Pacific Rim area for less cost (in Dollars).&lt;ref name="wsjll"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122126282034130461?mod=opinion_main_commentaries If You Like Michigan's Economy, You'll Love Obama's], Wall St. Journal, September 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NGE4MGEwMTkwMzE3MGE1NWI4MGJkYTA4M2NkMTIwZmU= Detroit: Same Old, Same Old], National Review, November 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A December 22, 2008 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, "For the most part, the so-called auto transplants – foreign-owned car companies with major operations in the United States – have deep pockets and ample credit, and they are not facing potential bankruptcy like General Motors and Chrysler."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/business/23transplants.html?hp |title=Foreign Automakers in the U.S. Cut Back |work=The New York Times |date=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the criticism centered on structural differences between the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)#United States and Canada|Big Three]] and the "transplants" (foreign companies manufacturing in U.S.) that result in major cost differentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9591 |title=Sorkin &amp; Cole Debate |publisher=Charlie Rose |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Big Three were first weakened by the substantially more expensive automobile fuels&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/18/business/deal19.php Uncertainty in U.S. auto industry puts pressure on suppliers.

The U.S. automakers also suffered from considerably higher labor costs than their non-unionized counterparts, including salaries, benefits, healthcare, and pensions.&lt;ref name="financialpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nicolas Van |last=Praet |url=http://www.financialpost.com/related/links/story.html?id=562830 |title=Caw Girds For War |publisher=Financial Post |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=January 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507213457/http://www.financialpost.com/related/links/story.html?id=562830 |archivedate=May 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In return for labor peace, management granted concessions to its unions that resulted in uncompetitive cost structures and significant legacy costs.&lt;ref name="cnsnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=39803 |title=Automakers Forced to Pay 85- to 95-Percent of Wages to Union Members Who Are Not Working |publisher=CNSNews.com |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225182638/http://www.cnsnews.com/public/Content/Article.aspx?rsrcid=39803 |archivedate=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=1343240 |title=John Ivison: Automotive bailout must not be free ride |publisher=Financialpost.com |date=March 2, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402161023/http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=1343240 |archivedate=April 2, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the volume of cars sold in the U.S. was significantly tied to home equity lines of credit, with 24% of sales financed this way in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singletary |first=Michelle |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Home-equity-car-loan-bad-idea-1232183.php |title=SeattlePI-Home Equity Car Loan A Bad Idea-March 2007 |publisher=Seattlepi.com |date=March 23, 2007 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the availability of these loans suddenly dried up in 2008 due to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], vehicle sales declined dramatically, from 17 million in 2006 to 10.6 million in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Postrel |first=Virginia |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-31/obama-deserves-a-victory-lap-for-automaker-rescue-commentary-by-ron-klain.html |title=Bloomberg-Klain: Give Obama a Victory Lap for Auto Rescue-May 2011 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' reported that all 10 of the cars that it considered to be the 10 best were built by Japanese companies.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Autos/story?id=1675993&amp;page=1 Autos: Consumer Reports Top Car Picks All Japanese], ABC News, March 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; While Michigan lost 83,000 Big Three auto manufacturing jobs between 1993 and 2008, more than 91,000 new auto manufacturing jobs were created in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Texas during that same time period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122126282034130461?mod=opinion_main_commentaries If You Like Michigan's Economy, You'll Love Obama's], Wall St. Journal, September 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that 83,000 jobs were lost in Michigan and there is not a reference to automotive jobs lost in other states.  Center for Automotive Research estimated that for every job created by a foreign transplant, 6.1 jobs were lost by the Big Three.

The support given to [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] by the [[Obama Administration]] was initially unpopular, with a March 2009 ''[[CNN]]''/Opinion Research Corporation poll finding that only 37% of Americans approved of the actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/03/30/polls-americans-dont-like-auto-bailouts.html|title=Americans Don't Like Auto Bailouts|date=March 30, 2009|author=[[Paul Steinhauser]]|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 2009 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''/[[NBC News]] survey found 39% approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Study #6095|work=Wall Street Journal|url=http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/WSJ-NBC_Poll090617.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, two polls taken three years after the event show that Americans did eventually support the auto bailout.

At the time, the Big Three employees, parts-supplier employees and car-dealer employees totaled approximately 1.6 million.&lt;ref name='American Prospect-Myerson-2008-11-24'/&gt; All auto-related industries and after-market service businesses employed approximately 3.1 million people in the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics breaks down the workers into the following segments, as of September 2008: Parts manufacturing-504,000; Repair operations-864,000; Wholesale operations-340,000; Dealer operations-1.2 million; and Manufacturing-114,000. GM directly employs 123,000 in all of North America.&lt;ref name='WSJ-McCracken-2008-11-15'&gt;

===Hourly wages and benefits===
[[Gary Burtless]] of the [[Brookings Institution]] argued that hourly wages were similar between the Big Three and the transplants. "The basic hourly wage received by a [[United Auto Workers|UAW]] worker in a Big Three plant is close to that received by a Toyota or Honda worker in a U.S. plant. The UAW-negotiated wage was roughly $28 an hour in 2007. For new workers, the hourly wage was lower at $14 an hour; senior workers made more money. The major cost difference between UAW members and employees in foreign-nameplate factories in the U.S. comes in fringe benefits. The UAW has been one of the more successful American unions in fighting for generous pensions and health benefits for its members."&lt;ref name="L.A. Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-burtless-ikenson4-2008dec04,0,2031804.story |title=L.A. Times |publisher=L.A. Times |date=December 4, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Ikenson of the [[Cato Institute]] argued that "total compensation is the cost of labor to the companies, and for GM it is about $73 per hour and for Toyota about $48.  The average cost differential between the Big Three and all the foreign nameplate companies is about $30 per hour. That's huge." His computation includes all labor-related costs (e.g.., wages, healthcare, and pension—for both current workers and retirees.)&lt;ref name="L.A. Times"/&gt;

Andrew Sorkin of the ''The New York Times'' indicated that GM and Chrysler pay $10–20 more per hour than transplants; this was vigorously disputed by David Cole of the Center for Automotive Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9591 |title=Sorkin and Cole-Discussion of labor about 13 minutes in |publisher=Charlie Rose |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'NYT-Sorkin-2008-11-18'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Average annual wages for production workers at the Big Three were $67,480 in 2007, and $81,940 for skilled workers. In Canada, GM's 2008 average labor costs (including both wages and benefits) were $69 per hour, and Toyota's at $48 per hour, with similar productivity.&lt;ref name='McLeans-Selley-2008-11-21'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Heritage Foundation]], the ratio of retirees to workers varies across the Big Three. For each active worker at GM, there were 3.8 retirees or dependents in 2006. At Chrysler, there were 2.0 and at Ford there were 1.6.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/images/wm2162_table1.gif Retrieved December 22, 2008.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213090237/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/images/wm2162_table1.gif |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the legacy labor cost burden for GM is significantly greater than its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garvey |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/wm2162.cfm#_ftn1 |title=Heritage Foundation – Worker to Retiree Ratios |publisher=Heritage.org |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Morici]], a professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]'s school of business, testified that the extremely high labor and product development costs will keep the Big Three from developing the high quality vehicles needed to become profitable and surviving.&lt;ref name="cnsnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT01&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html | work=The New York Times | title=Let Detroit Go Bankrupt | first=Mitt | last=Romney | date=November 19, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=From  Peter Hamby CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/04/02/romney.fundraising/ |title=Romney strikes bipartisan tone at GOP fundraiser |publisher=CNN |date=April 2, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asian-owned companies' U.S. employees are mainly non-unionized; the Big Three are bound by contracts with the UAW.

According to the UAW, labor cost represented 8.4% of the total cost of manufacturing and selling an automobile in 2006.  "The vast majority of the costs of producing a vehicle and transporting it to a dealership and preparing it for sale – including design, engineering, marketing, raw materials, executive compensation and other costs – are not related to direct or indirect manufacturing labor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaw.org/barg/07fact/fact02.php UAW – FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205035652/http://www.uaw.org/barg/07fact/fact02.php |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jared Bernstein]], the chief economist of Vice President [[Joe Biden]], noted in an April 7, 2009 interview that most of the concessions that the UAW made in the 2007 contract applied only to new hires. Older workers "still benefit from contracts that were signed a long time ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TOM KRISHER and KEN THOMAS – Apr 2, 2009 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j_Mvl4r4i9ue6CqUskMUZticqNuwD97AJQ3G1 |title=The Associated Press: GM readies giveback proposals for bondholders, UAW |publisher=Google |date=April 2, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406084916/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j_Mvl4r4i9ue6CqUskMUZticqNuwD97AJQ3G1 |archivedate=April 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jobs bank costs===
The ''[[Detroit News]]'' published a story in 2005 on how the Big Three U.S. automakers paid more than 12,000 idled employees their full salary and benefits in "jobs bank" programs. The program was established in the 1984 UAW labor contracts with the Big Three to protect workers' salaries and discourage layoffs, as part of the automakers' contracts with the UAW. The union's intent was to protect jobs via a plan to guaratee pay and benefits for union members whose jobs were extinguished by technological progress or plant restructurings. In most cases, workers are paid via the jobs bank only after exhausting government and company unemployment benefits. Some of those workers were placed in retraining.&lt;ref name='Detroit News-2005-10-25'&gt;{{cite news | first= Bryce G. | last= Hoffman | title= Jobs bank programs – 12,000 paid not to work: Big 3 and suppliers pay billions to keep downsized UAW members on payroll in decades-long deal. | date= October 17, 2005 | url = http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0510/17/A01-351179.htm | work = The Detroit News | accessdate =December 7, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the jobs banks, the U.S. automakers are contractually obligated to pay 85–95 percent of union wages and benefits to members of the United Auto Workers union who aren't working – even if their plants have been closed. In the agreement, GM would to allocate $2.1 billion in jobs bank payments over four years, Chrysler $451 million for its program along with another $50 million for salaried union employees, and Ford agreed to set aside $944 million. Peter Morici, a professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]'s school of business, testified that the jobs bank was one of the biggest problems that the Big Three face, saying "Right now if a plant closes in St. Louis and a new one opens in Kansas City, the workers don't have to move from St. Louis to Kansas City; they can opt to get a $105,000 payout or go on Jobs Bank where they can collect 95 percent of pay for the rest of their lives."&lt;ref name="cnsnews1"/&gt;

===Number of brands===
GM had eight brands sold in the United States (not including its overseas brands Vauxhaul, Opel, Holden and at the time GM Daewoo which is now called GM Korea) until it sold three and liquidated one of those brands during bankruptcy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/business/economy/17auto.html?_r=1&amp;hp Union Talks Seen as Key as G.M. Makes Case for Funds], The New York Times, February 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; leaving four (Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick), while Toyota has only three. More brands require additional marketing and product development expenditures, which drives incremental costs relative to the competition.  One analyst estimated that reducing GM brands from 8 to 3 would save $5 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/business/economy/18sorkin.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;em&amp;oref=slogin |title=NY Times |publisher=NY Times |date=November 18, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, reducing the number of brands required closing or consolidation of dealerships, which due to state franchise laws is very expensive.  For example, GM's retirement of the [[Oldsmobile]] brand cost nearly $2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiley |first=David |url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/brandnewday/archives/2008/11/gm_pondering_br.html?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_news+%2B+analysis |title=BW-GM Pondering Brand Cuts |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek  |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number and control of dealerships===
GM and Chrysler have nearly 10,000 dealerships between them, employing an estimated 500,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Isidore |first=Chris |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/20/news/gm_depression/index.htm?postversion=2008112414 |title=CNN-The Big 3 Depression Risk |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 21, 2012 |date=November 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM has many more, smaller dealerships spread across its eight brands than Toyota. Dealerships are protected by state laws that make them difficult to close without paying large fees.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} This makes dealership reform challenging without bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross |first=Andrew |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/business/economy/18sorkin.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=3&amp;em&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1227590442-aBu%20%20RCSrHqBtOHtI7zO6A |title=Dealbook Column – A Bridge Loan?

===Bondholders===
GM was carrying a $43 billion debt burden, with nearly $3 billion per year in interest costs. If bondholders swapped stakes for [[common stock]] (equity) which pays no interest, GM's debt and interest burden would be substantially reduced.

However, bondholders of both Chrysler and GM rejected the debt swap offers, complaining of unequal treatment compared to the UAW, citing that their outstanding debt was more than double that of the UAW's health care trust. The UAW had been offered 50% and 40% stakes in the new Chrysler and GM, respectively, while the bondholders would have received 33 cents on the U.S. dollar for Chrysler and 10% of the new GM (an analyst stated that the GM offer would be projected to recover 24 cents on the dollar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Denning |first=Liam |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124344712115459249 |title=GM Bondholders Right to Be Leery |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 29, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the approval of the Treasury, the offer for bondholders was later amended to include warrants for a further 15% stake.

Bondholders complained of US government interference that bypassed the higher precedence of debtholder claims to favour the UAW, due to the UAW's political contributions to President [[Barack Obama]]. One lawyer for the Chrysler bondholders stated that auto task force head [[Steve Rattner]] had ignored negotiation requests from the bondholders committee, while Rattner also threatened to destroy one of the bondholder's reputation for holding out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2009/05/nontarp.html |title=White &amp; Case's Tom Lauria Reflects on Non-TARP Lenders Crazy Chrysler Week |publisher=Amlawdaily.typepad.com |accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One GM bondholder described this as the socialist state intervention typical of [[Hugo Chavez]]'s [[Venezuela]], saying "This is the kind of stuff you'd expect from a banana republic. Not from the United States."&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aVXocPtIYXOA&amp;refer=us |title=GM's Main Street Bondholders Would Lose, Lawyer Says (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=1629700 |title=GM debt holders gird for battle |publisher=Financialpost.com |date=May 26, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama publicly accused Chrysler bondholders of being speculators, after they rejected the last offer which caused Chrysler to file for bankruptcy, with some of them receiving death threats after a bankruptcy judge refused to protect their anonymity. The hedge funds stated that their clients included pension funds and university endowments. Around $7 billion USD of GM bonds are held by "Mom and Pop-type investors", with one lawyer describing it as autoworker retirees versus retirees.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/flowchart/2009/05/28/gm-bankruptcy-watch-the-main-street-bondholders.html |title=GM Bankruptcy Watch: The "Main Street" Bondholders – Rick Newman |publisher=usnews.com |date=May 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not surprisingly, any recapitalization (typically through bankruptcy) would all but wipe out the value of existing common stock shares, which had already declined significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/28/AR2008112802505.html |title=BK Could Offers GM More Flexibility |work=Washington Post |accessdate=April 21, 2012 |first=Steven |last=Mufson |date=November 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact==

===Claims that failure would be harmful to economy===
The auto industry is a key component of the U.S. economy. Economists used 2007–2008 data to build estimates of what a shutdown would cost in summer 2008, in order to set benchmarks to help policy makers understand the impact of bankruptcies. Such estimates were widely discussed among policy makers in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122670818143330019#video%3DF63F44F3-4EC0-4D79-810B-2373E35CABAC%26articleTabs%3Dvideo ''Wall Street Journal'' video Nov 14, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Closing the Big Three would mean loss of 240,000 very highly paid jobs at the Big Three,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. wages for production workers at the Big Three were $67,480 in 2007, and $81,940 for skilled workers.  CAR Research Memorandum. "The Impact of the U.S. Economy of a Major Contraction of the Detroit Three Automakers" (Nov. 4, 2008) p. 7. A new union agreement calls for much lower rage rates to go into effect in 2010. [http://www.cargroup.org/documents/FINALDetroitThreeContractionImpact_3__000.pdf online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205035647/http://www.cargroup.org/documents/FINALDetroitThreeContractionImpact_3__000.pdf |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a loss of 980,000 highly paid jobs at the suppliers and local dealers, plus the loss of 1.7 million additional jobs throughout the economy—a total loss of 3 million jobs.

Estimates were that a Big Three shutdown would cause a decline in personal income of $151 billion the first year, and $398 billion over three years.  The federal, state and local governments would lose tax revenue, and instead spend on welfare programs a total of $156 billion over three years.&lt;ref&gt;If there is a 50% decline in the Big Three, the negative consequences include a loss of 2.5 million jobs, a decline of $276 billion in personal income over three years and a cost to the government of $108 billion. CAR Research Memorandum. "The Impact of the U.S. Economy of a Major Contraction of the Detroit Three Automakers" (Nov. 4, 2008) [http://www.cargroup.org/documents/FINALDetroitThreeContractionImpact_3__000.pdf online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205035647/http://www.cargroup.org/documents/FINALDetroitThreeContractionImpact_3__000.pdf |date=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[David Wyss]] of S&amp;P has posited that if GM and Chrysler disappear, there could be an increase of about 1 million imported cars every year, which would remove about $25 billion from the U.S. economy. That would reduce GDP by 0.2 percentage points annually—excluding the impact of lost jobs (higher unemployment) and wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Isidore |first=Chris |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/20/news/gm_depression/index.htm?postversion=2008112414 |title=CNN-Big 3 Depression Risk |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 21, 2012 |date=November 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims that failure would not be harmful to economy===
In a November 19, 2008 [[CNBC]] article, Jordan Kimmel, a fund manager at Magnet Investing in [[Randolph, New Jersey]], said that if the Big Three automakers were liquidated or completely shut down, foreign companies such as Honda and Toyota would open up new manufacturing plants in the U.S., and there would be no long term loss in employment or damage to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/27803683/print/1/displaymode/1098/ No Auto Bailout? Investors May Just Say 'No Problem'], CNBC, November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Schuman of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' stated that although a giant corporation failing would be ugly, it is better than artificially keeping it alive without a prospect of improvement. He compared the possible collapse of the U.S. domestic automakers to the 1999 dismantling of the [[Daewoo|Daewoo Group]] in South Korea. Daewoo's proportionate economic impact on Korea was larger than that of the Big Three to the United States. The persistence of the belief that Daewoo and other Korean conglomerates were too big to fail led many bankers and investors to continually waste money on bailouts, despite their poor business plans and unprofitable projects, as Daewoo was unable to repay these loans. Once the too-big-to-fail perception was dispelled, with large conglomerates no longer considered the safest investments, bankers and investors began financing new opportunities in areas which had been starved of capital (small firms, entrepreneurs and consumers), while Korea's GDP actually rose after Daewoo's unwinding. Schuman also noted a similar analogy with Japan during its [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade of the 1990s]], where banks kept injecting new funds into unprofitable "zombie firms" to keep them afloat, arguing that they were too big to fail. However, most of these companies were too debt-ridden to do much more than survive on further bailouts, which led to an economist describing Japan as a "loser's paradise." Schuman states that Japan's economy did not begin to recover until this practice had ended.

===Restructuring process alternatives===
Industry experts, academics, and media outlets made a variety of recommendations regarding reforming or restructuring the Big Three. Many of these include bankruptcy, a court-supervised method of reorganizing or shutting-down a company.

==Bankruptcy and alternatives==
Bankruptcy discussions centered around the prospect of [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]], commonly called restructuring, commonly used to provide a window of opportunity for a corporation to renegotiate contracts, sell assets or component businesses for cash, obtain debt forgiveness, or otherwise reform itself as a viable business enterprise. The alternative, [[Chapter 7 bankruptcy]], is used to shut down and liquidate an enterprise and sell off the pieces, with the proceeds going to the debt holders. Under both types of bankruptcy, the shareholders typically lose their investment and debt holders obtain control of the corporation.  During November 2008, the debate involved whether a Chapter 11 filing would be beneficial or feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/22/business/22nocera.html?_r=2&amp;ref=business |title=NY Times-Road Ahead is Long for GM |work=The New York Times |date=November 22, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012 |first=Joe |last=Nocera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments in favor of Chapter 11 bankruptcy===
In a November 19, 2008, editorial in ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Blythe McGarvie]] said that bankruptcy would allow the automobile industry to become more competitive and sustainable, and cited the airline industry bankruptcy as an example.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/11/19/gm-economy-autos-oped-cx_bm_1119mcgarvie.html The U.S. Economy Doesn't Need GM], Forbes, November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wharton finance professor [[Jeremy Siegel]], author of the book "The Future for Investors," asserted that Chapter 11 bankruptcy would allow Detroit to reorganize but not cause the massive job losses feared by some. "Any bailout of the auto industry is really a bailout for the health benefits of the UAW. That's all it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2092 |title=Dear President-elect Obama: Here's How to Get the Economy out of the Ditch |publisher=Knowledge@Wharton |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of a bailout believe that the automakers' problems could be more efficiently resolved by a bankruptcy court with legal power to dissolve existing contracts, shedding costs, and debts that it can no longer afford. They suggested that a government "[[car czar]]" would be ineffective since their actions could be swayed by Washington politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Kane |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/11/AR2008121101578.html?hpid=topnews |title=Auto Bailout Talks Collapse as Senate Deadlocks Over Wages |work=Washington Post |date=December 12, 2008 |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Isidore |first=Chris |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/11/news/companies/whats_next/ |title=Auto bailout legislation moves onto Senate – Dec. 11, 2008 |publisher=CNNMoney.com |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Massachusetts governor [[Mitt Romney]], running in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012]], confirmed that he had favored bankruptcy rather than government aid to the industry, though he had favored the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) as a whole.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haberman, Maggie, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/65699.html "New Hampshire debate: Mitt Romney talks against auto bailout"], ''Politico'', October 11, 2011. Retrieved February 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments against Chapter 11 bankruptcy===
Critics of [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] as a restructuring process argued that consumers would be unwilling to purchase a car from a bankrupt automaker, as the ability of the automaker to support the warranty is key to the purchase decision.  Advocates have argued that the government or private lenders could establish a fund to enable warranty coverage.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

GM argued that a bankruptcy would threaten jobs and the solvency of the U.S. federal government's [[Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation]] (PBGC). PBGC Director has said: "GM has not been able to give us a straight answer about the funded status of their pension plan. We can't successfully monitor the situation if they are not responsive."&lt;ref name='WSJ-McCracken-2008-11-15'/&gt;
GM's pension fund had enough money for current obligations, but a report issued by the Deutsche Bank estimates that the pension may be $18 billion under-funded by the end of 2008.&lt;ref name='WSJ-McCracken-2008-11-15'/&gt;

===Feasibility of a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy===
A "prepackaged" Chapter 11 bankruptcy means that the key stakeholders have agreed in advance what will happen during the bankruptcy proceedings, which enables greater certainty regarding the outcome and less time spent in bankruptcy protection.  Advocates have indicated this would be preferable, while critics argued it was unlikely that all of the stakeholders could agree on terms while outside of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/business/economy/18sorkin.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=3&amp;em&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1227590442-aBu%20%20RCSrHqBtOHtI7zO6A |title=Sorkin |publisher=NY Times |date=November 18, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government facilitated sale of assets===
The [[Brookings Institution]] advocated a government-facilitated solution in which Big Three assets are transferred or sold to other firms better able to deploy the plant and employee resources. "[The] most constructive role the government can play at this point is to provide a short-term infusion of capital with strict repayment rules that will essentially require the auto makers to sell off their assets to other, successful companies."  The authors argued that the Big Three make automobiles that not enough Americans want to buy, which cannot be solved by a bankruptcy restructuring focused initially on cost-side considerations like wages and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crandall |first=Robert W. |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122783248646663009 |title=WSJ – Brookings Institution |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government facilitated restructuring===
Economist and author [[Jeffrey Sachs]] has advocated a government and private industry partnership to transform the automotive industry, creating a "high mileage vehicle economy" based on hybrid and fuel cell cars.  Loans would be provided immediately, with conditions. He advocates a U.S. strategy of automotive technological leadership, which would "dramatically improve energy and national security, climate security, and U.S. global competitiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/16/AR2008111601743.html |title=A Bridge for the Carmakers |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=April 21, 2012 |first=Jeffrey D. |last=Sachs |date=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments against government intervention===
On November 24, 2008, Congressman [[Ron Paul]] (R-TX) wrote, "In bailing out failing companies, they are confiscating money from productive members of the economy and giving it to failing ones.  By sustaining companies with obsolete or unsustainable business models, the government prevents their resources from being liquidated and made available to other companies that can put them to better, more productive use.  An essential element of a healthy free market, is that both success and failure must be permitted to happen when they are earned.  But instead with a bailout, the rewards are reversed – the proceeds from successful entities are given to failing ones.  How this is supposed to be good for our economy is beyond me ... It won't work.  It can't work ... It is obvious to most Americans that we need to reject corporate cronyism, and allow the natural regulations and incentives of the free market to pick the winners and losers in our economy, not the whims of bureaucrats and politicians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/htbin/blog_inc?BLOG,tx14_paul,blog,999,All,Item%20not%20found,ID=081124_2545,TEMPLATE=postingdetail.shtml The Bailout Surge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228123336/http://www.house.gov/htbin/blog_inc?BLOG,tx14_paul,blog,999,All,Item%20not%20found,ID=081124_2545,TEMPLATE=postingdetail.shtml |date=February 28, 2009 }}, by Ron Paul, 11-24-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 17, 2008 opinion column, economist [[Thomas Sowell]] said that there was no bailout for the [[horse and buggy]] industry 100 years ago when it was replaced by the automobile, and that the overall standard of living is higher when winners and losers are determined by customers instead of by politicians. He also blamed the decline of the Big Three on the economic policies of the "[[rust belt]]" states, and said that Japanese car companies preferred to build factories in other U.S. states that were not so hostile to businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell121708.php3|title=Postponing reality|author=[[Thomas Sowell]]|date= December 17, 2008|publisher=[[Jewish World Review]]|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 16, 2009 report [[Ernst &amp; Young]] stated: "Policies that protect firms or industries can result in reduced incentives for entrepreneurs to invest in innovative ideas and for large firms to invest in R&amp;D because they no longer face the competitive pressure to constantly improve their product in order to improve (or maintain) their market share."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Entrepreneurship_and_innovation:_the_keys_to_global_economic_recovery/$FILE/Entrepreneurship_and_innovation_the_keys_to_global_economic_recovery.pdf |format=PDF |title=Entrepreneurship and Innovation: The Keys to Global Economic Recovery |author=[[Ernst &amp; Young]] |date=June 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229161900/http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Entrepreneurship_and_innovation%3A_the_keys_to_global_economic_recovery/%24FILE/Entrepreneurship_and_innovation_the_keys_to_global_economic_recovery.pdf |archivedate=December 29, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes to management and board===
Critics argued for the removal of General Motors' senior management.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/business/economy/18sorkin.html?_r=3&amp;em=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;adxnnlx=1227590442-aBu++RCSrHqBtOHtI7zO6A |title=A Bridge Loan? U.S. Should Guide GM in Bankruptcy |publisher=NY Times |date=November 18, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such removal is typical in a [[bailout]].

===Mergers===
One or more of the Big Three could have merged, enabling cost savings and focusing on the most profitable brands. However, the UAW and CAW opposed this move, as it would certainly involve layoffs. GM and Chrysler held talks which ultimately went to nothing, with Chrysler, as of June 10, 2009, a fully owned subsidiary of Italian automaker [[Fiat]].&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;

===Comparison with British Leyland===
The comparison was made with the situation of [[British Leyland]] (itself an amalgamation of many car makers similar to General Motors) in the 1970s, which at the time had a 36% market share in the UK.  During that period, the [[UK government]] [[nationalisation|nationalised]] and invested several billion pounds into the ailing business; faced with competition from Mainland Europe and questionable build quality, the business struggled to compete.  While the business slimmed its product line, concentrated mainly on the profitable [[Austin motors|Austin]] and [[Rover cars|Rover]] brands and by the 1980s had some successful models such as the [[Austin Metro]], the brand ended up being broken up and is now owned by [[Nanjing Automobile]] and has largely been dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Friday |url=http://anunlikelyperspective2.squarespace.com/aup2/2008/11/22/ten-reasons-not-to-bailout-the-auto-industry.html |title=Ten Reasons not to Bailout &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; the Auto Industry. – AUP 2 – An Unlikely Perspective 2 |publisher=Anunlikelyperspective2.squarespace.com |date=November 22, 2008 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215061128/http://anunlikelyperspective2.squarespace.com/aup2/2008/11/22/ten-reasons-not-to-bailout-the-auto-industry.html |archivedate=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal government bailout process and timeline==
On November 19, 2008, there was a [[United States Senate]] hearing on the automotive crisis in the presence of the heads of [[Chrysler]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors]]. The auto manufacturers explained that they would need financial aid of $25 billion if they were to avoid bankruptcy. The Senate was divided on the issue. The Republican senators were unwilling to provide aid, some even suggesting that bankruptcy might be the best option as it would free manufacturers from the employment deals agreed with the unions. The Democrats, however, continued to insist that action needed to be taken quickly, in line with President-elect [[Barack Obama|Obama]]'s stance on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1e7e86d0-b5a4-11dd-ab71-0000779fd18c.html Senators cool to pleas by big three carmakers. Financial Times site]. Retrieved November 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rick Wagoner]], head of General Motors, estimated that there could be a loss of 3 million jobs within the first year if the auto industry failed. "This is all about a lot more than just Detroit. It's about saving the U.S. economy from a catastrophic collapse," he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081119/congress_autos.html Big Three automakers running out of time, by Ken Thomas, Associated Press.].

At the November 19, 2008 hearing, [[Gary Ackerman]] (D-NY) said, "Maybe you can tell us what you're actually going to do to sell cars people want," and [[Michael Capuano]] (D-Mass) said, "My fear is you're going to take this money and continue the same stupid decisions you've made for 25 years."&lt;ref name="cnn1"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/19/news/companies/auto_hearing/index.htm More trouble for auto bailout], CNN, November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, General Motors shares fell to the lowest price since the [[Great Depression]] as the chances of a bail-out diminished. Ford shares also fell drastically.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/GM-shares-hit-lowest-price-apf-13632737.html GM shares hit lowest price since Great Depression. Yahoo business news.

A November 20, 2008 [[Detroit Free Press]] article said that the UAW was considering ending its jobs bank program as a condition for a federal bailout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20081120/BUSINESS01/311200023 UAW may give up jobs bank to revive auto loans], Detroit Free Press, November 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic Congressional party leaders [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Harry Reid]] sent a letter to the CEO's of the Big Three automakers calling on these leaders to present by December 2, 2008, a "credible restructuring plan" involving "significant sacrifices and major changes to [the] way of doing business," to qualify for further government assistance.  The letter included a variety of principles and requirements, including a situation assessment, forecasts under various assumptions, taxpayer protection, transparent reporting to an oversight body, dividend and executive pay restrictions, and approach to covering healthcare and pension obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/autoshow/2008/11/21/letter-form-pelosi-reid-to-auto-makers-on-terms/ |title=WSJ-Letter From Pelosi, Reid to Auto Makers on Terms |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2008, the Big Three submitted revised plans to Congress which apparently included more drastic measures such as the lowering of executive pay, reducing the number of brands and refinancing company debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081202/meltdown_autos.html Big Three automakers to submit plans to Congress.

Painting an even more dramatic picture of what would happen if Congress did not respond quickly, Chrysler said it would need $7 billion by the end of the month just to keep running while GM asked for $4 billion immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081203/meltdown_autos.html Congress eyes Big Three automakers' survival plans.

In an interview that was broadcast on NBC's [[Meet The Press]] on December 7, 2008, President-elect [[Barack Obama]] said, "The last thing I want to see happen is for the auto industry to disappear, but I'm also concerned that we don't put $10 billion or $20 billion or $30 billion or whatever billion dollars into an industry, and then, six months to a year later, they come back hat in hand and say, `Give me more.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gbjFY-o07QeryRxtFR3oC1w_v1PwD94U22AO0 Obama suggests some auto execs should lose jobs], Associated Press, December 7, 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210094144/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gbjFY-o07QeryRxtFR3oC1w_v1PwD94U22AO0 |date=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional bailout bill===
On December 9, 2008, negotiators revealed the terms of an emerging deal between the White House and Congress under which a short-term $15 billion bailout for the Big Three would be overseen by a federal "[[car czar]]" or trustee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081209/congress_autos.html Congress, White House nearing deal on $15 billion bailout for Big Three automakers, Associated Press, December 9, 2008]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212114900/http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081209/congress_autos.html |date=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081210/congress_autos.html Congress, White House near deal for $15 billion auto bailout – but not quite yet.

On December 10, 2008, the [[House Financial Services Committee]] released a copy of the proposed financial bailout package&lt;ref&gt;[http://crossovercars.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/automakerbailoutbillpacakage.pdf Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act, House Financial Services Committee, Dec. 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; for GM, Ford, and Chrysler. The bill proposed the appointment of a '[[car czar]]' to oversee automakers' restructuring efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apr. 21, 2012 |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081209/AUTO01/812090378/1148/&amp;source=nletter-business |title=Car czar to help steer restructuring, Detroit News, Tierney, C., Dec. 9, 2008 |publisher=The Detroit News |date=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and restrictions on executive bonuses, [[golden parachute]] packages and required automakers to sell or divest themselves of any privately owned or leased aircraft.

===Senate rejects bailout===
On December 11, the bill failed to pass, losing 52–35 on a Senate procedural vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rockymounttelegram.com/news/nation/senate-roll-call-on-14b-auto-bailout-291207.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516131816/http://www.rockymounttelegram.com/news/nation/senate-roll-call-on-14b-auto-bailout-291207.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 16, 2016 |title=Senate roll call on $14B auto bailout |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Rocky Mount Telegram |date=December 12, 2008 |quote=On this vote, a "yes" vote was a vote to formally consider the House bill and a "no" vote was a vote to stop its progress.

===Bush approves bailout===
On December 19, [[George W. Bush]] announced that he had approved the bailout plan, which would give loans of $17.4 billion to U.S. automakers GM and Chrysler, stating that under present economic conditions, "allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neuman |first=Scott |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98498125 |title=NPR Story |publisher=Npr.org |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush provided $13.4 billion now, with another $4 billion available in February 2009. Funds would be made available from the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]].&lt;ref name="Bush Approves $17.4 Billion Auto Bailout " /&gt; General Motors would get $9.4 billion, and Chrysler $4 billion.&lt;ref name="Bush unveils $17.4bn car bail-out "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7791999.stm|title=Bush unveils $17.4bn car bail-out |date=December 19, 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=December 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it had been argued that the Treasury lacked the statutory authority to direct TARP funds to the automakers, since TARP is limited to "financial institutions" under Section 102 of the TARP.  It was also argued that providing TARP funds to automaker's financing operations, such as GMAC, runs counter to the intent of Congress for limiting TARP funds to true "financial institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.heritage.org/2008/12/12/tarp-now-a-slush-fund-for-detroit/ |title=TARP: Now A Slush Fund for Detroit? |work=The Foundry |publisher=Heritage Foundation |date=December 12, 2008 |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 19, 2008, President Bush used his executive authority to declare that TARP funds may be spent on any program he personally deems necessary to avert the financial crisis, and declared Section 102 to be nonbinding.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The federal loan would prevent General Motors from going into immediate bankruptcy.

===Presidential task force on the auto industry===
{{Main|Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry}}
Under the [[Obama Administration]], the idea of a [[car czar]] was considered and ultimately abandoned in favor of joint [[Lawrence Summers]]/[[Timothy Geithner]] oversight of a possible second round of lending to the auto companies. In mid-February, the auto companies GM and Chrysler applied for additional funds.

The task force was formed in February 2009 instead, and began meetings at that time.&lt;ref name=detnews&gt;David Shepardson and Gordon Trowbridge.

===Second bailout===
On February 18, 2009, General Motors and Chrysler again approached the U.S. government, in regard to obtaining a second bridging loan of $21.6 billion (£15.2 billion).  $16.6 billion of this would go to General Motors, while Chrysler would take $5 billion.  General Motors agreed to shed 47,000 jobs, close five plants, and axe 12 car models.  Chrysler agreed to cut 3,000 jobs, cut one shift from production, and axe three car models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7893574.stm |title=Business &amp;#124; US car giants seek $21bn funding |publisher=BBC News |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  General Motors was also looking to sell its Swedish subsidiary, [[Saab Automobile|Saab]].

===Obama address to joint session of Congress===
In his [[joint address to Congress]] in 2009, Obama stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;We will invest fifteen billion dollars in technologies like ... more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America. As for auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink. We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices. But we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can compete and win. Millions of jobs depend on it. Scores of communities depend on it. And I believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk from it&lt;ref name=joint2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-President-Barack-Obama-Address-to-Joint-Session-of-Congress/ |title=Remarks of President Barack Obama – Address to Joint Session of Congress |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chrysler bankruptcy===
On April 30, 2009, Chrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after talks with lenders broke down.  On the May 14, 2009 Chrysler announced it was to close 25% of its US dealerships as part of its restructuring process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8050506.stm |title=Business &amp;#124; Chrysler to close 25% of dealers |publisher=BBC News |date=May 14, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Motors bankruptcy===
Only days after approaching the U.S. Government to seek further funding, General Motors published its losses for the final quarter of 2008 to be at $9.6 billion (£6.7 billion).  This brought its overall 2008 losses to $30.9 billion.  In 2007, General Motors made a loss of $38.7 billion.  In the light of the published losses GM has conceded that it expected auditors to question its future viability when it releases its annual report in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7912544.stm |title=Business &amp;#124; GM reports massive quarterly loss |publisher=BBC News |date=February 26, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the June 1, 2009, General Motors filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] after failing to successfully negotiate deals with bond holders.  On the day the application was made, General Motors was largely a nationalized institution (the U.S. government owning 60% and the Canadian 12.5%), the remaining private stakes mainly being owned by employees.  The application to a court in New York marked the largest failure of an industrial company in US history.  The restructuring would drastically change General Motors, with at least 20,000 US employees likely to lose their jobs.  General Motors had previously announced that another nine plants will be closed while three more will be idled.  GM's chief executive [[Fritz Henderson]] appealed to customers to give the company another chance, claiming ''"the GM that let too many of you down is now history"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8077255.stm |title=Business &amp;#124; GM enters bankruptcy protection |publisher=BBC News |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A  May 18, 2009 article in ''The Washington Post'' said that seven weeks after the Obama administration fired GM CEO G. Richard Wagoner Jr., Wagoner had still not received the $20 million severance package that the company had contractually promised him.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/17/AR2009051702268.html At Geithner's Treasury, Key Decisions on Hold]". ''The Washington Post'', May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a June 9, 2009 interview, [[Edward E. Whitacre Jr.]], the new chairman of GM, said, "I don't know anything about cars ... A business is a business, and I think I can learn about cars. I'm not that old, and I think the business principles are the same."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=aQ._YJhEj_Jo Whitacre Vows to ‘Learn About Cars’ as Chairman of New GM Board]". ''Bloomberg News'', June 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amount of investment===
A February 18, 2009 CNN article said the bailout could cost U.S. taxpayers $130 billion, but this number does not consider that monies recovered later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/18/news/companies/auto_bailout/?postversion=2009021817 Auto bailout tab could top $130 billion], CNN, February 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early June 2009, the Bush and Obama administrations had invested $80.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/transportation/taxpayers-b-invested-auto-makers/ Taxpayers Have $80.3B Invested in Detroit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611172338/http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/transportation/taxpayers-b-invested-auto-makers/ |date=June 11, 2009 }}, Fox Business News, June 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 2011, Chrysler repaid the last of the money to the U.S. and Canadian treasuries, several years ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler to pay off government loans today|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110524/BUSINESS01/105240399/Chrysler-pay-off-government-loans-today|publisher=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Image issues==
Issues involving the [[public relations|public image]] of the companies involved in this crisis also played key parts during the process.

===GM advertisement: an apology and a recommitment===
On December 8, 2008, General Motors unveiled a new advertisement where the company apologized for disappointing and violating the trust of American consumers. They pledged to make a commitment to regain focus on core brands and away from pickups and SUVs, declaring they needed to make such an unfiltered statement "since quite a bit of media commentary has not kept pace with our actual progress to transform the company."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE4B738W20081208?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true GM says it "disappointed" and "betrayed" consumers], Reuters, December 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 19, 2008 Congressional hearing===
According to [[ABC News]] and other media outlets, the Big Three CEOs ([[Rick Wagoner]] of GM, [[Alan Mulally]] of Ford and [[Robert Nardelli]] of Chrysler) who attended the November 19, 2008, meeting in Washington D.C. to request a bailout traveled to the meeting in private luxury jet aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/WallStreet/story?id=6285739&amp;page=1 Big Three CEOs Flew Private Jets to Plead for Public Funds], ABC News, November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A November 19 CNN article noted that "[[Gary Ackerman]], D-NY ... and several other representatives suggested that it was difficult to give money to the automakers when the CEOs had all flown to Washington on corporate jets. 'Those types of symbolic things matter and set a tone,' said [[Peter Roskam]], R-Ill."&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt; House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] summed up the Congressional response to their requests with the statement "Until they show us the plan, we cannot show them the money," and demanded that the automakers return to submit convincing turnaround plans by Dec. 2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122720155194344635 Lawmakers Send Big Three Back Home Empty-Handed], Wall Street Journal, November 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 19, 2008, [[CNN]] article quoted Thomas Schatz, president of [[Citizens Against Government Waste]], as saying, "They're coming to Washington to beg the taxpayers to help them. It's unseemly to be running around on a $20,000 flight versus a $500 round trip." The article noted that although it was not known how much the private flights cost, analyst [[Richard Aboulafia]] of the Teal Group said that $20,000 was a reasonable estimation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/11/19/autos.ceo.jets/?iref=hpmostpop Big Three auto CEOs flew private jets to ask for taxpayer money], CNN, November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2008, it was reported that General Motors and Ford were planning to sell their fleets of corporate luxury jets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=6376167&amp;page=1 GM, Ford Will Sell Corporate Jet Fleet], ABC News, December 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid electric vehicle usage===
Wagoner, Mulally and Nardelli each drove separately to Washington for a December 2 Congressional hearing in [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s after the above-noted criticism for arriving to Washington for the November hearing in private jets. Wagoner rode in a [[Chevrolet Malibu]] hybrid accompanied by Beth Lowery, the company's top environmental and safety official. Mulally travelled in a [[Ford Escape Hybrid]].&lt;ref name="detnews1"&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Shepardson |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081203/AUTO01/812030392 |title=Survival roadmap for the Big 3 |location=WASHINGTON |publisher=The Detroit News |date=December 3, 2008 |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nardelli arrived in a [[Chrysler Aspen]] Hybrid.

===Non-ecological past practices===
From the [[ecology|energy-conservation]] point of view the Big Three have a negative image. Some ecology-minded American view with little sympathy the big automakers' reputation for maximizing profits at the environment's expense, and often believe they deliberately destroying mass-transport systems and privately owned railways between the 1920s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovearth.net/gmdeliberatelydestroyed.htm |title=Bradford Snell, '&amp;#39;The StreetCar Conspiracy. How General Motors Deliberately Destroyed Public Transit'&amp;#39; |publisher=Lovearth.net |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|This takes Snell's essentially self-published thesis as a given.|date=August 2015}}
Some have alleged that The Big Three contributed to the development of suburbs, seen as fuel-inefficient in that it requires commuters to drive to cities from increasingly more distant suburbs. Facing a saturated car market in the U.S. in the early 1920s, GM engaged in a controversial policy along with road-builders that triggered the massive shift from the mass transportation of the previous century to the "one-person-one-car" trip of today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainabletimes.ca/articles/greencars.htm Stephen Leahy, ''Time Expired'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bond ratings downgraded===
On December 19, 2008, [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded the Issuer Default Rating of General Motors and Chrysler to "C," indicating "default is imminent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/12834609/c_12833296 Fitch: GM, Chrysler Defaults Are “Imminent”], CFO Magazine, December 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 22, 2008, article from Bloomberg reported that General Motors and Ford "had their debt cut further below investment status by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. GM's unsecured debt was trimmed one level to C, or 11 grades below investment quality, by S&amp;P. Moody's lowered its rating on $26 billion in Ford debt by two grades to Caa3, or nine below investment quality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aeb9Jow5oXNY&amp;refer=worldwide GM, Ford Debt Cut Further Into Junk by S&amp;P, Moody’s], Bloomberg, December 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbying and other financial ties between Big Three and Congress===
The Big Three spent almost $50 million to lobby Congress during the first nine months of 2008. Senator [[Carl Levin]] (D-Michigan) received $438,304 over 30 years, or $14,610 a year. House member [[John Dingell]] (D-Michigan) received nearly $1 million over his 54 years in Congress, or $18,518 a year. House member [[Joe Knollenberg]] (R-Michigan) received $879,327 over only 16 years in office, or $54,957 a year. Dingell's wife Debbie used to work as a lobbyist for General Motors, and after she married Dingell, she became a senior GM executive at an undisclosed salary. As of May 2008, Dingell owned GM stock worth up to $350,000, GM stock options worth up to $1 million more, and a GM pension fund. In 2000, the Dingells owned GM stock options worth up to $5 million. In 1998, Dingell sold GM stock options worth up to $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/03/cbsnews_investigates/main4646424.shtml Big Three Spending Millions On Lobbying], CBS News, December 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The value of that stock, options and pension has been lost in the bankruptcy restructuring that Congress approved for GM.

GM sent letters to tens of thousands of their dealers, supplier executives, employees and union members, asking recipients to call and write Congress with several "talking points" about the potential effects of a GM bankruptcy.&lt;ref name='WSJ-McCracken-2008-11-15'/&gt;

==Corporate turnaround proposals and strategies==

===Products: electric and hybrid vehicles===
[[Image:Chevrolet Volt--DC.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Chevrolet Volt]]]]

Detroit's "Big Three" automakers went to Washington, D.C., on December 2 (arriving in Washington in hybrids after being criticized for traveling to the earlier November Senate hearing in private jets) to present their long-term viability plans to the [[United States Congress]], and those plans included significant commitments to [[fuel efficiency|fuel-saving]] and [[electric vehicle]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12127 |title=Automakers Commit to Fuel Economy, Electrification in Long-Term Plans |publisher=EERE News |date=December 3, 2008 |accessdate=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ford Motor Company]] unveiled an aggressive plan to electrify its fleet of vehicles, including plans to offer an all-electric van-type vehicle in 2010 for use in commercial fleets, complemented by a battery-powered sedan in 2011. By 2012, the company will bring a family of [[regular hybrid]]s, [[plug-in hybrid]]s, and [[battery electric vehicle]]s to market. Ford intends to invest about $14 billion on fuel-efficient technologies over the next seven years and aims to achieve a 36% improvement in fuel economy for its entire fleet by the 2015 model year. The company has applied to DOE's [[Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program]] for $5 billion to support these efforts, but the company also sought up to $9 billion in bridge loans. However, Ford expected to remain viable through 2009 and hopes to avoid drawing on the loan.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[General Motors|GM]] unveiled the production version of the [[Chevy Volt]] in September. The vehicle will be able to travel up to 40 miles in all-electric mode. General Motors Corporation (GM) is involved in a well-publicized effort to launch its plug-in hybrid model, the Chevy Volt, in 2010, and the company also intends to employ the Volt drivetrain in other vehicles. GM plans to launch predominately fuel-efficient cars and crossovers over the next four years, investing $2.9 billion in fuel-efficient technologies and alternative fuels during that time period. By 2012, GM will offer 15 hybrid models, and more than half of its fleet will be [[flex-fuel vehicle]]s, able to run on either gasoline or ethanol-rich E85. GM is seeking $12 billion in bridge loans through 2009 and is also asking for revolving credit of $6 billion that it could draw on if its sales forecast falls short. The company ended the third quarter of the year with cash reserves of $16 billion, but it estimates that it should have at least $11 billion on hand to maintain its operations. Without a federal loan, GM expects its cash reserves to fall to $10.1 billion by year's end and to fall to $3.6 billion by February.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Chrysler LLC]] predicted that for the 2009 model year, 73% of its vehicles will be more fuel efficient than their 2008 models, and the company planned to launch more small, fuel-efficient vehicles in the future. The company's plan also called for the introduction of a [[Dodge Ram]] hybrid in 2010, along with the company's first electric-drive vehicle. Chrysler also planned to offer three additional electric-drive vehicles by 2013. And like GM, Chrysler planned to make half of its fleet [[flex-fuel]] capable by 2012. The company sought a bridge loan of $7 billion. Chrysler ended the first half of the year with $9.4 billion in cash, but expected to end the year with only $2.5 billion in cash, and was concerned that it might not make it through the first quarter of 2009 without the loan.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Automakers have already submitted applications for more than $20 billion in retooling loans to pay for fuel efficient vehicle projects.&lt;ref name="detnews1"/&gt;

===Production capacity: factory closings===
[[File:MN Ford plant.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Ford|Ford's]] [[Twin Cities Assembly Plant]] in [[Minnesota]] was closed in 2011]]
On December 12, 2008, General Motors announced that it was temporarily closing 20 factories in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j_Mvl4r4i9ue6CqUskMUZticqNuwD951BEHG0 GM to temporarily close 20 plants to slash output], Associated Press, December 12, 2008. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, Chrysler announced it would idle all 30 of its plants for at least one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramsey |first=Mike |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a6_dyTuWDwIM&amp;refer=home |title="Chrysler Idles Plants for a Month; GM Halts Volt Engine Factory", Bloomberg.com, December 17, 2008 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=December 17, 2008 |accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GM will invest $1 billion of bailout money in Brazil===
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=May 2011}}
A February 2, 2009 article in the ''Latin American Herald Tribune'' said that General Motors would invest $1 billion in [[Brazil]], and that this money is part of the bailout that it received from the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=12396&amp;ArticleId=320909 General Motors to Invest $1 Billion in Brazil Operations – Money to Come from U.S. Rescue Program]". ''Latin American Herald Tribune'', February 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brand consolidation===
General Motors' plan was to consolidate their portfolio of US brands, concentrating on the [[Cadillac]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Buick]] and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] brands, while phasing out, or possibly selling their [[Pontiac]], [[Hummer]] and [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] brands.

On June 2, GM Motors announced the sale of the [[Hummer]] brand of [[off-road vehicles]] to [[Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aaron Smith, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/02/news/companies/gm_hummer/index.htm?postversion=2009060207 |title=Who bought Hummer?

Various versions of the acronym exist, such as '''LAM''', which leaves out galleries, which may be seen as a subset of museums, and may be confused with commercial galleries where art is bought and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BibSI |url=http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |title=On the LAM: Library, Archive, and Museum Collections in the Creation and Maintenance of Knowledge Communities &amp;#124; BibSI |publisher=Bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305191920/http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |archivedate=2014-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lam.alaska.gov/ |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090501071432/http%3A//lam%2Ealaska%2Egov/ |archivedate= May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LAM DNA August 4, 2005 by Jim |url=http://hangingtogether.org/?p=15 |title=Blog Archive » LAM DNA |publisher=hangingtogether.org |date=2005-08-04 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLAMR is another variant which includes Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Conference - Australian Society of Archivists|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/2017-conference|website=www.archivists.org.au|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, GLAMs are institutions in the public interest, collecting [[cultural heritage]] materials.

The term LAM has been in use at least since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_saAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=LAM+libraries+archives+museums&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=E-LAM|title=Information Retrieval &amp; Library Automation|date=1997|publisher=Lomond Systems.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged as these institutions saw their missions overlapping, creating the need for a wider industry sector grouping. This became apparent as they placed their collections online—artworks, books, documents, and artifacts all effectively becoming "information resources."

Proponents of greater collaboration argue that the present convergence is actually a return to traditional unity. These institutions share epistemological links dating from the [[Library of Alexandria|“Museum” of Alexandria]] and continuing through the [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] gathered in early modern Europe. Over time as collections expanded, they became more specialized and their housing was separated according to the form of information and kinds of users. Furthermore, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries distinct professional societies and educational programs developed for each kind of institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Archives, Libraries, Museums: Coming Back Together?|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/libraries_and_culture/v049/49.1.marcum.html|journal = Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 2166-3033|pages = 74-89|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/lac.2014.0001|first = Deanna|last = Marcum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As collecting institutions, GLAMs preserve and make accessible primary sources valuable for researchers.

'''Health Reimbursement Account''' is a notional derivative of a '''Health Reimbursement Arrangement''' ('''HRA'''),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf IRS Publication 969]&lt;/ref&gt; a type of US employer-funded health benefit plan that reimburses employees for out-of-pocket medical expenses. Following implementation of the [[Affordable Care Act]], the health plans must be integrated with a qualified employer-sponsored group health insurance plan to avoid excise tax penalties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-54.pdf IRS Notice 2013-54]&lt;/ref&gt; Using a Health Reimbursement Arrangement yields "tax advantages to offset health care costs" for both employees and employers.&lt;ref name=IRS969&gt;Internal Revenue Service. [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf.] 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
Health Reimbursement Accounts are funded solely by the employer; they cannot be funded through employee salary deductions. The employer sets the parameters for the Health Reimbursement Accounts, and unused dollars remain with the employer: they do not follow the employee to new employment.

==Contributions==
Health Reimbursement Accounts are notional accounts; no funds are expensed until reimbursements are paid. By health reimbursement arrangements, employers reimburse employees directly only after the employees incur approved medical expenses. According to the IRS, an HRA "must be funded solely by an employer. Contributions cannot be paid through a salary reduction agreement (such as a [[cafeteria plan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969/index.html|title=Publication 969 - Main Content |publisher=IRS|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no minimum or maximum contribution limit on the employer's contributions to an HRA.&lt;ref name=IRS969/&gt;

==Distributions==
According to the IRS, employees are reimbursed tax-free for qualified medical expenses up to a maximum amount for a coverage period. HRAs reimburse only items (co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, and services) agreed to by the employer that are not covered by the employer's selected standard insurance plan (any health insurance plan, not only a [[High Deductible Health Plan]]). The arrangements are described in IRC Section 105.

With an HRA, employers fund individual reimbursement accounts for their employees and define what those funds can be used for, specified out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays.

Qualified claims must be described in the HRA plan document at inception: before reimbursing employees for the medical expenses. Arrangements (medical services, dental services, co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, participation) may vary from plan to plan, and an employer may have multiple plans in place, allowing much flexibility. The kinds of expenses that can be paid under an HRA are generally the same as the expenses that can be paid through a Flexible Spending Account (FSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfeifer|first=William|title=How to Deduct Medical Bills as Business Expenses at your Law Firm|url=http://law.about.com/od/financialmanagement/a/How-To-Deduct-Medical-Bills-As-Business-Expenses-At-Your-Law-Firm.htm|work=About.com Law Practice Management|publisher=About.com|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The employer is not required to prepay into a fund for reimbursements. Instead, the employer reimburses employee claims as they occur.

Reimbursements under an HRA can be made to the following persons:
# Current and former employees.
# Spouses and dependents of those employees.
# Any person the employee could have claimed as a dependent on the employee's return unless:
## The person filed a joint return,
## The person had gross income of $3,400 or more, or
## The employee or spouse, if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return.
# Spouses and dependents of deceased employees.

==Advantages==

Advantages of HRAs for employers include:
* Reimbursements of qualified claims are tax-deductible for the employer.
* Employers know their maximum expense related to their health care benefit.

Advantages of HRAs for employees include:
* Contributions that employers make can be excluded from employees' gross income (contributions must be made by the employer, not come from payroll reductions).
* Reimbursements may be tax free if the employee pays qualified medical expenses.
* Unused funds in the HRA can be rolled into future years for reimbursement.
* HRAs may be offered in conjunction with other employer-provided health benefits, including [[Flexible spending account|Flexible Spending Accounts]] (FSAs).
* Employees can be reimbursed for a health care plan that meets their or their families' specific needs, as opposed to a standard company plan.

==Disadvantages==
A frequent complaint regarding HRA arrangements is that they are extremely opaque in regards to their requirements. HRAs must follow "a variety of statutory rules and provisions" including the [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] continuation coverage requirements, [[ERISA]], and [[HIPAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Reimbursement Arrangements|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-02-45.pdf|publisher=IRS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HRA plans are considered "Primary Payers" subject to Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) mandatory reporting requirements. There are significant penalties for failure to comply with the MSP reporting requirements. Although the MSP reporting requirements began to apply to certain group health plans on January 1, 2009, [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CMS]] has delayed mandatory reporting for HRAs.&lt;ref&gt;Employee Benefits Institute of America 7/7/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules pertaining to their reimbursements are perceived by member participants to be somewhat contradictory and/or even incoherent, leading some to lose contributions intended for healthcare but later (after the procedure or laboratory test) to be disallowed.

Other disadvantages of HRAs include:
* Self-employed persons are usually ineligible.
* "Highly compensated" participants may be subject to "certain limitations."

A sole proprietor can employ a spouse who actually helps the business. The employer would need to establish a W-2 to make the spouse's employment legitimate. The health care can be run through the business and save the family, on average, $3,000 each year. As small businesses look to reduce costs, especially medical, the HRA can be a great tool that has been used by all too few since the 1954 tax law.

HRAs are treated as group health plans and subject to the Medicare secondary payment (MSP). HRAs are subject to the provisions regardless of whether or not they have an end-of-year carry-over feature.

Standalone HRAs not offered in conjunction with a High Deductible Health Plan are subjected to restrictions starting in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jaeckle.com/Publications/Alerts/StandAloneHRAMayViolatetheHealthCareReformLaw&lt;/ref&gt; The law now essentially bans the existence of most such HRAs, as a health plan with maximum benefit limit.

'''I.A.Recordings''' was founded in 1982 by a small group of volunteers, to record past and present [[industries]] on film and video, as a resource for [[industrial archaeology]] (I.A.).

When possible, they capture the processes and activities of an industry while it is still working; but moving pictures also add an extra dimension to the recording of industrial remains.

All the footage they shoot is kept in a storage archive for posterity}.&lt;ref name="BUFVC"&gt;Ballantyne, James (ed.): "Researchers Guide to British film &amp; television collections", page 142. British Universities Film &amp; Video Council 1993. {{ISBN|0-901299-64-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From time to time, they produce edited programmes from some of the material, to make it available to the public on [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="IAR_Home"&gt;[http://www.iarecordings.org], "I.A.Recordings home page" retrieved 2011-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Their first project in 1982 was to work with the historian W.K.V.Gale to record the famous John Bradley Rolling Mill in the [[English Midlands]], as it was due to close within a week and was the last of its kind in the area.

Since then they have recorded many industries, several of which have since closed.&lt;ref name="BUFVC" /&gt; They have also produced several documentary history programmes, particularly about inland waterways ([[canals]]) and [[mining]].&lt;ref name="NAMHO"&gt;Vernon, R.W. (ed.): "National Association of Mining History Organisations Mining Heritage Guide", page 98. National Association of Mining History Organisations 2006. {{ISBN|0-9517437-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I.A.Recordings started in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] but have since recorded sites in Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, [[Poland]], Spain and the United States.&lt;ref name="IAR_AZ"&gt;[http://www.iarecordings.org/subjidx.html], "I.A.Recordings A-Z Subject Index" retrieved 2011-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

They have developed their own specialist [[video]] technology such as helmet-mounted cameras for use underground and [[MineCam]], a remote-controlled camera for mine shaft exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, Mike (ed.): "Cave Radio &amp; Electronics Group Journal Number 22", pages 3 - 6. British Cave Research Association 1995. ISSN 1361-4800&lt;/ref&gt;

I.A.Recordings use [[broadcast]] equipment and techniques and since 2005, [[High Definition Video]].&lt;ref name="NAMHO" /&gt;

By 2008, they had over 38,000 minutes of original footage in the archive, but as they are voluntary they have only had time to edit a relatively small amount for release on DVD.

== Cost Accounting Standards (CASs) and Management Accounting Guidelines (MAGs) issued by ICAI ==

=== Cost Accounting Standards (CASs) ===

The Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICAI), recognizing the need for structured approach to the measurement of cost in manufacture or service sector and to provide guidance to the user organizations, government bodies, regulators, research agencies and academic institutions to achieve uniformity and consistency in classification, measurement and assignment of cost to product and services, has constituted Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) in the year 2001 with the objective of formulating the Cost Accounting Standards (CASs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casbicwai.org/CASB/casb-about.asp |title=About CASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of Cost Accounting Standard consists of Introduction, Objectives of issuing standards, Scope of standard, Definitions and explanations of the terms used in the standard, Principles of Measurement, Assignment of Cost, Presentation and Disclosure.

The CASB has primarily identified 39 areas/items on which CASs are to be developed.

On visit to India during the month of May, 2010, the then President of IFAC, Mr. Robert Bunting praised the role of ICAI by saying that "In cost accounting standards, perhaps India is the global leader. Its role is limited to select sectors and is closely linked to public accounting in most countries. We are discussing about the possibilities to make this system acceptable in more regions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/q-a-robert-bunting-president-ifa-110060200101_1.html |title=Q&amp;A: Robert Bunting, President, IFA |publisher=Business Standard |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartinvestor.in/common/srchoutdet-30315-Auto-QA_Robert_Bunting_President_IFA.htm |title=Q&amp;A: Robert Bunting, President, IFA |publisher=smartinvestor.in |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of the ICAI at its 251th Meeting held on 12–13 February 2009 and 258th Meeting held on 14 December 2009 decided on Mandatory application of Cost Accounting Standards (CASs). The CASs shall be mandatory with effect from period commencing on or after 1 April 2010 for being applied for the preparation and certification of General Purpose Cost Accounting Statements. So far ever 22 Cost Accounting Standards and 4 Management Accounting Guidelines have been issued by the Institute. The effective date of the standards are also mentioned in respective standards.

== Cost Audit &amp; Assurance Standards (CAASs) ==

With the introduction of "The Companies (Cost Audit Report) Rules, 2011" by [[Ministry of Corporate Affairs]] (MCA), Govt. of India, the scope &amp; application of Statutory Cost Audit (u/s 233B of the Companies Act, 1956) has been widened manifold. The said rule also introduces a new concept named as 'Performance Appraisal Report' (PAR) which needs to be submitted by the Statutory Cost Auditor to the company along with the Cost Audit Report. This PAR is only meant for the company &amp; it is not required to submit the same to the MCA like the Cost Audit Report.

In this changed context, the institute, addressing the needs of separate standards of auditing &amp; assurance of cost records, has constituted the Cost Audit and Assurance Standards Board (CAASB) entrusting the responsibility to formulate standards and develop guidance notes in the areas of auditing, assurance, related services and quality control keeping in mind the special sophisticated structure &amp; objectives of Statutory Cost Audit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icmai.in/~icmai/caasb/aboutcaasb |title=About CAASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sub-section (3) of section 148 of the Companies Act, 2013 gave the statutory mandate for separate auditing standards for audit of cost records as distinct from auditing standards applicable for audit of financial records. It stipulates that the auditor conducting the cost audit shall comply with the cost auditing standards which are issued by the ICAI, with the approval of the [[Government of India]].

'''Till date, the CAASB has issued four standards:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icmai.in/~icmai/caasb/download |title=CAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CAAS-101 on Planning an Audit of Cost Statements'''

'''CAAS-102 on Cost Audit Documentation'''

'''CAAS-103 on Overall Objectives of the Independent Cost Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance with Standards on Auditing'''

'''CAAS-104 on Knowledge of Business, its Processes and the Business Environment'''

==Education==
He is a former pupil of the French [[École polytechnique]], where he graduated in 1949, as an engineer of bridges &amp; road construction.

From 1954 to 1960 he worked on public projects in [[Guinea]], as an expert for the road programs of [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]]. In 1961 he returned to France and worked for the Wendel Group. After various positions, in 1972, he became general manager of [[Sacilor]], then Chairman and managing Director of [[Sollac]]. In 1976 he started working at the [[Rhône-Poulenc]], eventually becoming Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref name="CoignardGuichard2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coignard|first1=Sophie|last2=Guichard|first2=Marie-Thérèse|title=French Connections:Networks of Influence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GVyohk7knogC&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=25 February 2011|year=2000|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=978-1-892941-02-2|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the group in 1982 and until 1986 he worked as an international consultant.

'''Leicester City Centre''' is [[Leicester]]'s historical commercial, cultural and transport hub and is home to its central business district. Its inner core is roughly delineated by the [[A594 road (Leicester)|A594]], Leicester's inner [[ring road]], although the various central campuses of the University of Leicester, De Monfort University and Leicester College are adjacent to the inner ring road and could be considered to be a continuation of the City centre. In a similar way, the Leicester Royal Infirmary precinct, the New Walk business district ([[Southfields, Leicester|Southfields]]), the Welford Road Stadium of Leicester Tigers' RUFC and the King Power Stadium of Premier League Leicester City to the south, and the Golden Mile to the north could also be deemed to be extensions to the central core.

The city centre incorporates most of Leicester's shopping, with the [[Highcross Leicester|Highcross]] and the [[Haymarket Shopping Centre]] as well as the 'Old Town' around [[Leicester Cathedral]], [[Leicester Market]] and the [[Magazine Gateway]]. Politically, the city centre is split between the [[Leicester City Council]] [[ward (politics)|wards]] of Abbey and Castle. A£19 million regeneration project transformed Leicester's city centre. The work won three awards: The Urbis Urban Regeneration Award in 2007 for Gallowtree Gate, The BCSC Town Centre "Gold" Best in Britain award in June 2009 and the Transport Times Walking &amp; Public Realm award in July 2009.

==The old city==

[[File:Stukeley Leicester Map 1722.jpg|thumb|Map of Leicester in 1722]]

The [[Ratae Corieltauvorum|historic city of Leicester]] was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as [[Ratae Corieltauvorum]] - after the Corieltauvi, the local tribe of Britons whose tribal lands these were - at the crossing of the [[River Soar]] by the [[Fosse Way]], between the current path of the river and the modern Gallowtree Gate.

It is thought that the later medieval walls and gates were in approximately the same positions as the Roman ones, with the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] being where the modern inner ring road meets St Nicholas Circle. The Roman baths are nearby and are preserved at [[Jewry Wall]].  [https://web.archive.org/web/20050829162452/http://semper.freelinuxhost.com/historical_maps.htm] The east gate was at the eastern end of High Street (preserved in the street name Eastgates), the north gate was at the northern end of Highcross Street, the west gate was on the town side of West Bridge, and the south gate was in the modern Friar Lane area – the city walls ran along the current Millstone Lane, Horsefair Street, Gallowtree Gate, Church Gate, Sanvey Gate and Soar Lane, with the western wall possibly running along the river Soar (there is some doubt as to whether the western wall existed). The city centre was the High Cross, at the junction of the current High Street and Highcross Street (in mediaeval times, High Street ran between the north and south gates along the line of the current Highcross Street, while the current High Street was called Swinesmarket).  [[Leicester Cathedral]] and the [[Leicester Guildhall|Guildhall]] occupy this old area of town.

[[Leicester Castle]] lay on the south-western corner of the walls, and the Newarke was a separate walled area nearby. The Newarke Gateway (now known as the Magazine) is the only medieval gateway remaining. A small section of the town wall can be seen in the churchyard of [[St Mary de Castro (Leicester)|St Mary de Castro]]. The town's main gates were sold and demolished in the late 18th century, being an impediment to the flow of traffic (the city's hay market was outside the walls for this reason, the main market being situated within the south-east corner of the walls).

With increasing development, particularly in the 19th century, the focal point moved eastwards, with the [[Clock Tower (Leicester)|Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]] roundabout seeing the five-way junction of the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|London to Manchester]], [[A47 road (Great Britain)|Birmingham to Yarmouth]] and [[A46 road (Great Britain)|Fosse Way]] roads. This was influenced by the replacement of the [[A5199 road|Welford Road]] (now the A5199) by the [[Market Harborough]] road (the Harborough Turnpike, now the [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6]]), as the main route to London, because the Welford Road terminated in the tiny streets of the old town, and was therefore a hindrance for vehicles, while the London Road went past the East Gates of the city.

Meanwhile, the civic centre moved southwards, with the Corporation of Leicester moving to a new [[Leicester Town Hall|town hall]] building in 1876 in the Market Street area, facing onto a new Town Hall Square, and just outside the walled town. Between these areas is the modern market, based to the south-west of the [[Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]] area, which features the permanent outdoor covered [[Leicester Market]] (the largest in Europe), alongside an indoor market building selling fish, dairy produce, meat, etc., and the old Cornmarket building. Much of this old area of town is now in various [[conservation area]]s.

Outside of the ringroad, but close by, are the main campus of [[De Montfort University]], [[Leicester Royal Infirmary]], the [[Leicester City Football Club]]'s [[King Power Stadium]], the [[Leicester Tigers]]' [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] stadium and [[Leicester (HM Prison)|the prison]].  [[Leicester railway station]] is just on the outer side of the ringroad, on the A6. The [[University of Leicester]] is further away to the south-east, linked by the pedestrian-only path [[New Walk]]. When this was laid out in 1785, on the route of an ancient footpath, it passed through open land, becoming the route to the then Leicester Racecourse which later became [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] but it soon saw development of large private houses on both sides of it. It is now largely offices, although the [[New Walk Museum]] makes a strong impact.

The area inside the ringroad has two large shopping malls – [[Highcross Leicester]] (first opened as The Shires on the northern side of High Street and opening in 1991 with a large extension opened on 4 September 2008), and the [[Haymarket Shopping Centre]] (opened in 1974, on the site of the old hay market), both facing onto the [[Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]] area. On the opposite side of Humberstone Gate to the Haymarket is a new building, with no communal space, occupied by a variety of retailers, that incorporates the famous [[Lewis's]] tower from the previous [[department store]] on the site.

[[File:Granby Street, Leicester - geograph.org.uk - 469906.jpg|thumb|Granby Street.]]

Major chain stores can also be found on the pedestrianised Gallowtree Gate, running south-east from the clock tower, and which continues to the railway station as Granby Street. To the south of the Shires and west of Gallowtree Gate is an area known as ''The Lanes'' consisting mostly of small independent shops. This area's centrepiece is the St Martin's Square development (dating from the 1980s), and also features various smaller arcades, the ''Odeon Arcade'', the ''Royal Arcade'' and the ''Malcolm Arcade''. Of particular interest is the recently renovated [[Silver Arcade]], dating from 1899. Further south than this is the market, and then the civic centre (as mentioned above), which also features the main lending and reference libraries, and a number of shops, both chain and independent.

High Street, Eastgates, Cheapside, Gallowtree Gate and Humberstone Gate west of Charles Street are fully pedestrianised but bicycling is permitted. Private cars (but not buses and taxis) are forbidden at certain times from a larger area. Plans exist to fully pedestrianise the Haymarket and Churchgate also which will involve routing buses via Mansfield Street. [https://archive.is/20121223163438/http://www.leicester.gov.uk/your-council--services/regeneration--culture/environmentdevelopment/consultations/streets-spaces/pedestrianzone-]

The area around the junction of Humberstone Gate and the ring-road is the site of two [[strip mall]]s – the larger of which is on the south-east side of the roundabout and called 'St George's Retail Park', the smaller being on the south-west side.

==Transport==
{{update section|date=July 2017}}

The main bus companies serving the city centre are [[Arriva Fox County]], [[Centrebus]], [[First Leicester]] and Roberts Coaches. There are two main bus stations; the larger, St Margaret's Bus Station, is on Gravel Street to the north of the centre and the smaller, Haymarket Bus Station, is on Charles Street. A number of bus services terminate at on-street stops within the city. Regional and national coaches depart from St Margaret's Bus Station which was opened on 3 May 1985 and had a major refurbishment completed in March 2007.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}. Haymarket bus station which lies next to and serves as a transport hub for [[Haymarket Shopping Centre]] was developed at a proposed cost of £2m in mid-1994, coinciding with a major refurbishment of the adjacent [[Haymarket Shopping Centre]]  complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=12 May 1994|title=Work to Start on 2m Bus Station|journal=The Mail|pages=7|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/13462353@N05/4224505487/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is undergoing a major upgrade and expansion which started in September 2014.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In January 2015 Haymarket Bus Station was closed to allow contractors to start work on building the new bus station, this meant that buses using the current bus station were relocated to stops elsewhere in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leicester.gov.uk/transport-and-streets/travelling-by-bus/haymarket-bus-station-redevelopment/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516192005/http://www.leicester.gov.uk/transport-and-streets/travelling-by-bus/haymarket-bus-station-redevelopment |archivedate=16 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new bus station could be built in the city to replace both St Margaret's and Haymarket Bus Stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://beta.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/news/163-67m-bus-station-Leicester-help-city-centre-thrive/article-1528110-detail/article.html|title=£67m bus station in Leicester 'will help city centre thrive'|publisher=Leicester Murcury|date=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2016}}

[[Leicester railway station|Leicester London Road]] is now the only railway station in the city centre, after the closure of [[Leicester Belgrave Road railway station|Leicester Belgrave Road]] and [[Leicester Central railway station|Leicester Central]] in the 1960s.

There are more than 8,500 off-street car parking spaces available in four distinct parking zones around the city centre. These are complemented by some 1,500 park and ride spaces at hubs around the city. [http://www.leicester.gov.uk/your-council-services/transport-traffic/traffic-management/parking-homepage/city-centre-parking/]

Leicester City used to have a tram network: firstly horse-drawn under Leicester Tramways Company from 1874 then it was taken over by [[Leicester Corporation Tramways]] in 1901 who ran electric trams from 1904 until they ceased operation on 9 November 1949 to be replaced with bus services; a modern light rail network or tram system still a reserved option for the council's planning team.

==Facilities==
Leicester is home to a variety of theatres, such as the [[Curve]], the (currently mothballed) [[Haymarket Theatre]], [[Little Theatre (Leicester)|Little Theatre]] and [[Sue Townsend Theatre]] (formerly [[Phoenix Arts Centre|Phoenix Arts]]) and there is a small pub theatre called "The Theatre Upstairs" at The Western pub, 70 Western Road, Leicester.
In the City centre there is the [[Phoenix Square Digital Arts Centre]], Midland Street, Leicester (which has a regular programme of art-house and world cinema), a Cinema De Lux, part of Highcross Leicester, and an [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]] at Freemen's Common, some way to the south. The old Odeon building in Rutland Street was refurbished and opened in 2005 as the [[Leicester Athena]], a conferencing and banqueting venue. The former ABC Cinema on Belgrave Gate has now been demolished and is currently being used as a car park, the site will be turned into a new shopping area with shops, casino, theatre and a new link road which will provide access to the new Highcross Leicester and St. Margaret's bus station.

Since the closure of [[St Margaret's baths]], there is no municipal swimming pool in the city centre. Its replacement, the [[Braunstone Leisure Centre]], is some miles away in [[Braunstone Park &amp; Rowley Fields|Braunstone]].

The area in the inside of the ring-road is nearly entirely built up, with only [[Nelson Mandela Park]] (at the extreme south, in [[Southfields, Leicestershire|Southfields]]), [[Museum Square]] (off [[New Walk]]) and Town Hall Square being considerable open spaces. Outside the ring road are [[Castle Gardens, Leicester|Castle Gardens]] (by [[Leicester Castle]]), [[De Montfort Square]] (off [[New Walk]]), [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]], [[Aylestone Meadows]], [[Western Park, Leicester|Western Park]] and [[Abbey Park, Leicester|Abbey Park]].

Musical venues in the city are somewhat limited since the closure in 1998 then the demolition of the [[Granby Halls]] in 2001– the largest two venues, [[De Montfort Hall]] (mentioned above) and [[University of Leicester]]'s students union (now an O2 academy), are both in [[Southfields, Leicestershire|Southfields]], some way from the city centre, whose main venues include the pub-sized ''The Musician'', ''Firebug'', and ''The Shed''.

Several old [[Church of England|Anglican]] churches are based in or around the city centre. St Martin's is now [[Leicester Cathedral]]. The other four historic parishes were St Margaret's, St Mary de Castro, All Saints', and St Nicholas'. The first Anglican Church to be built in the city after the medieval period was St George's – contrary to popular belief, this is not empty and disused but is in fact a Serbian Orthodox Church, used by the Serbian Orthodox people as a place of worship, regularly.
There is a large Roman Catholic church and Priory named [[Holy Cross Church, Leicester|Holy Cross]] on [[New Walk]]/Wellington Street.
The city centre is covered by an extensive system of [[Closed circuit television|CCTV]] cameras, supplemented by CCTV vans. Now that the main police station on Charles Street has closed, City Centre policing is based in a building off Belgrave Gate called Mansfield House.

==Regeneration==
[[Highcross Leicester]] opened on 4 September 2008 and has several flagship stores, including a [[John Lewis Partnership|John Lewis]], a multiplex cinema, apartments, 2 public squares and [[al fresco dining]] and is the start of many regeneration projects in Leicester that have started to come to fruition.

To the east of Charles Street the city centre is dominated by disused factories and warehouses (which also have some presence in the other outer areas of the city centre). Conversion of these to residential accommodation is ongoing, particularly in the area east of Charles Street and around Humberstone Gate, which has been dubbed 'St George's' by the council, and was made a conservation area in 1989.

St George's South has been designated Leicester's new cultural quarter, and is already the site of the [http://www.lcbdepot.co.uk/ Leicester Creative Business Depot](built on the old [[First Leicester|Leicester City Bus]] depot and keeping the initials) and the Athena. The LCB Depot opened in July 2004, and by the time of its first birthday had let 37 of 55 units, with talk starting of finding an additional site. [https://archive.is/20070928101055/http://www.lsep.co.uk/depotcelebratesasuccessfulyear.html]

Opposite the [[Leicester Athena|Athena]], a new flagship £60 million [[Curve Theatre, Leicester]], designed by [[Rafael Vinoly]] Architects, started construction in 2005, on a site that has been long-disused. It is planned to be ready for handover 2007 to the Haymarket company, who will then vacate their existing building ([[Haymarket Theatre (Leicester)|Haymarket Theatre]]). The first productions would be in 2008. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2005/06/22/performing_arts_centre_intro_feature.shtml] The centre is being funded by the various sources including the City Council, the [[Arts Council]], the [[European Regional Development Fund]] and the [[East Midlands Development Agency]]. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2004/07/23/tanda_pacc_money_feature.shtml]

Further to the south of St George's are plans to create a new business area, near the railway station, including re-use of the old police station, and renovation of the [[Leicester Mercury]] building. [http://www.leicesterregeneration.co.uk/project_business.html]

St George's North has been proposed for a residential community by the Leicester Regeneration Company. [http://www.leicesterregeneration.co.uk/project_residential.html] Development has also started on waterfront properties, with a plan to re-use the [[Leicester Central railway station|Great Central station]] site. [http://www.leicesterregeneration.co.uk/project_waterfront.html]

Since the pedestrianisation of the High Street in Leicester city centre many of the independent retail shops have moved into this regenerated area. Some of Leicester's longest running independent shops can now be found in this area. However, the recent economic downturn and the opening of the Highcross Centre have led to a higher than expected number of closures and an increase in Charity outlets. There are current plans to develop a pedestrianised square, 'over-writing' a spend of almost £2m on parking in the square a few years ago.

==Listed buildings==
[[File:Leicester Town Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The town hall.]]
There are a few Grade I [[listed building]]s.
* [[Abbey Park, Leicestershire|Abbey Park]] ruins and wall, remains of Cavendish House
* [[Jewry Wall]]
* [[Leicester Castle|Castle]], Turret Gateway, Castle Hall, and [[St Mary de Castro (Leicester)|St Mary de Castro]]
* [[Leicester Guildhall|The Guildhall]]
* [[The City Rooms (Leicester)|The City Rooms]] on Hotel Street
* The Newarke [[Magazine Gateway]]
* [[St Margaret's Church, Leicester|St Margaret's]] Church
* [[St Nicholas' Church, Leicester|St Nicholas']] Church
* The [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]] war memorial

A few of these are also [[scheduled monument]]s. There are many Grade II [[listed building]]s, including
* The Turkey Cafe, Granby Street
* the Charles Street police building
* the [[Clock Tower (Leicester)|Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower]]
* [[Leicester Cathedral|St Martin's Cathedral]] (II star)
* [[31 Granby Street]] (HSBC bank)

* [[All Saints Church, Leicester (Leicester)|All Saints Church, Leicester]] is Grade B.

==Skyscrapers==
[[File:The 'Twin Towers' of Humberstone Gate - geograph.org.uk - 175465.jpg|thumb|right|Leicester International Hotel, with the Cardinal Telephone Exchange tower on the left.]]
During the 1960s and 1970s, many large concrete [[tower blocks]] were built in and around the city centre for residential and office purposes, like many other cities across the UK. Cardinal Telephone Exchange and St Georges Tower, at 84 metres and 82 metres high respectively, are the two tallest skyscrapers in the whole [[East Midlands]] region. Many housing association blocks, averaging 55 metres tall with 20 storeys, were also erected in various Council estates – four in [[Highfields, Leicester|Highfields]], two in [[St Matthew's, Leicester|St Matthews]] and a further two in [[Evington|Rowlatts Hill]].

However, in later years, most of Leicester's office towers became disused and abandoned, with the 58 metres tall Thames Tower never achieving more than 50% occupancy since it was completed. Simultaneously, the residential towers became negatively associated with crime and social deprivation. The four residential blocks in St Matthews and Rowlatts Hill were vacated and demolished by [[Leicester City Council]] in 2001.

Thames Tower and St Georges Tower were both refurbished and reclad in 2009 by private developers, for use as residential apartments and hotels. St Georges Tower was painted royal blue, turning it into a very distinctive local landmark, albeit one that attracted mass controversy due to its perceived ugliness and difference from the original architect's renders for the building's renovation.

The 55-metre-tall New Walk Centre has been occupied by the City Council since the 1970s, while the Cardinal Telephone Exchange is occupied by [[British Telecom]]. The International Hotel has been an un-maintained eyesore for many years, and requires demolition or serious maintenance work as it is having a real impact on the image and success of the adjacent 'Cultural Quarter'.

==LE1 Postal district==
The [[postal district]] LE1 is close to the area covered inside ring-road, but is somewhat larger. The only area inside the ring-road but not part of LE1 is the section of Humberstone Road inside the ring-road.

LE1 includes the [[St Matthew's, Leicester|St Matthew's]] estate, and extends as far north as the [[River Soar]], thus including [[Abbey Park (Leicester)|Abbey Park]]. Where the [[A50 road|A50]] crosses the Soar, the boundary runs south, including [[Leicester Central railway station|Great Central Street]] in LE1, but not the waterfront. It then broadly follows the path of the ring-road until it reaches Waterloo Way, where the border diverges substantially, to include the swathe of land between London Road, Victoria Park Road and Waterloo Way in the LE1 postcode, including the [[University of Leicester]], the [[De Montfort Hall]], [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College]], [[Regent College, Leicester|Regent College]], the [[Welford Road cemetery]], and [[Victoria Park, Leicester|Victoria Park]]. However, [[Leicester railway station|London Road station]] remains outside LE1.

The boundary then includes several streets west of the railway line but east of the ring-road as part of LE1, before meeting up with the roundabout again and then going inwards to exclude Humberstone Road from LE1 (as above).

==Nearby places==
To the west, the city centre borders the river, on the other side of this is the [[West End of Leicester]]. To the south-east it borders [[Highfields, Leicester|Highfields]], to the east, [[St Matthew's, Leicester|St Matthew's]], and to the north-east, [[Belgrave, Leicestershire|Belgrave]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">[[Image:Leipzig Neue Messe.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The ''Leipziger Messe'' Fairgrounds, home of the Book Fair]]
The '''Leipzig Book Fair''' ({{lang-de|Leipziger Buchmesse}}) is the second largest book fair in [[Germany]] after the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]]. The fair takes place annually over four days at the [[Leipzig Trade Fair]]ground in the northern part of [[Leipzig]], [[Saxony]].  It is the first large trade meeting of the year and as such it plays an important role in the market and is often where new publications are first presented.

==History==
The Leipzig Book Fair became the largest book fair in Germany in 1632 when it topped the fair in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in the number of books presented. It remained on top until 1945 when Leipzig became part of socialist [[East Germany]] and Frankfurt, in [[West Germany]] surpassed it to regain the number one spot. During the [[East Germany|East German]] era the fair remained an important meeting place for book lovers and sellers from both East and West Germany.  After [[German Reunification]], the fair moved from the Trade Fair House on the main market square to a new location removed from the city center.  After the move, the fair experienced a renaissance and continues to grow today.

==Profile==
[[File:Leipziger Buchmesse 2015.jpg|thumb|right|The Leipzig Book Fair in 2015]]
Today, the fair aims to be for the public, above all, and to emphasize the relationship between the authors and the fair's visitors.  The new orientation is necessary to compete with Frankfurt Book Fair, which sees a much larger volume of industry trading.  During the four-day fair Leipzig hosts over 1,800 events both in various locations throughout the city and at the fairgrounds, making it one of the largest events of its kind in [[Europe]].  The Leipzig Fair was one of the first to recognize the growing market for [[audiobook]]s and incorporate this trend into its concept.

==Awards==
The fair is the site of the presentation of several important German book prizes: The [[Leipzig Book Fair Prize]] (2002-2004 the German Book Prize), and the '''Leipzig Book Prize for European Understanding'''.  The fair also sees the nominations for the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]]

==Numbers==
In 2010 the fair experienced record attendance, registering 156,000 visitors and 2071 publishers from 39 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5376805,00.html Leipziger Buchmesse endet mit Besucherrekord ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 there were 163,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leipziger-messe.de/LeMMon/buch_web_eng.nsf page of Leipzig Book Fair] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418075202/http://www.leipziger-messe.de/LeMMon/buch_web_eng.nsf |date=2012-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Marketing research mix''' (or the "MR Mix") was created in 2004 and published in 2007 (Bradley - see references). It was designed as a framework to assist researchers to design or evaluate marketing research studies.  The name was deliberately chosen to be similar to the [[Marketing mix|Marketing Mix]] - it also has four Ps. Unlike the marketing mix these elements are sequential and they match the main phases that need to be followed. These four Ps are: Purpose; Population; Procedure and Publication.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the research is the reason why it is being done. The word “purpose” is useful because it has a wide coverage. It can be specifically defined or it can be loosely explained. The wide term also embraces studies to gather marketing intelligence, where the manager’s role is to scan the environment for useful data, and there may be no specific objective.

Many marketers avoid the term hypothesis entirely and tend to use the words “research objective” or “aim”. The word hypothesis (plural, hypotheses) is quite different from the terms mentioned above. It is an essential starting point for quantitative researchers, but takes a lesser role for qualitative researchers.  The term is deeply rooted in the history of scientific thought. In statistics we expend much time and energy to generate hypotheses, to test hypotheses, and to reject them.  Some people argue that we should only test one hypothesis; others say we should test several. In hypothesis testing we create a statement, which may be true or false, this statement is a "proposition" - we propose that something may be the case.   If it is right then we accept it.  If it is not right, if it is "wrong" then we reject it.

The first step is to formulate the null-hypothesis, abbreviated to Ho.   This is usually intended to be rejected.   Another carefully constructed hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis or the H1; this is actually called the 'research hypothesis'.  After these have been articulated the researcher can design a research programme to test the hypotheses. When the results are received, they are examined against the prediction of the null hypothesis. The basic idea is to use this possible explanation and then look for data to support the explanation (or not).  It is best to spend as much time as possible on the hypothesis: it is the research question, and it determines how the study is carried out.  It determines the design because it defines the problem.

The subject of hypothesis testing has been debated heavily for many years and there are suggestions that misuse of null hypothesis significance testing is widespread and damaging (Finch et al. 2001), at least in psychological research. It is relevant to cite an article on hypothesis testing in marketing research by Lawrence (1982) who tells us: "Practical survey researchers (realise) that, in many cases, no adequate theory exists for setting up hypotheses in advance".  The article continues:  "Drawing one-off hypotheses out of the air offers no solution to the problem.  Researchers will be guided by their own ideas, experiences, hunches".

== Population ==
When considering any market sector we need to ask “Who is involved in this marketplace?” Who are the players? Who should be the centre of the investigation and where are those subjects? This area considers the target audience, customer or player; the users or non-users. Who will become the respondent or informant? Should we contact all players or just some of them? Should we carry out a census or a sample: should respondents be selected by probability or non-probability methods? An important concept for primary research is sampling. We choose to interview or observe people who we think will give us the information that will solve our problems. So in choosing our research method, we need to consider whom we select and how we select.  This applies to qualitative research, with only a few people, and quantitative research with many people. Much emphasis in marketing research is on the end user, but “experts” can bridge the gap between primary and secondary data.  An expert may be someone who has been in the business for many years. This part of the MR Mix involves identifying relevant sampling frames.

== Procedure ==
When considering the procedure the key question is “How should the study be conducted?” Will it be qualitative or quantitative? This area also covers the question of timing: when will the fieldwork take place?

The best research starts by looking at secondary data, this information already exists. The two basic sources: internal (within an organisation) and external, published by someone outside have become easier to access in recent years. Information Technology, with Intranets and the Internet, has improved our ability to find such data. If secondary data doesn’t solve the problem then original data (primary data) is sought. It is useful to think of different primary methods in these terms: we can ask people what they are doing; we can watch them or detect what they have done by counting or we can manipulate some variables to discover the effect. This creates three categories: questioning; observation and experimentation.

Primary data collection techniques can be subdivided into: interviewer-administered or respondent-administered; direct or indirect; personal or impersonal. Processing data, analysis and interpretation are essential parts of the procedure.  Detailed examination of the appropriate tools used in the data collection needs to take place.

== Publication ==
Under the heading of “Publication” the key questions are: Who is the audience for the results? What should be communicated? When and how should they be communicated? Research is of no use if findings are kept within the research team; similarly commercially sensitive information will have no competitive advantage if placed in the public domain. Choices need to be made on how publication takes place. Will a written report be created? Will tabulations be provided? Will a personal presentation take place? Who should be allowed sight of the results?

There are many different readers of research reports and these audiences all have very different expectations. Reporting must be personalised, writing and presentation style must be customised and adapted to the user. At one extreme there is the general public. There are many reasons why research is reported to the “mass consumer”. It may be a government report that has been commissioned to be in the public interest: concerning health, welfare, transport and so on. It may be a consumer report: [[Consumer Watchdog|consumer watchdog]] reports are of great interest to the man on the street, so we find the Which? Magazine and similar bodies have enabled the layman appreciate survey findings. Editors of periodicals regularly commission research for editorial reasons, so the results may become part of an article for mass consumption. The research agency may report directly to the public on web pages, by email or by post, this is because it is now common to offer a short summary report to a respondent as a gesture of goodwill, an incentive, a thank you for co-operating in the research. Research findings may appear as part of a promotional campaign, appealing to the consumer’s need to know that indeed this is a best seller (“nine out of ten cat-owners prefer…”).

Then there are smaller audiences such as managers who are anxious to receive a report in order to make instant decisions. Additionally there are managers who will benefit from the information much later when the report is consulted as secondary data in the future.

Based on Düsseldorf's long history of trade fairs, the Trade Fair Organisation (Messe) was founded in 1947 as Nordwestdeutsche Ausstellungsgesellschaft mbH (NOWEA), and is now Messe Düsseldorf [[GmbH]] (German form of Ltd.). In 1971, the company moved to the newly built exhibition centre in [[Stockum]], next to the [[Düsseldorf Airport]]. In 1993, it hosted the finals of the [[1993 Davis Cup|Davis Cup]] in one its halls.

In reviewing ''The Cynical Americans'', ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'' questioned "the nature of the evidentiary framework and the absence of logitudinal trends" presented, but noted that that concern did not weaken "the authors' premise of historical cycles or their very useful chapters on mechanisms to reduce worker cynicism".&lt;ref name=favley/&gt; ''Choice'' recommended ''Building the Competitive Workforce'', for which Mirvis provided the opening and closing chapters, for "advanced undergraduate through professional collections".&lt;ref name=favley2&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews: Building the competitive workforce: investing in human capital for corporate success|url=https://library.villanova.edu/Find/Record/397492|website=Favley Memorial Library|publisher=Villanova University|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They described ''Beyond Good Company'' as "thoroughly researched", and recommended it highly.&lt;ref name=favley3/&gt;

[[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]], originator of the [[triple bottom line]], described the authors of ''Beyond Good Company'' as "a supergroup in their field".&lt;ref name=bokus&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond Good Company|url=http://www.bokus.com/bok/9781403984838/beyond-good-company/|publisher=Bokus|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polymer solution casting''' is a [[manufacturing process]] used to make flexible plastic components which are typically in the shape of a single or multi-lumen tube commonly utilized in the medical device industry.  This manufacturing technology is unique in that the process does not require conventional [[extrusion]] or [[injection molding]] technologies, yet it readily incorporates components and features traditionally produced by these processes.

The polymer solution casting process utilizes a [[mandrel]], or inner diameter mold, that is immersed in a tank of polymer solution or liquid plastic that has been specifically engineered for the process.  Due to a combination of thermal and frictional properties, the polymer solution then forms a thin film around the mold.&lt;ref name=thinfilm&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2Fb107336 Solvent cast technology - a versatile tool for thin film production]. springer.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mold is then extracted from the tank in a precisely controlled manner, followed by a curing or drying process.  Once the first layer of thin film is appropriately solidified, secondary features can be added to the product such as braided or coiled wire, laser-cut hypotubes or engineered metal reinforcements to prevent kinking, or imaging targets specific to the intended medical application.  Multiple casting steps can then be repeated to encapsulate the reinforcements, build up wall thickness, add additional lumens and optimize column strength. The part is then removed from the mold after it is cured or solidified. 
 
The most notable attribute of this thin-film process technology is the ability to alternate the material properties (i.e. strength, [[durometer]], color, [[lubricity]]) amongst the individual layers or even down the length of the part, resulting in a feature-rich single-piece construction. This process also allows other components to be incorporated into the structure of the part during the layering processes, such as injection molded components and extruded tubes made of [[High Performance Polymers|high performance polymers]] such as [[PTFE]], [[Pebax|PEBAX]], and [[polyimide]].

Another notable advantage of polymer solution casting technology is that the total manufacturing cost for both prototyping and production volumes are frequently less than the conventional technologies. This cost benefit results from the use of inexpensive molds coupled with the scalability and adaptability of the manufacturing line.  As a result, new products and processes are readily developed and implemented, facilitating cost-effective creation of very feature rich and complex [[catheters]].
Since the 1990s, Avalon Laboratories and Piper Plastics Corp. have aggressively pioneered polymer solution casting technology, focusing on complex medical devices.  The history of these technologies dates back to many highly regarded names in the medical industry including [[Medtronic]], BioMedicus, Bard, [[Terumo]], Research Medical Inc., Shiley, Polaris Plastics, and Caplugs.

== Materials ==
Polymer solution casting technology can be deployed utilizing a host of different polymer materials depending on the application and design inputs, including those used in Class I, II and III medical devices.&lt;ref name=polymers&gt;[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4613-1809-5 Polymers in Medicine II]. springer.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest and most commonly found materials were polyvinyl chlorides ([[PVC]]) due to their advantages in cost, physical properties and clarity.  Over the past twenty years, there has been scrutiny of the long term health effects of the PVC base materials relating to the plasticizers and stabilizers which are needed to ensure adequate shelf life of sterilized product. More recently, newly engineered formulations have eliminated these biocompatibility concerns while extending the shelf life, and PVC has re-emerged as a preferred polymer for use in interventional and surgical applications.

[[Polyurethane]] has emerged as another polymer that meets the medical device market's demands for thinner wall sections, longer lengths and extended blood exposure.  The high strength and range of properties make these materials an excellent choice for soft [[elastomer]] applications.  Among the first commercial polyurethane medical products were non-allergenic [[medical gloves]], developed as a response to latex allergies.  These advanced polymers offer a full range of physical properties, improved biocompatibility, and lubricous properties by way of custom formulations and coatings.

Another material choice for polymer solution casting is silicone urethane copolymers, which are among the most biocompatible synthetic materials. This class of medical grade material was developed for long-term implantable device applications and offers the physical characteristics of high elongation, low [[modulus of elasticity]], excellent recovery, and resistance to chemicals, oil, and [[UV light]].

While there exists a number of materials to choose from while deploying polymer solution casting technology, the material science work continues in the areas of wall thickness, strength, lubricity, biocompatibility and clarity as well as interactions of the liquid polymers with extruded and injection molded components.

Retrieved 16 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==

===Early career===

Ron Brierley began his career as the publisher of a horse racing tip sheet. He followed this with an investment analysis newsletter "Stocks and Shares"  which he founded in 1956 at age 19.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deep Value: Why Activist Investors and other Contrarians Battle for control of Losing Corporations|last = Carlisle|first = Tobias|publisher = Wiley|year = 2014|isbn = 1118747968|location = USA|pages = Chapter 7 (Kindle Edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sought to identify undervalued special situations and suggest what could be done with the companies.

His first bid via R.A.Brierley Investments Ltd was for the Otago Farmers Co-Operative Association in July 1961, which had become attractive as a target due to its cheapness, its unusual legal structure and the company being moved to an unofficial NZX bourse due to failing to comply with exchange listing requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While Brierley's offer was rejected, the company was forced into a change in policy and the market price of the company leapt upwards.

Other targets of Sir Ron Brierley's activist investment style in the 1960s and 1970s included the Southern Cross Building Society, the Finance Corporation of New Zealand, Citizens and Graziers and the Southern Farmers Co-operative Ltd in Australia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of these companies shares similar traits in that they were largely family controlled, inefficient, with lazy balance sheets, complacent management and surplus assets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Brierley's view was that his holding company, Brierley Investments Ltd, was "a monitoring organisation that continually evaluated the performance of various companies and acted as a catalyst to promote the most effective ownership of a company."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Man behind the Corporate Legend|last = Van Dongen|first = Yvonne|publisher = Penguin Books (NZL)|year = 1990|isbn = 0670831247|location = New Zealand|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post BIL===
On 29 March 1990 Brierley was appointed chairman of investment holding company [[Guinness Mahon|Guinness Peat Group]] (GPG). As chairman Brierley publicly attacked and defeated the plan to merge the [[London Stock Exchange]] with [[Deutsche Börse]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exchange merger 'bad for investors'|first=Simon|last=English|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2000/08/11/cnlse11.xml|date=2001-03-21|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Sir Ron Brierley, through his new company, Mercantile Investments, launched a hostile takeover of Australian shipping company Richfield International.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brierley's vehicle targets shipping firm|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/75508649/corporate-investor-ron-brierleys-new-vehicle-targets-shipping-firm-richfield|website = Stuff|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Motta recorded [[calypso (music)|calypso]] and [[mento]] style albums. He recorded on [[78 rpm]] records.

Talent from [[Vere Johns]] competitions was scouted by producers such as [[Clement "Coxsone" Dodd]] and [[Arthur "Duke" Reid]]. The groups recorded at Motta's studio. The records they cut would then be played on their [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]].&lt;ref name="Cooke2"&gt;Cooke, Mel (2010), "[http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100302/ent/ent2.html Lincoln traces Ambassador music role to England]", ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 2 March 2010, retrieved 2010-05-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motta's electronics business became a subsidiary of Musson before it relaunched with an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on the [[Jamaica Stock Exchange]] in 2018. It owns and manages the 58 HWT technology park property. The IPO raised $4 billion [[Jamaican dollar]]s for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loopjamaica.com/content/stanley-motta-lists-jse-after-4-billion-ipo-58-hwt|title=Stanley Motta lists on the JSE after $4 billion IPO on 58 HWT|website=www.loopjamaica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Fly (Rupert Lyon) recorded with Motta in 1952. Early band members who recorded include [[Bertie King]] on clarinet and Mapletoft Poulle whose big band employed many early ska musicians and [[Alpha Boys School]] alumni. Other artists Motta recorded include  [[Count Lasher]], Monty Reynolds, tenor banjo player Eddie Brown of the Calypso Clippers, Alerth Bedasse of Chin's Calypso Sextet, Jellicoe Barker (Lord Jellicoe), Lord Composer, Lord Lebby, [[Lord Messam]], Lord Power and [[Lord Melody]].&lt;ref name="skabook" /&gt; [[Roland Alphonso]], [[Derrick Harriott]], [[Lord Messam &amp; His Calypsonians]], [[Lord Tanamo]], Claude Sang Jr. and his brother [[Herman Sang]] of [[The Jiving Juniors]] and [[Theophilus Beckford]] also worked with Motta. [[Count Lasher]] released his debut album with Motta.

'''''Traders''''' is a [[business simulation game]] with a [[science fiction]] setting. It was created by [[André Wüthrich]] and published by Merit software in 1991. ''Traders'' as being inspired by ''[[M.U.L.E.]]'' was released for [[MS-DOS]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] home computers. Up to four players control characters, aliens known as Plubbers, make the most money in a commercial competition. Players grow fields, sell products, and raid other players.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The '''Unfair Commercial Practices Directive''' 2005/29/EC&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the European Union, L149/22 – L149/39, 11 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; regulates [[unfair business practices]] in [[EU law]], as part of [[European consumer law]]. It requires corresponding laws to be passed that incorporate it into each member state's legal system.

The Directive is concerned mainly with the "substantive" law (meaning in this context the standards of behaviour required of traders). To some extent it leaves to member states the choice of appropriate domestic enforcement procedures and penalties for non-compliance (Articles 11 to 13 of the Directive).

==Contents==
===Recitals===
The recitals state the objective of the Directive to reduce barriers to free trade in the EU while simultaneously ensuring a high level of consumer protection. At issue was the fact that the consumer protection laws are different among the various member states (see Article 1 of the Directive and the recitals to it). The Directive is supposed to reduce these differences while establishing a required minimum level of consumer protection across all member states. This is expected to benefit both business and consumers, as businesses receive a more standardised legal system under which to operate and consumers receive a sufficient and standardised level of protection, regardless of where they choose to make purchases.

The Directive is designed to achieve what is called "maximum harmonisation" of business-to-consumer fair trade.  The idea of "maximum harmonisation" is that it requires [[List of European Union member states|member states]] of the European Union to apply the standards set out in European legislation and prohibits those states from applying lower or higher standards. In other words, the Directive tells European countries to give consumers no more and no less than the level of protection set out in the Directive. That maximum harmonisation is not yet in force.

===Chapter 1===
The Directive starts with a general prohibition on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices (Articles 3(1) and 5(1)) and then goes into progressively greater detail defining what that means.

Article 3(2) states the Directive is expressly "without prejudice to contract law and, in particular, to the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract" (see also the 9th recital to the Directive). It does not seek to harmonise [[unfair competition]] law regulating "...commercial practices which, although not harming consumers, may hurt competitors and business customers" (8th recital to the Directive).

===Chapter 2===
Article 5(1) says that "unfair commercial practices" are prohibited, and under article 5(2)(a) these are practices that are "contrary to the requirements of professional diligence" (see further Article 2(h)) and that are likely to materially distort the economic behaviour of the average consumer (Article 5(2)(b)). The effect of commercial practices on particular kinds of consumers, especially those who are unusually vulnerable, can replace the "average consumer" test if the practices are directed at those kinds of consumers or will foreseeably affect them (Articles 5(2)(b) and 5(3)). The Directive describes two major categories of unfair commercial practices:- those that are misleading (Articles 5(4)(a), 6 and 7) and those that are aggressive (Articles 5(4)(b), 8 and 9). Annex 1 to the Directive sets out a list of "commercial practices that are, in all circumstances, considered unfair" (a black-list of bad behaviour). These are divided into "misleading commercial practices" (23 examples) and "aggressive commercial practices" (8 examples).

On a literal reading of the Directive, misleading or aggressive commercial practices that would not affect the average consumer's economic behaviour, but would distort the economic behaviour of particular kinds of consumer, may be prohibited only by the general clause in Articles 5(1) to 5(3), and not by the specific clauses in Articles 6 to 9. This is because the latter provisions refer exclusively to the "average consumer" (although Article 9(c) also refers to the "exploitation of any specific misfortune or circumstance of such gravity as to impair the consumer's judgement, of which the trader is aware..."). However, it might be fairer to read Articles 5(2)(b) and 5(3) as supplanting the references to the "average consumer" in Articles 6 to 9 in appropriate cases. The UK Government's [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] published a consultation paper in December 2005, which suggested that that was indeed the intention. There is no clear basis in the text for the favoured interpretation, but the UK Government supports its interpretation with reference to the European Commission's Explanatory Memorandum. This could be important because depending on the answer to this question it may be easier or harder to pin down a breach of the Directive.

The rules referred to in the actual text of the Directive in relation to codes of conduct are quite limited (e.g. Article 6(2)(b), prohibiting non-compliance with codes of conduct in some circumstances, and Article 10). However, the 20th recital states: "It is appropriate to provide a role for codes of conduct ... In sectors where there are specific mandatory requirements ... these will also provide evidence as to the requirements of professional diligence in that sector. ... consumers' organisations could be informed and involved in the drafting of codes of conduct." Subscribers to a code of conduct drafted with the input of and endorsed by a major consumers' organisation could seek to argue during enforcement proceedings that compliance with the code of conduct is therefore evidence that they have not engaged in unfair commercial practices. Those charged with promoting and administering membership of codes of conduct will take note that Article 11(1) in effect contemplates the possibility of class-actions brought by consumer groups against code-owners where the code promotes non-compliance with legal requirements. Taken together, these provisions may be an incentive for those who administer and promote codes of conduct to consult with consumers' groups and take careful legal advice in relation to the drafting of such codes.

===Chapters 3 and 4===
Chapter 3 envisages a role for businesses in the industry to draft codes of conduct about practices among their competitors.

Chapter 4 requires that member states have, under article 11, "adequate and effective means exist to combat unfair commercial practices". This includes ensuring that consumer groups have standing to take representative legal action on behalf of the people whose interests they represent, or make complaints to the consumer authorities. Article 11(2) requires that public authorities exist (for instance, the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] or the [[Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit]]). Article 11(3) requires that they should be impartial in fulfilling their role of protecting consumers against unfair business practices.

==Implementation==
The Directive required the member states to pass laws by no later than 12 June 2007 incorporating it into their own internal [[law|national law]] by 12 December 2007. However, until at least 12 June 2013, Member States will continue to be able to apply more protective national rules diverging from European directives insofar as it is necessary and proportionate to do so (Article 3(5)), meaning that maximum harmonisation may not be complete before that date. There will be a major review of the operation of the Directive by 12 June 2011 (Article 18).

'''Wim Hof''' (born 20 April 1959), also known as '''The Iceman''', is a Dutch [[extreme sport|extreme athlete]] noted for his ability to withstand extreme cold, which he attributes to his Wim Hof Method (WHM) breathing techniques.&lt;ref name="Erik Hedegaard" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pepijnvanerp.nl/2016/01/wim-hof-method/|title=Wim Hof's Cold Trickery – Pepijn van Erp|website=www.pepijnvanerp.nl|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Angier, 7 March 2008, ABC News, [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4393377 Iceman on Everest: 'It Was Easy'], Accessed 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=FEHILY|first1=TOBY|title=What Doesn’t Kill Us, To Be a Machine: books on extreme measures|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/what-doesnt-kill-us-to-be-a-machine-books-on-extreme-measures/news-story/a41089eaf5fb3f83a7cfab476c23ae8c|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hof says that the WHM can treat or help alleviate symptoms of illnesses such as [[multiple sclerosis]], [[arthritis]], [[diabetes]], [[clinical depression]], [[anxiety]], [[bipolar disorder]], and [[cancer]].&lt;ref name="Erik Hedegaard" /&gt; 

Hof has set out to spread the potential health benefits of his breathing techniques, working with scientists around the world to prove that his techniques work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_dk/article/iceman Iceman] [[Vice Media]]&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] stated that by consciously [[Hyperventilation|hyperventilating]], Hof can increase his [[heart rate]], [[adrenaline]] levels, and blood alkalinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kox M, van Eijk LT, Zwaag J, van den Wildenberg J, GJ Sweep FC, van der Hoeven JG, Pickkers P |date=May 20, 2014 |title=Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=111 |issue=20 |pages=7379–7384 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1322174111 |pmc=4034215 |access-date=January 28, 2017 |pmid=24799686}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hof is the subject of ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestselling book ''What Doesn't Kill Us'', which tells the story of how the investigative journalist [[Scott Carney]] took an assignment to debunk the WHM but ended up learning Hof's techniques. 

== Early life ==
Hof was born in [[Sittard|Sittard, Limburg]], [[Netherlands]] as one of nine children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scottcarney.com/article/the-iceman-commeth/|title=The Iceman Cometh - scottcarney.com|newspaper=scottcarney.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 17 he felt a sudden urge to jump into the freezing cold water of the [[List_of_parks_in_Amsterdam#Beatrixpark|Beatrixpark]] canal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Np0jGp6442A Joe Rogan Experience #712 - Wim Hof] [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erik Hedegaard"&gt;''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/wim-hof-method-the-iceman-on-key-to-healthy-life-w510956 Wim Hof Says He Holds the Key to a Healthy Life – But Will Anyone Listen?] Erik Hedegaard, November 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Records ==
[[File:Wim Hof at Theater Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Hof at a 2015 event]]
Hof holds 26 [[world record]]s, including one for longest ice bath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hofoutdoor.nl/iceman Background information on Hof on hofoutdoor.nl], accessed 20 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he climbed to 7200m/23600 feet altitude at [[Mount Everest]] wearing nothing but shorts and shoes, but failed to reach the summit due to a recurring foot injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mounteverest.net/news.php?id=15688 Dutch Iceman to climb Everest in shorts: It's all about the inner fire], MountEverest.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''[[The Age]]'', 29 May 2007. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/everest-climber-falls-short/2007/05/28/1180205165881.html Everest climber falls short]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he broke his previous world record by staying immersed in ice for 1 hour, 13 minutes and 48 seconds at [[Guinness World Records]] 2008.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} The night before, he performed the feat on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]''.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

In February 2009 Hof reached the top of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] within two days wearing only shorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb2jJsi1Ykc|title=Iceman Wim Hof on Kilimanjaro Summit|date=14 February 2009|work=YouTube|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hof completed a [[marathon]] above the [[arctic circle]] in [[Finland]], in temperatures close to {{convert|-20|C|F}}. Dressed in nothing but shorts, Hof finished in 5 hours and 25 minutes. The challenge was filmed by Firecrackerfilms, who make productions for [[BBC]], [[Channel 4]] and [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpKXE2lm4t0|title=Daredevils: The Ice Man|date=18 September 2009|work=YouTube|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Hof again broke the ice endurance record by standing fully immersed in ice for 1 hour and 44 minutes in [[Tokyo, Japan]].&lt;ref name="AT5-2010"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/29805/iceman-wim-hof-breekt-wereldrecord-ijsstaan |title = 'Iceman' Wim Hof breekt wereldrecord ijsstaan |trans-title='Ice man' Wim Hof breaks world record for staying in ice water |language = Dutch |work = [[AT5|AT5 Nieuws]] |location = [[Amsterdam]] |date = 3 January 2010 |accessdate = 10 May 2012 |quote = ''Hij stond 1 uur en 44 minuten tot en met zijn nek in het ijs'' (He stood up to his neck in ice water for 1 hour and 44 minutes) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Hof broke the ice endurance record twice, in [[Inzell]] in February and in [[New York City]] in November, setting a new Guinness World Record of 1 hour, 52 minutes, and 42 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerfire.nl/en-home|title=Innerfire - Wim Hof, The Iceman - Innerfire|author=Innerfire|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Hof ran a full marathon in the [[Namib Desert]] without water, under the supervision of Dr. Thijs Eijsvogels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerfire.nl/wim-hof-blog|title=Wim Hof Blog|author=Innerfire|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breathing Method ==
There are many variations of the Wim Hof Method. The basic version consists of three phases as follows:

;Controlled hyperventilation: The first phase involves 30 cycles of breathing. Each cycle goes as follows: take a powerful breath in, fully filling the lungs. Breathe out by passively releasing the breath, but not actively exhaling. Repeat this cycle at a steady rapid pace thirty times. Hof says that this form of [[hyperventilation]] may lead to [[Paresthesia|tingling sensations]] or [[Lightheadedness|light-headedness]].
;Exhalation: After completion of the 30 cycles of controlled hyperventilation, take another deep breath in, and let it out completely. Hold the breath for as long as possible.
;Breath retention: When strong urges to breathe occur, take a full deep breath in. Hold the breath for around 15 - 20 seconds and let it go. The body may experience a normal head-rush sensation.

These three phases may be repeated for three consecutive rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icemanwimhof.com/wim-hof-exercises|title=Wim Hof exercises - Wim Hof, The Iceman - Innerfire|last=Innerfire|website=www.icemanwimhof.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Hof has six children, four of them with his first wife who committed suicide in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PowerfulJRE|title=Joe Rogan Experience #712 - Wim Hof|date=2015-10-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np0jGp6442A|accessdate=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, born in 2003 to his second wife. Also a son in 2017.&lt;ref name="Innerfire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innerfire.nl/the-iceman|title=Innerfire - Wim Hof, The Iceman - Innerfire|author=Innerfire|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hof feels that sadness over the loss of his first wife was formative in leading him to develop techniques to face low temperature environments.&lt;ref name="Innerfire" /&gt;

== Controversies ==
Wim Hof has been blamed by relatives of four men who separately drowned in 2015 and 2016 when practicing his breathing exercise. They died after suffering [[shallow water blackout]]s in swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gezondheid.eenvandaag.nl/tv-items/67565/_iceman_onder_vuur |title='Iceman' onder vuur |first1=Fannie |last1=Tijmstra |first2=Loes |last2=Bomers |date=10 June 2016 |publisher=''[[EenVandaag]]'' |language=Dutch |access-date=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parool.nl/binnenland/-iceman-oefening-eist-opnieuw-leven~a4332186 |title='Iceman'-oefening eist opnieuw leven |first1=Roelf Jan |last1=Duin |date=2 July 2016 |publisher=''[[Het Parool]]''|language=Dutch |access-date=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wim Hof advises to do the exercises in a safe manner and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wimhofmethod.com/pages/practice-the-method|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129181133/https://www.wimhofmethod.com/pages/practice-the-method|archivedate=29 November 2016|deadurl=no |title=Practice the Wim Hof Method|website=Wim Hof Method|date=  |author= |accessdate= 26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wunderlist is free; additional collaboration features are available in a paid version known as Wunderlist Pro (released April 2013). Wunderlist was created in 2011 by [[Berlin]]-based startup ''6Wunderkinder''. 

The company was [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft|acquired]] by [[Microsoft]] in June 2015, at which time the app had over 13 million users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Microsoft confirms acquisition of Wunderlist app maker 6Wunderkinder |first = Jordan |last = Novet |url = https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/02/microsoft-confirms-its-acquisition-of-wunderlist-app-maker-6wunderkinder/ |website= [[VentureBeat]] |date = June 2, 2015 |accessdate = June 3, 2015 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6Yzv9Geyp |archivedate = June 3, 2015 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Microsoft announced that Wunderlist will eventually be discontinued in favor of [[Microsoft To-Do|To-Do]], a new multi-platform app developed by the Wunderlist team that has direct integration with the company's [[Office 365]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/microsoft-to-shut-down-wunderlist-in-favor-of-its-new-app-to-do/|title=Microsoft to shut down Wunderlist in favor of its new app, To-Do|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=2017-04-19|website=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet| user=Wunderlist| number=940255103562510336| date=December 11, 2017| title=There were a number of fundamental areas we wanted to improve such as accessibility, compliance and being more stress-free.

== Features ==
Wunderlist allows users to create lists to manage their tasks on many devices, mobile as well as desktop. These lists can be shared with other Wunderlist users. Through the "Detail View," users can add due dates (including repeating due dates), reminders, assignees, subtasks, comments, files and notes to tasks. Tasks can also be organized with #hashtags. The user adds lists to categorize tasks, and can place these lists in folders to organize their structure. Using a feature known as "Mail to Wunderlist", users can send or forward emails to me@wunderlist.com to add tasks to their Wunderlist accounts. With the company's browser and sharing extension known as "Add to Wunderlist", content from the Web can be added to Wunderlist from Chrome, Firefox, Safari, iOS and Android.

With Wunderlist Pro, several additional features can be used, including unlimited assigning, unlimited file upload size, and unlimited number of subtasks (the free version of Wunderlist allows 25 subtasks per task). Additionally, Pro users can choose from an additional 10 backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderlist.com/pro/ | title=Wunderlist Pro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Wunderlist added an API so that people can create or modify Wunderlist tasks in other apps, and get alerts for Wunderlist tasks when they're in those apps.&lt;ref&gt;By Ingrid Lunden, TechCrunch. "[https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/13/to-do-app-wunderlist-debuts-an-api-early-integrations-of-slack-sunrise-hipchat-and-more/ To-Do App Wunderlist Debuts An API, Early Integrations Of Slack, Sunrise, HipChat And More]."

===Platforms===
Users can sign in and use Wunderlist in a web browser, with no download required. Wunderlist can also be downloaded for a number of devices, including Windows 7 and 8 computers, Mac computers, Android phones and tablets, iOS (iPhone and iPad, v 7.0 and later), Kindle Fire, Chromebook, and Windows Phone.&lt;ref&gt;http://support.wunderlist.com/customer/portal/articles/64886-which-devices-can-i-use-with-wunderlist-&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Microsoft released Wunderlist for [[Apple Watch]] devices.&lt;ref name=Wunderlist-for-Apple-Watch&gt;{{cite news|last=Horsey|first=Julian|title=Wunderlist Mac App Updated With New Quick Add Features.|url=http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wunderlist-mac-app-updated-with-new-quick-add-features-06-08-2015/|newspaper=Geeky Gadgets|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrations===
In October 2014, Wunderlist announced its first integration, with cloud storage company [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Users could now access and link their Dropbox files to their Wunderlist tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Lunden | first1=Ingrid | title=To-Do App Wunderlist Links Up With Dropbox, Its First Integration | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/01/to-do-app-wunderlist-links-up-with-dropbox-its-first-integration/ | website=www.techcrunch.com | accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, a Calendar Feed feature was released for Wunderlist, allowing a user's pending tasks to appear in other calendar services such as [[Google Calendar]], Microsoft's [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] [[Outlook.com#Calendar|Calendar]], Apple's [[Calendar (Apple)|Calendar]], [[Slack (software)|Slack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/a-more-productive-way-to-chat-with-wunderlist-and-slack/ | title=A More Productive Way to Chat With Wunderlist and Slack/ | accessdate=2015-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sunrise Calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/sync-your-calendar-with-wunderlist/ | title=Sync Your Calendar with Wunderlist | accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences from competing applications===
Wunderlist can export notes to the [[JSON]] file format,&lt;ref&gt;http://support.wunderlist.com/customer/portal/articles/1183757&lt;/ref&gt; but cannot save as PDF or HTML.&lt;ref&gt;Twitter for instance can export to HTML (https://blog.twitter.com/2012/your-twitter-archive), as illustrated in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYsPlHMvhM#t=34&lt;/ref&gt; Notes can, however, be printed to PDF from the Wunderlist Web App by use of a [[List of virtual printer software#Virtual PDF printers|virtual PDF printer]] or Google Chrome's "Save as PDF" feature.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.wunderlist.com/customer/portal/articles/1642628-printing-emailing&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[right-to-left]] languages display correctly in Wunderlist's web browser application, the text is incorrectly justified to the left (as normal for left-to-right languages). Right-to-left language text in the Wunderlist iOS application, however, is correctly aligned to the right.{{Citation needed|reason=missing reference for the claim |date=July 2018}}

The Wunderlist website has no record of its release history but this is planned for the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.wunderlist.com/customer/portal/questions/11878825-version-release-notes&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2009, Wunderlist's CEO Christian Reber called on the social network platform [[XING]] for business partners to create a new to-do app. [[Frank Thelen]] responded and together Reber and Thelen developed first concepts for Wunderlist. The necessary seed funding was granted by [[High-Tech Gründerfonds]] and e42 GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t3n.de/magazin/kein-wunder-startup-227950/ |title= 6 Wunderkinder – die Berliner App-Shootingstars im Porträt|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of Wunderlist was published in 2011. Initially, the program was created for desktop PCs and platforms such as Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/two-new-members-join-the-family-assistly-and-wunderlist-for-linux/ | title=New members join the family: Assistly and Wunderlist for Linux |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the app received approval for the iPhone. Subsequently, the developers released a version prepared for the iPad with the name Wunderlist HD. In September 2012, the developers announced a shutdown of their service Wunderkit. Instead they wanted to focus on creating a new version of Wunderlist, which was later on released in December 2012 under the name Wunderlist 2. In September 2013, the company announced to have over 5 million users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/comments-for-wunderlist/ | title=Let's Talk Comments for Wunderlist | accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, a new major update was released under the name of Wunderlist 3, with a new real-time sync architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/wunderlist-3-is-here/ | title=Wunderlist 3 is Here | accessdate= August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wunderlist reached 10 million users in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Escreet|first1=Rebecca|title=World Productivity Report|url=https://www.wunderlist.com/world-productivity-report/|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2015, it was announced that [[Microsoft]] had acquired 6Wunderkinder, makers of Wunderlist, for between [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million and US$200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Buys To-Do List App Maker|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-buys-german-to-do-list-startup-6wunderkinder-1433177558|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its acquisition of the app, Microsoft announced in April 2017 a preview of [[Microsoft To-Do|To-Do]], a multi-platform task management app developed by the Wunderlist team that was intended to eventually replace Wunderlist and incorporate most of its features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Microsoft To-Do—now available in Preview|url=https://blogs.office.com/2017/04/19/introducing-microsoft-to-do-now-available-in-preview|website=Office Blogs|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, To-Do has not yet replaced Wunderlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17146308/microsoft-wunderlist-to-do-app-acquisition-complicated|title=Microsoft’s Wunderlist acquisition is getting complicated|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Wunderlist won the "Golden Mi" award from Xiaomi,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://twitter.com/Wunderlist/status/497767952146391040 | title=Guess who's got @xiaomi's Golden Mi Award?

==Finances==
In its [[Angel investor|initial round]] of funding, 100,000 [[euro]] was invested in 6Wunderkinder by [[Frank Thelen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frank.io/blog/wunderlist |title= Frank Thelen's Blog "Wunderlist"|publisher=Frank.io |date=2015-06-03 |accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. In December 2010, [[High-Tech Gründerfonds]] invested 500,000 euro (approximately US$660,000) in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = 6Wunderkinder raises €500,000 to build slick productivity tool called 'wunderkit' |first = Robin |last = Wauters |url = https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/21/6wunderkinder-raises-e500000-to-build-slick-productivity-tool-called-wunderkit/ |work = [[TechCrunch]] |date = December 21, 2010 |accessdate = April 11, 2014 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6OkQixy5E |archivedate = April 11, 2014 |deadurl = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T-Venture]] also invested an undisclosed amount in the startup.

'''Yaron Golan''' ({{lang-he|ירון גולן}}; April 26, 1949 – January 23, 2007) was an Israeli publisher.

Yaron Golan, originally a literature columnist in ''[[Haaretz]]'', established a publishing company in 1990. While refusing to submit to conventional rules of publishing only popular or profitable books, he used to take on himself to publish every book submitted to him, publishing over 1000 books, often at a personal loss. However he still was the publisher of many important works, including anthologies by [[Nathan Zach]] and [[Avot Yeshurun]]. Golan died unexpectedly of [[cardiac arrest]] on January 23, 2007, and was buried the following day in [[Tel-Aviv]].
