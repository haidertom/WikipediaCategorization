'''Andrea Palladio''' ({{IPA-it|anˈdrɛːa palˈlaːdjo}}; 30 November 1508&amp;nbsp;– 19 August 1580) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; architect active in the [[Venetian Republic]]. Palladio, influenced by [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], primarily by [[Vitruvius]], is widely considered to be one of the most influential individuals in the [[Architectural history|history of architecture]]. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura|The Four Books of Architecture]]'', gained him wide recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladio.html His conception of classical architecture was heavily influenced by Vitruvian ideas and his mentor Trissino. "Andrea Palladio."]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Vicenza]], with its twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio, and the [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]] are listed together as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Biography==
Palladio was born on 30 November 1508 in [[Padua]] and was given the name, Andrea Di Pietro della Gondola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Houghton Mifflin dictionary of biography |page=1167 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn=0-618-25210-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfesntdNnbwC&amp;lpg=PA1167&amp;pg=PA1167#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Pietro, called "Della Gondola", was a miller. From early on, Andrea Palladio was introduced into the work of building. In Padua he gained his first experiences as a stonecutter in the sculpture workshop of Bartolomeo Cavazza da Sossano, who was the sculptor responsible for the altar in the Church of Santa Maria dei Carmini in Padua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moose|first1=editor, Christina J.|title=Great lives from history.|date=2005|publisher=Salem Press|location=Pasadena, Calif.|isbn=978-1-58765-211-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavazza da Sossano is said to have imposed particularly hard working conditions. At the age of sixteen he moved to Vicenza where he would reside for most of his life. Here he became an assistant in the Pedemuro studio, a leading workshop of stonecutters and masons. He joined a guild of stonemasons and bricklayers. He was employed as a stonemason to make monuments and decorative sculptures. These sculptures reflected the [[Mannerist]] style of the architect [[Michele Sanmicheli]].

Perhaps the key moment that sparked Palladio's career was being employed by the Humanist poet and scholar, [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], from 1538 to 1539. While Trissino was reconstructing the Villa Cricoli, he took interest in Palladio's work. Trissino was heavily influenced by the studies of Vitruvius, who later influenced Palladio's own ideals and attitudes toward classical architecture. As the leading intellectual in Vicenza, Trissino stimulated the young man to appreciate the arts, sciences, and Classical literature and he granted him the opportunity to study Ancient architecture in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;He visited Rome alongside Trissino in 1541, 1547, and 1554 until 1556. His earlier visits to Rome influenced his designs of palaces. He modeled his designs based on his interpretation of classical architecture he had witnessed. Curl, James Stevens, "A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture", [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Trissino who gave him the name by which he became known, Palladio, an allusion to the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of wisdom [[Athena|Pallas Athene]] and to a character of a play by Trissino. Indeed, the word Palladio means ''Wise one''.&lt;ref&gt;"How I Spent A Few Days in Palladio's World" ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 3 March 2009, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123603460173214171?mod=article-outset-box WSJ.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After Trissino's death in 1550, Palladio benefited from the patronage of the Barbaro brothers, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Daniele Barbaro]], who encouraged his studies of [[classical architecture]] and brought him to Rome in 1554, and his younger brother [[Marcantonio Barbaro]]. The powerful Barbaros introduced Palladio to [[Venice]], where he finally became "Proto della Serenissima" (chief architect of the Republic of Venice) after [[Jacopo Sansovino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mostra del Palladio: Vicenza / Basilica Palladiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUk3AQAAIAAJ|year=1973|publisher=Electa|page=46|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Barbaros, the Corner, [[Foscari]], and [[Pisani family|Pisani]] families supported Palladio's career.&lt;ref&gt;''Venice and the Renaissance", Manfredo Tafuri, trans. Jessica Levine, 1989, [[MIT Press]], p.127 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BYaBnsP5PMC Books.Google.com] {{ISBN|0-262-70054-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio began to develop his own architectural style around 1541. The [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]], named after him, adhered to classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] principles he rediscovered, applied, and explained in his works.&lt;ref&gt;Palladio knew relatively little about Greek architecture, not yet rediscovered at his times, but he studied deeply the Roman remains during five trips to Rome. His works are heavily influenced by his studies of Greco-Roman architecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio is known to be one of the most influential architects in Western architecture. His architectural works have "been valued for centuries as the quintessence of High Renaissance calm and harmony" (Watkin, D., ''A History of Western Architecture''). He designed many palaces, [[villa]]s, and churches, but Palladio's reputation, initially, and after his death, has been founded on his skill as a designer of villas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Burns]], [http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e ''Andrea Palladio (1508–1580)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924065640/http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e |date=24 September 2009 }}, [[Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[palladian villas]] are located mainly in the [[province of Vicenza]], while the ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' are concentrated in the city of [[Vicenza]] and the churches in [[Venice]]. A number of his works are now protected as part of the [[World Heritage Site]] ''[[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]]''. Other buildings by Palladio are to be found within the ''Venice and its Lagoon'' World Heritage Site.

Palladio's first major public project began when his designs for building the [[loggia]]s for the town hall, known as the [[Basilica Palladiana]], were approved in 1548. He proposed an addition of two-storey stone buttresses reflecting the Gothic style of the existing hall while using classical proportions. The construction was completed in 1617 after Palladio's death.

Aside from Palladio's designs, his publications contributed to ''[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]]''. During the second half of his life, Palladio published many books, above all, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (''The four books of architecture'', Venice, 1570). Palladio is most known for his designs of villas and palaces as well as his books.

The precise circumstances of his death are unknown. Palladio died in 1580,&lt;ref name="Avcioglu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Nebahat Avcioglu|title=Architecture, Art and Identity in Venice and its Territories, 1450–1750: Essays in Honour of Deborah Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOL9i4VXrtkC&amp;pg=PA150|date=23 December 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-1082-5|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; retold in tradition, in [[Maser, Italy|Maser]], near [[Treviso]], and was buried in the church of [[Santa Corona]] in Vicenza; since the nineteenth century his tomb has been located in the ''Cimitero Maggiore'' of Vicenza.

Palladio's architecture was not dependent on expensive materials, which must have been an advantage to his more financially pressed clients. Many of his buildings are of brick covered with [[stucco]]. Stuccoed brickwork was always used in his villa designs in order to portray his interpretations of the Roman villa typology.

In the later part of his career, Palladio was chosen by powerful members of Venetian society for numerous important commissions. His success as an architect is based not only on the beauty of his work, but also for its harmony with the culture of his time. His success and influence came from the integration of extraordinary aesthetic quality with expressive characteristics that resonated with his client's social aspirations. His buildings served to communicate, visually, their place in the social order of their culture. This powerful integration of beauty and the physical representation of social meanings is apparent in three major building types: the urban palazzo, the agricultural villa, and the church.

Relative to his trips to Rome, Palladio developed three main palace types by 1556. In 1550, the [[Palazzo Chiericati]] was completed. The proportions for the building were based on musical ratios for adjacent rooms. The building was centralized by a tripartite division of a series of columns or colonnades. In 1552, the [[Palazzo Porto|Palazzo Iseppo Porto]] located in Vicenza was rebuilt incorporating the Roman Renaissance element for façades. A colonnade of Corinthian columns surrounded a main court. The [[Palazzo Antonini]] in Udine, constructed in 1556, had a centralized hall with four columns and service spaces placed relatively toward one side. He uses styles of incorporating the six columns, supported by pediments, into the walls as part of the façade. This technique had been applied in his villa designs as well. Palladio experimented with the plan of the Palazzo Iseppo Porto by incorporating it into the [[Palazzo Thiene]]. It was an earlier project from 1545 to 1550 and remained uncompleted due to elaborate elevations in his designs. He used Mannerist elements such as stucco surface reliefs and large columns, often extending two stories high.

In his urban structures he developed a new improved version of the typical early [[Renaissance]] palazzo (exemplified by the [[Palazzo Strozzi]]). Adapting a new urban palazzo type created by [[Bramante]] in the [[House of Raphael]], Palladio found a powerful expression of the importance of the owner and his social position. The main living quarters of the owner on the second level were clearly distinguished in importance by use of a [[pediment]]ed classical [[portico]], centered and raised above the subsidiary and utilitarian ground level (illustrated in the [[Palazzo Porto]] and the [[Palazzo Valmarana]]). The tallness of the portico was achieved by incorporating the owner's sleeping quarters on the third level, within a [[Giant order|giant]] two-story classical colonnade, a motif adapted from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Capitoline]] buildings in Rome. The elevated main floor level became known as the "[[piano nobile]]", and is still referred to as the "first floor" in Europe.

Palladio also established an influential new building format for the agricultural villas of the Venetian [[aristocracy]]. Palladio's approach to his villa designs was not relative to his experience in Rome. His designs were based on practicality and employed few reliefs. He consolidated the various stand-alone farm outbuildings into a single impressive structure, arranged as a highly organized whole, dominated by a strong center and symmetrical side wings, as illustrated at [[Villa Barbaro]]. In the project of the Villa Barbaro, Palladio most likely was also engaged in the interior decoration. Alongside the painter [[Paolo Veronese]], he invented the complex and sophisticated illusionistic landscape paintings that cover the walls of various rooms.&lt;ref&gt;For the illusionistic landscape paintings and the relationship of Palladio and Veronese see http://www.kunstgeschichte-ejournal.net/329/1/Paolo_Veronese%2C_Andrea_Palladio_und_die_Stanza_di_Baco.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Villa Rotonda]] of 1552, outside Vicenza, was constructed as a summer house with views from all four sides. The plan has centralized circular halls with wings and porticos expanding on all four sides. Palladio began to implement the classical temple front into his design of façades for villas. He felt that to make an entry appear grand, the Roman temple front would be the most suitable style. The Palladian villa configuration often consists of a centralized block raised on an elevated [[podium]], accessed by grand steps, and flanked by lower service wings, as at [[Villa Foscari]] and [[Villa Badoer]]. This format, with the quarters of the owners at the elevated center of their own world, found resonance as a prototype for Italian villas and later for the country estates of the British nobility (such as [[Lord Burlington]]'s [[Chiswick House]], Vanbrugh's [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]], Walpole's [[Houghton Hall]], and Adam's [[Kedleston Hall]] and [http://www.paxtonhouse.co.uk/ Paxton House] in Scotland). His villas were used by a capitalist gentry who developed an interest in agriculture and land. The configuration was a perfect architectural expression of their worldview, clearly expressing their perceived position in the social order of the times. His influence was extended worldwide into the [[British colonies]]. Palladio developed his own prototype for the plan of the villas that was flexible to moderate in scale and function. The Palladian villa format was easily adapted for a democratic worldview, as may be seen at [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] and his arrangement for the [[University of Virginia]]. It also may be seen applied as recently as 1940 in Pope's [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]] in Washington D.C., where the public entry to the world of high culture occupies the exalted center position. The [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] of exposed [[basement]] walls of Victorian residences is a late remnant of the Palladian format, clearly expressed as a podium for the main living space for the family.

Similarly, Palladio created a new configuration for the design of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] churches that established two interlocking architectural orders, each clearly articulated, yet delineating a hierarchy of a larger order overriding a lesser order. This idea was in direct coincidence with the rising acceptance of the theological ideas of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], who postulated the notion of two worlds existing simultaneously: the divine world of faith, and the earthly world of humans.  Palladio created an architecture which made a visual statement communicating the idea of two superimposed systems, as illustrated at [[San Francesco della Vigna]]. In a time when religious dominance in Western culture was threatened by the rising power of science and [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], this architecture found great favor with the Catholic Church as a clear statement of the proper relationship of the earthly and the spiritual worlds.

==Influence==
[[File:Palladio Titel 1642.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture)]]

[[File:Frontispiece Campbell's edition of Palladio's First Book of Architecture 1728.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] from [[Colen Campbell]]'s edition of Palladio's ''First Book of Architecture'', published at London, 1728]]

Although his buildings are all in a relatively small part of Italy, Palladio's influence was far-reaching. One factor in the spread of his influence was the publication in 1570 of his architectural treatise, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture), which set out rules others could follow. The first book includes studies of decorative styles, classical orders, and materials. The second book included Palladio's town and country house designs and classical reconstructions. The third book has bridge and basilica designs, city planning designs, and classical halls. The fourth book included information on the reconstruction of ancient Roman temples. Before this landmark publication, architectural drawings by Palladio had appeared in print as illustrations to [[Daniele Barbaro]]'s "Commentary" on [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Clini "Vitruvius' Basilica at Fano: The drawings of a lost building from 'De Architectura Libri Decem'" The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Vol. XXXIV, Part 5/W12 pp121 – 126 2002 [http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf ISPRS.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517124924/http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf |date=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in his style was renewed in later generations and became fashionable throughout Europe, for example in parts of the [[Loire Valley]] of France. In Britain, [[Inigo Jones]], [[Elizabeth Wilbraham]], and [[Christopher Wren]] embraced the Palladian style. In his [[Italian Journey]], [[Johann von Goethe]] describes Palladio as a genius, commending his unfinished Convent of Saint Maria della Carita as the most perfect existing work of architecture. Another admirer was the architect, [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]], 4th [[Earl of Cork]], also known as [[Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], who, with [[William Kent]], designed [[Chiswick House]]. The influence of Palladio even spread to America. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Thomas Dawes]] much admired that style of architecture, and the United States Capitol building is an example of a slightly evolved version of Palladio's works. The One Hundred Eleventh [[Congress of the United States of America]] called him the "Father of American Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcadoc.it/english/news/Palladio-Father-of-American-Architecture.htm|title=The US Congress: 'Palladio, the Father of American Architecture'|website=www.marcadoc.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Congressional Resolution no. 259 of 6 December 2010). Exponents of Palladianism include the eighteenth century [[Venice|Venetian]] architect, [[Giacomo Leoni]], who published an authoritative four-volume work on Palladio and his architectural concepts.

More than 330 of Palladio's original drawings and sketches still survive in the collections of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx Collecting Palladio's drawings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192605/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}, website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; most of which originally were owned by Inigo Jones. Jones collected a significant number of these on his Grand Tour of 1613–1614, while some were a gift from [[Henry Wotton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx Inigo Jones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926192618/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx |date=26 September 2009 }}, website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], a nonprofit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio's influence in the architecture of the United States.

In 2010, the [[National Building Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] created an exhibition dedicated solely to Palladio and his legacy. The exhibition, titled ''Palladio and His Legacy: A Transatlantic Journey'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710002925/http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html |archivedate=10 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was open to the public until January 2011.

In [[physical cosmology]], '''baryogenesis''' is the hypothetical physical process that took place during the [[Big Bang|early universe]] that produced [[baryon asymmetry|baryonic asymmetry]], i.e. the imbalance of [[matter]] ([[baryon]]s) and [[antimatter]] (antibaryons) in the observed [[universe]].

Baryogenesis theories are based on different descriptions of the interaction between fundamental particles. Two main theories are [[electroweak]] baryogenesis ([[standard model]]), which would occur during the [[electroweak epoch]], and the [[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]] baryogenesis, which would occur during or shortly after the [[grand unification epoch]]. [[Quantum field theory]] and [[statistical physics]] are used to describe such possible mechanisms.

Baryogenesis is followed by primordial [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis]], when [[atomic nuclei]] began to form.

Since then, experiments have verified that every known kind of particle has a corresponding antiparticle. Under the [[CPT symmetry|CPT theorem]], a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass and lifetime, and opposite charge. Given this symmetry, it is puzzling that the universe does not have equal amounts of matter and [[antimatter]]. Indeed, there is no experimental evidence that there are any significant concentrations of antimatter in the observable universe.

There are two main interpretations for this disparity: either the universe began with a small preference for matter (total [[baryon number|baryonic number]] of the universe different from zero), or the universe was originally perfectly symmetric, but somehow a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favour of matter over time. The second point of view is preferred, although there is no clear experimental evidence indicating either of them to be the correct one.

* [[Baryon number]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; violation.
* [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] violation.
* Interactions out of [[thermal equilibrium]].

Baryon number violation is obviously a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti-baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti-baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|left-handed]]  baryons and [[Chirality (physics)#Chirality and helicity|right-handed]] anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium, since otherwise [[CPT symmetry]] would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number.&lt;ref name=FarrarShaposhnikov1993&gt;

Currently, there is no experimental evidence of particle interactions where the conservation of baryon number is broken [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbatively]]: this would appear to suggest that all observed particle reactions have equal baryon number before and after. Mathematically, the [[commutator]] of the baryon number [[operator (mathematics)|quantum operator]] with the (perturbative) [[Standard Model]] [[hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] is zero: &lt;math&gt;[B,H] = BH - HB = 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, the Standard Model is known to violate the conservation of baryon number only non-perturbatively: a global U(1) anomaly. To account for baryon violation in baryogenesis, such events (including proton decay) can occur in [[Grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] (GUTs) and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] (SUSY) models via hypothetical massive bosons such as the [[X and Y bosons|X boson]].

The second condition&amp;nbsp;– violation of CP-symmetry&amp;nbsp;– was discovered in 1964 (direct CP-violation, that is violation of CP-symmetry in a decay process, was discovered later, in 1999). Due to CPT symmetry, violation of CP-symmetry demands violation of time inversion symmetry, or [[T-symmetry]].

In the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario,&lt;ref name=Riotto99&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author1=A. Riotto |author2=M. Trodden | year = 1999
 | title = Recent progress in baryogenesis

|arxiv = hep-ph/9901362 |bibcode = 1999ARNPS..49...35R }}&lt;/ref&gt; the last condition states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. In this situation the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation.

== Baryogenesis within the Standard Model (Electroweak Baryogenesis) ==
The [[Standard Model]] can incorporate baryogenesis, though the amount of net baryons (and leptons) thus created may not be sufficient to account for the present baryon asymmetry. This issue has not yet been determined decisively.

Baryogenesis within the Standard Model requires the [[Electroweak interaction|electroweak]] [[Higgs mechanism|symmetry breaking]] be a [[Phase transition#Ehrenfest classification|first-order]] [[phase transition]], since otherwise [[sphaleron]]s wipe off any baryon asymmetry that happened up to the phase transition, while later the amount of baryon non-conserving interactions is negligible.&lt;ref name=KRS1985&gt;

The [[phase transition]] [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]] breaks the [[P-symmetry]] spontaneously, allowing for [[CP-symmetry]] violating interactions to create [[C-symmetry|C-asymmetry]] on both its sides: quarks tend to accumulate on the broken phase side of the domain wall, while anti-quarks tend to accumulate on its unbroken phase side. This happens as follows:&lt;ref name="FarrarShaposhnikov1993"/&gt;

Due to [[CP-symmetry]] violating [[electroweak]] interactions, some amplitudes involving quarks are not equal to the corresponding amplitudes involving anti-quarks, but rather have opposite phase (see [[CKM matrix]] and [[Kaon]]); since [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] takes an amplitude to its complex conjugate, [[CPT-symmetry]] is conserved.

Though some of their amplitudes have opposite phases, both quarks and anti-quarks have positive energy, and hence acquire the same phase as they move in space-time. This phase also depends on their mass, which is identical but depends both on [[flavor]] and on the [[Higgs field|Higgs]] [[Vacuum expectation value|VEV]] which changes along the domain wall. Thus certain sums of amplitudes for quarks have different absolute values compared to those of anti-quarks. In all, quarks and anti-quarks may have different reflection and transmission probabilities through the domain wall, and it turns out that more quarks coming from the unbroken phase are transmitted compared to anti-quarks.

Thus there is a net baryonic flux through the domain wall. Due to [[sphaleron]] transitions, which are abundant in the unbroken phase, the net anti-baryonic content of the unbroken phase is wiped off. However, sphalerons are rare enough in the broken phase as not to wipe off the excess of baryons there. In total, there is net creation of baryons.

In this scenario, non-perturbative electroweak interactions (i.e. the [[sphaleron]]) are responsible for the B-violation, the perturbative electroweak Lagrangian is responsible for the CP-violation, and the domain wall is responsible for the lack of thermal equilibrium; together with the CP-violation it also creates a C-violation in each of its sides.

== Matter content in the universe ==
{{see also|Baryon asymmetry}}

=== Baryon asymmetry parameter ===
The challenges to the physics theories are then to explain ''how'' to produce this preference of matter over antimatter, and also the ''magnitude'' of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the ''asymmetry parameter'',
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{n_\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.
This quantity relates the overall number density difference between baryons and antibaryons (n&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;{{overline|B}}&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively) and the number density of [[cosmic background radiation]] [[photon]]s n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the [[cosmic background radiation]] (CBR) at a temperature of roughly {{val|3000}} [[kelvin]], corresponding to an average kinetic energy of {{val|3000|u=K}} / ({{val|10.08|e=3|u=K/eV}}) = {{val|0.3|u=eV}}. After the decoupling, the ''total'' number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature T per cubic centimeter, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;n_\gamma = \frac{1}{\pi^2} {\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \int_0^\infty \frac{x^2}{e^x - 1} dx =
  \frac{2\zeta(3)}{\pi^2}{\left(\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c}\right)}^3 \approx
  20.3 \left(\frac{T}{1\text{K}}\right)^3 \text{cm}^{-3}
&lt;/math&gt;,
with k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; as the [[Boltzmann constant]], ħ as the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2π and c as the speed of light in vacuum, and ζ(3) as
[[Apéry's constant]]. At the current CBR photon temperature of {{val|2.725|u=K}}, this corresponds to a photon density n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter.

Therefore, the asymmetry parameter η, as defined above, is ''not'' the "good" parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the [[entropy]] density s,
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_s = \frac{n_B - n_{\bar B}}{s}&lt;/math&gt;
because the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is
:&lt;math&gt;s \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\mathrm{entropy}}{\mathrm{volume}} = \frac{p + \rho}{T} = \frac{2\pi^2}{45}g_{*}(T) T^3&lt;/math&gt;
with p and ρ as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor T&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;, and g&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; as the effective number of degrees of freedom for "massless" particles (inasmuch as mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≪ k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T holds) at temperature T,
:&lt;math&gt;g_*(T) = \sum_\mathrm{i=bosons} g_i{\left(\frac{T_i}{T}\right)}^3 + \frac{7}{8}\sum_\mathrm{j=fermions} g_j{\left(\frac{T_j}{T}\right)}^3&lt;/math&gt;,
for bosons and fermions with g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; degrees of freedom at temperatures T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. At the present era, s = {{val|7.04|s=n&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Behavior analytics ==
Behavior informatics covers ''behavior analytics'' which focuses on analysis and learning of behavioral data.

== Behavior ==
From an informa[[Informatics|t]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ics perspective, a [[behavior]] consists of four key elements: actors (behavioral subjects and objects), operations (actions, activities) and interactions (relationships), and their properties. A behavior can be represented as a behavior vector, all behaviors of an actor or an actor group can be represented as behavior sequences and multi-dimensional behavior matrix.

'''Brevitas et Facilitas''' means "brevity and simplicity" in English, the [[hermeneutical]] method of [[John Calvin]]. Especially he used this method in the dedication in the Commentary on [[Romans]].
Calvin presented his own distinctive method of the hermeneutics of [[Scripture]] in his Commentary on the Epistle of Paul, the Apostle, to the Romans. It is called the ideal of brevitas et facilitas. Calvin was not satisfied with both [[Philip Melanchthon|Malanchthon]]'s [[loci method]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]]'s [[prolixity]] commentary. He took a [[via media]] approach. Calvin's method was influenced by the rhetoric of [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Quintilian]] and [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]]. Calvin, however, confirmed that his own principle came from [[Scripture]] itself. Calvin showed that the clarity of Scripture was related to the ideal of brevitas et facilitas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://verbumetecclesia.org.za/index.php/VE/article/view/601  Myung Jun Ahn. The Ideal of Brevitas et Facilitas: The Theological Hermeneutics of John Calvin, Verbum et Ecclesia; Skrif en Kerk: Vol 20, No 2 (1999), 270-281]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to John Bolt this means the brevitas et dilucidatio of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bavinckinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Bavinck_RD_outline.pdf The Outline of Bavinck's Reformed Dogmatics]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method as Brevitas et Facilitas==
According to Michael Mewborn, Calvin did have a basic approach to Scripture which is often described as brevitas et
facilitas (i.e. in derivative form-brevitas-to be brief and relevant and facilitas-to be simple or
easily understood), brevitas for short. Brevitas is an assent to clear and concise interpretation.
Even though the Latin terminology may paint Calvin’s approach as irrelevant or archaic, the
heart of this method is the basis of evangelical interpretation today. [[Richard Gamble]] writes of
brevitas, “[it] may be understood as an attempt to communicate the message of the biblical
author in as concise, clear, and accurate a manner as possible….”
That brevitas et facilitas is a good summary of Calvin’s exegetical methodology is hardly disputed; Battles, Kraus, Higman, [[David Steinmetz|Steinmetz,]] Girardin, Ganoczy/Scheld, and Parker among others have written recently about it.”
Brevitas describes Calvin’s prevailing disposition toward interpretation.
Calvin used this Method in his Commentaries. [[Richard Muller (theologian)|Richard Muller]] rightly notes that brevitas tended to describe more Calvin’s commentaries
than his sermons. This point is well taken and suggests even more convincingly that brevitas
characterizes Calvin’s approach to exegesis as he discerns biblical meaning in his study, apart
from oratorical influence. Calvin was more apt to say less when writing than when speaking.
Muller writes, “…whereas the commentaries held to the model of brevitas, the sermons tended
toward a more amplificatory model of oratory, often reaching three or four times the length of
the comment on the same text.
But less we assume that Calvin victimized the text or at least his interpretations by
verbalizing in excess of textual warrant or study, Muller notes that during oratory he was,
“drawing on more collateral texts for the sake of broader hortatory, topical, and polemical
development." It is a lesson to the exegete that the Holy Spirit does not dispense textual
understanding only in our study rooms, but that he gives us textual understanding, even when we
are without material aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformedblacksofamerica.org/downloads/Calvin_and_His_Interpretative_Methody_by_Michael_Mewborn.pdf  Michael Mewborn, "Calvin and His Interpretative Method"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source and Mention of Brevitas et Facilitas==

For Calvin Scripture was not complicated, but simple. Scripture was simply the eloquent speech of the Holy Spirit for his simple people. Therefore, to vitiate the simplicity of Scripture was to destroy the whole of 273 THE IDEAL OF Scripture. For Calvin the simplicity of Scripture was immediately connected with his hermeneutical method. This supplied Calvin with the foundation for the principles of brevitas et Jacilitas as his hermeneutical ideal. Calvin believed that Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel employed a simple and easy style in order for ordinary people to understand God's Word more easily. This made him believe that the style of Scripture had its orientation in brevitas et facilitas. Consequently, Calvin, influenced by rhetoricians like Cicero and Quintilian in his ideal of brevitas et facilitas, confirmed that the authors of Scripture demonstrated this ideal. Calvin made this ideal a part of his own hermeneutical method.&lt;ref&gt;https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/20883/Ahn_Ideal%281999%29.pdf?sequence=1

In the dedication in the Commentary on Romans published in 1540 to [[Simon Grynaeus]] his friend and Hebrew teacher, John Calvin says

"we both thought that the chief excellency of an expounder consists in lucid brevity. And, indeed, since it is almost his only work to lay open the mind of the writer whom he undertakes to explain, the degree in which he leads away his readers from it, in that degree he goes astray from his purpose, and in a manner wanders from his own boundaries. Hence we expressed a hope, that from the number of those who strive at this day to advance the interest of theology by this kind of labour, some one would be found, who would study plainness, and endeavour to avoid the evil of tiring his readers with prolixity. I know at the same time that this view is not taken by all, and that those who judge otherwise have their reasons; but still I cannot be drawn away from the love of what is compendious. But as there is such a variety, found in the minds of men, that different things please different persons, let every one in this case follow his own judgment, provided that no one attempts to force others to adopt his own rules. Thus it will be, that we who approve of brevity, will not reject nor despise the labours of those who are more copious and diffused in their explanations of Scripture, and that they also in their turn will bear with us, though they may think us too compressed and concise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/calcom38.pdf John Calvin, "THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY JOHN CALVIN TO SIMON GRYNÆUS," Commentary on Romans, Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sentiebat enim uterque nostrum praecipuam interpretis virtutem in perspicua brevitate esse positam. Et sane, quum hoc sit prope unicum illius officium mentem scriptoris quem explicandum sumpsit patefacere, quantum ab ea lecturos abducit, tantundem a scopo suo aberrat, vel certe a suis finibus quodammodo evagatur…unum aliquem exstare qui et facilitati studeret, et simul daret operam ne prolixis commentariis studiosos ultra modum detineret…ego tamen dimoveri non possum ab amore comendii".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7223">In music, a '''coda''' {{IPA-it|ˈkoːda|}} ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "tail", plural ''code'') is a [[passage (music)|passage]] that brings a piece (or a [[movement (music)|movement]]) to an end. Technically, it is an expanded [[cadence (music)|cadence]].  It may be as simple as a few [[bar (music)|measures]], or as complex as an entire [[section (music)|section]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009). ''Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II'', p.355. Eighth Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-310188-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Coda (''It.'') (1) The tail of a note. (2) The bars occasionally added to a contrapuntal movement after the close or finish of the ''[[canto fermo]]''. (3) The few chords or bars attached to an infinite canon in order to render it finite; or a few chords ''not in a canon'', added to a finite canon for the sake of obtaining a more harmonious conclusion. (4) That closing adjunct of any movement, or piece, specially intended to enforce a feeling of completeness and finality.&lt;ref&gt;Stainer, John and Barrett, William Alexander (1898). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2H0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22coda%22+stainer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV4v-wvt3UAhUD9GMKHTFVBU4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22coda%22%20stainer&amp;f=false Stainer and Barrett's Dictionary of Musical Terms]'', p.&amp;nbsp;100. Novello.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In classical music==

[[Image:Mozart- Coda- Sonata in C Major, K. 309, I.png|thumb|right|350px|Coda from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] [[Piano Sonata No. 7 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata no. 7 in C Major]], [[Koechel|K.]] 309, I, mm. 152–155 {{audio|Mozart- Coda- Sonata in C Major, K. 309, I.mid|Play}}.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2009), p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The presence of a coda as a structural element in a movement is especially clear in works written in particular [[musical form]]s.  Codas were commonly used in both [[sonata form]] and [[Variation (music)|variation]] movements during the Classical era.  In a sonata form movement, the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] section will, in general, follow the [[exposition (music)|exposition]] in its thematic content, while adhering to the home [[key (music)|key]].  The recapitulation often ends with a passage that sounds like a termination, paralleling the music that ended the exposition; thus, any music coming after this termination will be perceived as extra material, i.e., as a coda.  In works in variation form, the coda occurs following the last variation and will be very noticeable as the first music not based on the theme.

One of the ways that [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] extended and intensified Classical practice was to expand the coda sections, producing a final section sometimes of equal musical weight to the foregoing exposition, development, and recapitulation sections and completing the [[musical argument]].  For one famous example, see the finale of [[Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven)]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of this coda, and of codas in general, see Rosen, Charles (1988) ''Sonata Forms'', 2nd edition.  New York:  Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2012}}

===Musical purpose===
[[Charles Burkhart]] suggests that the reason codas are common, even necessary, is that, in the climax of the main body of a piece, a "particularly effortful passage", often an expanded [[phrase (music)|phrase]], is often created by "working an idea through to its structural conclusions" and that, after all this momentum is created, a coda is required to "look back" on the main body, allow listeners to "take it all in", and "create a sense of balance."&lt;ref&gt;Burkhart, Charles. "The Phrase Rhythm of Chopin's A-flat Major Mazurka, Op. 59, No. 2" in Stein, Deborah (2005). ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', p.12. New York: [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codetta===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Piano Sonata No. 16 (Mozart)]] --&gt;
'''Codetta''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "little tail", the [[diminutive]] form) has a similar purpose to the coda, but on a smaller scale, concluding a section of a work instead of the work as a whole. A typical codetta concludes the [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] sections of a work in [[sonata form]], following the second ([[modulation (music)|modulated]]) theme, or the closing theme (if there is one). Thus, in the exposition, it usually appears in the secondary key, but, in the recapitulation, in the primary key. The codetta ordinarily closes with a [[perfect cadence]] in the appropriate key, confirming the tonality. If the exposition is repeated, the codetta is also, but sometimes it has its ending slightly changed, depending on whether it leads back to the exposition or into the [[musical development|development]] sections.

==History==
'''Cauda''', a Latin word meaning "tail", "edge" or "trail" is the root of ''coda'' and is used in the study of [[conductus]] of the 12th and 13th centuries. The cauda was a long [[melisma]] on one of the last syllables of the text, repeated in each strophe. Conducti were traditionally divided into two groups, ''conductus cum cauda'' and ''conductus sine cauda'' ([[Latin]]: "conductus with cauda", "conductus without cauda"), based on the presence of the melisma. Thus, the cauda provided a conclusionary role, also similar to the modern coda.

==In popular music==
Many songs in [[Rock music|rock]] and other genres of [[popular music]] have sections identifiable as codas.  A coda in these genres is sometimes referred to as an "[[Conclusion (music)|outro]]", while in jazz, modern church music and [[barbershop arranging]] it is commonly called a "tag". One of the most famous codas is found in the 1968 single "[[Hey Jude]]" by [[The Beatles]]. The coda lasted nearly four minutes, making the song's full length at just over the seven-minute mark, and the single topped the U.S. [[Billboard charts|Billboard chart]] for nine weeks, tying it for the longest run at the top of the chart.

==In music notation==
[[Image:Coda sign.svg|right|thumb|75px|Coda sign]]

In [[music notation]], the '''coda symbol''', which resembles a set of crosshairs, is used as a navigation marker, similar to the ''[[dal segno]]'' sign. It is used where the exit from a repeated section is within that section rather than at the end. The instruction "To Coda" indicates that, upon reaching that point during the final repetition, the performer is to jump immediately to the separate section headed with the coda symbol. For example, this can be used to provide a special ending for the final verse of a song.

The ''coda'' sign is encoded in the Musical Symbols block of Unicode as U+1D10C MUSICAL SYMBOL CODA:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;#x1D10C;

The '''Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES)''' is a collaborative research project among national election studies around the world.  Participating countries and polities include a common module of survey questions in their national post-election studies. The resulting data are collated together along with voting, demographic, district and macro variables into one dataset allowing comparative analysis of voting behavior from a multilevel perspective.

The CSES is published as a free, public dataset. The project is administered by the CSES Secretariat, a joint effort between the Institute for Social Research at the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] in Germany.

== Aims and content of the study ==

The CSES project was founded in 1994 with two major aims. The first was to promote international collaboration between national election studies. The second was to allow researchers to study variations in political institutions, especially electoral systems, and their effects on individual attitudes and behaviors, especially turnout and vote choice.

CSES datasets contain variables at three levels.  The first is micro-level variables which are answered by respondents during post-election surveys in each included country.  The second is district-level variables which contain election results from the electoral districts that survey respondents are situated in.  The third is macro-level variables containing information about the country context and electoral system, as well as aggregate data such as economic indicators and democracy indices. This nested data structure, as depicted in Figure 1, allows for multilevel analysis.

[[File:Multi-levelDataStructure.png|thumb|Figure 1: Visualization of CSES multilevel data structure]]

A new thematic module is devised by the CSES Planning Committee every five years. Between the final releases of the complete modules, CSES also disseminates advance releases of datasets periodically, which include partial data for modules that have not been fully released yet.

Survey data collection for '''module 1''' was conducted between 1996 and 2001 and focuses on system performance. The module allows investigation of the impact of electoral institutions on citizens’ political cognition and behavior as well as of the nature of political and social cleavages and alignment. Furthermore, it enables research about citizens’ evaluation of democratic institutions and processes. Module 1 includes 39 election studies conducted in 33 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 2''' was conducted between 2001 and 2006 and focuses on accountability and representation. It addresses the contrast between the view that elections are a mechanism to hold government accountable and the view that they are a means to ensure that citizens’ views and interests are properly represented in the democratic process. Module 2 includes 41 election studies conducted in 38 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 3''' was conducted between 2006 and 2011. The module allows investigating the meaningfulness of electoral choices and, accordingly, focuses on a major aspect of electoral research: the contingency in choice of available options. Module 3 includes 50 election studies conducted in 41 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 4''' was conducted between 2011 and 2016 and focuses on distributional politics and social protection. The main topics investigated are voters’ preferences for public policy and the mediating factors of political institutions and voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Partial source of text segments about module 1 to module 4: [http://www.gesis.org/en/services/data-analysis/survey-data/rdc-international-survey-programs/cses], accessed June 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Module 4 includes 45 election studies conducted in 39 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 5''' is conducted between 2016 and 2021 and focuses on the electorate's attitudes towards political elites, on the one hand, and towards "out groups", on the other hand. It thus enables research on attitudes and voting behavior in the context of a rise of parties campaigning on anti-establishment messages and in opposition to "out groups".&lt;ref&gt;Partial source of text segment about module 5: [http://www.csesblog.org/2016/09/announcing-cses-module-5/], accessed June 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete table of all variables available across modules can be found on the CSES website.

== Data access ==

CSES data are available publicly and are free of charge. Data releases are non-proprietary – in other words the data are made available to the public without preferential or advance access to anyone. Data is available in multiple formats including for common statistical packages like STATA, SPSS, SAS and R. The data can be downloaded from the CSES website as well as via the GESIS data catalogue. The GESIS online analysis tool ZACAT can furthermore be used to browse and explore the dataset.

==Organizational structure and funding==

===The CSES Secretariat===

In conjunction with national election study collaborators, the CSES Secretariat administers the CSES project. It consists of staff from the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] in Germany and the University of Michigan, Ann-Arbor in the United States. The Secretariat is responsible for compiling the final CSES dataset by harmonizing the single country studies into a cross-national dataset. It is also responsible for collecting the district and macro data, for data documentation, and for ensuring data quality. The Secretariat, furthermore, maintains the CSES website, promotes the project, provides support to the user community, and organizes conferences and project meetings.

===The Planning Committee, collaborators and the CSES Plenary===

The CSES research agenda, study design, and questionnaires are developed by an international committee of leading scholars in political science, sociology, and survey methodology. This committee is known as the CSES Planning Committee. At the beginning of each new module a new Planning Committee is established. Nominations for the Planning Committee come from the user community, with membership of the Committee then being approved by the CSES Plenary Meeting. The Plenary Meeting is made up of national collaborators from each national election study involved in the CSES. Ideas for new modules can be submitted by anyone. More information on the current planning committee, its members, and subcommittee reports, as well as on past Planning Committees can be found on the CSES website. A list of country collaborators which participate in CSES can also be found on the CSES website.

===Funding and support===

The work of the CSES Secretariat is funded by the American [[National Science Foundation]], the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] and the [[University of Michigan]]’s Center for Political Studies along with in-kind support from participating election studies, additional organizations that sponsor planning meetings and conferences, and the many organizations that fund election studies by CSES collaborators.

==Klingemann Prize==

Each year, the CSES awards the GESIS Klingemann Prize for the best CSES scholarship (paper, book, dissertation, or other scholarly work, broadly defined). The award is sponsored by the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] and is named in honor of Professor Dr. Hans-Dieter Klingemann, co-founder of the CSES, an internationally renowned political scientist who made significant contributions to cross-national electoral research. Nominated works must make extensive use of CSES and have a publication date in the calendar year prior to the award, either in print or online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3561">'''Conditioned satiety''' is one of the three known food-specific forms of suppression of appetite for food by effects of eating, along with [[alliesthesia|alimentary alliesthesia]] and [[sensory-specific satiety]]. ''Conditioned satiety'' was first evidenced in 1955&lt;ref&gt;Le Magnen J. Sur le mécanisme d'établissement des appétits caloriques. [Mechanism of establishment of caloric appetites] ''C. R. Hebd. Séances Acad. Sci.'' 1955; 240: 2436-38.&lt;/ref&gt; in rats by the late French physiologist professor [[Jacques Le Magnen]]. The term was coined in 1972&lt;ref&gt;Booth DA. Conditioned satiety in the rat. ''J Comp Physiol Psychol.'' 1972;81(3):457-71.&lt;/ref&gt; by professor [[David Allenby Booth]]. Unlike the other two sorts of stimulus-specific satiety, this phenomenon is based on [[classical conditioning]]&lt;ref&gt;Booth DA, Davis JD. Gastrointestinal factors in the acquisition of oral sensory control of satiation. ''Physiol Behav.'' 1973;11(1):23-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth DA. Psychology of Nutrition. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1994. 228 pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ATtP1hzNW44C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=%22conditioned+satiety%22+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kMyXdhG_Gv&amp;sig=29SfhS2aFBXYmrMoj5-na3OJaoQ&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=cEplTfiwF4PAhAeqpJyfBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22conditioned%20satiety%22%20definition&amp;f=false full text on google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth DA. Learnt reduction in the size of a meal. Measurement of the sensory-gastric inhibition from conditioned satiety. ''Appetite'' 2009;52(3):745-9.&lt;/ref&gt; but is distinct from [[conditioned taste aversion]] (CTA) in its dependence on internal state towards the end of a meal.

== Description of the phenomenon ==

''Conditioned satiety'' is thought to be acquired when a food with a given flavour is eaten on a partly full stomach and followed promptly by a mildly aversive digestive event ("bloat"). However, it is uncertain if and how this phenomenon may occur under real-life conditions as normally more than food of one given flavor is ingested during a meal. It has been widely misunderstood{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} as an association of the sensory properties of a food with its energy content (calories) or carbohydrate content. However that is a confusion with the conditioning of simple aversion or a contrast with simple conditioned preference. ''Conditioned satiety'' has only been evidenced in experiments with rats,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} monkeys{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} or humans{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} when a flavour and fullness together have been paired with concentrated maltodextrin. When a whole meal of concentrated maltodextrin is eaten without changing its flavour, only the conditioning of preference for the flavour early in the meal is seen. Rats, monkeys and people can learn ''conditioned satiety'' within one or two pairings{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} although in the first experiments{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} the rats needed several days to adapt their intakes because the test food was aversively flavoured or textured. The particularity of ''conditioned satiety'' is that the time lapse between intake (and thus sensory stimulation) and the aversively conditioning after-effect is much shorter (less than 15 minutes) than that feasible for the conditioning of simple aversion to taste, odour or texture by poisoning, which can occur with a delay in postabsorptive effects of 12 or more hours.

'''Emanuel Anthony Posselt''' (1858–1921) was an authority on [[Jacquard loom]]s and weaving. His book on the Jacquard machine is considered to be a classic.&lt;ref name=csbio&gt;[https://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/webdocs/pea_bibl.pdf cs.arizona.edu: "Emanuel Anthony Posselt"], by Ralph E. Griswold&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Posselt, the son of Emanuel Anthony and Elizabeth (Demuth) Posselt, was born in [[Liberec|Reichenberg, Austrian Empire]] (current Liberec, [[Czech Republic]]) on 21 August 1858. Emanuel graduated in 1876 from the [[Imperial Government Weaving School]], also in Reichenberg. During the next two years, he visited most of the important textile manufacturing cities in Europe, and during this time he managed his father's textile mills. In August 1878, he went to the United States, where he worked until 1884 for various textile mills in New England and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

In 1884, Posselt became the inaugural director of the textile division of [[Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art]]. In 1891, he resigned that position to accept the editorship of the [[Textile Record of North America]], at the time a leading trade journal.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt then established a private textile academy and a textile trade book business. He published his own work on the Jacquard machine, the technology of textile design, textile calculations, and cotton, wool and silk industries; as well as works by other authors, such as Gardner on wool dyeing.  The series ''Hand Books of the Textile Industry'' and ''Posselt's Textile Library'', as well as ''Posselt's Textile Journal'' that ran between 1907 and 1923, are his own.  The last was the immediate forerunner of [[Textile World]].&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt died in 1921.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

==Family==

Posselt married in July 1884 at [[Colchester, Vermont]] Anna Clera Pollinger, by whom he had three children: Anna (1896), Elwood (1906) and Gertrude (1908).&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

'''Emergency psychiatry''' is the clinical application of [[psychiatry]] in [[emergency medicine|emergency]] settings.&lt;ref name=Currier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Conditions requiring psychiatric interventions may include [[failed suicide attempt|attempted suicide]], [[substance abuse]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[psychosis]], violence or other rapid [[behavior|changes in behavior]]. Psychiatric emergency services are rendered by professionals in the fields of [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]] and [[social work]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; The demand for emergency psychiatric services has rapidly increased throughout the [[world]] since the 1960s, especially in [[urban area]]s.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipton/&gt; Care for patients in situations involving emergency psychiatry is complex.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Individuals may arrive in psychiatric emergency service settings through their own voluntary request, a referral from another health professional, or through [[involuntary commitment]]. Care of patients requiring psychiatric intervention usually encompasses crisis stabilization of many serious and potentially life-threatening conditions which could include acute or chronic [[mental illness|mental disorders]] or symptoms similar to those conditions.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

==Definition==
Symptoms and conditions behind psychiatric emergencies may include [[parasuicide|attempted]] [[suicide]], [[substance dependence]], [[alcohol intoxication]], acute [[clinical depression|depression]], presence of [[delusion]]s, violence, [[panic attack]]s, and significant, rapid changes in behavior.&lt;ref name=ClercqLamarreVergouwen&gt;De Clercq, M.; Lamarre, S.; Vergouwen, H. (1998). ''Emergency Psychiatry and Mental Health Policty: An International Point of View''. New York: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency psychiatry exists to identify and/or [[treatment of mental illness|treat]] these symptoms and psychiatric conditions. In addition, several rapidly lethal medical conditions present themselves with common psychiatric symptoms. A [[physician]]'s or a [[nurse]]'s ability to identify and intervene with these and other medical conditions is critical.&lt;ref name=Currier&gt;Currier, G.W. ''New Developments in Emergency Psychiatry: Medical, Legal, and Economic''. (1999). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delivery of services==
The place where emergency psychiatric services are delivered are most commonly referred to as Psychiatric Emergency Services, Psychiatric Emergency Care Centers, or Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Programs. [[Mental health professional]]s from a wide area of disciplines, including [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[psychology]], and [[social work]] in these settings alongside [[psychiatrist]]s and emergency [[physician]]s.&lt;ref name=Hillard&gt;Hillard, R. &amp; Zitek, B. (2004). ''Emergency Psychiatry''. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The facilities, sometimes housed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], psychiatric ward, or [[emergency department]], provide immediate treatment to both voluntary and involuntary patients [[24 hours a day, 7 days a week]].&lt;ref name=USNews&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=US News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2007-07-15 |title=Glossary |url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/hospitals/articles/glossary.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFNAMI&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=NAMI-San Francisco |accessdate=2007-07-15 |title=Crisis Service |url=http://www.namisf.org/crisis-serv.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710103126/http://www.namisf.org/crisis-serv.html |archivedate=2007-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a protected environment, psychiatric emergency services exist to provide brief stay of two or three days to gain a diagnostic clarity, find appropriate alternatives to psychiatric hospitalization for the patient, and to treat those patients whose symptoms can be improved within that brief period of time.&lt;ref name=AllenM&gt;Allen, M.H. (1995). ''The Growth and Specialization of Emergency Psychiatry''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Even precise psychiatric diagnoses are a secondary priority compared with interventions in a crisis setting.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; The functions of psychiatric emergency services are to assess patients' problems, implement a short-term treatment consisting of no more than ten meetings with the patient, procure a 24-hour holding area, mobilize teams to carry out interventions at patients' residences, utilize emergency management services to prevent further crises, be aware of inpatient and outpatient psychiatric resources, and provide 24/7 [[telephone counseling]].&lt;ref name=Hillard2&gt;Hillard, J.R. (1990). ''Manual of Clinical Emergency Psychiatry''. Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Since the 1960s the demand for emergency psychiatric services has endured a rapid growth due to [[deinstitutionalization]] both in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. Deinstitutionalization, in some locations, has resulted in a larger number of severely mentally ill people living in the community.  There have been increases in the number of medical specialties, and the multiplication of transitory treatment options, such as [[psychiatric medication]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk&gt;Bassuk, E.L. &amp; Birk, A.W. (1984). ''Emergency Psychiatry: Concepts, Methods, and Practices''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipton&gt;Lipton, F.R. &amp; Goldfinger, S.M. (1985).

''Mind, Brain, and Drug: An Introduction to Psychopharmacology''. Boston: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual number of psychiatric emergencies has also increased significantly, especially in psychiatric emergency service settings located in [[urban area]]s.&lt;ref name=ClercqLamarreVergouwen/&gt;

Emergency psychiatry has involved the evaluation and treatment of unemployed, homeless and other disenfranchised populations. Emergency psychiatry services have sometimes been able to offer accessibility, convenience, and anonymity.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; While many of the patients who have used psychiatric emergency services shared common sociological and demographic characteristics, the symptoms and needs expressed have not conformed to any single psychiatric profile.&lt;ref name=Gerson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerson S, Bassuk E |title=Psychiatric emergencies: an overview |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=1980 |pmid=6986089|doi=10.1176/ajp.137.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The individualized care needed for patients utilizing psychiatric emergency services is evolving, requiring an always changing and sometimes complex treatment approach.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

==Scope==

===Suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts===
As of 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated one million suicides in the world each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |title=Suicide prevention (SUPRE) |accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are countless more suicide attempts. Psychiatric emergency service settings exist to treat the mental disorders associated with an increased risk of completed suicide or suicide attempts. Mental health professionals in these settings are expected to predict acts of violence patients may commit against themselves (or others), even though the complex factors leading to a suicide can stem from  many sources, including psychosocial, biological, interpersonal, anthropological, and religious. These mental health professionals will use any resources available to them to determine risk factors, make an overall assessment, and decide on any necessary treatment.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Violent behavior===
Aggression can be the result of both internal and external factors that create a measurable activation in the [[autonomic nervous system]]. This activation can become evident through symptoms such as the clenching of fists or jaw, pacing, slamming doors, hitting palms of hands with fists, or being easily startled. It is estimated that 17% of visits to psychiatric emergency service settings are [[homicide|homicidal]] in origin and an additional 5% involve both suicide and homicide.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hughes DH |title=Suicide and violence assessment in psychiatry |journal=General hospital psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=416–21 |year=1996 |pmid=8937907 |doi= 10.1016/S0163-8343(96)00037-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is also associated with many conditions such as acute intoxication, acute psychosis, [[paranoid personality disorder]], [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]]. Additional risk factors have also been identified which may lead to violent behavior. Such risk factors may include prior arrests, presence of hallucinations, delusions or other neurological impairment, being uneducated, unmarried, etc.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Mental health professionals complete violence risk assessments to determine both security measures and treatments for the patient.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Psychosis===
Patients with [[psychotic]] symptoms are common in psychiatric emergency service settings. The determination of the source of the psychosis can be difficult.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Sometimes patients brought into the setting in a psychotic state have been disconnected from their previous treatment plan. While the psychiatric emergency service setting will not be able to provide long term care for these types of patients, it can exist to provide a brief respite and reconnect the patient to their case manager and/or reintroduce necessary psychiatric medication. A visit to a crisis unit by a patient suffering from a chronic mental disorder may also indicate the existence of an undiscovered precipitant, such as change in the lifestyle of the individual, or a shifting medical condition. These considerations can play a part in an improvement to an existing treatment plan.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

An individual could also be suffering from an acute onset of psychosis. Such conditions can be prepared for diagnosis by obtaining a medical or psychopathological history of a patient, performing a [[mental status examination]], conducting [[psychological testing]], obtaining [[neuroimaging|neuroimages]], and obtaining other neurophysiologic measurements. Following this, the mental health professional can perform a [[differential diagnosis]] and prepare the patient for treatment. As with other patient care considerations, the origins of acute psychosis can be difficult to determine because of the mental state of the patient. However, acute psychosis is classified as a medical emergency requiring immediate and complete attention. The lack of identification and treatment can result in suicide, homicide, or other violence.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

===Substance dependence, abuse and intoxication===
[[Image:Psychoactive Drugs.jpg|right|thumb|Illicit [[psychoactive drugs]], a cause of psychotic symptoms.]]
Another common cause of psychotic symptoms is substance intoxication. These acute symptoms may resolve after a period of observation or limited psychopharmacological treatment. However the underlying issues, such as substance dependence or abuse, is difficult to treat in the emergency department, as it is a long term condition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Both acute [[alcohol intoxication]] as well as other forms of substance abuse can require psychiatric interventions.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Acting as a [[depressant]] of the [[central nervous system]], the early effects of [[ethanol|alcohol]] are usually desired for and characterized by increased talkativeness, giddiness, and a loosening of social inhibitions. Besides considerations of impaired concentration, verbal and motor performance, insight, judgment and short term memory loss which could result in behavioral change causing injury or death, levels of alcohol below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood are usually considered non-lethal. However, individuals at 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood are considered grossly intoxicated and concentration levels at 400 milligrams per deciliter of blood are lethal, causing complete [[anesthesia]] of the [[respiratory system]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Beyond the dangerous behavioral changes that occur after the consumption of certain amounts of alcohol, idiosyncratic intoxication could occur in some individuals even after the consumption of relatively small amounts of alcohol. Episodes of this impairment usually consist of confusion, disorientation, delusions and visual [[hallucination]]s, increased aggressiveness, rage, agitation and violence. Chronic [[alcoholic]]s may also suffer from alcoholic hallucinosis, wherein the cessation of prolonged drinking may trigger auditory hallucinations. Such episodes can last for a few hours or an entire week. [[Antipsychotic]]s are often used to treat these symptoms.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Patients may also be treated for substance abuse following the [[route of administration|administration]] of psychoactive substances containing [[amphetamine]], [[caffeine]], [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], [[cocaine]], [[phencyclidine]]s, or other [[inhalant]]s, [[opioid]]s, [[sedative]]s, [[hypnotic]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, [[psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants]]. Clinicians assessing and treating substance abusers must establish therapeutic rapport to counter [[denial]] and other negative attitudes directed towards treatment. In addition, the clinician must determine substances used, the route of administration, dosage, and time of last use to determine the necessary short and long term treatments. An appropriate choice of treatment setting must also be determined. These settings may include outpatient facilities, partial hospitals, residential treatment centers, or hospitals. Both the immediate and long term treatment and setting is determined by the severity of dependency and seriousness of physiological complications arising from the abuse.&lt;ref name= Hillard/&gt;

===Hazardous drug reactions and interactions===
[[Drug overdose|Overdoses]], [[drug interaction]]s, and dangerous reactions from psychiatric medications, especially antipsychotics, are considered psychiatric emergencies. [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] is a potentially lethal complication of first or second generation antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; If untreated, neuroleptic malignant syndrome can result in fever, muscle rigidity, confusion, unstable vital signs, or even death.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; [[Serotonin syndrome]] can result when [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s or [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s mix with [[buspirone]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Severe symptoms of serotonin syndrome include [[hyperthermia]], delirium, and [[tachycardia]] that may lead to shock. Often patients with severe general medical symptoms, such as unstable vital signs, will be transferred to a general medical emergency department or medicine service for increased monitoring.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Personality disorders===
Disorders manifesting dysfunction in areas related to [[cognition]], [[affect (psychology)|affectivity]], interpersonal functioning and impulse control can be considered [[personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fourth Edition''. Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Patients suffering from a personality disorder will usually not complain about symptoms resulting from their disorder. Patients suffering an emergency phase of a personality disorder may showcase combative or suspicious behavior, suffer from brief psychotic episodes, or be delusional. Compared with outpatient settings and the general population, the prevalence of individuals suffering from personality disorders in inpatient psychiatric settings is usually 7–25% higher. Clinicians working with such patients attempt to stabilize the individual to their baseline level of function.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Anxiety===
Patients suffering from an extreme case of [[anxiety]] may seek treatment when all support systems have been exhausted and they are unable to bear the anxiety. Feelings of anxiety may present in different ways from an underlying medical illness or psychiatric disorder, a secondary functional disturbance from another psychiatric disorder, from a primary psychiatric disorder such as [[panic disorder]] or [[generalized anxiety disorder]], or as a result of stress from such conditions as [[adjustment disorder]] or [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Clinicians usually attempt to first provide a "safe harbor" for the patient so that assessment processes and treatments can be adequately facilitated.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; The initiation of treatments for mood and anxiety disorders are important as patients suffering from anxiety disorders have a higher risk of premature death.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

===Disasters===
[[Natural disaster]]s and [[man-made hazards]] can cause severe psychological stress in victims surrounding the event. [[Emergency management]] often includes psychiatric emergency services designed to help victims cope with the situation. The impact of disasters can cause people to feel shocked, overwhelmed, immobilized, panic-stricken, or confused. Hours, days, months and even years after a disaster, individuals can experience tormenting memories, vivid nightmares, develop apathy, withdrawal, memory lapses, fatigue, loss of appetite, insomnia, depression, irritability, panic attacks, or dysphoria.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

Due to the typically disorganized and hazardous environment following a disaster, mental health professionals typically assess and treat patients as rapidly as possible. Unless a condition is threatening life of the patient, or others around the patient, other medical and basic survival considerations are managed first. Soon after a disaster clinicians may make themselves available to allow individuals to ventilate to relieve feelings of isolation, helplessness and vulnerability. Dependent upon the scale of the disaster, many victims may suffer from both chronic or acute [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Patients suffering severely from this disorder often are admitted to psychiatric hospitals to stabilize the individual.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

===Abuse===
Incidents of [[physical abuse]], [[sexual abuse]] or [[rape]] can result in dangerous outcomes to the victim of the criminal act. Victims may suffer from extreme anxiety, fear, helplessness, confusion, eating or sleeping disorders, hostility, guilt and shame. Managing the response usually encompasses coordinating psychological, medical and legal considerations. Dependent upon legal requirements in the region, mental health professionals may be required to report criminal activity to a police force. Mental health professionals will usually gather identifying data during the initial assessment and refer the patient, if necessary, to receive medical treatment. Medical treatment may include a [[physical examination]], collection of medicolegal evidence, and determination of the risk of [[pregnancy]], if applicable.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatments in psychiatric emergency service settings are typically transitory in nature and only exist to provide dispositional solutions and/or to stabilize life-threatening conditions.&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Once stabilized, patients suffering chronic conditions may be transferred to a setting which can provide long term [[psychiatric rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name=Bassuk/&gt; Prescribed treatments within the emergency service setting vary dependent upon the patient's condition.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;Walker, J.I. (1983) ''Psychiatric Emergencies''. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott.&lt;/ref&gt; Different forms of psychiatric medication, [[psychotherapy]], or [[electroconvulsive therapy]] may be used in the emergency setting.&lt;ref name= Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=RundHutzler&gt;Rund, D.A, &amp; Hutzler, J.C. (1983). ''Emergency Psychiatry''. St. Louis: The C.V. Mosby Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter&gt;Potter, M. (2007, May 31). ''[http://www.nihrc.org/dms/data/NIHRC/attachments/dd/files/91/Mental_health_issues_(Michael_Potter).pdf Setting the Standards: Human Rights and Health – Mental Health]''. Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction and efficacy of psychiatric medication as a treatment option in psychiatry has reduced the utilization of physical restraints in emergency settings, by reducing dangerous symptoms resulting from acute exacerbation of mental illness or substance intoxication.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;

===Medications===
With time as a critical aspect of emergency psychiatry, the rapidity of effect is an important consideration.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; [[Pharmacokinetics]] is the movement of drugs through the body with time and is at least partially reliant upon the [[route of administration]], [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]], [[distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]] and [[metabolism]] of the medication.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name=HolfordSheiner&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holford N.H.G |author2=Sheiner L.B. | year = 1981 | title = Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling in vivo | url = | journal = CRC Critical Reviews in Bioengineering | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 273–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common route of administration is oral administration, however if this method is to work the drug must be able to get to the stomach and stay there.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; In cases of [[vomiting]] and nausea this method of administration is not an option. [[Suppositories]] can, in some situations, be administered instead.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; Medication can also be administered through [[intramuscular injection]], or through [[intravenous therapy|intravenous injection]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;

The amount of time required for absorption varies dependent upon many factors including drug [[solubility]], gastrointestinal [[motility]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; If a medication is administered orally the amount of [[food]] in the stomach may also affect the rate of absorption.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; Once absorbed medications must be distributed throughout the body, or usually with the case of psychiatric medication, past the [[blood–brain barrier]] to the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt; With all of these factors affecting the rapidity of effect, the time until the effects are evident varies. Generally, though, the timing with medications is relatively fast and can occur within several minutes. As an example, physicians usually expect to see a remission of symptoms thirty minutes after [[haloperidol]], an antipsychotic, is administered intramuscularly.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; [[Antipsychotics]], especially [[Haloperidol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=3298219|year=2012|author1=Wilson|first1=M. P.|title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup|journal=Western Journal of Emergency Medicine|volume=13|issue=1|pages=26–34|last2=Pepper|first2=D|last3=Currier|first3=G. W.|last4=Holloman Jr|first4=G. H.|last5=Feifel|first5=D|doi=10.5811/westjem.2011.9.6866|pmid=22461918}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as assorted [[benzodiazepines]] are the most frequently used drugs in emergency psychiatry, especially agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2507712|year=2008|author1=Wilhelm|first1=S|title=Use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in patients with psychiatric emergencies: Results of an observational trial|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=61|last2=Schacht|first2=A|last3=Wagner|first3=T|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-8-61|pmid=18647402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
Other treatment methods may be used in psychiatric emergency service settings. [[Brief therapy|Brief psychotherapy]] can be used to treat acute conditions or immediate problems as long as the patient understands his or her issues are psychological, the patient trusts the physician, the physician can encourage hope for change, the patient has motivation to change, the physician is aware of the psychopathological history of the patient, and the patient understands that their confidentiality will be respected.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; The process of brief therapy under emergency psychiatric conditions includes the establishment of a primary complaint from the patient, realizing psychosocial factors, formulating an accurate representation of the problem, coming up with ways to solve the problem, and setting specific goals.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; The information gathering aspect of brief psychotherapy is therapeutic because it helps the patient place his or her problem in the proper perspective.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; If the physician determines that deeper psychotherapy sessions are required, he or she can transition the patient out of the emergency setting and into an appropriate clinic or center.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;

===ECT===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] is a controversial form of treatment which [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)#Additional rights|cannot be involuntarily applied]] in psychiatric emergency service settings.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter/&gt; Instances wherein a patient is depressed to such a severe degree that the patient cannot be stopped from hurting himself or herself or when a patient refuses to swallow, eat or drink medication, electroconvulsive therapy could be suggested as a therapeutic alternative.&lt;ref name=RundHutzler/&gt; While preliminary research suggests that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, it usually requires a course of six to twelve sessions of convulsions lasting at least 20 seconds for those antidepressant effects to occur.&lt;ref name=Hedges/&gt;

==Observation and collateral information==
There are other essential aspects of emergency psychiatry: observation and collateral information. The observation of the patient's behavior is an important aspect of emergency psychiatry inasmuch as it allows the clinicians working with the patient to estimate prognosis and improvements/declines in condition. Many jurisdictions base involuntary commitment on dangerousness or the inability to care for one's basic needs. Observation for a period of time may help determine this. For example, if a patient who is committed for violent behavior in the community, continues to behave in an erratic manner without clear purpose, this will help the staff decide that hospital admission may be needed.

Collateral information or parallel information is information obtained from family, friends or treatment providers of the patient. Some jurisdictions require consent from the patient to obtain this information while others do not. For example, with a patient who is thought to be paranoid about people following him or spying on him, this information can be helpful discern if these thoughts are more or less likely to be based in reality. Past episodes of suicide attempts or violent behavior can be confirmed or disproven.

==Disposition==
Patient receive emergency services often on a time limited basis such as 24 or 72 hours. After this time, and sometimes earlier, the staff must decide the next place for the patient to receive services. This is referred to as disposition. This is one of the essential features of emergency psychiatry.

===Hospital admission===
[[Image:EmergencyPsychiatryProcess.PNG|thumb|right|The emergency care process.]]
The staff will need to determine if the patient needs to be admitted to a psychiatric inpatient facility or if they can be safely discharged to the community after a period of observation and/or brief treatment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Initial emergency psychiatric evaluations usually involve patients who are acutely agitated, [[paranoid]], or who are suicidal. Initial evaluations to determine admission and interventions are designed to be as therapeutic as possible.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt;

====Involuntary commitment====
[[Involuntary commitment]], or sectioning, refers to situations where [[police officer]]s, health officers, or [[Health care provider|health professionals]] classify an individual as dangerous to themselves, others, [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)#5150 criteria|gravely disabled]], or mentally ill according to the applicable government law for the region. After an individual is transported to a psychiatric emergency service setting, a preliminary professional assessment is completed which may or may not result in [[involuntary treatment]].&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Some patients may be discharged shortly after being brought to psychiatric emergency services while others will require longer observation and the need for continued involuntary commitment will exist. While some patients may initially come voluntarily, it may be realized that they pose a risk to themselves or others and involuntary commitment may be initiated at that point.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

====Referrals and voluntary hospitalization====
In some locations, such as the United States, voluntary hospitalizations are outnumbered by involuntary commitments partly due to the fact that insurance tends not to pay for hospitalization unless an imminent danger exists to the individual or community. In addition, psychiatric emergency service settings admit approximately one third of patients from [[assertive community treatment]] centers.&lt;ref name=Hillard/&gt; Therefore, patients who are not admitted will be referred to services in the community.

The '''European Joint Master degree in Economics''' provides a rigorous education in fundamental quantitative tools by combining economic theory with related quantitative disciplines such as [[Econometrics]], [[Finance]], [[Actuarial Science]], [[Probability]], [[Statistics]], Mathematical Modeling, [[Computation]] and [[Simulation]], [[Experimental Design]], and [[Political Science]], managed by consortia of higher education institutions from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index_en.php|title=The Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency of the European Commission - EACEA|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European Joint Master degree in Economics was the Erasmus Mundus [[QEM]] - Models and Methods of Quantitative Economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://erasmusmundus-qem.univ-paris1.fr/|title=Master QEM Erasmus Mundus: Master Economics QEM Erasmus Mundus France|author=Master QEM Erasmus Mundus - Pantheon Sorbonne university|work=univ-paris1.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was  approved by the European Union in 2006 as international graduate degree program  designed by a Consortium of European Universities. The number of European universities or institutions making up a consortia varies from the degree awarding program. The nature of the degree differs from other [[master's degree]] in Economics or finance.  Compared to the [[Master of Finance]] or [[Master of Economics]], this European degree is joint and prepares graduate for a wide range of careers which utilize their competency in economics, including [[economic theory]], [[macroeconomics]] and financial forecasting, financial engineering and risk management, quantitative asset management, computational economics, quantitative trading, and applied and theoretical research. Unlike programs which are substantially quantitative, this degree provide a merge of both theory and empirics useful in practice.

Closely related degrees include the "Master of Quantitative Finance and Economics" and "Master of Finance and Economics".

Often, the degree prepares graduates for  both research orientation for further studies and in the job market for positions in government organizations, private companies or financial institutions. This joint degree is officially recognized as a master degree in each university and each country with the same rights and duties with the national degree.

The degree is gaining in recognition as graduate placements have increased over the past few years.

== Structure ==
European Joint Master degree in Economics is usually two years in duration, and typically include a [[thesis]], an [[internship]] or [[research]] component. The programs require a [[bachelor's degree]] or an equivalent qualification at the same level, i.e. 180 ECTS credits in the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] prior to admission.
A typical requirement is exposure to economics, mathematics, applied mathematics, quantitative economics or finance. Like many master programs in Economics or finance, a review of [[statistics]], [[probability]] theory, [[linear algebra]] and [[calculus]] are provided as a preliminary course. The curriculum is distributed between theory, applications, and simulations, with the emphasis on each differing by university in the [[consortium]]. The degree programs are usually funded by the [[Erasmus Mundus]] Scholarship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7233">'''Fratire''' is a type of 21st-century fiction literature written for and marketed to young men in a [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] and overtly [[masculinity|masculine]] fashion. The term was coined following the popularity of works by [[George Ouzounian]] (writing under the pen name Maddox) and [[Tucker Max]].&lt;ref name="NY TIMES"/&gt; Described as a satirical celebration of traditional masculinity, the genre has been criticized for allegedly promoting [[sexism]] and [[misogyny]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Johnson, "The Subtleties of Blatant Sexism", ''Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies'', Volume 4, Issue 2 June 2007 , pages 166 - 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre==
Fratire generally features male protagonists, usually in their twenties and thirties. It is characterized by masculine themes and could be considered the male equivalent of [[chick lit]].&lt;ref name="NY TIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Harkin | first = James | title = The return of the real man | publisher = Financial Times (September 15, 2006) | date =  | url = http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto091520060937397349 | accessdate = 2010-06-20 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was popularized by [[Tucker Max]]'s ''[[I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell]]'' and [[Maddox (writer)|Maddox's]] webpage titled [[The Best Page in the Universe]] and his book ''[[The Alphabet of Manliness]]''. According to one of the authors, "fratire as a genre represents the non-mainstream literary reaction to the feminization of masculinity," although not all the books address this so directly.&lt;ref name="maddox"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tucker-max/pass-the-beer-in-defense_b_22530.html |title = Pass the Beer: In Defense of "Fratire" |publisher  = The Huffington Post (August 6, 2006)|author = Tucker Max|date =|accessdate = 2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Fratire is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] and [[satire]]. The term was introduced by ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[Warren St. John]] in a 2006 article titled ''Dude, here's my book''. Allegedly, it was the only word allowed by the editor.&lt;ref name="NY TIMES"&gt;{{cite news | last = St. John | first = Warren | title = Dude, Here's My Book | publisher = New York Times (April 16, 2006) | date = April 16, 2006| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/fashion/sundaystyles/16CADS.html | accessdate = 2008-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maddox"/&gt;  Tucker Max, after first hearing the term during a telephone interview with St. John, said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Great Holy Jesus. Warren, that is awful. First off, I wasn't in a fraternity. Neither was Maddox. In fact, none of the writers you are profiling in your article was in a frat. Please, call it anything else."&lt;ref name="maddox"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term aimed to classify the recent publication of male-centric books that focused on alcohol and sexual themes. Publishers continued to push the genre as a sales tactic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/tag/fratire/products ''Fratire products''] Amazon.com, Retrieved on 2008-09-14&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the books published by Max and Maddox, publishers and reporters attempted to capitalize on the trend with new iterations of the word, including "[[lad-lit]]," "dicklit," "frat-lit" and "menaissance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Criticism of fratire==
[[Melissa Lafsky]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the genre as "[[misogyny]] for sale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melissa-lafsky/misogyny-for-sale-the-ne_b_22313.html |title= Misogyny for sale: The new "Frat-Lit" trend |publisher  = The Huffington Post |last = Lafsky | first = Melissa | authorlink = Melissa Lafsky| date= 6 June 2006|accessdate = 22 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lafsky wrote that fratire authors were profiting by fueling young male anger concerning societal demands for equality. In a [[Salon.com]] interview with [[Rebecca Traister]], Ouzounian said his writing was a nostalgic parody of old-fashioned masculinity and that society had moved too far forward to return to those concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Traister|first=Rebecca|authorlink=Rebecca Traister|title=It's a man's world|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date= 2 June 2006|url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/06/02/maddox_qa/|accessdate=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Public Radio International]], Maddox offered the suggestion that the misogyny often associated with the genre of fratire had become more acceptable because women are stronger than they've ever been in society, and that singling out women as the only group not okay to lampoon is a sexist act in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://216.22.0.192/images/maddox_pri.mp3|title = Save the males|publisher = Public Radio International |author = To The Best of our Knowledge|date = 29 June 2006 |accessdate = 29 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 article, [[Kira Cochrane]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' disputed that idea, stating there still remained much inequality between men and women. Cochran called the fratire genre a regression to old-fashioned sexism "presented under the veil of irony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title =Retrosexual, or just misogynist?|work=[[New Statesman]]|date= 5 June 2008|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2008/06/cochrane-women-woman-long|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The French National Sequencing Center''' ('''Genoscope''') was created in 1996 in [[Évry, Essonne|Évry]], [[France]]. It has been involved in the [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] of the [[human genome]]. The center's name is meant to personify what it is to be a gene.

==Details==
The Genoscope is a member of the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|CEA]], and employs around 130 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microbiome-standards.org/index.php?id=86&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2530">A '''glass code''' is a method of classifying [[glass]]es for [[optics|optical]] use, such as the manufacture of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[prism (optics)|prisms]]. There are many different types of glass with different compositions and optical properties, and a glass code is used to distinguish between them.

There are several different glass classification schemes in use, most based on the catalogue systems used by glass manufacturers such as [[Pilkington]] and [[Schott Glass]]. These tend to be based on the material composition, for example ''BK7'' is the Schott Glass classification of a common [[borosilicate glass|borosilicate]] [[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]].

The '''international glass code''' is based on [[U.S. military standard]] MIL-G-174, and is a six-digit number specifying the glass according to its [[refractive index]] ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; at the [[Fraunhofer line|Fraunhofer]] d- (or D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-) line, and its [[Abbe number]] ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; also taken at that line.

The resulting glass code is the value of ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;-1 rounded to three digits, followed by ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; rounded to three digits, with all decimal points ignored. For example, BK7 has ''n''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.5168 and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 64.17, giving a six-digit glass code of 517642.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newportglass.com/GeneCd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows some example glasses and their glass code. Note that the glass properties can vary slightly between different manufacturer types.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oharacorp.com/pdf/cross-ref-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:globec logo.jpg|150px|right|]]
'''Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics''' (GLOBEC) is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP) core project responsible for understanding how global change will affect the abundance, diversity and productivity of marine populations. The programme was initiated by [[Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research|SCOR]] and the IOC of [[UNESCO]] in 1991, to understand how global change will affect the abundance, [[biodiversity|diversity]] and productivity of marine populations comprising a major component of [[oceanic ecosystem]]s.

The aim of GLOBEC is to advance our understanding of the structure and functioning of the global ocean ecosystem, its major subsystems, and its response to physical forcing so that a capability can be developed to forecast the responses of the marine ecosystem to global change.

==Structure==
GLOBEC encompasses an integrated suite of research activities consisting of Regional Programmes, National Activities and cross-cutting research focal activities. The GLOBEC programme has been developed by the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) and is co-ordinated through the GLOBEC International Project Office (IPO).

'''Regional Programmes:'''
*Ecosystem Structure of Subarctic Seas (ESSAS)
*CLimate Impacts on Oceanic TOp Predators (CLIOTOP)
*[[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]] Cod and Climate Change (CCC)
*[[North Pacific Marine Science Organization|PICES]] Climate Change and Carrying Capacity (CCCC)
*Southern Ocean GLOBEC (SO GLOBEC)
*Small Pelagic Fish and Climate Change (SPACC)
**{{see also|Fisheries and climate change}}

'''National Programmes:'''

GLOBEC has several active national programmes and scientists from nearly 30 countries participate in GLOBEC activities on a national or regional level.

[[Image:national wiki.jpg|national wiki.jpg]]

'''Focus Working Groups:'''

There are four GLOBEC cross-cutting research focal activities:
*Focus 1. Retrospective analysis
*Focus 2. Process studies
*Focus 3. [[Prediction]] and [[Scientific modelling|modelling]]
*Focus 4. Feedback from [[ecosystem change]]s

==Publications==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:globec newsletter.jpg|right|GLOBEC International Newsletter||{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 July 2009}}]] --&gt;
GLOBEC produces a report series, special contributions series and a biannual newsletter, all of which can be downloaded from the [http://www.globec.org GLOBEC website.]  GLOBEC science has contributed to over 2000 refereed scientific publications which can be searched from a database on the GLOBEC website.

'''Health communication''' is the study and practice of communicating [[Health promotion|promotional health information]], such as in [[public health]] campaigns, [[health education]], and between doctor and patient.&lt;ref name="What is Communication?"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Communication? |url=http://www.natcom.org/Tertiary.aspx?id=236&amp;terms=health%20communication |publisher=[[National Communication Association]] |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of disseminating health information is to influence personal health choices by improving [[health literacy]].

Because effective health communication must be tailored for the audience and the situation,&lt;ref name=EHS&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beato |first=Ricardo R. |author2=Jana Telfer |title=Communication as an Essential Component of Environmental Health Science |journal=Journal of Environmental Health |date=July–August 2010 |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=24–25 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/Docs/JEH/2010/July-Aug_Beato_Telfer.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; research into health communication seeks to refine communication strategies to inform people about ways to enhance health or to avoid specific health risks.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=Health Communication Basics|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/healthbasics/whatishc.html|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academically, health communication is a discipline within [[communication studies]].&lt;ref name="What is Communication?"/&gt;

Health communication may variously seek to:
* increase audience knowledge and awareness of a health issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gwyn|first1=Richard|title=Communicating health and illness|date=2002|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=0761964754}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* influence behaviors and attitudes towards a health issue
* demonstrate healthy practices
* demonstrate the benefits of behavior changes to [[public health]] outcomes
* advocate a position on a health issue or policy
* increase demand or support for health services
* argue against misconceptions about health&lt;ref name=HD&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freimuth|first=Vicki S.|author2=Sandra Crouse Quinn|title=The Contributions of Health Communication to Eliminating Health Disparities|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=December 2004|volume=94|issue=12|pages=2053–2055|doi=10.2105/ajph.94.12.2053|pmc=1448587}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
The term was generated when members of an ICA, [[International Communication Association]], interest group adopted the term. Interdisciplinary marriage between health and communication was certainly a common-law relationship long before the term "health communication" was introduced. (Stacks &amp; Salween, page 489)
The research of health communication surrounds the development of effective messages about health, the dissemination of health-related information through broadcast, print, and electronic media, and the role of inter personal relationships in health communities. At the core of all of the communication is the idea of health and the emphasis of health. The goal of health communication research is to identify and provide better and more effective communication strategies that will improve the overall health of society. (Stacks &amp; Salween, page 489)

==Research==
There are many purposes and reasons why health communication research is important and how it betters the health care field. The training programs of Health Care Professionals, or HCP, can be adapted and developed based on health communication research. (Stacks &amp; Salween, 495) Due to there being a diverse culture that makes up the group of patients within the health care field, communication to other cultures has been taught and has been made a focus in health care training classes. Research suggests that nonverbal and verbal communication between health care professionals and patient can lead to improved patient outcomes. According to Stacks and Salween on page 496 some health care facilities, like hospitals are providing training and education materials to patients. The goal of hospitals doing this is to allow for patients to have a better outcome due to better communication skills.
Over the years, there has been much research done on health communication. For example, researchers want to know if people are more effectively motivated by a positive message versus a negative message. Researchers examine ideas like, are people better motivated by ideas of wealth and safety or an idea of illness and death. Researchers are examining which dimensions of persuasive incentives are most influential: physical health versus economic, versus psychological, versus moral, versus social. (Stacks &amp; Salween, 497)
Impact of the Health Campaign-After research has been conducted and analyzed on the effects of health communication, it can be concluded that a health communication campaign that is requiring a behavior change causes the desired behavior change in about 7%-10%  or more in the people who are in the campaign site than those who are in the control group. Also, the effects are stronger for adoption of a new behavior than cessation of a current behavior, about 12% higher.

When assessing how affective a health campaign is, the key determinant is the degree of audience reception, the quality and quantity of the message, the dissemination channels, and the larger communication environment. It is possible that an audience can be more receptive to some messages than others. The media channel and how the message is reached by the audience can affect the effectiveness of the health campaign. (Stacks &amp; Salween page 498)

The efforts and effects of health messages and communication are often counter affected by alcohol and tobacco commercials. The advertisement for these items is often made to be glamorous and will contradict what was said in the health campaign. This can lead to the efforts of the health communication seem to be pointless.

==Training==
Health communication professionals are specifically trained in methods and strategies for effective communication of [[public health]] messages, with qualifications in research, strategic development, and evaluating effectiveness.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Health communication is taught in [[Master's degree|master's]] and doctoral programs.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Timothy|author2=James N. Hyde|title=An Alumni-Based Evaluation of Graduate Training in Health Communication: Results of a Survey on Careers, Salaries, Competencies, and Emerging Trends|journal=Journal of Health Communication|date=November 2004|pages=5–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition for Health Communication maintains a list of such programs.&lt;ref name=CHC&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Programs in Health Communication|url=http://www.healthcommunication.net/CHC/gradprograms/grad%20programs.htm|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and practitioners in health communication are often trained in disciplines such as [[communication studies]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[public health]], or [[medicine]] and then focus within their field on either health or communication. Practitioners are pragmatic and draw from social-scientific scholarship, theories from the humanities, and professional fields such as education, management, law and marketing (Maibach 2008). Professionals trained in health communication encounter a wide range of employment opportunities spanning between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and have the opportunity for a large amount of career mobility.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt; Examples of jobs in each of these categories include federal, state, and local health departments in the public sector, Pharmaceutical companies and large corporations in the private sector, and various non-profit organizations such as the [[American Cancer Society]] and the [[American Heart Association]] in the volunteer sector.

==Overview==
[[International Communication Association]] officially recognized health communication in 1975; in 1997, the [[American Public Health Association]] categorised health communication as a discipline of [[Public Health]] Education and Health Promotion.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

Careers in the field of health communication range widely between the public, private, and volunteer sectors and professionals of health communication are distinctively trained to conduct communication research, develop successful and repeatable campaigns for health promotion and advocacy, and to evaluate how effective these strategies have been for future campaigns.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt;

Clear communication is essential to successful [[public health]] practice at every level of the [[ecological model]]: intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, organizational, and societal. In each instance of health communication, there must be careful deliberation concerning the appropriate channel for messages to best reach the target audience, ranging from face-to-face interactions to television, Internet, and other forms of [[mass media]].&lt;ref name=HTB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parvis|first=Leo|title=How to Benefit From Health Communication|journal=Journal of Environmental Health|date=Jul–Aug 2002|volume=65|issue=1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent explosion of new [[Internet]] communication technologies, particularly through the development of health websites (such as [[MedlinePlus]], Healthfinder, and [[WebMD]]), online support groups (such as the Association for Cancer Online Resources), web portals, tailored information systems, telehealth programs, electronic health records, [[social networking]], and [[mobile devices]] (cell phones, PDAs, etc.) means that the potential media are ever changing.

The social and cultural contexts in which health communication occurs are also widely diverse and can include (but are not limited to) homes, schools, doctor’s offices, and workplaces, and messages must consider the variant levels of health literacy and education of their audience, as well as demographics, values, socioeconomic issues, and many other factors that may influence effective communication.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt;

=== Critical Health Communication ===
Critical Health Communication refers to scholarship that interrogates "how meanings and enactments of health are tied to issues of power through the systematic construction and maintenance of inequalities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=“Doing” Critical Health Communication. A Forum on Methods {{!}} Frontiers Research Topic|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It examines links with culture, resources, and other social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7691/doing-critical-health-communication-a-forum-on-methods|title=“Doing” Critical Health Communication. A Forum on Methods {{!}} Frontiers Research Topic|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from mainstream Health Communication in its emphasis on qualitative and interpretive methods, and its attention to the ideological processes that underpin shared understandings of health. Unlike much mainstream Health Communication, most Critical Health Communication holds that simply circulating better quality, or more visible message about health is not enough to meaningfully influence health outcomes or correct health care disparities. The first comprehensive review of Critical Health Communication was published in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zoller|first=Heather M.|last2=Kline|first2=Kimberly N.|date=January 2008|title=Theoretical Contributions of Interpretive and Critical Research in Health Communication|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|journal=Annals of the International Communication Association|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=89–135|doi=10.1080/23808985.2008.11679076|issn=2380-8985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then the volume of Health Communication research taking a critical approach has steadily increased.

==Strategies and methods==
Tailoring a health message is one strategy for persuasive health communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noar|first=Seth M. |author2=Christina N. Benac |author3=Melissa S. Harris|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2007|volume=133|issue=4|pages=673–693|pmid=17592961|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.4.673|title=Does tailoring matter? Meta-analytic review of tailored print health behavior change interventions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For messages of health communication to reach selected audiences accurately and quickly, health communication professionals must assemble a collection of superior and audience appropriate information that target population segments. Understanding the audience for the information is critical to effective delivery.

Communication is an enigma that is detrimental to the healthcare world and to the resulting health of a patient. Communication is an activity that involves oral speech, voice, tone, nonverbal body language, listening and more. It is a process for a mutual understanding to come at hand during interpersonal connections. A patient’s communication with their healthcare team and vice versa, affects the outcome of their health. Strong, clear, and positive relationships with physicians can chronically improve and increase the condition of a certain patient. Through two approaches, the biomedical model and the biopsychosocial model; this can be successfully achieved. Evidence has shown that communication and its traditions have altered throughout the years. With the use of many new discoveries and the changes within our technology market, communication has severely improved and become instantaneous.

Communicators need to continually synthesize knowledge from a range of other scholarly disciplines including marketing, psychology, and behavioural sciences.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Once this information has been collected, professionals can choose from a variety of methods and strategies of communication that they believe would best convey their message. These methods include [[Advocacy|campaigns]], entertainment advocacy, media advocacy, new technologies, and interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

===Campaigns===
Health Communication campaigns are arguably the most utilized and effective method for spreading [[public health]] messages, especially in endorsing disease prevention (e.g. [[cancer]], [[HIV/AIDS]]) and in general health promotion and wellness (e.g. [[family planning]], [[reproductive health]]).&lt;ref name="HTB"/&gt; The [[Institute of Medicine]] argues that health communication campaigns tend to organize their message for a diverse audience in one of three ways:&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;
* By catering to the common denominator within the audience
* By creating one central message and then later making systematic alterations in order to better reach a certain audience segment, while retaining the same central message
* By creating distinctly different messages for different audience segments
Both the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and scholars of health communication emphasize the importance of [[strategic planning]] throughout a campaign.  This includes a variety of steps to ensure a well-developed message is being communicated:&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;
* Reviewing background information to define what the problem is and who is affected by the problem
* Setting communication objectives and proposing a plan to meet the wanted outcome
* Analyze the target audience by determining interests, attitudes, behaviors, benefits, and barriers
* Select channels and materials for communication in relation to what will most effectively reach audiences
* Develop and pretest message concepts to determine understanding, acceptance, and reaction to the message
* Implement communication with selected audience and monitor exposures and reactions to the message
* Assess the outcome and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the campaign, noting if changes need to be made

====Historical campaigns====

=====American smallpox epidemic=====
In 1721, health communication was used to mitigate the smallpox epidemic in Boston. Cotton Mather, a political leader, used pamphlets and speeches to promote inoculation of smallpox.Alcohol abuse has been a problem within society for about as long as alcohol has been around. In the 19th century, the Women’s Christian Temperance Union led a movement against alcohol abuse. They utilized mass communication to communicate the desired message. News papers and magazines allowed for the promotion of the anti-alcohol movement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/when-cotton-mather-fought-smallpox|title=When Cotton Mather Fought The Smallpox {{!}} AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cardiovascular disease=====
Three-community study and the five-city project were experimental campaigns to inform middle-aged men about the causes of [[cardiovascular disease]]. Health messages were communicated via television, radio, newspaper, cookbooks, booklets, and bus cards. The three "communities" comprised three experimental communication strategies: a media-only campaign, a media campaign supplemented with face-to-face communication, and a no-intervention [[control group]]. The experimented revealed that after one year, the most informed at-risk men were those in the second experimental group: they men consumed the media campaign and were attended by a [[health care provider]].

===Communication channels===

====Entertainment media====
Using the entertainment industry as a platform for advocating health information and education is a communication strategy that has become increasingly popular. The most utilized strategy is for health communication professionals to create partnerships with storyline creators so that public health information can be incorporated into within the plot of a television show. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has formed a strong partnership with Hollywood, Health, and Society, at the [[University of Southern California]] [[Norman Lear Center]] to continue to produce new storylines on television and in film studios that will help to promote public health information.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Some of the resources provided with this partnership include comprehensive "tip sheets" to provide writers with easy to access and trustworthy information on health issues, and meetings and panels to discuss new information and resources. Some of the most notable examples of this method of communication in recent years have been with the films ''Contagion'' and ''I Am Legend'' in understanding the spread of disease, ''NBC's'' series ''Parenthood'' in Asperger's Syndrome, and with the ''CW's'' series ''90210'' and spreading cancer awareness. More recently, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] focused specifically on health films have been organised by the [[American Public Health Association]], [[International Health Film Festival|the International Health Film Festival]], the Global Health Film Initiative of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] and the [[Public Health Film Society]]&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1757913915619120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apha.org/events-and-meetings/annual/schedule/film-festival&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalhealthfilm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/40/1/169/3089818&lt;/ref&gt;.

Writers and storyline developers have an increased motivation to continue to incorporate public health information into their scripts with the creation of the Sentinel for Health Awards in 2000, which honors storylines that effectively promote health topics and audience awareness of [[public health]] issues.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Surveys conducted by [[Porter Novelli]] in 2001 reported many interesting statistics on the effectiveness of this strategy, such as that over half of regular prime time and daytime drama viewers have reported that they have learned something about health promotion or disease prevention from a TV show.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Amongst this data, minority groups are significantly represented with well over half of African American and Hispanic viewers stating that they had either taken some form of preventative action after hearing about a health issue on TV, or that a TV storyline helped them to provide vital health information to a friend or family member.

====Direct marketing====
{{Main|Social marketing}}
[[File:Text messaging used to provide encouragement to quit smoking.png|thumb|Some health organizations manage text messaging services to help people avoid smoking]]
Media advocacy use strategic mass media tools combined with widespread organization in order to advocate for healthy public policies or lifestyles.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; This can include the use of [[text messaging]] and [[email]] to spread messages from person to person, and using [[social networking]] venues to promote health information to a wide-ranging audience. As technologies expand, the platforms for health communication through media advocacy will undoubtedly expand as well.

====Interpersonal communication====
Health communication relies on strong interpersonal communications in order to influence health decisions and behaviours. The most important of these relationships are the connection and interaction between an individual and their [[health care provider]] (e.g., physician, therapist, pharmacist) and an individual's social support system (family, friends, community). These connections can positively influence the individual's decision to make healthy choices.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Patients are more prone to listen when they feel invested emotionally into the situation. If they feel as if they understand what is being said, they are more prone to make objective decisions based on the information heard.

==Applications==
Health communication has become essential in promoting the general [[public health]] in myriad situations. One of health communication's most important applications has been throughout major Environmental events (e.g. [[hurricanes]], [[flooding]], [[tornado]]s) and addressing the affected audience's questions and needs quickly and efficiently, keeping the protection of [[public health]] and the forefront of their message.&lt;ref name="EHS"/&gt; Health communication professionals are constantly working to improve this type of risk communication in order to be prepared in the case of an emergency.

Another increasingly important application of health communication has been in reaching students in the college community. The National College Health Assessment has measured that 92.5% of college students reported being in "good, very good, or excellent health", however college students seem to battle serious problems with stress, depression, substance abuse, and a general lack of nutrition in comparison to other age groups and audiences.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|author2=Nichole Egbert |author3=Evelyn Ho |title=Everyday Health Communication Experiences of College Students|journal=Journal of American College Health|date=Jan–Feb 2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=427–435|doi=10.3200/jach.56.44.427-436}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Professionals in health communication are actively striving for new ways to reach this at-risk audience in order to raise standards of [[public health]] in the college setting and to promote a healthier life style amongst students.

==Challenges==
There are many challenges in communicating information about health to individuals. Some of the most essential issues have to do with the gap between individual health literacy and healthcare workers and institutions, as well as flaws in communicating health information through mass media.

===Literacy-communication gap===
{{Further|Health literacy}}

One problem that health communication seeks to address is the gap that has formed between health literacy and the use of health communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication Yearbook 19|year=1996|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=187–227|vauthors=Viswanath K, Finnegan JR |authorlink=The knowledge gap hypothesis: twenty-five years later|editor=Burleson, B|chapter=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the goal is that health communication will effectively ''lead'' to health literacy, issues such as the use of unexplained medical jargon, ill-formed messages, and often a general educational gap have created a disparity. Specifically, studies have been done amongst elderly populations in America to illustrate a common audience who is left at a disadvantage due to this issue.&lt;ref name=LCG&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hester|first=Eva Jackson|title=An Investigation of the Relationship Between Health Literacy and Social Communication Skills in Older Adults|journal=Communication Disorders Quarterly|date=February 2009|volume=30|issue=2|pages=112–119|doi=10.1177/1525740108324040}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The older adults comprise an age group that generally suffers from the most chronic health conditions in comparison to other age groups, however studies have shown{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} that even this group have difficulty understanding written health materials, understanding health care and policies, and generally do not comprehend medical jargon. Such shortcomings of health communication may lead to increased hospitalizations, the inability to respond to and manage a disease or medical condition, and a generally declining health status.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In some populations, health-related websites (e.g., [[WebMD]]) and online support groups (e.g., Association for Cancer Online Resources) have increased access to health information.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt;

===Mass media===
Mass communication is used to promote beneficial changes in behavior among members of populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abroms|first=LC|author2=Maibach, EW|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|year=2008|volume=29|pages=219–34|pmid=18173391|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090824|title=The effectiveness of mass communication to change public behavior.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major criticism of the use of mass media as a method of health communication is the unfortunate ability for false and misinformed messages to spread quickly through the mass media, before they have the chance to be disputed by professionals. This issue may generate unwarranted panic amongst those who receive the messages and be an issue as technology continues to advance. An example of this may be observed in the ongoing distrust of vaccinations due to the publication of numerous messages that wrongly link the childhood measles-mumps-rubella ([[MMR vaccine|MMR]]) vaccination with the development and onset of [[Autism]].&lt;ref name=MMR&gt;{{cite news|last=Brauser|first=Deborah|title=Autism and MMR Vaccine Study an 'Elaborate Fraud,' Charger BMJ|date=January 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed with which this message spread due to new social networking technologies caused many parents to distrust vaccinations and therefore forgo having their children receive the vaccine. Although this panic has been ferociously labeled as fictitious, many still harbor a lingering suspicion towards vaccinations and refuse them, which has caused an immediate [[public health]] concern.

[[Image:Front Entrance to ISAS.jpeg|200px|thumb|Entrance to the ISAS [[Sagamihara Campus]]]]
{{nihongo|'''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science'''|宇宙科学研究所|Uchū kagaku kenkyūjo}} (ISAS) is a [[Japan]]ese national research organization of [[astrophysics]] using [[rocket]]s, [[astronomy|astronomical]] satellites and [[interplanetary probe]]s which played a major role in [[Japan's space development]].  Since 2003, it is a division of [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JAXA History|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/about/history/index_e.html|publisher=JAXA Official Website (English)|accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ISAS originated as part of the [[Institute of Industrial Science]] of the [[University of Tokyo]], where [[Hideo Itokawa]] experimented with miniature [[solid-fuel rocket]]s ([[Pencil Rocket]] and [[Baby Rocket]]) in the 1950s.  This experimentation eventually led to the development of the [[Kappa_(rocket)|Κ (''Kappa'')]] [[sounding rocket]], which was used for observations during the [[International Geophysical Year]].  By 1960, the Κ-8 rocket had reached an altitude of 200 km.

In 1964, the rocket group and the ''Institute of Aeronautics'', along with [[high altitude balloon|scientific ballooning]] team&lt;!--from Kobe Univ?--&gt;, were merged to form {{nihongo|''Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science''|宇宙航空研究所|Uchū kōkū kenkyūjo}} within the University of Tokyo.  The rocket evolved into the [[Lambda (rocket)|L (''Lambda'')]] series, and, in 1970, L-4S-5 was launched as Japan's first artificial satellite [[Ohsumi (satellite)|Ohsumi]].

Although ''Lambda'' rockets were only sounding rockets, the next generation of [[Mu (rocket family)|M (''Mu'') rocket]]s was intended to be satellite launch vehicles from the start.  Beginning in 1971, ISAS launched a series of [[scientific satellites]] to observe the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]].  Since the launch of [[Hakucho]] in 1979, ISAS has had [[X-ray astronomy]] satellites consecutively in orbit, until it was briefly terminated by the launch failure of [[ASTRO-E]].

In 1981, as a part of university system reform, and for the mission expansion, ISAS was spun out from University of Tokyo as an inter-university national research organization, ''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science''.

In 2003, three national aerospace organizations including ISAS were merged to form [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA).  The English name ''Institute of Space and Astronautical Science'' is still used, although the Japanese name was changed to 宇宙科学研究本部, (literally, ''Space Science Research Division'', whereas the previous name's literal translation was ''Space Science Laboratory'').  In 2010, the name was changed back to the previous {{nihongo||宇宙科学研究所|Uchū kagaku kenkyūjo}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9919">'''Islamic graffiti''' is a [[genre]] of [[graffiti]] created by [[Islam]]ic people or by people inspired by the Islamic religion. Containing Islamic themes, this type of [[art]] finds expression in a variety of forms. The most common languages used are English and Arabic.   Like all other forms of art, graffiti can serve as a medium for instigating political or social change, or as a form of self-expression.

==Socio-political==
===Sticker art===
[[Sticker art]] refers to the practice of posting images or phrases to convey a message.[[File:Shop bamako posters marche fadjiguila.jpg|thumb|An example of Islamic sticker art in Mali]]
A collaborative project called "INSIDE OUT: Artocracy in Tunisia" uses sticker art to promote the spirit of democracy in post-revolutionary Tunisia. Prior to the revolution, only presidential photography could be found in the public space. A group of six photographers, along with a French graffiti artist called JR, replaced these pictures with black and white photographs of anonymous Tunisian people. Their goal is to inspire the people of Tunisia to see themselves in a new light. One of the photographers states: "If people want to tear them down, or write something on them, that's part of the project, that's okay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine|title=Art challenges Tunisian revolutionaries|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/03/201132223217876176.html|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=26 March 2011|agency=Al Jazeera|language=English, Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subvertising===
[[Subvertising]] refers to the practice of making spoofs or parodies of political advertisements. 
Princess Hijab, an anonymous street artist from Paris, paints Muslim veils on advertisements in the subway. She refers to this as "hijabisation." Since the enforcement of the "burqa ban," in which women are prohibited from wearing the burqa in public places, her art has sparked feminist and fundamentalist questions. It is not known if Princess Hijab is a Muslim or even a woman.  "The real identity behind Princess Hijab is of no importance," she has been quoted. Inspired by Naomi Klein's [[No Logo]], she drew her first veil in 2006 on the French rapper [[Diam's]], who subsequently happened to convert to Islam and now wears a veil. Graffiti on the subways in Paris is considered vandalism. Consequently, Princess Hijab has become highly selective and only paints four to five advertisements a year. She chooses to combine veils with advertisements because they are both "dogmas that can be questioned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|title=Cornered – Princess Hijab, Paris's elusive graffiti artist|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/11/princess-hijab-paris-graffiti-artist|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 November 2010|agency=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti as a form of communication in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] began in 1987 during the first Intifada. This was a period in which there were no Palestinian TV or Radio stations in the Gaza Strip. Murals commemorated martyrs as well as called protestors to action. Israeli military would force Palestinians to wash off graffiti from their homes. The Dome of the Rock was common among murals in Palestine. In 2006, [[Hamas]] took over the graffiti scene. Hamas would encourage people to perform the first of the day’s five prayers through street art.&lt;ref&gt;Gröndahl, Mia. ''Gaza Graffiti: Messages of Love and Politics''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, The [[West Bank]] wall is covered in graffiti. Numerous messages can be found including marriage proposals, notes to friends, and jokes. Also common are messages of peace. One reads: "Mirror, mirror on the wall. When will this senseless object fall?" "Trying to imagine a clear view between Palestine and Israel," is another. Messages such as these splatter across the wall, and some graffiti artists will paint your message for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Melissa|title=Palestinian graffiti spreads message of peace|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-16/world/palestinian.wall.graffiti_1_west-bank-five-palestinian-villages-barrier-cuts?_s=PM:WORLD|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=16 April 2009|agency=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable graffiti artists==
===Middle East===
''See also: [[Graffiti in Iran]].''

From [[Lebanon]], [[Yazan Halwani]] has developed his form of graffiti based on Arabic calligraphy, figures and culture. His style mixes portraiture and Arabic calligraphy on large walls in [[Beirut]]. Halwani thinks that graffiti in the Arab world and Beirut should not evolve into a form of vandalism and therefore he says that his murals try to adapt to their environment and not against it.&lt;ref&gt;Alabaster, Olivia. [http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Lifestyle/2013/Feb-09/205688-i-like-to-write-beirut-as-its-the-city-that-gave-us-everything.ashx#axzz3DCxf8Utr "I like to write Beirut as it’s the city that gave us everything"], ''[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]]'', Beirut, 09 February 2013. Retrieved on 13 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Tehran, graffiti artist [[A1one]] (a.k.a.

In 2003, he moved outdoors by spraying a 30x40cm stencil on university walls to express to the "uncommon pressure" at the university which was "endured in silence." However, the motivations behind his art are not protest. He states that his art is simply personal expression: "A drawing on the street is similar to a letter: It proves that there is a writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Uleshka |title=A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran |url=http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |accessdate=9 June 2012 |newspaper=PingMag |date=19 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |archivedate=12 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Arab World, three major areas of interest can be identified: Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and the Arab states that were involved in the Arab Spring. In these areas, graffiti has been perceived, both by the public and the media, as a barometer of the society. Lebanon’s religious and ethnic diversity and its position at the crossroad of the Mediterranean basin and the Arab World have contributed to the appearance and development of an active youth culture and graffiti is part of it. Secondly, the Palestinian Territories are a space where graffiti is one of the most powerful forms of protest against what its inhabitants perceive as a contemporary form of colonization. Last but not least, the social importance of graffiti and its militant functions have recently been reflected by the international media, within the coverage of the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria. The media coverage of the Arab Spring has drawn attention to a type of both artistic and political expression typical for the young people in the MENA region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicoarea|first=Georgiana|url=https://www.academia.edu/2219214/Cultural_Interactions_in_The_Graffiti_Subculture_of_The_Arab_World._Between_Globalization_and_Cosmopolitanism|title=Cultural Interactions in the Graffiti Subculture of the Arab World |publisher=Romano-Arabica Journal |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
After growing up in Paris during the late 80s and early 90s, graffiti artist eL Seed found himself inspired by hip-hop culture. With parents from Temoula, [[Tunisia]], he explored his North African origins by learning calligraphy. Before becoming an artist, he pursued degrees in marketing and business. After befriending a graffiti artist known as Hest1, he began to combine his love of graffiti and calligraphy. Today, he creates both personal exhibitions as well as murals for commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alwazir|first=Atiaf Z.|title=Garbage Collectors and the Struggle For Workers' Rights in Yemen|url=http://aslanmedia.com/arts-culture/324-from-elan/4175-el-seed-explores-identity-with-graffiti-art|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=Aslan Media|date=6 June 2012|agency=Aslan Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also combining calligraphy with graffiti, Niels Meulman (also known as SHOE) coined the phrase "[[calligraffiti]]." Born in Amsterdam, SHOE has worked for ad agencies such as BBDO and the television channel [[MTV]].  The Metropolitan Museum of Art called calligraffiti "a new explosive art form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calligraffiti: An Explosive New Art Form (17 pics)|url=http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/calligraffiti-an-explosive-new|work=My Modern Met|publisher=My Modern Met|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=alice|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28451">'''Jury sentencing''' is the practice, in some U.S. states, of having [[jury|juries]] decide what penalties to give those who have been convicted of criminal offenses.

CODE ANN. §§ 40-2704 to -2707 (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Virginia]] had jury sentencing in times past, but then abandoned it.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Proponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.&lt;ref name=booker/&gt; Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.&lt;ref name=statutory/&gt;

The impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Virginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution_of_Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas_Jefferson#Minister_to_France|Jefferson was in France]].&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Sentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should "suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776-1845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

The adoption of jury sentencing happened at the same time that the movement for an elective judiciary gathered speed, with at least four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota switching to [[judicial election]]s around the same time that they adopted jury sentencing. Both reforms may have been due to a mistrust of unelected judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

During the ten years of the [[Republic of Texas]], judges determined sentences. The 
change to jury determination of the penalty was brought about by one of the first laws passed by the first legislature of the State of Texas in 1846, which empowered the jury to sentence the defendant in all criminal cases except capital cases and cases for which punishment was fixed by law.&lt;ref name=grab/&gt;

Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia adopted jury sentencing later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

===Decline of jury sentencing===
The 1895 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' reflected growing concern that letting juries decide whether or how the law should be applied in particular cases could be detrimental to the [[rule of law]]. By 1910, the role of juries in determining penalties was being eroded by the professionalization of sentencing, as many states passed laws that created [[parole]] and [[probation]] systems.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

These systems were based on a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] philosophy that it would be more useful for society to focus on finding ways to prevent future crime than on fixing blame for crime that had occurred in the past. Criminal behavior was viewed as the result of such factors as [[heredity]], social circumstances, random breeding, and [[Darwinian struggle]], rather than an abuse of divinely-granted [[free will]]. [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]] would determine the causes of crime and what social reforms and treatment programs would correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probation officer]]s gathered and analyzed information about the defendant's character and prepared a presentence report that served as the basis for the ultimate sentence. Probation provided opportunities for treatment in the community for juveniles and adults. In the prison system, [[parole commission]]ers, trained in penology and insulated from political pressures, determined when prisoners had been rehabilitated and could be reintegrated into society.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

The process of preparing a presentence report, which takes weeks, only begins after the defendant is convicted, since if he/she were to be acquitted, the effort that went into preparing the report would be wasted. It would, therefore, not be possible for juries to sentence the defendant at the time of conviction, if the jury needed to rely on a presentence report in making its sentencing decision; rather, the jury would need to be broken up and reassembled later, which could be unworkable if the delay between verdict and sentencing is substantial.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

Furthermore, jury control procedures typically provide that during the trial, information about the defendant's background that is not relevant to the issue of guilt is not to be presented in the presence of the jury, lest it prejudice him. The assumptions that presentence reports would be more informative than presentence hearings, and that training and experience were required to intelligently consider the data and assess sanctions, militated in favor of having a judge rather than a jury do the sentencing.&lt;ref name=statutory&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statutory Structures for Sentencing Felons to Prison|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=1 December 1960|volume=60|number=8|pages=1134-1172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[McKeiver v Pennsylvania]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that alleged juvenile delinquents have no right to a jury trial, with [[Harry Blackmun]] and three other Justices opining that an adversarial system would put an end to the prospect of a intimate, informal protective proceeding focused on rehabilitation.

Georgia and Tennessee both had periods (from 1937-1939, and from 1913-1923, respectively) in which they briefly abandoned jury sentencing while experimenting with [[indeterminate sentencing]]. By 1919, fourteen states gave juries sentencing powers in non-capital cases, although by 1960, that number had dropped to thirteen.&lt;ref name=democratic&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice|author=Iontcheva, Jenia|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=89|number=2|date=April 2003|pages=311-383|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3202435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s and 1980s, [[determinate sentencing]], a new intellectual current that repudiated the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]] model with its focus on using mathematical models and grids to determine sentences, had made inroads, making jury sentencing seem like more of an anachronism.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Georgia permanently abandoned jury sentencing in 1974 and Tennessee did the same in 1982.&lt;ref name=origins&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Nancy J.|title=The Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing in the United States|volume=78|journal=Chi.-Kent L. Rev.|number=937|date=2003|url=https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cklawreview/vol78/iss3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota had also abandoned jury sentencing, and Mississippi was using jury sentencing only in rape and statutory rape cases. Oklahoma abolished jury sentencing but reinstated it in 1999.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

===Possible revival of jury sentencing===
According to some commentators, the time is ripe for a revival of jury sentencing, because flaws in the determinate sentencing systems are becoming increasingly apparent. Lawmakers drafting legislation such as the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] have had difficulty mustering the political will to make clear choices among opposing moral and ideological viewpoints, instead delegating these decisions to agencies that lack the representativeness and democratic origin of legislatures. Prosecutors have routinely circumvented the sentencing guidelines through their charging and plea bargaining decisions, creating a new set of disparities, despite the intent of the guidelines to curtail disparities.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Determinate sentencing has also failed to reduce racial disparity in sentencing.&lt;ref name=idea&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come (Again)?|author=Lanni, Adriaan|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 May 1999|volume=108|number=7|pages=1775-1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some juries have been acquitting guilty defendants to save them from what they regard as overly harsh [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s, such as those imposed by the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]] and California's [[three-strikes law]]. There have been movements to abolish sentencing commissions and guideline systems and inform jurors of their right to nullify. Decisions like ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find any facts that would increase a defendant's maximum sentence) and ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find whether there are aggravating factors justifying capital punishment) have also signaled a willingness by the judiciary to expand the role of the jury in the legal process.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Jury sentencing has been seen as a way to in many cases render moot the questions raised by ''Apprendi'' and related cases such as ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'' and ''[[United States v. Booker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibas, Stephanos and Klein, Susan R.|title=The Sixth Amendment and Criminal Sentencing|date=2008|journal=Faculty Scholarship|number=921|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/921}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the differences between [[Element (criminal law)|elements of an offense]] and sentencing factors by letting the jury decide all the facts.&lt;ref name=applying&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying Apprendi to jury sentencing: why state felony jury sentencing threatens the right to a jury trial|author=Carrington, Melissa|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=2011|number=4|pages=1359-1385|url=http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Carrington.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases such as ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'' and ''[[Graham v. Florida]]'' (banning mandatory life imprisonment without parole, and life imprisonment without parole in non-homicide cases, respectively, for juveniles, as contrary to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]]) also raise a question of whether the Supreme Court logically should allow only a jury, rather than a judge, to determine a juvenile should receive such a sentence, given the parallels between adult capital punishment case law and juvenile life imprisonment with parole case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Russell, Sarah F.|title=Jury Sentencing and Juveniles: Eighth Amendment Limits and Sixth Amendment Rights|volume=56|journal=B.C.L. Rev.|number=553|date=2015|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol56/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plea bargains, judicial override, and juror access to information==
In Virginia, under the 1796 act, capital punishment remained mandatory for [[first-degree murder]], but the penalty for [[second-degree murder]] was any term between five and eighteen years in the penitentiary. The 1796 act gave the court in murder cases the authority to "determine the degree of the crime, and to give sentence accordingly" when a defendant was "convicted by confession." The judge's discretion to set sentences in cases of confession did not exist in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In Missouri, informing juries of sentences of defendants in similar cases or the sentences of co-participants in the crime on trial is strictly prohibited under the rules of evidence." Similarly, the Kentucky [[truth in sentencing]] statute, which generally increases the information available to sentencing juries, does not provide for sentencing guidelines and statistics. Kentucky courts have also held parole eligibility statistics inadmissible. The military at one time provided [[United States military jury|jurors]] with sentencing statistics and guidelines was the military, but this practice ended in the late 1950s as the military's judicial philosophy shifted its emphasis away from sentencing uniformity and towards individualized judgments. The [[United States Court of Military Appeals]] held that jurors were not to consider sentences in similar cases or to consult the sentencing manual.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Under Virginia's current system, jurors are controversially not allowed access to the Commonwealth's [[sentencing guidelines]] or to information about whether sentences will run consecutively or concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20120401-2012-04-01-dp-nws-crime-notebook-0401-20120331-story.html|date=1 April 2012|title=Virginia judges rarely question juries' sentencing recommendations|publisher=Daily Press|author=Kelly, Ashley and Dujardin, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 2000 were also not informed that parole had been abolished in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/va_md_dc/virginia-eyes-new-sentences-after-juries-didn-t-get-key/article_1008cc74-de6f-5b77-bdd0-61c099dd9400.html|title=Virginia eyes new sentences after juries didn't get key fact|author=Durkin, Alana|publisher=Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge must justify any departure from the jury's recommendation in writing to the [[Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission]]. Less than one-quarter of jury-recommended sentences are modified by judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Caleb R.|title=Sentencing Roulette: How Virginia’s Criminal Sentencing System is Imposing an Unconstitutional Trial Penalty That Suppresses the Rights of Criminal Defendants to a Jury Trial|volume=23|journal=Wm.&amp; Mary Bill Rts. J.|number=559|date=2014|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmborj/vol23/iss2/10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns about juries' imposing higher sentences than what the sentencing guidelines would suggest, many defendants opt either for [[bench trial]]s or [[plea bargain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of juried trials slumps both in Va., nationwide |url=https://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/number-of-juried-trials-slumps-both-in-va-nationwide/article_d2dbfd5c-34cc-5d9c-b999-a9c6641783f9.html|author=Green, Frank|publisher=Daily Progress|date=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States with jury sentencing have often allowed judges to intervene in the sentencing process, e.g. by reducing the sentence imposed by the jury, imposing hard labor or solitary confinement in addition to the jury's assessment of fines, or determining the place of confinement imposed by the jury.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In Alabama, judges were allowed to override juries' recommendations of life imprisonment and impose capital punishment instead, until a 2017 law took that power away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/07/death_penalty_judicial_overrid.html|title=Did judicial override end in Alabama? Some say judges can still overrule jury over death penalty|date=21 July 2017|publisher=AL.com|author=Remkus, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; All jury sentencing states except Texas allow the judge to fix the punishment in case the jury fails to agree on a sentence,&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; making it impossible for there to be a mistrial due to a [[hung jury]] at sentencing.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

==Arguments for and against jury sentencing==
Arguments that have been raised for sentencing by jury are that judges can be arbitrary (depending, e.g., on their mood at the time of sentencing) and partisan, and that putting the same person in charge of both deciding sentences and extending leniency (e.g. through pardons) centralizes too much power in one person. Also, different judges may be inconsistent in the judgments they render. Another argument in favor of jury sentencing is that the punishment equitably due is best determined by the particular circumstances of the case, rather than by legal technicalities; and that a jury is well-equipped for this purpose.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; Also, if juries have power to give a lenient sentence, they may be less likely to engage in [[jury nullification]] by acquitting a guilty defendant whom they believe is undeserving of severe punishment.&lt;ref name=idea/&gt;

An argument based on the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution]] is that criminal and civil juries have similar societal functions, including checking the abuse of governmental power, injecting community values into legal decisions, and aiding public acceptance of legal determinations; and therefore the criminal system should have juries decide sentences much as the civil system has juries decide judgments.&lt;ref name=booker&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirgis, Paul F.|title=The Right to a Jury Decision on Sentencing Facts after Booker: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach the Sixth|volume=39|journal=Ga. L. Rev.|number=897|date=2005|url=http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/faculty_lawreviews/131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments that have been raised against sentencing by jury are that juries are not as accountable as judges; that putting them in charge of determining both guilt and the sentence concentrates too much power in one body; and that different juries may differ widely in the sentences they impose. Counterarguments are that the lack of accountability of jurors to a higher authority preserves their [[judicial independence]], and that judges are also capable of differing from other judges in the sentences they impose. Judges may even deviate from their own usual sentencing practices if the case is high-profile or a judicial election is coming up. Also, disparities are not always a sign of arbitrariness; sometimes they may reflect geographical differences in public attitudes toward a given crime, or a jury's taking proper account of the individual circumstances of each offender.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

It is sometimes argued that an unreasonable juror may force the rest of the jury into an undesirable compromise to find the defendant guilty but impose an overly light sentence. A counter-argument is that whether this is bad or good is a matter of perception since "one juror's principled holdout is another juror's irrational nullification. One jury's 'compromise' is another jury's perfectly appropriate give-and-take deliberations."&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&amp;context=dlj|title=The Case for Jury Sentencing|author=Hoffman, Morris B.|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=52|number=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to University of Chicago Law School lecturer Jenia Iontcheva, sentencing decisions are well-suited to being made through a process of [[deliberative democracy]] rather than by experts such as judges, since they involve deeply contested moral and political issues rather than scientific or technical issues. She argues that since sentencing requires individualized, case-by-case assessments, sentences should be decided through small-scale deliberation by juries, as opposed to having lawmakers codify general policies for mechanical application by judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

An advantage Iontcheva cites of having juries come together to deliberate on sentences is that the jurors may alter their preferences in the light of new perspectives. She argues that the hearing and consideration of diverse opinions will give the sentencing decisions greater legitimacy, and that engaging ordinary citizens in government through this process of deliberative democracy will give these citizens confidence about their ability to influence political decisions and thus increase their willingness to participate in politics even after the end of their jury service. Racial and other minorities may also benefit from having greater representation among jurors than among judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

In jurisdictions that do not have any statutory provisions formally allowing jury sentencing, judges have sometimes consulted with the jury on sentencing anyway. At the federal level, the practice of polling the jury and using their input in sentencing was upheld on appeal by the [[6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/06/federal_appeals_court_upholds.html|title=Federal appeals court upholds judge's lowest possible sentence in child-porn case|author=Heisig, Eric|publisher=Cleveland.com|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing is said to be more time-consuming for jurors than the relatively easy task of ascertaining guilt or innocence,&lt;ref name=grab&gt;{{cite journal|author=Webster, Charles W.|title=Jury Sentencing - Grab-Bag Justice|volume=14|journal=Sw L.J.|number=221|date=1960|url=https://scholar.smu.edu/smulr/vol14/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means an increase in jury fees and in the amount of productivity lost to jury duty.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In [[New South Wales]], a 2007 proposal by Chief Justice [[Jim Spigelman]] to involve juries in sentencing was rejected after District Court Chief Judge [[Reg Blanch]] cited "an expected wide difference of views between jurors about questions relating to sentence". Concerns about [[jury tampering]] through intimidation by defendants were also raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/keep-juries-away-from-sentencing-say-judges-20070427-gdq067.html|title=Keep juries away from sentencing, say judges|author=Pearlman, Jonathan|date=27 April 2007|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and many other [[continental Europe]]an countries have a system in which professional judges and [[Judiciary_of_Germany#Lay_judges|lay judges]] deliberate together at both the trial and sentencing stages; such systems have been praised as a superior alternative because the mixed court dispenses with most of the time‐consuming practices of jury control that characterize Anglo‐American trial procedure, yet serves the purposes of a jury trial better than plea bargaining and bench trials, which have displaced the jury from routine American practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mixed Court and Jury Court: Could the Continental Alternative Fill the American Need?|author=Langbein, John H.|date=January 1981|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1981.tb00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable jury sentences==
Civil rights leader [[James Bevel]] was sentenced to 15 years in prison pursuant to the recommendation of a Virginia jury that found him guilty of having sex with his teenage daughter in the 1990s when they lived in Leesburg. The sentencing range had been 5 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=43768|title=Civil Rights Leader Convicted of Incest|author=Barakat, Matthew|publisher=Associated Press|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land consumption''' as part of human [[resource consumption]] is the [[land development|conversion of land]] with [[soil health|healthy soil]] and intact [[habitat|habitats]] into areas for [[intensive farming|industrial agriculture]], traffic ([[road|road building]]) and especially [[urbanization|urban]] [[human settlement|human settlements]]. More formally, the [[European Environment Agency|EEA]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Environment Agency]] EEA|year=1997|title=The concept of environmental space|url=http://glossary.eea.europa.eu/terminology/concept_html?term=land%20consumption}}&lt;/ref&gt; has identifid 3 [[land]] consuming activities:
#The expansion of [[built-up area]] which can be directly measured;
#the absolute extent of land that is subject to exploitation by [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] or other economic activities; and
#the [[overexploitation|over-intensive exploitation]] of land that is used for agriculture and forestry.
In all of those respects, land consumption is equivalent to typical [[land use]] in [[industrialized]] regions and civilizations.

Since often aforementioned conversion activities are virtually [[irreversible process|irreversible]], the term '''land loss''' is also used. From 1990 to 2000, [[orders of magnitude (area)#108_to_1014_square_metres|{{convert|1.4|e6ha}}]] of open space were consumed in the U.S..&lt;ref name=mcdonald&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLoS One|volume=5|issue=3: e9509.

{{quote|[[Urban growth]] reduces [[Public space|open space]] in and around [[cities]], impacting [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem services]]|McDonald et al.&lt;ref name=mcdonald/&gt;}}

Land loss can also happen due to natural factors, like [[erosion]] or [[desertification]] - nevertheless most of those can also eventually be tracked back to [[human impact on the environment|human activities]]. Another slightly different interpretation of the term is the forced displacement or [[compulsory acquisition]] of a native people or settlers from their original land due to [[land grabbing]], etc.. Again, in most cases, this will be due to economic reasons like search for [[profitable]] [[investment]] and [[commodification of nature|commodification of natural resources]].

Even though global land loss progresses at an alarming rate, the [[land footprint]], the area required by some Western countries can a lot larger than the land actually used or even available in the country itself.&lt;ref name=soilatlas2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Friends of the Earth|FOE]] Europe|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/resource_use/2016/foee-true-cost-consumption-land-footprint.pdf|title=The true cost of consumption - The EU's land footprint|year=2016|quote=The European Union uses more than its fair share of global land. In 2010, the amount of land used to satisfy our [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], solely of agricultural goods and services, amounted to 269 million hectares – that’s 43% more agricultural land than is available within the EU itself and an area almost the size of France and Italy used outside of our borders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[land price]]s have surged in the first few years of the 21st century, land consumption economy still lacks [[environmental full-cost accounting]] to add the long-term costs of [[environmental degradation]].

==Consequences of land consumption==
The major effects of land conversion for [[economic growth]] are:
*[[Land degradation]]
*[[Habitat loss]] - built-up areas support only particularly adapted species
*[[Soil degradation]] - loss or [[soil contamination|contamination]] of [[top soil]] by civilization [[waste]] and general [[pollution]]
*[[Soil compaction]] - buildings, heavy machinery and vehicle traffic compact the soil to a degree that [[Macrobiology|macrobiotic]] [[soil life]] is eradicated
*[[Impervious surface]]s - [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]] seal of the soil from the atmosphere and disrupt natural [[water cycle|water]] and [[biogeochemical cycle]]s

{{Linguistics}}

'''Language education''' refers to the process and practice of acquiring a second or foreign language. It is primarily a branch of [[applied linguistics]], however can be considered an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field.&lt;ref&gt;Spolsky, B., &amp; Hult, F.M. (Eds.). (2008). ''Handbook of educational linguistics.'' Malden, MA: Blackwell. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., (Ed.). (2010). ''Directions and prospects for educational linguistics.''  New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main learning categories for language education: communicative competencies, proficiencies, [[cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural experiences]], and multiple literacies.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, J. K. (2007). Foreign Language Education: Whose Definition?. ''The Modern Language Journal'', ''91''(2), 266–268. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 00267902&lt;/ref&gt;

== Need ==
Increasing [[globalization]] has created a great need for people in the workforce who can communicate in multiple languages. Common languages are used in areas such as trade, tourism, international relations, technology, media, and science. Many countries such as [[Korea]] (Kim Yeong-seo, 2009), [[Japan]] (Kubota, 1998) and [[China]] (Kirkpatrick &amp; Zhichang, 2002) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels. However, some countries such as [[India]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[Philippines]] use a second official language in their governments. According to [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] (2010), China has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning, especially [[the English language]].

==History==

===Ancient to medieval period===
The need to learn foreign languages is as old as human history itself. In the Ancient Near East, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] was the language of diplomacy, as in the [[Amarna letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scoville |first1=Priscila |title=Amarna Letters |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Amarna_Letters/ |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many centuries, [[Latin]] was the dominant language of education, commerce, religion, and government in much of Europe, but it was displaced for many purposes by French, Italian, and English by the end of the 16th century. [[John Amos Comenius]] was one of many people who tried to reverse this trend. He wrote a complete course for learning Latin, covering the entire school curriculum, culminating in his ''Opera Didactica Omnia'', 1657.

In this work, Comenius also outlined his theory of [[language acquisition]]. He is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages. He held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience. Teaching must be oral. The schoolroom should have models of things, or else pictures of them. He published the world's first illustrated children's book, ''[[Orbis sensualium pictus]]''. The study of Latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum. This decline demanded a new justification for its study. It was then claimed that the study of Latin developed intellectual ability, and the study of Latin grammar became an end in and of itself.

"Grammar schools" from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of Classical Latin. Advanced students continued grammar study with the addition of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching |last=Richards|first=Jack C. |author2=Theodore S. Rodgers |year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge UK |ISBN=0-521-00843-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of European schools until the 18th century. Based on the purely academic study of Latin, students of modern languages did much of the same exercises, studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences. Oral work was minimal, and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language. This tradition-inspired method became known as the [[grammar translation|grammar-translation method]].&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===
{{globalize/US|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Sweet Henry.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Henry Sweet]] was a key figure in establishing the [[applied linguistics]] tradition in language teaching]]
Innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century. It led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods, each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods. The earliest applied linguists included Jean Manes ca, [[Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff]] (1803–1865), [[Henry Sweet]] (1845–1912), [[Otto Jespersen]] (1860–1943), and [[Harold E. Palmer|Harold Palmer]] (1877–1949). They worked on setting language teaching principles and approaches based on linguistic and psychological theories, but they left many of the specific practical details for others to devise.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

The history of foreign-language education in the 20th century and the methods of teaching (such as those related below) might appear to be a history of failure. Very few students in U.S. universities who have a foreign language as a major attain "minimum professional proficiency". Even the "reading knowledge" required for a PhD degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read, and only very few researchers who are native English speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than English. Even a number of famous linguists are monolingual.&lt;ref name="Diller"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Language Teaching Controversy |last=Diller |first=Karl Conrad |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House |location=Rowley, Massachusetts |isbn=0-912066-22-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find, leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs. This tends to make the research of [[second language acquisition]] emotionally charged. Older methods and approaches such as the [[grammar translation method]] and the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]] are dismissed and even ridiculed, as newer methods and approaches are invented and promoted as the only and complete solution to the problem of the high failure rates of foreign language students.

Most books on language teaching list the various methods that have been used in the past, often ending with the author's new method. These new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author's mind, as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method. For example, descriptive linguists{{Who|date=December 2009}} seem to claim unhesitatingly that there were no scientifically based language teaching methods before their work (which led to the [[audio-lingual method]] developed for the U.S. Army in World War II). However, there is significant evidence to the contrary. It is also often inferred or even stated that older methods were completely ineffective or have died out completely, though in reality even the oldest methods are still in use (e.g. the [[Maximilian Berlitz|Berlitz]] version of the direct method). Proponents of new methods have been so sure that their ideas are so new and so correct that they could not conceive that the older ones have enough validity to cause controversy. This was in turn caused by emphasis on new scientific advances, which has tended to blind researchers to precedents in older work.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;5)

There have been two major branches in the field of language learning, the empirical and theoretical, and these have almost completely separate histories, with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another. Examples of researchers on the empiricist side are Jesperson, Palmer, and [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who promote mimicry and memorization with pattern drills. These methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling. In its most extreme form, language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species, human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species.

On the theoretical side are, for example, Francois Gouin, M.D. Berlitz, and [[Emile B. De Sauzé]], whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by [[Noam Chomsky]] and others. These have led to a wider variety of teaching methods, ranging from the grammar-translation method and Gouin's "series method" to the direct methods of Berlitz and De Sauzé. With these methods, students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar. This follows from the rationalist position that man is born to think and that language use is a uniquely human trait impossible in other species. Given that human languages share many common traits, the idea is that humans share a [[universal grammar]] which is built into our brain structure. This allows us to create sentences that we have never heard before but that can still be immediately understood by anyone who understands the specific language being spoken. The rivalry between the two camps is intense, with little communication or cooperation between them.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

=== 21st century ===
Over time, language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world. In some countries, such as the United States, language education (also referred to as World Languages) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as English, Maths and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/21stCenturySkillsMap/p21_worldlanguagesmap.pdf|title=American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages|website=www.actfl.org|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as Australia, it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to [[Languages Other Than English|LOTE]] or Language Other Than English. In the majority of English-speaking education centers, French, Spanish and German are the most popular languages to study and learn. English As A Second Language is also available for students whose first language is not English and they are unable to speak it to the required standard.

==Teaching foreign language in classrooms==
{{main article|Methods of teaching foreign languages}}

[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|right|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]
Language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized '''[[language school]]'''. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.

While sometimes confused, the terms "approach", "method" and "technique" are hierarchical concepts.

An '''approach''' is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning, but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting. Such can be related to [[second language acquisition theory]].

There are three principal "approaches":
# The structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).
# The functional view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something.
# The interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This approach has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

A '''method''' is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned, and should be based upon a selected approach. In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students, and the roles of teachers.
# Examples of structural methods are [[grammar translation]] and the [[audio-lingual method]].
# Examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching.
# Examples of interactive methods include the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the series method, [[communicative language teaching]], [[language immersion]], the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], the [[Natural Approach]], [[Tandem language learning|Tandem Language Learning]], [[Total Physical Response]], [[Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling]] and [[Dogme language teaching]].

A '''technique''' (or strategy) is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective. Such are derived from the controlling method, and less directly, from the approach.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

==Online and self-study courses==
Hundreds of languages are available for self-study, from scores of publishers, for a range of costs, using a variety of methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Self-Study Courses: Comparison, Problems, Ratings|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course itself acts as a teacher and has to choose a methodology, just as classroom teachers do.

===Audio recordings and books===
Audio '''recordings''' use native speakers, and one strength is helping learners improve their accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Accents|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/2/category/accent/1.html|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recordings have pauses for the learner to speak. Others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice, similar to learning a song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadowing Step by Step|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=130bOvRpt24|work=ForeignLanguageExpertise.com|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching, and have been produced on records, tapes, CDs, DVDs and websites.

Most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner's own language. An alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Hear-Say'', by Donald Rivera, Penton Overseas Inc., {{ISBN|1-56015-677-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-350-0}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-353-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-349-7}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aaa.Lang1234.com | title=Lessons for Beginners in English, mp3 | date=15 August 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only language in such recordings is the target language, and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.

Language '''books''' have been published for centuries, teaching vocabulary and grammar. The simplest books are phrasebooks to give useful short phrases for travelers, cooks, receptionists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hhh.Lang1234.com | title=Workers and Guests Have Different Language Needs in a Hotel | date=20 April 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or others who need specific vocabulary. More complete books include more vocabulary, grammar, exercises, translation, and writing practice.

Also, various other "language learning tools" have been entering the market in recent years.

===Internet and software===
'''Software''' can interact with learners in ways that books and audio cannot:

# Some software records the learner, analyzes the pronunciation, and gives feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scoring Your Pronunciation|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/3/post/2012/08/pronunciation.html|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Software can present additional exercises in areas where a particular learner has difficulty, until the concepts are mastered.
# Software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language Guide|url=http://Languageguide.org|publisher=Language Guide|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of oral explanations. The only language in such software is the target language. It is comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.

'''Websites''' provide various services geared toward language education. Some sites are designed specifically for learning languages:

# Some software runs on the web itself, with the advantage of avoiding downloads, and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection.
# Some publishers use the web to distribute audio, texts and software, for use offline. For example, various travel guides, for example Lonely Planet, offer software supporting language education.
# Some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts.
# [[Language exchange]] sites connect users with complementary language skills, such as a native Spanish speaker who wants to learn English with a native English speaker who wants to learn Spanish. Language exchange websites essentially treat ''knowledge of a language'' as a commodity, and provide a marketlike environment for the commodity to be exchanged. Users typically contact each other via chat, [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], or email. Language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at [[language school]]s. Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage, rather than formal grammar or writing skills. Across Australasia, 'Language Perfect' - an online vocabulary learning site- is frequently used as it enables teachers to monitor students' progress as students gain a "point" for every new word remembered. There is an annual international Language Perfect contest held in May.

Many other websites are helpful for learning languages, even though they are designed, maintained and marketed for other purposes:

# All countries have websites in their own languages, which learners elsewhere can use as primary material for study: news, fiction, videos, songs, etc. In a study conducted by the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]], it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom. With the help of the internet, students are readily exposed to foreign media (music videos, television shows, films) and as a result, teachers are taking heed of the internet's influence and are searching for ways to combine this exposure into their classroom teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Can Learn From Foreign Language Teaching In Other Countries|url=http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/ | title=Google Translate | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bing.com/translator | title=Bing Translator | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Speech synthesis]] or text to speech (TTS) sites and software let learners hear pronunciation of arbitrary written text, with pronunciation similar to a native speaker.
# Course development and [[learning management system]]s such as [[Moodle]] are used by teachers, including language teachers.
# [[Web conferencing]] tools can bring remote learners together; e.g. [[Elluminate Live]].
# Players of computer games can practice a target language when interacting in [[massively multiplayer online game]]s and [[virtual worlds]]. In 2005, the virtual world [[Second Life]] started to be used for foreign language tuition, sometimes with entire businesses being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Study and teach in Second Life |url=http://www.its-teachers.com/destinations/second_life/second_life03.asp |work=iT's Magazines |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Apprendre une langue dans un monde virtuel |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0,36-935560,0.html |work=Le Monde |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Spain’s language and cultural institute [[Instituto Cervantes]] has an "island" on Second Life.
Some Internet content is free, often from government and nonprofit sites such as [[Bbc Online#Knowledge and Learning|BBC Online]], Book2, [[Foreign Service Institute]], with no or minimal ads. Some are ad-supported, such as newspapers and YouTube. Some require a payment.

==Learning strategies==
[[Language learning strategies]] have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition.

===Listening as a way of learning===
Clearly listening is used to learn, but not all language learners employ it consciously. Listening to understand is one level of listening but focused listening&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/improving-listening-skills/ focused listening]&lt;/ref&gt; is not something that most learners employ as a strategy.

===Reading as a way to learn===
Many people read to understand but the strategy of reading text to learn grammar and discourse styles can also be employed.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/learning-grammar/ strategy of reading]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning vocabulary===

Translation and rote memorization have been the two strategies that have been employed traditionally. There are other strategies that also can be used such as guessing, based on looking for contextual clues, spaced repetition with a use of various apps, games and tools (e.g. [http://www.duolingo.com DuoLingo], [http://www.LingoMonkey.com LingoMonkey] and [http://www.vocabularystickers.com Vocabulary Stickers]). Knowledge about how the brain works can be utilized in creating strategies for how to remember words.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/how-to-remember-vocabulary/ How to remember vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code switching===
{{Main article|Code-switching}}
Code switching, that is, changing between languages at some point in a sentence or [[utterance]], is a commonly used communication strategy among language learners and bilinguals. While traditional methods of formal instruction often discourage code switching, students, especially those placed in a language immersion situation, often use it. If viewed as a [[study skills|learning strategy]], wherein the student uses the target language as much as possible but reverts to their native language for any element of an utterance that they are unable to produce in the target language (as, e.g., in [[Wolfgang Butzkamm]]'s concept of enlightened monolingualism), then it has the advantages that it encourages fluency development and motivation and a sense of accomplishment by enabling the student to discuss topics of interest to him or her early in the learning process—before requisite vocabulary has been memorized. It is particularly effective for students whose native language is English, due to the high probability of a simple English word or short phrase being understood by the conversational partner.&lt;ref&gt;Butzkamm, Wolfgang (1998). "Code-Switching in a Bilingual History Lesson: The Mother Tongue as a Conversational Lubricant". ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism'' 1:2, pp. 81–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching strategies==

===Blended learning===
{{Main article|Blended learning}}
Blended learning combines face-to-face teaching with [[distance education]], frequently electronic, either computer-based or web-based. It has been a major growth point in the ELT (English Language Teaching) industry over the last ten years. {{when|date=May 2016}}

Some people, though, use the phrase 'Blended Learning' to refer to learning taking place while the focus is on other activities. For example, playing a card game that requires calling for cards may allow blended learning of numbers (1 to 10).

===Skill teaching===
When talking about language skills, the four basic ones are: listening, speaking, reading and writing. However, other, more socially based skills have been identified more recently such as summarizing, describing, narrating etc. In addition, more general learning skills such as study skills and knowing how one learns have been applied to language classrooms.&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{cite book |title=English language teaching |last=Holden |first=Susan |author2=Mickey Rodgers  |year=1998 |publisher=DELTI |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-6820-12-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, the four basic skills were generally taught in isolation in a very rigid order, such as listening before speaking. However, since then, it has been recognized that we generally use more than one skill at a time, leading to more integrated exercises.&lt;ref name="Holden"/&gt; Speaking is a skill that often is underrepresented in the traditional classroom. This is due to the fact that it is considered harder to teach and test. There are numerous texts on teaching and testing writing but relatively few on speaking.

More recent textbooks stress the importance of students working with other students in pairs and groups, sometimes the entire class. Pair and group work give opportunities for more students to participate more actively. However, supervision of pairs and groups is important to make sure everyone participates as equally as possible. Such activities also provide opportunities for peer teaching, where weaker learners can find support from stronger classmates.&lt;ref name="Holden"/&gt;

===Sandwich technique===
{{main article|Sandwich technique}}
In [[second language acquisition|foreign language teaching]], the '''sandwich technique''' is the oral insertion of an [[idiom|idiomatic translation]] in the [[mother tongue]] between an unknown phrase in the [[second language|learned language]] and its repetition, in order to convey meaning as rapidly and completely as possible. The mother tongue equivalent can be given almost as an aside, with a slight break in the flow of speech to mark it as an intruder.

When modeling a dialogue sentence for students to repeat, the teacher not only gives an oral mother tongue equivalent for unknown words or phrases, but repeats the foreign language phrase before students imitate it: L2 =&gt; L1 =&gt; L2. For example, a [[German language|German]] teacher of [[English language|English]] might engage in the following exchange with the students:

: Teacher: "Let me try - lass mich versuchen - let me try."
: Students: "Let me try."

===Mother tongue mirroring===
{{main article|Mother tongue mirroring}}
Mother tongue mirroring is the adaptation of the time-honoured technique of [[literal translation]] or word-for word translation for pedagogical purposes. The aim is to make foreign constructions salient and transparent to learners and, in many cases, spare them the technical jargon of grammatical analysis. It differs from [[literal translation]] and [[interlinear text]] as used in the past since it takes the progress learners have made into account and only focuses upon a specific structure at a time. As a didactic device, it can only be used to the extent that it remains intelligible to the learner, unless it is combined with a normal idiomatic translation. This technique is seldom referred to or used these days.

===Back-chaining===
{{main article|Back-chaining}}
Back-chaining is a technique used in teaching oral language skills, especially with [[polysyllabic]] or difficult words.&lt;ref name="ue"&gt;"Backchaining." ''Glossary.'' Retrieved April 4, 2009, from http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/backchaining.html&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher pronounces the last syllable, the student repeats, and then the teacher continues, working backwards from the end of the word to the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;"Backchaining." ''Teaching English.'' Retrieved April 4, 2009, from http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/backchaining&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, to teach the name ‘[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]' a teacher will pronounce the last syllable: ''-sky,'' and have the student repeat it. Then the teacher will repeat it with ''-sorg-'' attached before: ''-sorg-sky,'' and all that remains is the first syllable: ''Mus-sorg-sky.''

==By region==
{{main article|Language education by region}}

Practices in language education may vary by region however the underlying understandings which drive it are fundamentally similar. Rote repetition, drilling, memorisation and grammar conjugating are used the world over. Sometimes there are different preferences [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|teaching methods]] by region. [[Language immersion]] is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the [[United States]], in [[Asia]] or in [[Australia]].

The languages being learned differ; in the [[United States]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most popular language to be learned, whereas the most popular languages to be learned in [[Australia]] are [[Italian language|Italian]] and Mandarin Chinese.

==Language study holidays==
{{See also|Language school}}
An increasing number of people are now combining [[tourism|holiday]]s with language study in the native country. This enables the student to experience the target culture by meeting local people. Such a holiday often combines formal lessons, cultural excursions, leisure activities, and a [[homestay]], perhaps with time to travel in the country afterwards. Language study holidays are popular across Europe (Malta &amp; UK being the most popular because almost everyone speaks English as a first language) and Asia due to the ease of transportation and variety of nearby countries. These holidays have become increasingly more popular in Central and South America in such countries as Guatemala, Ecuador and [[ACUPARI|Peru]]. As a consequence of this increasing popularity, several international language education agencies have flourished in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelweek.ca/news/travel-agents-missing-profitable-language-travel-holidays-sprachcaffe/ |title=Travel agents missing out on profitable language travel holidays – Sprachcaffe |publisher=TravelWeek|date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;


With the increasing prevalence of international business transactions, it is now important to have multiple languages at one's disposal. This is also evident in businesses outsourcing their departments to Eastern Europe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Minority language education==

===Minority language education policy===
The principal policy arguments in favor of promoting minority language education are the need for multilingual workforces, intellectual and cultural benefits and greater inclusion in global information society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/community |title=Community Languages in Higher Education: Towards realising the potential |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Sachdev |first=I |author2=McPake, J  |year=2008 |pages=76 |publisher=Routes into Languages }}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to education in a minority language is also seen as a human right as granted by the [[European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]], the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and the [[UN Human Rights Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |title=The right to education and minority language |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=de Varennes |first=Fernand |year=2004 |publisher=EUMAP: EU Monitoring and Advocacy Program Online Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404121819/http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |archivedate=4 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M.

===Materials and e-learning for minority language education===
Suitable resources for teaching and learning minority languages can be difficult to find and access, which has led to calls for the increased development of materials for minority language teaching. The internet offers opportunities to access a wider range of texts, audios and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/community |title=Community Languages in Higher Education: Towards realising the potential |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Sachdev |first=I |author2=McPake, J  |year=2008 |pages=61–62 |publisher=Routes into Languages }}&lt;/ref&gt; Language [[learning 2.0]] (the use of web 2.0 tools for language education)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.plymouth.ac.uk/e-learning/conference_proceedings_2009.pdf |title=Language learning 2.0 in action: web .0 tools to enhance language learning |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Diouri |first=Mourad |year=2009 |publisher=4th Plymouth e-Learning Conference 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122165045/http://www2.plymouth.ac.uk/e-learning/conference_proceedings_2009.pdf |archivedate=22 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers opportunities for material development for lesser-taught languages and to bring together geographically dispersed teachers and learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/5011 |title=New Roles for Technology in Language Maintenance and Revitalization |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Ikeda |first=A.

'''''Looking Backward: 2000–1887''''' is a [[utopia]]n [[science fiction]] novel by [[Edward Bellamy]], a journalist and writer from [[Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts]]; it was first published in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/bellamy_edward Edward Bellamy in [[Encyclopedia of science fiction]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the third-largest bestseller of its time, after ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (novel)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]''.&lt;ref name = "qlfjpt"&gt;Edward Bellamy, ''Looking Backward 2000-1887'', with a Foreword by [[Erich Fromm]], Signet, 1960. {{ISBN|0-451-52412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced a large number of intellectuals, and appears by title in many [[socialism|socialist]] writings of the day. "It is one of the few books ever published that created almost immediately on its appearance a political mass movement".&lt;ref&gt;See Fromm's Foreword to ''Looking Backward'', p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States alone, over 162 [[Nationalist Clubs|"Bellamy Clubs"]] sprang up&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/5280831/Utopian_Dreamers_-_Edward_Bellamy_And_The_Canadian_Context |title=Utopian Dreamers - Edward Bellamy And The Canadian Context |first=Matthew |last=Vasilev |type=Undergraduate research paper |publisher=McGill University |date=2012 |accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss and propagate the book's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking backward: 2000-1887|year=2000|publisher=Signet|page=Introduction}} Walter James Miller confirms "more than 162 Bellamy Clubs".&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its commitment to the [[nationalization]] of private property and the desire to avoid use of the term "socialism", this political movement came to be known as Nationalism — not to be confused with the political concept of [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bellamy.

==Publication history==

The decades of the 1870s and the 1880s were marked by economic and social turmoil, including the [[Long Depression]] of 1873–1879, a series of [[recession]]s during the 1880s, the rise of [[trade union|organized labor]] and [[strike action|strikes]], and the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]] and its controversial aftermath.&lt;ref name=Bowman87&gt;Sylvia E. Bowman, ''The Year 2000: A Critical Biography of Edward Bellamy.'' New York: Bookman Associates, 1958; pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, American capitalism's tendency towards concentration into ever larger and less competitive forms—[[monopoly|monopolies]], [[oligopoly|oligopolies]], and [[trust (business)|trusts]]—began to make itself evident, while emigration from Europe expanded the labor pool and caused wages to stagnate.&lt;ref name=Bowman87 /&gt; The time was ripe for new ideas about economic development which might ameliorate the current social disorder.

[[Edward Bellamy]] (1850–1898), a relatively unknown [[New England]]-born novelist with a history of concern with social issues,&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; began to conceive of writing an impactful work of visionary fiction shaping the outlines of a [[utopian socialism|utopian]] future, in which production and society were ordered for the smooth production and distribution of commodities to a regimented labor force. In this he was not alone — between 1860 and 1887, no fewer than 11 such works of fiction were produced in the United States by various authors dealing fundamentally with the questions of economic and social organization.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellamy's book, gradually planned throughout the 1880s, was completed in 1887 and taken to [[Boston]] publisher Benjamin Ticknor, who published a first edition of the novel in January 1888.&lt;ref name=Bowman115&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sales of the book were modest and uninspiring, but the book did find a readership in the Boston area, including enthusiastic reviews by future Bellamyites [[Cyrus Field Willard]] of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' and [[Sylvester Baxter]] of the ''Boston Herald.''

Shortly after publication, Ticknor's publishing enterprise, Ticknor and Company, was purchased by the larger Boston publisher, [[Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.]], and new publishing plates were created for the book.&lt;ref name=Bowman115 /&gt; Certain "slight emendations" were made to the text by Bellamy for this second edition, released by Houghton Mifflin in September 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its second release, Bellamy's futuristic novel met with enormous popular success, with more than 400,000 copies sold in the United States alone by the time Bellamy's follow-up novel, ''Equality,'' was published in 1897.&lt;ref name=Bowman121&gt;Bowman, ''The Year 2000,'' pg. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Sales topped 532,000 in the USA by the middle of 1939.&lt;ref name=Bowman121 /&gt; The book gained an extensive readership in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], as well, with more than 235,000 copies sold there between its first release in 1890 and 1935.&lt;ref name=Bowman121 /&gt;

The first version of the novel published in China, heavily edited for the tastes of Chinese readers, was titled ''Huitou kan jilüe'' (回頭看記略). This text was later retitled ''Bainian Yi Jiao'' (百年一覺 ), or "A Sleep of 100 Years" and in 1891–1892 this version was serialized in ''[[Wanguo gongbao]]'';&lt;ref name=Andolfatto&gt;Andolfatto, Lorenzo.

New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1955; pg. xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

Bellamy's novel tells the story of a hero figure named Julian West, a young American, who towards the end of the 19th century, falls into a deep, hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up 113 years later. He finds himself in the same location ([[Boston, Massachusetts]]), but in a totally changed world: It is the year 2000, and while he was sleeping, the United States has been transformed into a [[socialist]] utopia. The remainder of the book outlines Bellamy's thoughts about improving the future. The major themes include problems associated with capitalism, a proposed socialist solution of a nationalization of all industry, and the use of an "industrial army" to organize production and distribution, as well as how to ensure free cultural production under such conditions.

The young man readily finds a guide, Doctor Leete, who shows him around and explains all the advances of this new age, including drastically reduced working hours for people performing menial jobs and almost instantaneous, Internet-like delivery of goods. Everyone retires with full benefits at age 45, and may eat in any of the public kitchens. The productive capacity of the United States is nationally owned, and the goods of society are equally distributed to its citizens. A considerable portion of the book is dialogue between Leete and West wherein West expresses his confusion about how the future society works and Leete explains the answers using various methods, such as metaphors or direct comparisons with 19th-century society.

Although Bellamy's novel did not discuss technology or the economy in detail, commentators frequently compare ''Looking Backward'' with actual economic and technological developments. For example, Julian West is taken to a store which (with its descriptions of cutting out the middleman to cut down on waste in a similar way to the [[consumers' cooperative]]s of his own day based on the ''[[Rochdale Principles]]'' of 1844) somewhat resembles a modern [[warehouse club]] like BJ's, Costco, or Sam's Club. He additionally introduces a concept of "credit" cards in chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25, and 26, but these actually function like modern [[debit card]]s. All citizens receive an equal amount of "credit". Those with more difficult, specialized, dangerous, or unpleasant jobs work fewer hours (in contrast to the real-world practice of paying them more for their efforts of, presumably, the same hours). Bellamy also predicts both sermons and music being available in the home through [[cable radio|cable "telephone"]] (already demonstrated but commercialized only in 1890 as [[Théâtrophone]] in France).

Despite the "ethical" character of his socialism (though he was initially reluctant to use the term "socialism"), Bellamy's ideas somewhat reflect classical [[Marxism]]. In chapter 19, for example, he has the new legal system explained. Most civil suits have ended in socialism, while crime has become a medical issue. The idea of [[atavism]], then current, is employed to explain crimes not related to inequality (which Bellamy thinks will vanish with socialism). Remaining criminals are medically treated. One professional judge presides, appointing two colleagues to state the prosecution and defense cases. If all do not agree on the verdict, then it must be tried over. Chapters 15 and 16 have an explanation of how free, independent public art and news outlets could be provided in a more [[libertarian socialist]] system. In one case, Bellamy even writes, "the nation is the sole employer and capitalist".

== Precursors ==

Though Bellamy tended to stress the independence of his work, ''Looking Backward'' shares relationships and resemblances with several earlier works—most notably the anonymous ''[[The Great Romance]]'' (1881), [[John Macnie]]'s ''[[The Diothas]]'' (1883),&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Morgan, ''Edward Bellamy'', New York, Columbia University Press, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Gronlund]]'s ''The Co-operative Commonwealth'' (1884), and [[August Bebel]]'s ''Woman in the Past, Present, and Future'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Morgan, ''Plagiarism in Utopia: A Study of the Continuity of the Utopian Tradition With Special Reference to Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward"'', Yellow Springs, Ohio, privately printed, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''The True Author of Looking Backward'' (1890) J. B. Shipley argued that Bellamy's novel was a repeat of Bebel's arguments, while literary critic R. L. Shurter went so far as to argue that "''Looking Backward'' is actually a fictionalized version of ''The Co-operative Commonwealth'' and little more".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Shurter, ''The Utopian Novel in America, 1865–1900'', New York, AMS Press, 1975; p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bellamy's book also bears resemblances to the early socialist theorists or 'utopian socialists' [[Étienne Cabet|Etienne Cabet]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Robert Owen]], and [[Henri Saint-Simon]], as well as to the 'Associationism' of [[Albert Brisbane]] whom Bellamy had met in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative, Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America'', (Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 1991), p. 368, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction and sequels ==
{{main|List of sequels to Looking Backward}}

On publication, ''Looking Backward'' was praised by both the [[American Federation of Labor]] and the [[Knights of Labor]].&lt;ref name="rew"&gt;Robert E. Weir, ''Workers in America: A Historical Encyclopedia''.Santa Barbara, Calif. : ABC-CLIO, ©2013 {{ISBN|1598847198}} (p. 68-70).&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the Knights read ''Looking Backward'' and also joined Bellamy's Nationalist clubs.&lt;ref name="rew" /&gt; ''Looking Backward'' was also praised by [[Daniel De Leon]], [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref name="rew" /&gt;

In 1897, Bellamy wrote a sequel, ''[[Equality (book)|Equality]]'', dealing with women's rights, education, and many other issues. Bellamy wrote the sequel to elaborate and clarify many of the ideas merely touched upon in ''Looking Backward''.

The success of ''Looking Backward'' provoked a spate of sequels, parodies, satires, dystopian, and 'anti-utopian' responses.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Pfaelzer,''The Utopian Novel in America, 1886–1896: The Politics of Form'', Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press; pp. 78–94 and 170–3.&lt;/ref&gt; A partial list of these follows.&lt;ref&gt;This list was derived from G. Claeys ''Late Victorian Utopias: A Prospective'', (Pickering and Chatto, London, 2008), J. Pfaelzer, ''The Utopian Novel in America 1886–1896: The Politics of Form'', (University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, 1984), K.

The result was a "battle of the books" that lasted through the rest of the 19th century and into the 20th. The back-and-forth nature of the debate is illustrated by the subtitle of Geissler's 1891 ''Looking Beyond'', which is "A Sequel to 'Looking Backward' by Edward Bellamy and an Answer to 'Looking Forward' by Richard Michaelis".

The book was translated into [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] in 1892. In 1900 Bellamy personally approved a request by Bulgarian author [[Iliya Yovchev]] to make an "adapted translation" based on the realities of [[Bulgaria]]n social order. The resulting work, titled ''The Present as Seen by Our Descendants And a Glimpse at the Progress of the Future'' ("Настоящето, разгледано от потомството ни и надничане в напредъка на бъдещето"), generally followed the same plot. The events in Yovchev's version take place in an [[environmentally friendly]] [[Sofia]] and describe the country's unique path of adapting to the new social order. It is considered by local critics to be the first Bulgarian utopian work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chitanka.info/text/20938-nachaloto|title=The Beginning|author=Ivaylo Runchev|publisher=Narodna Mladezh|year=1985|accessdate=1 July 2013|quote=Фактически налице е произведение, отличаващо се от оригинала дотолкова, че следва да се говори за нов роман, първия ни български утопичен роман. ("Basically this work differs from the original to such an extent, that we can consider it a new novel, the first Bulgarian Utopian novel.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Morris]]'s [[1890 in literature|1890]] utopia ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' was partly written in reaction to Bellamy's utopia, which Morris did not find congenial.

Beyond the purely literary sphere, Bellamy's descriptions of utopian [[urban planning]] had a practical influence on [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s founding of the [[garden city movement]] in England, and on the design of the [[Bradbury Building]] in [[Los Angeles]].
[[Image:Edward Bellamy 2000 1887.jpg|thumb|German Reclam edition 1919]]
During the [[Great railroad strike of 1877|Great Strikes of 1877]], [[Eugene V. Debs]] opposed the strikes and argued that there was no essential necessity for the conflict between capital and labor. Debs was influenced by Bellamy's book to turn to a more [[socialist]] direction. He soon helped to form the [[American Railway Union]]. With supporters from the [[Knights of Labor]] and from the immediate vicinity of Chicago, workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company went on strike in June 1894. This came to be known as the [[Pullman Strike]].

The book had a specific and intense reception in Wilhelminian Germany including various parodies and sequels, from [[Eduard Loewenthal]], [[Ernst Müller]] and [[Philipp Wasserburg]], [[Konrad Wilbrandt]] and [[Richard Michaelis]].&lt;ref&gt;(Edward Bellamy, ''Ein Rückblick aus dem Jahre 2000 auf das Jahr 1887'', Translation Georg von Gizycki, editor Wolfgang Biesterfeld. Philipp Reclam jun., Stuttgart 1983 {{ISBN|3-15-002660-1}} (Universal-Bibliothek 2660 [4]), Afterword of Biesterfeld, p.301f.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, there was a revival of interest in ''Looking Backward''. Several groups were formed to promote the book's ideas. The largest was Edward Bellamy Association of New York; its honorary members included [[John Dewey]], [[Heywood Broun]] and [[Roger N. Baldwin]]. &lt;ref name="aem"&gt; Aaron D. Purcell, ''Arthur Morgan: A Progressive Vision for American Reform''. University of Tennessee Press, 2014 {{ISBN|9781621900580}} (p. 214-9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Ernest Morgan]], chairman of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], also admired the book and wrote the first biography of Bellamy.&lt;ref name="aem" /&gt; 

== Legacy and later responses ==
''Looking Backward'' influenced the novel ''[[Future of a New China]]'' by [[Liang Qichao]].&lt;ref name=DDWangTranslatingp309&gt;[[David Der-wei Wang|Wang, David D. W.]] "Translating Modernity." In: Pollard, David E. (editor). ''Translation and Creation: Readings of Western Literature in Early Modern China, 1840–1918''. [[John Benjamins Publishing]], 1998. {{ISBN|9027216282}}, 9789027216281.

''Looking Backward'' was rewritten in 1974 by American science fiction writer [[Mack Reynolds]] as ''Looking Backward from the Year 2000''. [[Matthew Kapell]], a historian and anthropologist, examined this re-writing in his essay, "Mack Reynolds' Avoidance of his own [[18 Brumaire|Eighteenth Brumaire]]: A Note of Caution for Would-Be Utopians".

In 1984, Herbert Knapp and Mary Knapp's ''[[Red, White and Blue Paradise|Red, White and Blue Paradise: The American Canal Zone in Panama]]'' appeared. The book was in part a memoir of their careers teaching at fabled [[Balboa High School (Panama)|Balboa High School]], but also a re-interpretation of the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] as a creature of turn-of-the-century Progressivism, a workers' paradise. The Knapps used Bellamy's ''Looking Backward'' as their heuristic model for understanding Progressive ideology as it shaped the Canal Zone.

A one-act play, ''Bellamy's Musical Telephone,'' was written by Roger Lee Hall and premiered at Emerson College in Boston in 1988 on the centennial year of the novel's publication.  It was released as a DVD titled, "The Musical Telephone."

'''Marine Transfer Operations''' are conducted at many ports around the world between '''tanker ships, barges, and marine terminals'''. Specifically, once the marine vessel is secure at the dock a [[loading arm]] or transfer hose is connected between a valve header on the dock and the manifold header on the vessel. A marine transfer of petroleum products cannot be conducted unless it is supervised by a '''person-in-charge (PIC)''' on the vessel who is seafarer in the [[Merchant Marine]] and another person-in-charge on the dock.

== Person-in-charge ==
The person-in-charge on the dock is called a [[Loading master]]-PIC and the person-in charge on the barge will be the '''Tankerman-PIC.''' The person-in-charge on a tanker ship will be the '''[[deck officer]]''' who monitors the transfer of product in the '''cargo control room'''. All persons-in-charge must have special training in order to obtain the proper credentials such as licensing and endorsement on their merchant mariner documents.

== Marine surveyor ==

Loading Masters work closely with the marine surveyor in agreeing to the sequence of the transfer. Such as whether any product sampling will take place prior to commencement, determining if a line displacement will occur, agreeing on whether the final stop at completion will either be a shore stop or a draft stop on the vessel. The marine surveyor gauges the vessel's tanks and shore tanks to ensure the correct amount of product is transferred. Additionally, the surveyor or inspector will obtain product samples on the marine vessel and shore tank for laboratory analysis to ensure that the product meets all specifications of purity.

== Regulations ==
Transfer operations and commencement of a transfer is highly regulated throughout the world with consideration of the environment with potential of [[water pollution]] occurring if petroleum product is released into the water during the transfer. Federal, state, and local laws must be observed during marine transfer operations. 

[[Maritime Security (USCG)]], [[occupational safety and health]] regulations must be adhered to in addition to environmental regulations during marine transfer operations. These regulation's are enforced by local state port control organizations such as the United States Coast Guard in the United States.

==Marine transfer operators==

A marine transfer operation occurs between three main stakeholders which includes the Loading Master-PIC, Vessel Person-In -Charge PIC, and marine surveyor or inspector. These individuals communicate prior to the transfer agreeing on the sequence of events that will occur before, during, and after the transfer. During the course of the transfer the Loading Master is in continuous two way radio contact with the vessel Person-In-Charge and standing by to stop the transfer immediately if any problems develop such as leaks at the transfer hose or loading arm.

'''NHK Science &amp; Technical Research Laboratories''' ('''STRL''', ''Japanese:'' NHK放送技術研究所, NHK Hōsō Gijutsu Kenkyūjo), headquartered in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]], [[Japan]], is responsible for technical research at [[NHK]], Japan's public broadcaster.

Work done by the STRL includes research on [[direct-broadcast satellite]] ([[Yuri (satellite)|BS]]), [[ISDB|Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting]], [[high-definition television]], and [[ultra high definition television]].

On May 9, 2013, [[NHK]] and [[Mitsubishi Electric]] announced that they had jointly developed the first [[High Efficiency Video Coding]] (HEVC) encoder for 8K Ultra HD TV, which is also called Super Hi-Vision (SHV).&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Cdrinfo&gt;{{cite news |title=NHK and Mitsubishi Develop First HEVC encoder for 8K Super Hi-Vision |publisher=CDRinfo |url=http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=36639 |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Engadget&gt;{{cite news |title=NHK and Mitsubishi develop the first H.265 encoder for 8K video |author=Jon Fingas |publisher=Engadget |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/09/nhk-and-mitsubishi-develop-the-first-h-265-encoder-for-8k-video/ |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Mitsubishi&gt;{{cite news |title=NHK and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation successfully develop World’s First HEVC encoder for 8K "Super Hi-Vision" |format=PDF |publisher=[[Mitsubishi Electric]]|url=http://www.mitsubishielectric.com/news/2013/0509-b.pdf |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Yahoo&gt;{{cite news |title=NHK and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Successfully Develop World's First HEVC Encoder for 8K "Super Hi-Vision" |publisher=Yahoo Finance |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nhk-mitsubishi-electric-corporation-successfully-070000159.html |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HEVC encoder supports the Main 10 profile at Level 6.1 allowing it to encode 10-bit video with a resolution of 7680 × 4320 at 60 fps.&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Cdrinfo/&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Engadget/&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Mitsubishi/&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Yahoo/&gt; The HEVC encoder has 17 [[3G-SDI]] inputs and uses 17 boards for parallel processing with each board encoding a row of 7680 × 256 pixels to allow for real time video encoding.&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Cdrinfo/&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Engadget/&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Mitsubishi/&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Yahoo/&gt; The HEVC encoder was shown at the NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories Open House 2013 that took place from May 30 to June 2.&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Cdrinfo/&gt;&lt;ref name=HEVC8KUltraHDMay2013Mitsubishi/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHKOpenHouse2013Website&gt;{{cite news |title=NHK Open House 2013 |publisher=NHK |url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/open2013/index_e.html |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4892">The '''National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center (NAFEC)''' was founded July 1, 1958, by the Airways Modernization Board (AMB) and located in [[Galloway Township, New Jersey]], near [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. On November 1, 1959, after passage of the [[Federal Aviation Act of 1958]], it came under the newly created [[Federal Aviation Administration|US Federal Aviation Agency]] (FAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= FAA Historical Chronology, 1926–1996 |url= http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf |accessdate= June 2, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080624211236/http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf |archivedate= June 24, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to conduct research and development on [[air traffic control]] computers, [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]]s, and advanced [[radar]] equipment. The success (in terms of funding and research activity) eventually forced the [[United States government role in civil aviation#Civil Aeronautics Authority|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (CAA) to close its own Technical Evaluation and Development Center in [[Indianapolis]] starting in 1959.

The computerized air traffic control developed at NAFEC was based on the [[IBM 9020]], special hardware developed by [[IBM]]. Software was developed by NAFEC, IBM, and under contract to [[Computer Usage Company]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |author= George R.

Besides the research and development project work, the FAA field facilities have daily operational support all over the country from the center operating 24-hour. In order to make critical systems remain operational, center experts analyze problems and make software changes.  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/tc/history/|title = History|website = Federal Aviation Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Neurohistory''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to [[history]] that leverages advances in [[neuroscience]] to tell new kinds of stories about the past, but especially of [[deep history]].  It was first proposed by Harvard professor [[Daniel Lord Smail]].&lt;ref&gt;Smail, D. L. (2008) ''On Deep History and the Brain''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Other supporters include [[Lynn Hunt]].&lt;ref name="from within"&gt;Burman, J. T. (2012). History from within? Contextualizing the new neurohistory and seeking its methods. ''History of Psychology, 15''(1), 84-99.

Subsequent commentaries have shown that the idea relies on evolutionary assumptions (notably a blend of [[exaptation]] and the [[Baldwin Effect]]) and can be extended by drawing on ideas from [[neurophilosophy]].  The result has been suggested as providing the means for a new kind of [[historical method]]: [[history from within]], which is conceived as an augmentation of [[People's history|history from below]].&lt;ref name="from within"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2670">'''Open management education''' refers to business and management programs and courses making use of [[open educational resources]] and [[open content]]. The main idea is to develop competences by re-use, combination and adaption of freely accessible, existing resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kalz, M., Specht, M., Nadolski, R., Bastiaens, Y., Leirs, N., and Pawlowski, J.M. (2010) OpenScout: Competence based management education with community-improved open educational resources, 17th EDINEBConference: Crossing borders in Education and Work-based Learning, London, UK, June 2010, [http://hdl.handle.net/1820/2452]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and purpose ==
Programs and trainings in business and management are often not affordable, especially for SMEs or for people in less developed countries. Therefore, open management education seems like a promising alternative for many stakeholders.

== Challenges ==
It is still an ongoing discussion which [[business models]] could be applied, such as sharing or add-on models. However, the domain is still developing and no business model has become mainstream. A good discussion can be found by Downes (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Downes, S. (2007): Models for Sustainable Open Educational Resources in Interdisciplinary Journal of Knowledge and Learning Objects 3 29-44 February 27, 2007. [http://www.downes.ca/post/33401]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another challenge is to find simple tools to adapt (the sometimes complex) resources.&lt;ref&gt;Mikroyannidis, Alexander; Okada, Alexandra and Connolly, Teresa (2011). Sharing practices and experiences on the authoring and adaptation of Open Educational Resources. In: Open Educational Resources 2011, 11–13 May 2011, Manchester, UK. [http://oro.open.ac.uk/29265/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access to open management education ==
There are many repositories, databases and web access points, some of them listed here:
* [http://learn.openscout.net OpenScout] providing access to global resources in the business and management sector.  It is possible to search for competences to be achieved and to get help with tools for adaptation (e.g. internationalizing materials, adapting the design, contextualizing), see also the Wikipedia entry for [[Openscout]]
* [http://www.khanacademy.org The Khan Academy] provides a variety of business courses.
* [[MIT OpenCourseWare]] access to courses from MIT, some of them related to management
* MERLOT [http://www.merlot.org/merlot/materials.htm?category=2202 Repository] (Category Business) 
* Globe Info (Federation of Repositories): (no browsing, just use keywords such as management or better more specific) [http://www.globe-info.org/ Search page]

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8139">{{for|the book by Chad Engelland|Ostension: Word Learning and the Embodied Mind}}
An '''ostensive definition''' conveys the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a term by pointing out examples. This type of [[definition]] is often used where the term is difficult to define verbally, either because the words will not be understood (as with children and new speakers of a language) or because of the nature of the term (such as colors or sensations). It is usually accompanied with a gesture [[pointing]] to the object serving as an example, and for this reason is also often referred to as "[[wikt:definition by pointing|definition by pointing]]". 

==Overview==

Ostensive definition assumes the  questioner has sufficient understanding to recognize the type of information being given. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So one might say: the ostensive definition explains the use—the meaning—of the word when the overall role of the word in language is clear. Thus if I know that someone means to explain a colour-word to me the ostensive definition "That is called 'sepia' " will help me to understand the word.... One has already to know (or be able to do) something in order to be capable of asking a thing's name. But what does one have to know?&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Philosophical Investigations'', §30.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The limitations of ostensive definition are exploited in a famous argument from the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (which deal primarily with the [[philosophy of language]]), the [[private language argument]], in which [[Wittgenstein]] asks if it is possible to have a private language that no one else can understand.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. ''Philosophical Investigations'', §258.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Passmore states that the term was first defined by the British logician [[William Ernest Johnson]] (1858–1931):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"His neologisms, as rarely happens, have won wide acceptance: such phrases as "ostensive definition", such contrasts as those between ... "determinates" and "determinables", "continuants" and "occurrents", are now familiar in philosophical literature" (Passmore 1966, p. 344).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ostension in folklore==
The term ostension is also used by those who study [[folklore]] and [[urban legend]]s to indicate real-life happenings that parallel the events told in pre-existing and well-established [[legend]]s and lore. Semiotician [[Umberto Eco]] was the first to use the term to describe the way in which people communicate messages through miming actions, as by holding up a pack of cigarettes to say, "Would you like one?"&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto. ''A Theory of Semiotics.'' 224-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was applied to contemporary legends by folklorists [[Linda Dégh]] and Andrew Vázsonyi, who argued that the most direct form of ostension involved committing an actual crime mentioned in a well-known urban legend, such as microwaving someone's pet animal or placing poison in a child's Halloween candy. While such events are rare, the authors stressed that folklorists must recognize "that fact can become narrative and narrative can become fact."&lt;ref name="DéghVázsonyi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dégh|first1=Linda|last2=Vázsonyi|first2=Andrew|title=Does the Word 'Dog' Bite? Ostensive Action: A Means of Legend Telling|journal=Journal of Folklore Research|date=1983|volume=20|pages=5–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}}

Dégh and Vázsonyi, followed by other analysts, argued that there were two other forms of ostension that did not necessarily involve literal acting out of legends.

''Quasi-ostension'' involves interpretation of ambiguous events in terms of a legend, as when a murder is first believed to have been a "cult" sacrifice or "gang" murder when in fact the perpetrator had other motives. Many local media panics are based in this form of ostension.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Bill. Legend-Trips and Satanism: Adolescents' Ostensive Traditions as "Cult" Activity. In Richardson et al., ''The Satanism Scare,'' pp. 279-295.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pseudo-ostension'' involves legend-like events intentionally acted out by persons aware of the original narrative. For example, in 1991, [[Ebony (magazine)|''Ebony'']] published a letter written by "C.J." a Dallas-area woman who said she was HIV-positive, but intentionally having sex with as many men as possible. Soon after, a local radio talk-show broadcast a phone call from a woman who said she was the real "C.J." "I blame it on men, period," she said to the talk-show host. "I'm doing it to all the men because it was a man that gave it to me." After a huge spike in males seeking HIV screening in the Dallas-Fort-Worth area, both the author of the letter and the talk-show caller were identified as hoaxers intending to raise consciousness of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;''FOAFTale News'' 25 (March 1992): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostension has become an important concept for folklorists studying the ways in which folklore affects everyday people's real lives, ranging from supernatural rituals such as [[legend tripping]] to the complex ways in which awareness of [[AIDS]] has affected people's sexual habits.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Diane. ''Once upon a Virus'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorist John McDowell, in an article preceding Dégh and Vázsonyi by a year, explored the relationship between [[iconicity]]—representation—and ostension—presentation—in mythic narrative, finding in episodes of ostention a virtual encounter with the experiential substrate, an experience that he termed "narrative epiphany".&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Iconicity: Ostension in Kamsa Mythic Narrative, Journal of the Folklore Institute 19 (1982): 119-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20728">'''Pagan studies''' is the multidisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of [[Modern Paganism|contemporary Paganism]], a broad assortment of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], which are typically influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of premodern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Pagan studies embrace a variety of different scholarly approaches to studying such religions, drawing from history, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[folkloristics]], [[theology]] and other [[religious studies]].

==Background==
The earliest academic studies of contemporary Paganism were published between 1970 and 1980 by scholars like [[Margot Adler]], [[Marcello Truzzi]] and [[Tanya Luhrmann]], although it would not be until the 1990s that the actual Pagan studies discipline properly developed, pioneered by academics such as Graham Harvey and [[Chas S. Clifton]]. Increasing academic interest in Paganism has been attributed to the new religious movement's increasing public visibility, as it began interacting with the [[interfaith dialogue|interfaith movement]] and holding large public celebrations at sites such as [[Stonehenge]].

The first academic conference on the subject was held at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], North-East England in 1993, followed three years later by a larger conference organised by the [[University of Lancaster]] in North-West England. Annual gatherings of the Conference on Current Pagan Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paganconference.com/|title=Conference on Current Pagan Studies|website=Conference on Current Pagan Studies|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Contemporary Pagan Studies Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://papers.aarweb.org/content/contemporary-pagan-studies-unit|title=Contemporary Pagan Studies Unit {{!}} PAPERS|website=papers.aarweb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the American Academy of Religion continue to develop scholarship in this field. In 2004, a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] devoted to the discipline, ''[[The Pomegranate (journal)|The Pomegranate]]'', began publication.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/pom/index|title=Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies
|publisher=www.equinoxjournals.com|accessdate=2008-05-26|last=|first=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Many books on the subject have been published by a variety of different academic publishing companies, while AltaMira Press began publication of the Pagan Studies Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~wgriffin/paganstudies/|title=Pagan Studies / AltaMira Press|publisher=www.csulb.edu|accessdate=2008-05-26|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Pagan studies scholars and the contemporary Pagan community which it studies has at times been strained, with some practitioners rejecting academic interpretations of their faiths. At the same time, many academics involved in Pagan studies are practicing Pagans themselves, bringing an insider's perspective to their approaches.

Pagan studies scholar [[Chas S. Clifton]] argued that the discipline had developed as a result of the increasing "academic acknowledgement" of contemporary Paganism's "movement into the public eye", referring to the emergence of Pagan involvement with [[interfaith]] groups and the Pagan use of archaeological monuments as "sacred sites", particularly in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 7"/&gt; Clifton also argued that the development of Pagan studies was necessary to "set forth an audacious redefinition of the term "pagan" as [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] has done", something which Clifton felt "gives us room to reexamine from fresh perspectives all manifestation of ancient Pagan religions".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 7&amp;ndash;8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The first international academic conference on the subject of Pagan studies was held at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], North-East England in 1993. It had been organised by two British religious studies scholars, [[Graham Harvey (author)|Graham Harvey]] and Charlotte Hardman.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary Paganism took place at [[Ambleside]] in the [[Lake District]], organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Lancaster]], North-West England. Titled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s", it led to the publication of an academic anthology, ''[[Nature Religion Today|Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World]]''.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In that anthology, some of the conference's organisers described its original intentions, remarking that through it they "sought to explore the innovations in practice and belief which constitute contemporary Paganism, and which appear to be a part of a widespread cultural response to the decay of main-line religions and to a widely felt awareness of ecological crisis."&lt;ref name="Pearson 1998 1"/&gt;

That same year saw the beginnings of ''The Pomegranate'', which would later be transformed into a peer-reviewed academic journal, which first appeared in 2004.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the books AltaMira released was ''Researching Paganisms'', an anthology edited by Jenny Blain, Douglas Ezzy and [[Graham Harvey (author)|Graham Harvey]] in which different Pagan studies scholars discussed their involvement with the subject and the opposition that they have faced.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bla04|Blain, Ezzy and Harvey 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethan Doyle White noted that as Pagan studies reached its twentieth year, it came under "increasing pressure to explain itself, both to academia and to the Pagan community that it studies."{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=17}}

==Approaches==
===Sociological===
[[File:Margot-adler-2004.jpg|thumb|right|Margot Adler ''(pictured in 2004)'' published an early sociological study of Paganism in the United States.]]
In 1979, the American sociologist, journalist and Wiccan [[Margot Adler]] published ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon]]'', a sociological study of the Pagan movement across the United States, covering Wiccans, Druids, Goddess Worshipers, Heathens and Radical Faeries.

In 1999, the American sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] of [[West Chester University]] published ''[[A Community of Witches]]'', a sociological study of the Wiccan and Pagan movement in the north-eastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious studies===
In 2003, the British religious studies scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] published ''[[Pagan Theology|Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion]]'', in which he argued that contemporary Paganism could be seen as a part of a much wider global "paganism" which encompassed a large variety of animistic and polytheistic religious traditions, including [[Indigenous religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yor03|York 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ABC-CLIO published an anthology entitled ''[[Modern Paganism in World Cultures]]'', which was edited by the American religious studies scholar Michael F. Strmiska.

===Historical===
Among the first scholars to study contemporary Paganism from a historical perspective was the American Wiccan [[Aidan Kelly]], who had been a founding member of the [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Covenant of the Goddess]] during the 1970s. Having attained several academic qualifications, including in the field of religious studies, in the 1970s he began a study of the religious texts of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], in order to establish a historical chronology for the tradition. The results of his study would only be published in 1991, as ''Crafting the Art of Magic''. This would later be rewritten and republished in 2007 as ''Inventing Witchcraft''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kel07|Kelly 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] of the [[University of Bristol]] later devoted the latter part of his book ''[[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles]]'' (1991) to an examination of the contemporary Pagan religions that took these pre-Christian religions as a core influence. He followed this with several studies of British folk customs, but in 1999 returned to the field of Pagan studies when he published ''[[The Triumph of the Moon|The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft]]'', the first academic study of [[History of Wicca|Wiccan history]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical debates==
Pagan studies has been charged with failing to properly define "paganism", as some scholars use it solely to designate contemporary Paganism and others &amp;ndash; like Michael York and Chas Clifton &amp;ndash; using it to refer to a wide range of religious movements across the world and throughout history.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=11&amp;ndash;15}} A further problem arises from the fact that while Pagan studies scholars might adopt "paganism" in reference to pre-Christian belief systems in Europe, the term was increasingly rejected by archaeologists specialising in those belief systems.{{sfn|Doyle White|2014|p=11}}

Pagan studies has failed to satisfactorily define "contemporary Paganism"; a minority of scholars have treated it as a singular religion within which groups like Wicca and Heathenry are [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s, while a larger group have instead treated it as a "group of comparative religions".{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=15&amp;ndash;17}} The concern has been made that Pagan studies scholars would be "at a loss to convey (to ourselves and to others), what it is that we are actually studying. The current situation, in which widely differing definitions are being used in tandem, is clearly unsustainable."{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=18}}

Religious studies scholar Markus Altena Davidsen published a critique of the field in 2012, via a review of the ''Handbook of Contemporary Paganism''.{{sfn|Davidsen|2012}} Ethan Doyle White in ''The Pomegranate'', arguing that there were flaws in Davidsen's approach.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=5}} Arguing that the ''Handbook of Contemporary Paganism'' was not as symptomatic of the field as Davidsen had assumed, he goes on to identify a number of factual errors within Davidsen's paper.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}} Doyle White argued that Davidsen's division of scholars into firmly insider and outsider categories was problematic as scholars of Pagan studies like [[Sabina Magliocco]] straddled both boundaries, an approach based in the methodologies employed in anthropology.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|pp=8&amp;ndash;11}}

==Relationship with Pagan community==
The relationship between Pagan studies scholars and some practicing Pagans has at times been strained.{{sfn|Doyle White|2012|p=17}} The Australian academic and practicing Pagan Caroline Jane Tully argued that as a result of [[cognitive dissonance]], many Pagans can react negatively to new scholarship regarding historical pre-Christian societies, believing that it is a threat to the structure of their beliefs and "sense of identity." She furthermore argued that some of those dissatisfied Pagans lashed out against academics as a result, particularly on the internet.{{sfn|Tully|2011|pp=98&amp;ndash;99}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18257">'''Parasitic nutrition''' is a mode of [[heterotrophic]] nutrition where a [[parasite|parasitic]] organism lives on the body surface or inside the body of another type of organism (a [[Host (biology)|host]]) and gets nutrition directly from the body of the host. Since these parasites derive nourishment from their host, this symbiotic interaction is often harmful to the host. Parasites depend on their host for survival, since the host provides nutrition and protection. As a result of this dependence, parasites have considerable modifications to optimise parasitic nutrition and therefore their survival.

Parasites are divided into two groups: ''[[List of parasitic organisms|endoparasites]]'' and ''[[List of parasitic organisms|ectoparasites]]''. Endoparasites are parasites that live inside the body of the host, whereas ectoparasites are parasites that live on the outer surface of the host and generally attach themselves during feeding.&lt;ref name="Cain2011"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Cain| title= Parasitism | booktitle =Ecology | edition=Second | year=2011| chapter=13 | publisher = Sinauer Associates|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the different strategies of endoparasites and ectoparasites, they require different adaptations to derive nutrients from their host.

Parasites require nutrients to carry out essential functions including reproduction and growth. Essentially, the nutrients required from the host are [[carbohydrates]], [[amino acids]] and [[lipids]].  Carbohydrates are utilised to generate energy, whilst amino acids and fatty acids are involved in the synthesis of macromolecules and the production of eggs.&lt;ref name="Dalton2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Dalton| title=Role of the tegument and gut in nutrient uptake by parasitic platyhelminths | journal=[[Canadian Journal of Zoology]] | volume=82 | year=2004| pages=211–232 | doi=10.1139/Z03-213|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most parasites are heterotrophs, so they therefore are unable to synthesise their own 'food' i.e. organic compounds and must acquire these from their host.

==Endoparasitism==
''Endoparasites'' live inside the body of the host. This group includes [[Parasitic worms|helminths]], [[trematodes]] and [[cestodes]]. Endoparasites are two groups of parasites: intercellular and [[intracellular parasite]]s. Intercellular parasites live in spaces within the host e.g. the alimentary canal, whereas intracellular parasites live in cells within the host e.g. erythrocytes. Intracellular parasites typically rely on a third organism, a vector, to transmit the parasite between hosts.&lt;ref name="Cain2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Sibley LD | title=Intracellular Parasite Invasion Strategies | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=304 | year=2004| pages=248–253 | doi=10.1126/science.1094717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than requiring adaptations to penetrate the host, as ectoparasites do, endoparasites are in a nutrient-rich location so they instead have adaptations to maximise nutrient absorption. Endoparasites have a readily available and renewable supply of nutrients inside the host, which in some cases is pre-digested by the host, so mechanisms of nutrient absorption across their body surface is a common feature.&lt;ref name="Cain2011" /&gt; As part of their life cycle strategy, endoparasites must also be able to transmit from within the host body and survive the hostile environment within the host. Only by achieving this can they benefit from acquiring nutrition in this way.

[[File:Microvilli.png|right|thumb|alt=Diagram showing a microvilli structure|Microvilli structure, which increases the surface area available for nutrient uptake in endoparasites]]

Endoparasites have various anatomical and biochemical adaptations, typically at the host-parasite interface, to maximise nutrient acquisition. One such adaptation is the [[tegument (helminth)|tegument]], a metabolically active external cover that plays an important role in nutrient extraction from the host.&lt;ref name="Dalton2004" /&gt; The parasite tegument is permeable to various organic solutes and has transporters for the facilitated or active uptake of nutrients. Various studies have attempted to characterise these transporters in a number of parasites e.g. the amino acid transporter molecules in protozoa.&lt;ref name="Dalton2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhardwaj and Skelly 2011 1–8"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Bhardwaj and Skelly | title=Characterization of Schistosome Tegumental Alkaline Phosphatase (SmAP)| journal=[[PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases]] | volume=5 | year=2011| pages=1–8 | doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Jackson AP | title=Origins of amino acid transporter loci in trypanosomatid parasites | journal=[[BMC Evolutionary Biology]] | volume=7 | year=2007| pages=1–17 | doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cestodes do not have a gut so the tegument is therefore critical for nutrient uptake. In cestodes the tegument is highly efficient with spine-like microtriches, similar to microvilli, to increase the surface area available for nutrient acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=McManus DP | title= Reflections on the biochemistry of Echinococcus: past, present and future | journal=[[Parasitology (journal)|Parasitology]] | volume=136 | year=2009| pages=1643–1652 | doi=10.1017/S0031182009005666}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many parasites the tegument structure has folds or [[microvilli]] to maximise the surface area available for diffusion and uptake of nutrients. The tegument also commonly has additional organelles and features with important functions in metabolism including the [[glycocalyx]]. The glycocalyx is a carbohydrate-rich layer that enhances nutrient absorption and secretes enzymes to aid primary digestion.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author= Reitsma| title=The endothelial glycocalyx: composition, functions, and visualization | journal=[[European Journal of Physiology]] | volume=454 | year=2007| pages=345–359 | doi=  10.1007/s00424-007-0212-8|display-authors=etal| pmc=1915585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important adaptation of endoparasites is the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]], which digests host macromolecules into soluble utilisable products.&lt;ref name="Dalton2004" /&gt; This feature is particularly important for endoparasites that are not in the alimentary canal, because nutrients are not pre-digested by the host. The gut lining typically has a layer of endodermal cells that secrete proteolytic enzymes to aid digestion. Some endoparasites have both a gut and anus, some lack an anus and some have neither—i.e., those that live in the alimentary canal, which instead diffuse pre-digested host nutrients across their body surface.&lt;ref name="Dalton2004" /&gt; The relative importance of the tegument, gut and other adaptations involved in nutrient acquisition varies between different endoparasitic species.

===Tapeworms===

[[File:Kopf bewaffneter Bandwurm-drawing.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Diagram illustrating the head of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium|Head of the pork tapeworm, [[Taenia solium]]., with attachment structures to attach to the wall of the small intestine]]

[[Tapeworms]] are endoparasites with numerous adaptations to enhance parasitic nutrition. Tapeworms live in the [[small intestine]] of humans, providing an ideal location to access a readily available, rich source of pre-digested nutrients.&lt;ref name="Shrihari et al. 2011 1101–1103"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Shrihari| title=Intestinal Perforation due to Tapeworm: Taenia Solium| journal=[[Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research]] | volume=5 | year=2011| pages=1101–1103|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since nutrients in the small intestine are plentiful and pre-digested by the host, tapeworms do not require a gut and instead have adaptations to maximise nutrient absorption. Tapeworms have a tegument that they use to absorb nutrients directly from the host small intestine by diffusion. They also have anatomical adaptations in the form of a scolex with hookers and suckers that they use to attach to the host small intestine wall, preventing the tapeworm from being egested following [[peristalsis]].&lt;ref name="Dalton2004" /&gt; Tapeworms have a flattened body with [[microtriches]] to maximise the surface area available for nutrient absorption and they additionally have various transporter molecules. Tapeworms have to compete with the host epithelium for nutrients, so it is essential that they compete more efficiently for nutrients. They also secrete enzymes to enhance host digestive enzymes e.g. pancreatic α-amylase.&lt;ref name="Dalton2004" /&gt;

===Schistosomes===
[[Schistosomes]], another type of endoparasite, also live inside the body of the host but instead these parasites acquire their nutrients from host blood. Schistosomes are in direct contact with host blood, a rich source of amino acids, and they therefore do not require penetrative structures to reach host nutrients. Schistosomes take blood up through the negative pressure created by muscle contractions of their sucker and oesophagus.&lt;ref name="Dalton2004" /&gt; They obtain amino acids from host blood through a mechanism of haemoglobin degradation, which remains unresolved but is suggested to involve a series of proteases. Mechanisms to overcome blood clotting are also employed.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Hall| title=Insights into blood feeding by schistosomes from a proteomic analysis of worm vomitus| journal=[[Molecular &amp; Biochemical Parasitology]] | volume=179 | year=2011| pages=18–29| doi=10.1016/j.molbiopara.2011.05.002|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bos et al. 2009 1–14"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Bos| title=Analysis of regulatory protease sequences identified through bioinformatic data mining of the Schistosoma mansoni genome | journal=[[BMC Genomics]] | volume=10 | year=2009| pages=1–14 | doi=10.1186/1471-2164-10-488|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various studies have attempted to characterise the components of the schistosome tegument, including transporter molecules that may be involved in nutrient uptake. Such transporter molecules include schistosome alkaline phosphatase (SmAP) and cathepsin B, which may be important in nutrient acquisition.&lt;ref name="Bhardwaj and Skelly 2011 1–8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bos et al. 2009 1–14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Malaria===
[[Malaria]], caused by the apicomplexan parasite [[Plasmodium|''Plasmodium falciparum'']], is an intracellular endoparasite. This parasite relies on a third organism, in the form of an ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito vector. The host blood provides an ideal rich source of glucose and amino acids to the parasite, particularly during blood stage infection where ''Plasmodium'' infects [[erythrocytes]].&lt;ref name="Landfear2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Landfear SM | title= Nutrient Transport and Pathogenesis in Selected Parasitic Protozoa | journal=[[Eukaryotic Cell (journal)|Eukaryotic Cell]] | volume=10 | year=2011| pages=483–493 | doi=10.1128/EC.00287-10| pmc=3127635}}&lt;/ref&gt; To acquire essential nutrients ''Plasmodium'' has to compete with both the vertebrate and insect host and therefore must be highly efficient, regulating uptake according to nutrient availability.&lt;ref name="Landfear2011" /&gt; ''Plasmodium'', along with many other endoparasitic parasites, have numerous channels in their parasitophorous vacuole membrane rendering it permeable to organic solutes to allow the uptake of necessary nutrients. The ''Plasmodium falciparum'' hexose transporter (PfHT) is such a transporter, which is critical for the uptake of glucose and fructose and therefore survival of the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Slavic| title=Life cycle studies of the hexose transporter of Plasmodium species and genetic validation of their essentiality| journal=[[Molecular Microbiology (journal)|Molecular Microbiology]] | volume=75 | year=2010| pages=1402–13 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07060.x|display-authors=etal| pmc=2859251}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organic molecules have to cross three membranes altogether; the plasma membrane of the erythrocyte, the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and the ''Plasmodium'' plasma membrane, facilitated by transporters such as PfHT.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Leirião| title=Survival of protozoan intracellular parasites in host cells | journal=[[European Molecular Biology Organisation Reports]] | volume=5 | year=2004| pages=1142–1147 | doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400299|display-authors=etal| pmc=1299194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ectoparasitism==
Ectoparasites live on the outer surface of the host. This group includes [[tick]]s, [[leeches]], [[mites]] and the [[tsetse fly]]. Ectoparasites do not have a readily available source of nutrients available on the outer surface of the host, so they need adaptations to access host nutrients. This requires penetrating features they can insert into the host, as well as the ability to secrete digestive enzymes and the presence of a gut to digest host-derived nutrients.&lt;ref name="Cain2011" /&gt; Ectoparasites also have a variety of parasite transporters and permeases to enable them to acquire nutrition from their host, across numerous membranes.  Many ectoparasites are known pathogen vectors, so they transmit these pathogens during nutrient acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Nieto| title=Ectoparasite diversity and exposure to vector-borne disease agents in wild rodents in central coastal California | journal=[[Journal of Medical Entomology]] | volume=44 | year=2007| pages=328–335 | doi=10.1603/0022-2585(2007)44[328:edaetv]2.0.co;2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsetse flies, the insect vector of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of [[African trypanosomiasis]] are an example of an ectoparasite. These insects have a specialised structure, a ''[[proboscis]]'', that they use to pierce and draw nutrients from their host. These then employ transport proteins to transport the essential nutrients across membranes, ultimately from the host to the tsetse fly gut for digestion. Various permeases have been characterised including those that import [[hexoses]], [[carboxylates]], and amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Geiser| title=Molecular Pharmacology of Adenosine Transport in Trypanosoma brucei: P1/P2 Revisited | journal=[[Molecular Pharmacology]] | volume=68 | year=2005| pages=589–595 | doi=10.1124/mol.104.010298|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Another ectoparasite is scabies, caused by ''Sarcoptes scabiei''.  Scabies, transmitted by female mites, depends on nutrition from its host for survival. This ectoparasite obtains nutrients by burrowing into the skin of the host.  Studies have also identified the presence of scabies mite inactivated protease paralogues (SMIPPs), which are believed to compete with host proteases.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Henggae| title= Scabies: a ubiquitous neglected skin disease | journal=[[The Lancet Infectious Diseases]] | volume=6 | year=2006| pages=769–779 | doi=10.1016/s1473-3099(06)70654-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on the host==
Parasitic nutrition is beneficial to the parasite but typically detrimental to the host since it deprives the host of nutrients. This mode of nutrition has numerous side effects on the host including weight loss, anaemia, obstruction of the intestine, damage to the host intestinal wall and in some cases transmission of serious pathogens—e.g., the ectoparasitic tsetse fly, which transmits African trypanosomiasis.&lt;ref name="Cain2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalton2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shrihari et al. 2011 1101–1103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Landfear2011" /&gt;

==Applications==
Nutrient acquisition is an important component of parasite pathogenesis since it is critical to parasite survival.&lt;ref name="Landfear2011" /&gt; Understanding the mechanisms of parasite nutrient acquisition therefore identifies novel targets we can exploit as a form of parasite control—e.g., through knock-out or inhibition of crucial transporters or destruction of penetrative anatomical features. Several studies have looked into nutrient acquisition as a method of parasite control, including the development of vaccines against helminth parasites by targeting digestive proteases.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Pearson|title=Blunting the knife: development of vaccines targeting digestive proteases of blood-feeding helminth parasites |journal=[[Biological Chemistry (journal)|Biological Chemistry]] | volume=391 | year=2010| pages=901–911 | doi=10.1515/bc.2010.074|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parasitic nutrition in plants==
Plants are typically [[autotroph]]ic organisms meaning that they synthesise their own 'food' from inorganic compounds by photosynthesis. Some plants however are unable to synthesise their own 'food' by photosynthesis and therefore acquire nutrients by parasitic nutrition from other living plants. Plants that acquire nutrients in this way are called ''[[parasitic plants]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= 
Plant Defense: Warding Off Attack by Pathogens, Herbivores and Parasitic Plants | edition=First | year=2010| publisher = John Wiley and Son}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plants have modified root structures called ''[[haustorium]]'' that they use to penetrate the vascular bundle of host plants and, essentially, 'steal' nutrients from host plants.&lt;ref name="Cain2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Marquardt| title=Constraints on host use by a parasitic plant | journal=[[Oecologia]] | volume=164 | year=2010| pages=177–184 | doi=10.1007/s00442-010-1664-7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parasitic plants include [[Cuscuta|Dodder]], ''[[Rafflesia]]'' and [[Orobanche|Broomrape]].

'''Structural steel pipe racks''' typically support pipes, power cables and instrument cable trays in petrochemical, chemical and power plants. Occasionally, pipe racks may also support mechanical equipment, vessels and valve access platforms. Main pipe racks generally transfer material between equipment and storage or utility areas. Storage racks found in warehouses are not pipe racks, even if they store lengths of pipe.&lt;ref name=drakewalter&gt;Drake, Richard M., P.E., S.E., SECB and Walter, Robert J., P.E., S.E. {{cite web|url=http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1388 |title=Seismic Design of Structural Steel Pipe Racks |publisher=Structure Magazine |date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pipe rack is the main artery of a process unit. Pipe racks carry process and utility piping and may also include instrument and cable trays as well as equipment mounted over all of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bausbacher|first=Ed|title=Process Plant Layout and Piping Design|year=1993|publisher=PTR Prentice-Hall,inc|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-13-138629-8|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipe racks consist of a series of transverse bents that run along the length of the pipe system, spaced at uniform intervals typically around 20&amp;nbsp;ft.  To allow maintenance access under the pipe rack, the transverse bents are typically moment frames.  Transverse bents are typically connected with longitudinal struts.&lt;ref name="drakewalter"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6102">The [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] that are concerned with the secretion of [[gums]], [[resins]], volatile oils, [[nectar]] 
[[latex]], and other substances in plants are called '''secretory tissues'''
These tissues are divided into two groups-
# Laticiferous tissues
# Glandular tissues

== Introduction ==
[[Cell (biology)|Cells]] or organizations of cells which produce a variety of secretions. The secreted substance may remain deposited within the secretory cell itself or may be excreted, that is, released from the cell. Substances may be excreted to the surface of the plant or into intercellular cavities or canals. Some of the many substances contained in the secretions are not further utilized by the plant (resins, rubber, tannins, and various crystals), while others take part in the functions of the plant (enzymes and hormones). Secretory structures range from single cells scattered among other kinds of cells to complex structures involving many cells; the latter are often called [[gland_(botany)|glands]].

Epidermal hairs of many plants are secretory or glandular. Such hairs commonly have a head composed of one or more secretory cells borne on a stalk. The hair of a stinging needle is bulbous below and extends into a long, fine process above. If one touches the hair, its tip breaks off, the sharp edge penetrates the [[skin]], and the poisonous secretion is released.
Glands secreting a sugary liquid—the nectar—in flowers pollinated by insects are called nectaries. Nectaries may occur on the floral stalk or on any floral organ: sepal, petal, stamen, or ovary.

The [[hydathode]] structures discharge water—a phenomenon called [[guttation]] through openings in margins or tips of leaves.
The water flows through the [[xylem]] to its endings in the leaf and then through the [[intercellular space]]s of the hydathode tissue toward the openings in the epidermis. Strictly speaking, such hydathodes are not glands because they are passive with regard to the flow of water. &lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;
Some [[carnivorous plants]] have glands that produce secretions
capable of digesting insects and small animals. These glands
occur on leaf parts modified as insect-trapping structures. In
the sundews ( Drosera ) the traps bear stalked glands, called
tentacles. When an insect lights on the leaf, the tentacles bend
down and cover the victim with a mucilaginous secretion, the
enzymes of which digest the insect. See  [[insectivorous plants]].
&lt;br/&gt; 
Resin ducts are canals lined with secretory cells that release
resins into the canal. Resin ducts are common in gymnosperms
and occur in various tissues of roots, stems, leaves, and
reproductive structures. &lt;br/&gt;
Gum ducts are similar to resin ducts and may contain resins,
oils, and gums. Usually, the term gum duct is used with
reference to the dicotyledons, although gum ducts also may
occur in the [[gymnosperms]].
Oil ducts are intercellular canals whose secretory cells produce
oils or similar substances. Such ducts may be seen, for
example, in various parts of the plant of the carrot family
([[Umbelliferae]]).
Laticifers are cells or systems of cells containing latex, a milky
or clear, colored or colorless liquid. [[Latex]] occurs under
pressure and exudes from the plant when the latter is cut.

== Laticiferous tissues ==

These consist of thin walled, greatly elongated and much 
branched ducts containing a milky or yellowish colored 
juice known as [[latex]]. They contain numerous nuclei 
which lie embedded in the thin lining layer of [[protoplasm]].
They irregularly distributed in the mass of parenchymatous cells.
Laticiferous ducts, in which latex are found are again two types-
# Latex cell or non-articulate latex ducts
# Latex vessels or articulate latex

=== Latex cells ===
Also called as "non-articulate latex ducts", these ducts are independent units which extend as branched structures for long distances in the plant body.
They originates as minute structures, elongate quickly and by repeated branching ramify in all directions but do not fuse together.
Thus a network is not formed as in latex vessels.

=== Latex vessel ===
Also called "articulate latex ducts", these ducts or vecssels are the result of anastamosing of many cells together.
They grow more or less as parallel ducts which by means of branching and frequent anastamose form a complex network.
Latex vessels are commonly found in many angiosperm families [[Papaveraceae]], [[Compositae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Moraceae]], etc.

=== Function ===
The function of laticiferous ducts is not clearly understood. They may also act as food storage organs or as reservoir of waste products.
They may also act as translocatory tissues.

== Glandular tissues ==

This tissue consists of special structures; the glands. These glands contain some secretory or excretory products.
A gland may consist of isolated cells or small group cells with or without a central cavity. 
They are of various kinds and may be internal or external.
&lt;br /&gt;
Internal glands are
* Oil-gland secreting essential oils, as in the fruits and leaves of orange, lemon.
* Mucilage secreting glands, as in the betel leaf 
* Glands secreting gum, resin, tannin, etc. 
* Digestive glands secreting enzymes or digestive agents 
* Special water secreting glands at the tip of veins 
&lt;br /&gt;
External glands are commonly short hairs tipped by glands. They are 
* water-secreting hairs or glands,
* Glandular hairs secreting gum like substances as in [[tobacco]], [[plumbago]], etc. 
* Glandular hairs secreting irritating, poisonous substances, as in nettles
* Honey glands, as in [[carnivorous plants]].

'''''Practical Ethics''''' (1979; second edition 1993; third edition 2011) is an introduction to [[applied ethics]] by [[bioethics|bioethical]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]. The book, which has been translated into a number of languages, caused outrage in German-speaking countries.

==Summary==

Singer analyzes, in detail, why and how beings' interests should be weighed. In his view, a being's interests should always be weighed according to that being's concrete properties, and not according to its belonging to some abstract group. Singer studies a number of ethical issues including: [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], ability, species, [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], [[infanticide]], [[Embryonic stem cell|embryo experimentation]], the moral [[Animal rights|status of animals]], political violence, [[overseas aid]], and whether we have an obligation to assist others. The 1993 second edition adds chapters on [[refugees]], the environment, [[Equal opportunity|equality]] and [[disability]], embryo experimentation, and the treatment of academics in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophyblog.com.au/review-of-practical-ethics-by-peter-singer |title=Review of Practical Ethics by Peter Singer | date = 2006-09-20 |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521439718 |title=''Practical Ethics'' 2nd edition |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third edition published in 2011 omits the chapter on refugees, and contains a new chapter on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item5759355/Practical%20Ethics/?site_locale=en_US |title=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privy digging''' is the process of locating and investigating the contents of defunct [[outhouse]] vaults.  The purpose of privy digging is the salvage of antique bottles and everyday household artifacts from the past.  Privy digging is a form of [[historical digging]] and is often conducted on private residential properties.  Construction sites and major developments around older areas of towns and cities are also likely places to look for evidence of privies.

Historical contractors (privy diggers who enter into contracts enabling them to investigate vaults on commercial or industrial properties) are also engaging in privy digging.  Privies are also called pits, holes, and chambers.  In some locations, like New York City, vaults are sometimes referred to as “wells”, due to their appearance and often considerable depth.  In these instances well digging is synonymous with privy digging.

== Academic controversies ==
There are controversies regarding who should be permitted to investigate private residential privies and the historical significance of what is found in them.  From a conventional academic perspective, it is assumed that all privies contain vital and unique information which cannot be found elsewhere and that a costly forensic approach is required.  Privy diggers who are not professional archaeologists are labeled “looters”, even while working on sites which are in the process of being destroyed or have already been examined and worked by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jordan, S.|title=Past Objects|publisher=Mark Batty Publisher|place=New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-9820754-3-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While both parties are engaging in similar activities, each is confronted with very different logistics, constraints, and unique opportunities for genuine discovery.

US academics responding to the threat of privy digging, dump digging, metal detecting, and so on have helped create laws protecting objects of a certain age, usually only 50–100 years old, from exploitation by opportunistic looters and other thieves that disturb historic context in pursuit of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf |title= Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979| accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws intended to safeguard legitimate national and cultural treasures are applied to any item found while digging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pandozzi|first1=Frank|title=Metal Detecting Laws Controversial &amp; Unconstitutional, But You Need To Follow Them|url=https://www.metal-detecting-ghost-towns-of-the-east.com/metaldetectinglaws.html|website=Metal Detecting Ghost Towns of the East}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Privies==
Privies can be constructed of stone, brick, or wood and vary considerably from place to place.&lt;ref name="Dantwell &amp; diZerega Wall"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Cantwell, A.  |author2=diZerega Wall, D. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Unearthing Gotham: The Archaeology of New York City|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-300-08415-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some privy vaults are less than 2 feet deep and others are more than 25 feet.  They can be as narrow as 2 feet or as wide as 10 feet, particularly in urban settings where a large privy shed with multiple doors and inner compartments once stood.  Some vaults are cylindrical, these are usually made of stone or brick.  Though there are cylindrical privies that are actual wooden barrels placed in the ground.  Others are rectangular and commonly made of stone, brick, or wood.  Many shallower rectangular vaults were only wood-lined.

Many privies were cleaned out periodically (“dipped”). This routine process addressed the growing concern for foul odors and airborne illnesses which was prevalent at the time.  Dipping also provided some of the necessary organic material for the fertilizer industry. Around the time that modern plumbing was installed, many were cleaned out and backfilled with newer material. These dipped vaults do not have an undisturbed night soil layer and the probability of one containing anything of major archaeological importance is extremely low.

== Sites ==
[[File:woodlined privy.jpg|thumb|300px|Excavating a small wood-lined privy located behind a residence which was built around 1876.]]
Most privies are located behind the building or buildings which they served.  In major urban areas, such as older cities on the US east coast, they are commonly found in the rear section of the residential lot and their size will vary considerably from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegal|first1=Nina|title=MAKING IT WORK; Through Bottles, Darkly, Glimpses of the Past|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/30/nyregion/making-it-work-through-bottles-darkly-glimpses-of-the-past.html?scp=274&amp;sq=dappled&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=1|website=New York Times|date=May 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old fire insurance maps, such as [[Sanborn maps|Sanborn]], indicate that some properties were several lots wide and sometimes had two or more houses within the same boundary line.  In these instances only one privy vault may exist for all the houses being considered or one may exist for each.

In other cases structures apparently had no outlying property at all.  It is assumed that these particular vaults were incorporated into a neighboring lot or perhaps placed within the structure itself somewhere, possibly the basement.  Some insurance maps show outbuildings and sheds, and occasionally privy outlines too.  For example, 19th century insurance maps for New York City generally do not have markings indicating privy placements and some for New Jersey do. However, when researching the latter, privy diggers find no evidence that a privy ever existed where the map outline indicates one should be.

[[File:probing.jpg|thumb|300px|Investigating a barren wood-lined privy (ca. 1840).]]
Some privy diggers also research excavation sites where old houses and other buildings, such as factories, saloons, and hotels once were.  The use of heavy machinery can lead to indications of stone or brick structures and other subterranean anomalies being unearthed.  This in turn can lead to discoveries of privies, cisterns, root cellars, and trash pits.  Managers and owners of construction sites may not accommodate privy diggers on their missions to salvage on these sites.

Some of them are enthusiasts themselves and agreements can be formed allowing diggers to search for privy vaults and landfill deposits.  Some historical diggers focus exclusively on these kinds of sites and over time develop good relations with various development companies.  Permission to salvage on these sites can lead to remarkable discoveries with relatively little physical effort but this is the exception to the rule.

==Locating the privy vault==
When a property is determined to be old enough to have had an outhouse somewhere within its original boundaries, probing and test digging are the common methods for finding it.  The basic probe is made of [[spring steel]] and between 4’ and 6’ feet in length.  Many variations exist and each locale being probed has its own peculiarities regarding which equipment and what techniques should be applied.  Adept privy diggers develop considerable skill interpreting the faint residues which come up on the end of a probe and the subtle noise variations encountered while sliding it in and out of the ground.&lt;ref name=brater&gt;{{Cite book|author=Brater, E.|title=The Essentials of Privy Digging|publisher=e-Book|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test digging involves making a small hole, and going down a few feet, to determine that a probe reading is accurate.  Once something other than dirt and rocks are being encountered and man-made objects are buried deeply in a particular spot, the outline of the privy is carefully excavated.  This can take hours or days depending on its size and the materials being dug through.  Dug dirt or “fluff” as it is sometimes called, is systematically removed from the hole by shoveling.  Deeper holes require a rope and bucket setup and sometimes a tripod mechanism to assist with the removal of material.

==Privy maintenance and garbage disposal==
[[File:bricklined privy.jpg|thumb|300px|Near the bottom of a brick-lined urban privy awaiting demolition (ca. 1855). During the [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] excavators encountered an array of antique bottles and other interesting items which were manufactured in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s.]]
Due to extreme odors and overfilling, a high percentage of privy vaults were cleaned out, to varying levels, while still in use.  This is commonly referred to as “dipping” among privy diggers.  The amount of dipping that occurred, how far down a well material was cleared and how frequently it was cleared, varied from privy to privy.  After plumbing was installed at the residence there was a final cleaning, which had a tendency of removing everything down to the deepest level of the vault.

Even at depths reaching 30 feet or more, some of the deepest vaults known to exist, many were cleaned to the base. Alternatively, a small percentage of shallow vaults extending down about 3 feet or less have contained noteworthy bottles, numerous fragments of dinner plates, cups, bowls, pitchers, tobacco pipes, clam and oyster shells, food bones and even sparse night soil pockets around the edges.

During the mid 19th century operators connected to the booming waste-generated fertilizer (night soil) business circulated cities and towns emptying vaults.  In rural areas where vaults are usually much smaller and shallower farmers and other property owners often conducted this task themselves.  Despite lying in human waste and other decaying refuse for years, many recyclable bottles of the time, and other reusable items, were retrieved during the dipping process.  Genuine garbage would be taken to landfills and other suitable locations and dumped, along with a never ending supply of stove and fireplace ashes.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{Cite book|author=Miller, B.|title=Fat of the Land: Garbage of New York-The Last Two Hundred Years|publisher=Basic Books|place=New York|year=2000|isbn=1-56858-172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence suggests that not all dippers were equally concerned with being meticulous and periodically dozens of bottles, and even some night soil, can still be found while privy digging.  The many out of place bottles sometimes discovered in clusters near the top or bottom of a dipped out vault are referred to by diggers as “kick-backs”, or “throw-ins”, and were left intentionally by the workers who cleaned out the privy.

Throughout the decades of the middle and late 19th century, the years diggers tend to focus on due to rapid changes in bottle manufacturing, privies were only incidental or sporadic dumping spots for bottles, kitchen garbage and other refuse.  Some privies were never used for that purpose at all and for practical reasons only a very small percentage of a household’s total trash could ever be distributed there.  Due to the enormous quantities of everyday garbage being produced by this time in history, not to mention the hundreds of millions of bottles sold each year in the United States alone, the vaults would have filled up very quickly requiring constant maintenance instead of being emptied just every so often.

Moreover, it was generally acceptable to dump reeking trash just about anywhere then without worrying about legal consequences.  Preferred places were lowland areas near the edges of towns and cities, down embankments and into ravines, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, bogs, shorelines, backyard burning pits and other locales.  For example, New York City sent scows brimming with garbage out into the harbor everyday where very cheap labor shoveled it directly into the water without a second thought.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;  This process went on for centuries and an endless supply of collectable items, antiques and archaeological information alike remain in these dumping places to this day.

A sterile mixture of dirt, sand, rocks, ashes, brick bats and other worthless debris manufactured around 1880-1920 was used to backfill privies once plumbing was installed at a particular address.  With or without night soil deposits remaining down below there is no longer any offensive odor.

== Items recovered ==
[[File:Yale_bottle.gif|thumb|200px|An iron pontiled soda or beer bottle, ca. 1855.]]
Privy digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting. Glass or clay bottles are the most likely items to be found in an average 19th century privy. Yet, more often than not they are found prohibitively damaged. This may be due to the large number of brickbats and stones which are found at all levels of the privy.  Excavators have theorized that at least some of them were thrown in with the intention of crushing down the contents of the vault, so it could be used longer without needing to be cleaned.  The high percentage of broken items is one reason why privy digging is one of the most unpredictable and arduous methods of attempting to form a bottle collection.

Pontiled medicine bottles, ink bottles, beer and soda bottles, and many others, particularly those manufactured between the 1830s-1860s are among the most sought after and can sell for thousands of dollars each.  However, in reality an average pontiled find discovered while privy digging is worth less than twenty dollars.  Even these are not discovered consistently in most locations.

Not unlike old stamps and coins invariably they are required to be in mint or very good condition to be sufficiently interesting to a serious bottle collector.  An enormous quantity of rare bottles are known to exist in private collections, museums, museum and university basements, and elsewhere but these prime examples are seldom found on average privy digs.  In fact a high percentage of all valuable bottles and related containers were never buried in privies, dumps or elsewhere; these are known as “attic” bottles among privy diggers and bottle collectors.

There are exceptions and over time some groups of regularly active diggers, operating in good locations, will encounter thousands of antique bottles and other interesting things. The vast majority of items will be very common examples of nominal value and not very useful to serious collectors, historians, or archaeologists.

Not unlike dump diggers privy diggers may also encounter miscellaneous tableware (banded ware,&lt;ref name=sussman&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sussman, L.|title=Mocha, Banded, Cat’s Eye, and Other Factory-Made Slipware|publisher=Studies in Northeast Historical Archaeology|year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; redware, mocha,&lt;ref name=rickard&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rickard, J.|title=Mocha and related dipped wares, 1770-1939 |publisher=University Press of New England|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other slipwares), stoneware, occasionally clay pipes, doll parts, tea set pieces, [[marble (toy)|marbles]], buttons, chamber pots, decorative porcelain pot lids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deantiques.com/PLG/|title=Antique Pot Lid Gallery|accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bases used for pomades and skin creams, bone or ivory toothbrush handles, hard-rubber combs and hair picks, ambrotypes, and other objects which are usually broken or damaged.&lt;ref name="jordan"/&gt;

Most of these items were valueless and intentionally discarded into the privy, others fell through the opening in the outhouse seat, and some were lost at the hands of small children.&lt;ref name="de sola mendez"&gt;{{Cite book|author=de Sola Mendez, E.|title=Tiny Treasures|publisher=Dollhouse Miniatures|page=28|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each instance the insides of active vaults were very caustic environments, the highly toxic ingredients causing most things to break down and rot very quickly.

== Related topics and history ==
Privy diggers, along with dump diggers and other historical diggers are enthusiastic about making their own discoveries and will get sufficiently dirty as a result.  Though there are some exceptions this work is usually done by hand and requires a remarkable degree of persistence and tenacity.  Career level diggers are obsessive by nature, sometimes achieving considerable skill with the various forms of privy digging techniques available.  Some privy diggers also use a metal detector to pinpoint old coins and other easy to miss metal objects. Some privy diggers are metal detectorists and some metal detectorists are also privy diggers, dump diggers and so on.  However, each designation is a specific subject on its own.

[[File:stone privy well.jpg|thumb|300px|Excavating a large stone-lined urban privy during a major property renovation (ca. 1851).]]
Privy digging has things in common with [[dump digging]] and to some degree treasure hunting and garbology but is none of these exclusively as it involves salvaging the contents of defunct privies more than anything else.  Privy digging and dump digging are equally concerned with antique bottles and related items.  Though many exceptions exist in most instances even the oldest dump-bottles are not as old as privy bottles can be.

Dumps are commonly associated with bottles and trash manufactured between the 1880s-1920s.  This was a time when everyday bottles were being mass-produced annually by the hundreds of millions.  They were reused less and often thrown away rather than recycled due to their relatively inexpensive production costs.

Many bottles were still being mouth-blown and their lips formed by assorted tooling devices as late as 1915-20.  The patent for the first fully automatic bottle machine, the Owens Automatic Bottle Machine, was not issued until 1903.  And by 1906 it was swiftly replacing the old method at glasshouses nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Bureau of Land Management and Society for Historic Archaeology: Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-07-15 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Early examples of machine made bottles manufactured between about 1906 and 1915 often resemble their predecessors in shape and color and can be nominally valuable for that reason.

Whether found in privies or dumps late period mouth-blown bottles manufactured between about 1880-1915 have a lesser amount of serious collectable potential depending on rarity, condition and color.  Dug bottles manufactured between 1880 and 1915 have sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars but statistically this is very rare.

Although privy diggers usually attempt to focus on the contents of vaults built before the Civil War, these too can also contain bottles made as late as the 1920s or later up near the top.  Depending on when a vault went into permanent disuse it could contain bottles and debris deposited as late as the second half of the 20th century.  According to a 1950 census 50 million homes reported no indoor plumbing. In 1990 more than 4 million old style privies were still in use coast to coast.&lt;ref name=barlow&gt;{{Cite book|author=Barlow, R.|title=The Vanishing American Outhouse|publisher=Studio|place=New York|year=2000|isbn=0-14-028868-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No matter what is encountered near the top assuming a given vault was active in 1850 its potential for older bottles lying at a lower section has a consistently strong draw for serious privy diggers.

Whether mold blown or free blown (both forms of mouth-blowing and considered hand made), most bottles produced before 1860-65 have a distinct scar on their base.  This mark is the result of removing the pontil rod.  Something which was temporarily fused to the base in order to handle them effectively while they were still exceedingly hot, as their necks and lips were being tooled at the glassworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Burea of Land Management and Society for Historic Archaeology: Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-11-26 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decades just prior to the absence of pontil rods from bottle-glass making were a time when endless variations pertaining to shape, size, style, color and embossing were being produced regularly in an unprecedented quantity.  Some of the most interesting bottles were manufactured during this time; 1830s-1860s.

Even after the pontil rod was replaced by assorted clamping mechanisms known as “snap cases”, many bottles were still being created in the same interesting molds and sold in huge quantities annually.  These are known as smooth base bottles and are sometimes found in privies which were in use after the 1860s and as late as the 1880s.  Visually, the difference between an early smooth base and a pontiled example of exactly the same bottle is insignificant but to a collector it often means everything.  Rare early smooth base bottles can occasionally be as valuable as rare pontiled bottles but statistically they are unlikely to be discovered with any regularity on average privy digs.

The term '''process model''' is used in various contexts. For example, in [[business process modeling]] the enterprise process model is often referred to as the ''business process model''.

[[Image:Meta-levels.svg|thumb|right|300px|Abstraction level for processes&lt;ref name="Rolland1993"&gt;
[[Colette Rolland]] (1993). ''Modeling the Requirements Engineering Process. 3rd European-Japanese Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Overview ==
Process models are [[wiktionary:Process|process]]es of the same nature that are classified together into a model. Thus, a process model is a description of a process at the type level. Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it. The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations. One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.&lt;ref name="Rolland1998"&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] and Pernici, C. Thanos (1998). ''A Comprehensive View of Process Engineering. Proceedings of the 10th International Conference CAiSE'98''. B. [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] 1413. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of a process model are to be:
*Descriptive
**Track what actually happens during a process
**Take the point of view of an external observer who looks at the way a process has been performed and determines the improvements that must be made to make it perform more effectively or efficiently.
*Prescriptive
**Define the desired processes and how they should/could/might be performed.
**Establish rules, guidelines, and behavior patterns which, if followed, would lead to the desired process performance. They can range from strict enforcement to flexible guidance.
*Explanatory
**Provide explanations about the rationale of processes.
**Explore and evaluate the several possible courses of action based on rational [[argument]]s.
**Establish an explicit link between processes and the requirements that the model needs to fulfill.
**Pre-defines points at which data can be extracted for reporting purposes.

== Purpose ==
From a theoretical point of view, the [[meta-process modeling]] explains the key concepts needed to describe what happens in the development process, on what, when it happens, and why. From an operational point of view, the meta-process modeling is aimed at providing guidance for method engineers and application developers.&lt;ref name=Rolland1993/&gt;

The activity of [[business model|modeling a business]] process usually predicates a need to change processes or identify issues to be corrected. This transformation may or may not require IT involvement, although that is a common driver for the need to model a business process. [[Change management]] programmes are desired to put the processes into practice. With advances in technology from larger platform vendors, the vision of business process models (BPM) becoming fully executable (and capable of round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality every day. Supporting technologies include [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), [[model-driven architecture]], and [[service-oriented architecture]].

Process modeling addresses the process aspects of an enterprise [[business architecture]], leading to an all encompassing [[enterprise architecture]].  The relationships of a business processes in the context of the rest of the enterprise systems, data, organizational structure, strategies, etc. create greater capabilities in analyzing and planning a change. One real-world example is in corporate [[mergers and acquisitions]]; understanding the processes in both companies in detail, allowing management to identify redundancies resulting in a smoother merger.

Process modeling has always been a key aspect of [[business process reengineering]], and continuous improvement approaches seen in [[Six Sigma]].

== Classification of process models ==

=== By coverage ===
There are five types of coverage where the term process model has been defined differently:&lt;ref name="Dowson1988"&gt;M. Dowson (1998). ''Iteration in the Software Process, Proc 9th Int. Conf. on Software Engineering''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Activity-oriented: related set of activities conducted for the specific purpose of product definition; a set of partially ordered steps intended to reach a goal.&lt;ref name="Feiler1993"&gt;P.H. Feiler and [[W.S. Humphrey]]. (1993). ''Software Process Development and Enactment: Concepts and Definitions, Proc. 2nd Int. Conf. on "Software Process"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Product-oriented: series of activities that cause sensitive product transformations to reach the desired product.&lt;ref name=Sianipar2014&gt;

* Decision-oriented: set of related decisions conducted for the specific purpose of product definition.
* Context-oriented: sequence of contexts causing successive product transformations under the influence of a decision taken in a context.
*Strategy-oriented: allow building models representing multi-approach processes and plan different possible ways to elaborate the product based on the notion of intention and strategy.&lt;ref name="Rolland1999"&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] (1994). ''A Multi-Model View of Process Modelling. Requirements Engineering''. Vol 4, Nr 4. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By alignment ===
Processes can be of different kinds.&lt;ref name=Rolland1998/&gt; These definitions "correspond to the various ways in which a process can be modelled".

* Strategic processes
** investigate alternative ways of doing a thing and eventually produce a plan for doing it
** are often creative and require human co-operation; thus, alternative generation and selection from an alternative are very critical activities
* Tactical processes
** help in the achievement of a plan
** are more concerned with the tactics to be adopted for actual plan achievement than with the development of a plan of achievement
* Implementation processes
** are the lowest level processes
** are directly concerned with the details of the ''what'' and ''how'' of plan implementation

=== By granularity ===
[[Granularity]] refers to the level of detail of a process model and affects the kind of guidance, explanation and trace that can be provided. Coarse granularity restricts these to a rather limited level of detail whereas fine granularity provides more detailed capability. The nature of granularity needed is dependent on the situation at hand.&lt;ref name=Rolland1998/&gt;

Project manager, customer representatives, the general, top-level, or middle management require rather coarse-grained process description as they want to gain an overview of time, budget, and resource planning for their decisions. In contrast, software engineers, users, testers, analysts, or software system architects will prefer a fine-grained process model where the details of the model can provide them with instructions and important execution dependencies such as the dependencies between people.

While notations for fine-grained models exist, most traditional process models are coarse-grained descriptions. Process models should, ideally, provide a wide range of granularity (e.g. Process Weaver).&lt;ref name=Rolland1998/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernström1991"&gt;C. Fernström and L. Ohlsson (1991). ''Integration Needs in Process Enacted Environments, Proc. 1st Int. Conf. on the Software Process''. IEEE computer Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By flexibility ===
[[Image:flexibility.png|thumb|right|300px|Flexibility of Method construction approaches &lt;ref name="HBO"&gt;
A.F. Harmsen, [[Sjaak Brinkkemper]] and J.L.H. Oei  (1994). ''Situational Method Engineering for information Systems Project Approaches''. North Holland&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was found that while process models were prescriptive, in actual practice departures from the prescription can occur.&lt;ref name=Rolland1999/&gt; Thus, frameworks for adopting methods evolved so that systems development methods match specific organizational situations and thereby improve their usefulness. The development of such frameworks is also called situational [[method engineering]].

Method construction approaches can be organized in a flexibility spectrum ranging from 'low' to 'high'.&lt;ref name=HBO/&gt;

Lying at the 'low' end of this spectrum are rigid methods, whereas at the 'high' end there are modular method construction. Rigid methods are completely pre-defined and leave little scope for adapting them to the situation at hand. On the other hand, modular methods can be modified and augmented to fit a given situation. Selecting a rigid methods allows each project to choose its method from a panel of rigid, pre-defined methods, whereas selecting a path within a method consists of choosing the appropriate path for the situation at hand. Finally, selecting and tuning a method allows each project to select methods from different approaches and tune them to the project's needs." &lt;ref name="Rolland1997"&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] (1997). 'A Primer for Method Engineering. Proceedings of the INFORSID Conference''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality of methods ==

As the quality of process models is being discussed in this paper, there is a need to elaborate quality of modeling techniques as an important essence in quality of process models.  In most existing frameworks created for understanding the quality, the line between quality of modeling techniques and the quality of models as a result of the application of those techniques are not clearly drawn.  This report will concentrate both on quality of process modeling techniques and quality of process models to clearly differentiate the two.
Various frameworks were developed to help in understanding quality of process modeling techniques, one example is Quality based modeling evaluation framework or known as Q-Me framework which argued to provide set of well defined quality properties and procedures to make an objective assessment of this properties possible.&lt;ref name=hommes/&gt;
This framework also has advantages of providing uniform and formal description of the model element within one or different model types using one modeling techniques&lt;ref name=hommes&gt;BJ Hommes, V Van Reijswoud, Assessing the Quality of Business Process Modeling Techniques -Proceedings of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences – 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
In short this can make assessment of both the product quality and the process quality of modeling techniques with regard to a set of properties that have been defined before.

Quality properties that relate to [[business process modeling]] techniques discussed in &lt;ref name=hommes/&gt; are:

* Expressiveness: the degree to which a given modeling technique is able to denote the models of any number and kinds of application domains.
* Arbitrariness: the degree of freedom one has when modeling one and the same domain
* Suitability: the degree to which a given modeling technique is specifically tailored for a specific kind of application domain.
* Comprehensibility: the ease with which the way of working and way of modeling are understood by participants.
* Coherence: the degree to which the individual sub models of a way of modeling constitute a whole.
* Completeness; the degree to which all necessary concepts of the application domain are represented in the way of modeling.
* Efficiency: the degree to which the modeling process uses resources such as time and people.
* Effectiveness: the degree to which the modeling process achieves its goal.

To assess the quality of Q-ME framework; it is used to illustrate the quality of the dynamic essentials modeling of the organisation (DEMO) business modeling techniques.

It is stated that the evaluation of the Q-ME framework to the DEMO modeling techniques has revealed the shortcomings of Q-ME. One particular is that it does not include quantifiable metric to express the quality of business modeling technique which makes it hard to compare quality of different techniques in an overall rating.

There is also a systematic approach for quality measurement of modeling techniques known as complexity metrics suggested by Rossi et al. (1996). Techniques of Meta model is used as a basis for computation of these complexity metrics. In comparison to quality framework proposed by [[John Krogstie|Krogstie]], quality measurement focus more on technical level instead of individual model level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bart-Jan Hommes, ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220260389_Business_Process_Change_A_Study_of_Methodologies_Techniques_and_Tools/file/72e7e52a1d6f118dba.pdf The evaluation of business process modeling techniques],'' phd thesis TU Delft 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors (Cardoso, Mendling, Neuman and Reijers, 2006) used complexity metrics to measure the simplicity and understandability of a design. This is supported by later research done by Mendling ''et al.'' who argued that without using the quality metrics to help question quality properties of a model, simple process can be modeled in a complex and unsuitable way. This in turn can lead to a lower understandability, higher maintenance cost and perhaps inefficient execution of the process in question.&lt;ref name="MendlingMoserBPM"&gt;J. Mendling, M. Moser, G. Neumann, H. Verbeek, B. Dongen, W. van der Aalst, A Quantitative Analysis of Faulty EPCs in the SAP Reference Model, BPM Center Report BPM-06-08, BPMCenter.org, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of modeling technique is important in creating models that are of quality and contribute to the correctness and usefulness of models.

== Quality of models ==
Earliest process models reflected the dynamics of the process with a practical process obtained by instantiation in terms of relevant concepts, available technologies, specific implementation environments, process constraints and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Enormous number of research has been done on quality of models but less focus has been shifted towards the quality of process models. Quality issues of process models cannot be evaluated exhaustively however there are four main guidelines and frameworks in practice for such. These are: top-down quality frameworks, bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects, empirical surveys related to modeling techniques, and pragmatic guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Mendling |first2=H. A. |last2=Reijers |first3=W. M. P. |last3=van der Aalst |title=Seven process modeling guidelines (7PMG) |journal=Information and Software Technology |volume=52 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=127–136 |doi=10.1016/j.infsof.2009.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hommes quoted Wang ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt; that all the main characteristic of quality of models can all be grouped under 2 groups namely correctness and usefulness of a model, correctness ranges from the model correspondence to the phenomenon that is modeled to its correspondence to syntactical rules of the modeling and also it is independent of the purpose to which the model is used.

Whereas the usefulness can be seen as the model being helpful for the specific purpose at hand for which the model is constructed at first place. Hommes also  makes a further distinction between internal correctness (empirical, syntactical and semantic quality) and external correctness (validity).

A common starting point for defining the quality of conceptual model is to look at the linguistic properties of the modeling language of which syntax and semantics are most often applied.

Also the broader approach is to be based on semiotics rather than linguistic as was done by Krogstie using the top-down quality framework known as SEQUAL.&lt;ref name=krogstie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O. |last=Lindland |first2=G. |last2=Sindre |first3=A. |last3=Sølvberg |title=Understanding quality in conceptual modeling |journal=IEEE Software |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=1994 |pages=42–49 |doi=10.1109/52.268955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, knowledge Externalisation, domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling.

The framework does not however provide ways to determine various degrees of quality but has been used extensively for business process modeling in empirical tests carried out &lt;ref&gt;D. Moody, G. Sindre, T. Brasethvik and A. Sølvberg, Evaluating the quality of process models: empirical testing of a quality framework. In: S. Spaccapietra, S.T. March and Y. Kambayashi, Editors, Conceptual Modeling – ER 2002, 21st International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, Tampere, Finland, October 7–11, 2002, Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol. 2503, Springer (2002), pp. 380–396.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to previous research done by Moody ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Moody, G. Sindre, T. Brasethvik, A. Sølvberg. Evaluating the Quality of Process Models: Empirical Testing of a Quality Framework&lt;/ref&gt; with use of conceptual model quality framework proposed by Lindland ''et al.'' (1994) to evaluate quality of process model, three levels of quality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=C. W. |year=1970 |title=Foundations of the Theory of Signs |location=Chicago |publisher=Chicago University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; were identified:

* Syntactic quality: Assesses extent to which the model conforms to the grammar rules of modeling language being used.
* Semantic quality: whether the model accurately represents user requirements
* Pragmatic quality: whether the model can be understood sufficiently by all relevant stakeholders in the modeling process. That is the model should enable its interpreters to make use of it for fulfilling their need.

From the research it was noticed that the quality framework was found to be both easy to use and useful in evaluating the quality of process models however it had limitations in regards to reliability and difficult to identify defects. These limitations led to refinement of the framework through subsequent research done by [[John Krogstie|Krogstie]]. This framework is called SEQUEL framework by Krogstie ''et al.'' 1995 (Refined further by Krogstie &amp; Jørgensen, 2002) which included three more quality aspects.

* Physical quality: whether the externalized model is persistent and available for the audience to make sense of it.
* Empirical quality: whether the model is modeled according to the established regulations regarding a given language.
* Social quality: This regards the agreement between the stakeholders in the modeling domain.

Dimensions of Conceptual Quality framework&lt;ref&gt;[[John Krogstie|J. Krogstie]], O. Lindland, G. Sindre, Defining quality aspects for conceptual models, in: Proc. IFIP8.1 Working Conference on Information Systems Concepts: Towards a Consolidation of Views, Marburg, Germany, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modeling Domain is the set of all statements that are relevant and correct for describing a problem domain, Language Extension is the set of all statements that are possible given the grammar and vocabulary of the modeling languages used. Model Externalization is the conceptual representation of the problem domain.

It is defined as the set of statements about the problem domain that are actually made. Social Actor Interpretation and Technical Actor Interpretation are the sets of statements that actors both human model users and the tools that interact with the model, respectively 'think' the conceptual representation of the problem domain contains.

Finally, Participant Knowledge is the set of statements that human actors, who are involved in the modeling process, believe should be made to represent the problem domain. These quality dimensions were later divided into two groups that deal with physical and social aspects of the model.

In later work, Krogstie et al.&lt;ref name=krogstie/&gt; stated that while the extension of the SEQUAL framework  has fixed some of the limitation of the initial framework, however other limitation remain .
In particular, the framework is too static in its view upon semantic quality, mainly considering models, not modeling activities, and comparing these models to a static domain rather than seeing the model as a facilitator for changing the domain.

Also, the framework's definition of pragmatic quality is quite narrow, focusing on understanding, in line with the semiotics of Morris, while newer research in linguistics and semiotics has focused beyond mere understanding, on how the model is used and affects its interpreters.

The need for a more dynamic view in the semiotic quality framework is particularly evident when considering process models, which themselves often prescribe or even enact actions in the problem domain, hence a change to the model may also change the problem domain directly. This paper discusses the quality framework in relation to active process models and suggests a revised framework based on this.

Further work by Krogstie ''et al.'' (2006) to revise SEQUAL framework to be more appropriate for active process models  by redefining physical quality with a more narrow interpretation than previous research.&lt;ref name =krogstie&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Krogstie |first2=G. |last2=Sindre |first3=H. |last3=Jorgensen |title=Process models representing knowledge for action: a revised quality framework |journal=European Journal of Information Systems |volume=15 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=91–102 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other framework in use is Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) &lt;ref&gt;J. Becker, M. Rosemann and C. Uthmann, Guidelines of business process modeling. In: W. van der Aalst, J. Desel and A. Oberweis, Editors, Business Process Management. Models, Techniques, and Empirical Studies, Springer, Berlin (2000), pp. 30–49&lt;/ref&gt; based on general accounting principles include the six principles: Correctness, Clarity deals with the comprehensibility and explicitness (System description) of model systems.
Comprehensibility relates to graphical arrangement of the information objects and, therefore, supports the understand ability of a model.
Relevance relates to the model and the situation being presented. Comparability involves the ability to compare models that is semantic comparison between two models, Economic efficiency; the produced cost of the design process need at least to be covered by the proposed use of cost cuttings and revenue increases.

Since the purpose of organizations in most cases is the maximization of profit, the principle defines the borderline for the modeling process. The last principle is Systematic design defines that there should be an accepted differentiation between diverse views within modeling.
Correctness, relevance and economic efficiency are prerequisites in the quality of models and must be fulfilled while the remaining guidelines are optional but necessary.

The two frameworks SEQUAL and GOM have a limitation of use in that they cannot be used by people who are not competent with modeling. They provide major quality metrics but are not easily applicable by non-experts.

The use of bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects of process models is trying to bridge the gap of use of the other two frameworks by non-experts in modeling but it is mostly theoretical and no empirical tests have been carried out to support their use.

Most experiments carried out relate to the relationship between metrics and quality aspects and these works have been done individually by different authors: Canfora et al. study the connection mainly between count metrics (for example, the number of tasks or splits -and maintainability of software process models);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Canfora |first2=F. |last2=Garcia |first3=M. |last3=Piattini |first4=F. |last4=Ruiz |first5=C. |last5=Visaggio |title=A family of experiments to validate metrics for software process models |journal=Journal of Systems and Software |volume=77 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=113–129 |doi=10.1016/j.jss.2004.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardoso validates the correlation between control flow complexity and perceived complexity; and Mendling et al. use metrics to predict control flow errors such as deadlocks in process models.&lt;ref name=MendlingMoserBPM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mendling, Detection and prediction of errors in epc business process models, Ph.D. thesis, Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, http://wi.wu-wien.ac.at/home/mendling/publications/Mendling%20Doctoral%20thesis.pdf, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The results reveal that an increase in size of a model appears to reduce its quality and comprehensibility.
Further work by Mendling et al. investigates the connection between metrics and understanding &lt;ref name=mendling14/&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;J. Mendling and M. Strembeck, Influence factors of understanding business process models. In: W. Abramowicz and D. Fensel, Editors, Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Business Information Systems (BIS 2008), Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing vol. 7, Springer-Verlag (2008), p. 142153.&lt;/ref&gt; While some metrics are confirmed regarding their effect, also personal factors of the modeler – like competence – are revealed as important for understanding about the models.

Several empirical surveys carried out still do not give clear guidelines or ways of evaluating the quality of process models but it is necessary to have clear set of guidelines to guide modelers in this task. Pragmatic guidelines have been proposed by different practitioners even though it is difficult to provide an exhaustive account of such guidelines from practice.
In,&lt;ref&gt;B.Silver, Ten Tips for Effective Process Modeling,BPMInstitute.org, &lt;http://www.bpminstitute.org/articles/article/article/bpms-watch-ten-tips-for-effective-process-modeling.html&gt;, Wednesday January 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 10 tips for process modeling are summarized, many technical definitions and rules are provided, but it does not teach how to create process models that are effective in their primary mission - maximizing shared understanding of the as-is or to-be process.
Most of the guidelines are not easily put to practice but "label activities verb–noun" rule has been suggested by other practitioners before and analyzed empirically.
From the research.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mendling, H.A. Reijers, J. Recker, Activity Labeling in Process Modeling: Empirical Insights and Recommendations, Information Systems. URL: &lt;http://eprints.qut.edu.au/19625/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; value of process models is not only dependent on the choice of graphical constructs but also on their annotation with textual labels which need to be analyzed. It was found that it results in better models in terms of understanding than alternative labelling styles.

From the earlier research and ways to evaluate process model quality it has been seen that the process model's size, structure, expertise of the modeler and modularity affect its overall comprehensibility.&lt;ref name=mendling14&gt;J.

P. van der Aalst, Seven process modeling guidelines (7pmg), QUT ePrints Report 12340, Queensland University of Technology (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 7 Process Modeling Guidelines (7PMG). This guideline uses the verb-object style, as well as guidelines on the number of elements in a model, the application of structured modeling, and the decomposition of a process model. The guidelines are as follows:

* G1 Minimize the number of elements in a model
* G2 Minimize the routing paths per element
* G3 Use one start and one end event
* G4 Model as structured as possible
* G5 Avoid OR routing elements
* G6 Use verb-object activity labels
* G7 Decompose a model with more than 50 elements

7PMG still though has limitations with its use: Validity problem 7PMG does not relate to the content of a process model, but only to the way this content is organized and represented.
It does suggest ways of organizing different structures of the process model while the content is kept intact but the pragmatic issue of what must be included in the model is still left out.
The second limitation relates to the prioritizing guideline the derived ranking has a small empirical basis as it relies on the involvement of 21 process modelers only.

This could be seen on the one hand as a need for a wider involvement of process modelers' experience, but it also rises the question what alternative approaches may be available to arrive at a prioritizing guideline.&lt;ref name=mendling19/&gt;

'''''Rose v. Locke''''', 423 U.S. 48 (1975), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which a [[Tennessee]] statute proscribing "crime against nature" was held not unconstitutionally vague as applied to [[cunnilingus]], satisfying as it does the [[due process]] standard of giving sufficient warning that men may so conduct themselves as to avoid that which is forbidden. Viewed against that standard, the challenged statutory phrase is no vaguer than many other terms describing criminal offenses at common law, which are now codified in criminal codes. Moreover, the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] by previously rejecting claims that the statute was to be narrowly applied has given sufficiently clear notice that it would be held applicable to acts such as those involved here when such a case as this arose.

== Facts ==
Defendant was convicted for having committed a crime against nature after Defendant entered a home of a woman, produced a knife, forced her to partially disrobe, and compelled her to submit to his twice performing cunnilingus upon her. Defendant appealed on the basis that the statutory term "crimes against nature" could not "in and of itself withstand a charge of unconstitutional vagueness" and being unable to find any Tennessee opinion previously applying the statute to the act of cunnilingus.

== Opinion of the Court ==
In a ''[[Per curiam decision|per curiam]]'' decision issued on November 17, 1975, the Court found that the statute was not vague, and, furthermore, Defendant could not claim that he was afforded no notice that his conduct might be within the statute's scope.

The Court rejected Defendant's arguments, stating that the Tennessee statute's proscription encompassed the act of [[cunnilingus]]. As early as 1955, Tennessee had expressly rejected a claim that "crime against nature" did not cover [[fellatio]], repudiating those jurisdictions which had taken a narrow and restrictive definition of the offense. Four years later, the Tennessee Supreme Court was quoted as saying that "the prohibition brings all unnatural copulation with mankind or a beast, including [[sodomy]], within its scope". 

Furthermore, other jurisdictions had already reasonably construed identical statutory language to apply to such acts. And given the Tennessee court's clear pronouncements that its statute was intended to effect broad coverage, there was nothing to indicate, clearly or otherwise, that respondent's acts were outside the scope of "crimes against nature".

Therefore, the statute was not vague, and Defendant's motion was denied.

=== Brennan's dissent ===
Justice Brennan, with Justice Marshall concurring, first questioned the majority's broad interpretation of crimes against nature.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of particular significance for this case, as the Court of Appeals accurately stated, "courts have differed widely [423 U.S. 48, 54] in construing the reach of 'crimes against nature' to cunnilingus".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Stewart's dissent ===
Justice Stewart, with Justice Marshall concurring, wrote that the case did not align with the ruling of ''Wainwright v. Stone'', 414 U.S. 21. Specifically: &lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Florida courts had repeatedly and explicitly ruled that the state law in question prohibited precisely the conduct in which the defendants were found to have engaged. Here, by contrast, the Tennessee courts had never ruled that the act that Locke was found to have committed was covered by the vague and cryptic language of the Tennessee statute. Tenn. Code Ann. 39-707.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Teaching artists''', also known as '''art teachers''' or '''artist educators''' or '''community artists''', are [[artist|professional artists]] who supplement their incomes by teaching and integrating their art form, perspectives, and skills into a wide range of settings, such as by showing kids how to make clay mugs with faces in local libraries and elementary schools. Teaching artists work with schools, [[After-school activity|after school programs]], community agencies, [[prison]]s, jails, and [[Social services|social service]] agencies. The ''Arts In Education'' movement benefited from the work of Teaching Artists in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm History of Teaching Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227120148/http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm |date=2012-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts learning consultant [[Eric Booth]] has defined a teaching artist, somewhat wordily, as "a practicing professional artist with the complementary skills, curiosities and sensibilities of an educator, who can effectively engage a wide range of people in learning experiences in, through, and about [[the arts]].”&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823124354/http://nysaae.org/docs/The_History_of_Teaching_Artistry_By_Eric_Booth.pdf Booth Article]&lt;/ref&gt; This term applies to professional artists in all artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm Teaching Artist described] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005527/http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching Artists have worked in schools and in communities for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Lopate]], ''Journal of a Living Experiment, a documentary history of Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative and the writers-in-the-schools movement.'' New York: Virgil Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Remer, ''A Brief History of Artists in K-12 American Schooling,'' Teaching Artists Journal, Volume I, Number 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wakeford, ''A Short Look At A Long Past, Putting The Arts In The Picture: Reframing Education in the 21st Century,'' Edited by Nick Rabkin and Robin Redmond, Center for Arts Policy, Columbia College Chicago, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On April 16, 2011 the [[Association of Teaching Artists]] convened the First National Teaching Artists Forum. The forum was held at [[The Center for Arts Education]] in [[New York City]] with nearly fifty participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/TAforum.htm Teaching Artists Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005346/http://www.teachingartists.com/TAforum.htm |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web. 10 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient symbol of Trinacria is the head of [[Medusa]] (a [[gorgon]] with a head of snakes) overlaying ''three legs conjoined at the hips and flexed in triangle and three stalks of wheat''. The Trinacria symbol has also been adopted by the modern Sicilian government and appears at the center of Sicily's flag. The symbol (without the central Gorgon's head) was adopted as the heraldic device of the Lord of the [[Isle of Man]] (located between [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]) in the 13th century and appears on the present [[coat of arms of the Isle of Man]].

==Triskelion==
The Trinacria's shape is often referred to as a [[triskelion]], which shape has been found in many places surrounding the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and in many European countries including [[France]], [[Sicily]], [[Crete]], [[Greece]], the North African coast. The triskelions found in these locations have all dated back to after the eighth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;"National Sicilian American Foundation." National Sicilian American Foundation.

== History of the Trinacria ==
The Trinacria came to be on the Sicilian flag in 1943 during [[World War II]] when [[Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile]] led an independence movement, in collaboration with the allies. Their plan was to help Sicily become independent and form a free republic. The separatist behind the movement used a yellow and red flag with the Trinacria in the center of it. When [[World War II]] ended, Sicily was recognized as an autonomous region in the Italian Republic. Although the Trinacria was recognized worldwide on Sicily's flag in World War II, the distinct symbol had made its first ''debut'' on Syracusan coins dating back to the fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;http://sonsofsicily.com/id11.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sicilian Mythology ==
=== Story of Colapesce ===
Colapesce, a boy from [[Messina]], loved staying in the water and would spend most of his days swimming. He resided in the water for so long that he slowly started to gain fish (Pesce) like characteristics, such as being able to swim underwater for long periods of time without needing air. When [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Frederick II]] found out about the young boy and his talent, he sailed to visit him. When he met him, he tested the boys abilities by throwing his possessions overboard for the boy to retrieve. He gradually began diving deeper into  the water, always returning with the king’s possessions. However, when the boy was asked to retrieve the kings crown, he noticed a peculiar sight under the water. He saw the island of Sicily being held and supported by three columns, one intact, the second slightly chipped and scratched, and the third was crumbling away, making Colapesce uneasy at the sight of it. When King Frederick asked the boy to retrieve his ring, Colapesce was worried he might not come back. Eventually he decide to go but asked for a handful of lentils, saying “If you see the lentils float to the surface then I will not be coming back.” After waiting a few days for Colapesce to return, the king looked into the water and saw his ring and lentils float to the surface. He then knew that Colapesce had chosen to take the broken column upon his shoulders to support Sicily. Sicilians claim that when the island shakes from earthquakes it is Colapesce, moving the island on his shoulder because he is tired.&lt;ref&gt;Manzetti, Tiziana.

'''Wound healing''' is a complex process in which the skin, and the tissues under it, repair themselves after injury.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Nguyen DT, Orgill DP, Murphy GT |title=Biomaterials for Treating Skin Loss|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-6yjAgAAQBAJ|page=25}}|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-84569-554-5|pages=25–57.

The wound healing process is not only complex but also fragile, and it is susceptible to interruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing [[chronic wound]]s. Factors that contribute to non-healing chronic wounds are diabetes, venous or arterial disease, infection, and metabolic deficiencies of old age.&lt;ref name="Enoch"&gt;Enoch, S. Price, P. (2004). [http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2004/august/Enoch/Pathophysiology-Of-Healing.html ''Cellular, molecular and biochemical differences in the pathophysiology of healing between acute wounds, chronic wounds and wounds in the elderly''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Wound care encourages and speeds wound healing via cleaning and protection from reinjury or infection. Depending on each patient's needs, it can range from the simplest [[first aid]] to entire nursing specialties such as [[wound, ostomy, and continence nursing]] and [[burn center]] care.

==Stages==
* [[Hemostasis]] (blood clotting): Within the first few minutes of injury, [[platelets]] in the blood begin to stick to the injured site. This activates the platelets, causing a few things to happen. They change into an amorphous shape, more suitable for clotting, and they release chemical signals to promote clotting. This results in the activation of [[fibrin]], which forms a mesh and acts as "glue" to bind platelets to each other. This makes a [[thrombus|clot]] that serves to plug the break in the blood vessel, slowing/preventing further bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Rasche H |title=Haemostasis and thrombosis: an overview|journal=European Heart Journal Supplements|date=2001|volume=3|issue=Supplement Q|pages=Q3–Q7|doi=10.1016/S1520-765X(01)90034-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Versteeg HH, Heemskerk JW, Levi M, Reitsma PH | title = New fundamentals in hemostasis | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 327–58 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23303912 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00016.2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inflammation: During this phase, damaged and dead cells are cleared out, along with bacteria and other pathogens or debris. This happens through the process of [[phagocytosis]], where white blood cells "eat" debris by engulfing it. [[Platelet-derived growth factor]]s are released into the wound that cause the migration and division of cells during the proliferative phase.
* Proliferation (growth of new tissue): In this phase, [[angiogenesis]], [[collagen]] deposition, [[granulation tissue]] formation, epithelialization, and wound contraction occur.&lt;ref name="Midwood"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Midwood KS, Williams LV, Schwarzbauer JE | title = Tissue repair and the dynamics of the extracellular matrix | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 1031–7 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15094118 | doi = 10.1016/j.biocel.2003.12.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In angiogenesis, vascular endothelial cells form new blood vessels.&lt;ref name="chang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang HY, Sneddon JB, Alizadeh AA, Sood R, West RB, Montgomery K, Chi JT, van de Rijn M, Botstein D, Brown PO | title = Gene expression signature of fibroblast serum response predicts human cancer progression: similarities between tumors and wounds | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = E7 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14737219 | pmc = 314300 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020007 | displayauthors = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation, [[fibroblast]]s grow and form a new, provisional [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) by excreting collagen and [[fibronectin]].&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt;  Concurrently, re-epithelialization of the epidermis occurs, in which [[epithelial cell]]s proliferate and 'crawl' atop the wound bed, providing cover for the new tissue.&lt;ref name="Garg"&gt;Garg, H.G.

When the cells' roles are close to complete, unneeded cells undergo [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt;
* Maturation (remodeling): During maturation and remodeling, collagen is realigned along tension lines, and cells that are no longer needed are removed by programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]].

==Early vs cellular phase==

Wound healing is classically divided into hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although a useful construct, this model employs considerable overlapping among individual phases. A complementary model has recently been described&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; where the many elements of wound healing are more clearly delineated. The importance of this new model becomes more apparent through its utility in the fields of [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] (see Research and development section below). In this construct, the process of wound healing is divided into two major phases: the ''early phase'' and the ''cellular phase'':&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;

The early phase, which begins immediately following skin injury, involves cascading molecular and cellular events leading to hemostasis and formation of an early, makeshift extracellular matrix that provides structural [[scaffolding|staging]] for cellular attachment and subsequent cellular proliferation.

The cellular phase involves several types of cells working together to mount an inflammatory response, synthesize granulation tissue, and restore the epithelial layer.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; Subdivisions of the cellular phase are:  [1] [[Macrophage]]s and inflammatory components (within 1–2 days), [2] [[Epithelial]]-[[mesenchymal]] interaction: re-epithelialization ([[phenotype]] change within hours, migration begins on day 1 or 2), [3] [[Fibroblasts]] and [[myofibroblasts]]: progressive alignment, collagen production, and matrix contraction (between day 4 and day 14), [4] [[Endothelial cell]]s and angiogenesis (begins on day 4), [5] Dermal matrix: elements of fabrication (begins on day 4, lasting 2 weeks) and alteration/remodeling (begins after week 2, lasting weeks to months—depending on wound size).&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;

== Inflammatory phase ==
Just before the inflammatory phase is initiated, the [[clotting cascade|clotting]] cascade occurs in order to achieve [[hemostasis]], or stop blood loss by way of a fibrin clot. Thereafter, various soluble factors (including chemokines and cytokines) are released to attract [[cell (biology)|cells]] that [[phagocytosis|phagocytise]] debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue, in addition to releasing signaling molecules that initiate the proliferative phase of wound healing.

===Clotting cascade===
{{Main|Coagulation}}

When [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] is first wounded, [[blood]] comes in contact with [[collagen]], triggering blood [[platelet]]s to begin secreting inflammatory factors.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"&gt;Rosenberg L., de la Torre J. (2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic457.htm Wound Healing, Growth Factors].  Emedicine.com. Accessed January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Platelets also express sticky [[glycoprotein]]s on their [[cell membrane]]s that allow them to [[platelet aggregation|aggregate]], forming a mass.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt;

[[Fibrin]] and [[fibronectin]] cross-link together and form a plug that traps [[protein]]s and particles and prevents further blood loss.&lt;ref name="Sandeman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandeman SR, Allen MC, Liu C, Faragher RG, Lloyd AW | title = Human keratocyte migration into collagen gels declines with in vitro ageing | journal = Mechanisms of Ageing and Development | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 149–57 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11080534 | doi = 10.1016/S0047-6374(00)00177-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This fibrin-fibronectin plug is also the main structural support for the wound until collagen is deposited.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; Migratory cells use this plug as a matrix to crawl across, and platelets adhere to it and secrete factors.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; The clot is eventually lysed and replaced with [[granulation tissue]] and then later with collagen.

Platelets, the cells present in the highest numbers shortly after a wound occurs, release mediators into the blood, including [[cytokine]]s and [[growth factor]]s.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/&gt;  Growth factors stimulate cells to speed their rate of division. Platelets release other proinflammatory factors like [[serotonin]], [[bradykinin]], [[prostaglandin]]s, [[prostacyclin]]s, [[thromboxane]], and [[histamine]],&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; which serve several purposes, including increasing cell proliferation and migration to the area and causing [[blood vessel]]s to become dilated and [[porous]]. In many ways, extravasated platelets in trauma perform a similar function to tissue [[macrophage]]s and [[mast cell]]s exposed to [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|microbial molecular signature]]s in [[infection]]: they become activated, and secrete molecular mediators – vasoactive amines, [[eicosanoid]]s, and [[cytokine]]s  – that initiate the [[inflammation|inflammatory]] process.

===Vasoconstriction and vasodilation===
Immediately after a [[blood vessel]] is breached, ruptured [[cell membrane]]s release inflammatory factors like [[thromboxane]]s and [[prostaglandin]]s that cause the vessel to spasm to prevent blood loss and to collect inflammatory cells and factors in the area.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; This [[vasoconstriction]] lasts five to ten minutes and is followed by [[vasodilation]], a widening of blood vessels, which peaks at about 20 minutes post-wounding.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Vasodilation is the end result of factors released by platelets and other cells. The main factor involved in causing vasodilation is [[histamine]].&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/&gt; Histamine also causes blood vessels to become porous, allowing the tissue to become [[edema]]tous because proteins from the bloodstream leak into the extravascular space, which increases its osmolar load and draws water into the area.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Increased [[porosity]] of blood vessels also facilitates the entry of inflammatory cells like [[leukocyte]]s into the wound site from the [[bloodstream]].&lt;ref name="Dealey"&gt;Dealey C. (1999). ''The care of wounds: A guide for nurses''.  Oxford ; Malden, Mass. Blackwell Science.

===Polymorphonuclear neutrophils===
Within an hour of wounding, [[granulocyte|polymorphonuclear neutrophil]]s (PMNs) arrive at the wound site and become the predominant cells in the wound for the first two days after the injury occurs, with especially high numbers on the second day.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"&gt;de la Torre J., Sholar A.  (2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic477.htm Wound healing: Chronic wounds].  Emedicine.com.  Accessed January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They are attracted to the site by fibronectin, growth factors, and substances such as [[kinin]]s.

Other leukocytes to enter the area include [[helper T cell]]s, which secrete [[cytokines]] to cause more T cells to divide and to increase inflammation and enhance vasodilation and vessel permeability.&lt;ref name="Dealey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santoro"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santoro MM, Gaudino G | title = Cellular and molecular facets of keratinocyte reepithelization during wound healing | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 304 | issue = 1 | pages = 274–86 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15707592 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.10.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; T cells also increase the activity of macrophages.&lt;ref name="Dealey"/&gt;

===Macrophages===

=== Decline of inflammatory phase===
As inflammation dies down, fewer inflammatory factors are secreted, existing ones are broken down, and numbers of neutrophils and macrophages are reduced at the wound site.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt;  These changes indicate that the inflammatory phase is ending and the proliferative phase is underway.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; In vitro evidence, obtained using the [[dermal equivalent]] model, suggests that the presence of macrophages actually delays wound contraction and thus the disappearance of macrophages from the wound may be essential for subsequent phases to occur.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newton PM, Watson JA, Wolowacz RG, Wood EJ | title = Macrophages restrain contraction of an in vitro wound healing model | journal = Inflammation | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 207–14 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15673162 | doi = 10.1023/B:IFLA.0000049045.41784.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because inflammation plays roles in fighting infection, clearing debris and inducing the proliferation phase, it is a necessary part of healing. However, inflammation can lead to [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage if it lasts too long.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; Thus the reduction of inflammation is frequently a goal in therapeutic settings. Inflammation lasts as long as there is debris in the wound. Thus, if the individual's immune system is compromised and is unable to clear the debris from the wound and/or if excessive detritus, devitalized tissue, or microbial [[biofilm]] is present in the wound, these factors may cause a prolonged inflammatory phase and prevent the wound from properly commencing the proliferation phase of healing. This can lead to a [[chronic wound]].

== Proliferative phase ==

About two or three days after the wound occurs, [[fibroblasts]] begin to enter the wound site, marking the onset of the proliferative phase even before the inflammatory phase has ended.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"&gt;Falanga V.  (2005). Wound Healing.  American Academy of Dermatology (AAD).&lt;/ref&gt; As in the other phases of wound healing, steps in the proliferative phase do not occur in a series but rather partially overlap in time.

===Angiogenesis===
{{Further|Angiogenesis}}
Also called neovascularization, the process of angiogenesis occurs concurrently with fibroblast proliferation when endothelial cells migrate to the area of the wound.&lt;ref name="Kuwahara"&gt;Kuwahara R.T. and Rasberry R.  2007.  [http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic533.htm Chemical Peels]. Emedicine.com.  Accessed September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the activity of fibroblasts and epithelial cells requires oxygen and nutrients, angiogenesis is imperative for other stages in wound healing, like epidermal and fibroblast migration. The tissue in which angiogenesis has occurred typically looks red (is [[erythema]]tous) due to the presence of [[capillary|capillaries]].&lt;ref name="Kuwahara"/&gt;

Angiogenesis occurs in overlapping phases in response to inflammation:
#'''Latent period:''' During the haemostatic and inflammatory phase of the wound healing process, vasodilation and permeabilisation allow leukocyte extravasation and phagocytic debridement and decontamination of the wound area. Tissue swelling aids later angiogenesis by expanding and loosening the existing collagenous extracellular matrix.
#'''Endothelial activation''': As the wound macrophages switches from inflammatory to healing mode, it begins to secrete endothelial chemotactic and growth factors to attract adjacent endothelial cells. Activated endothelial cells respond by retracting and reducing cell junctions, loosening themselves from their embedded endothelium. Characteristically the activated endothelial cells show enlarged nucleoli.
#'''Degradation of endothelial basement membrane''': The wound macrophages, mast cells and the endothelial cells themselves secrete proteases to break down existing vascular basal lamina.
#'''Vascular sprouting''': With the breakdown of endothelial basement membrane, detached endothelial cells from pre-existing capillaries and post-capillary venules can divide and migrate chemotactically towards the wound, laying down new vessels in the process. Vascular sprouting can be aided by ambient hypoxia and acidosis in the wound environment, as hypoxia stimulates the endothelial transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) to transactivate angiogenic genes such as VEGF and GLUT1. Sprouted vessels can self-organise into luminal morphologies, and fusion of blind channels give rise to new capillary networks.
#'''Vascular maturation''': the endothelium of vessels mature by laying down new endothelial extracellular matrix, followed by basal lamina formation. Lastly the vessel establishes a pericyte layer.

[[Stem cell]]s of [[endothelial cell]]s, originating from parts of uninjured blood vessels, develop [[pseudopod]]ia and push through the [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]] into the wound site to establish new blood vessels.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt;

[[Endothelial cell]]s are attracted to the wound area by fibronectin found on the fibrin scab and [[chemotaxis|chemotactically]] by angiogenic factors released by other cells,&lt;ref name="romo"&gt;Romo T. and Pearson J.M. 2005.  [http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic13.htm Wound Healing, Skin].  Emedicine.com. Accessed December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. from macrophages and platelets when in a low-oxygen environment. Endothelial growth and proliferation is also directly stimulated by [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and presence of [[lactic acid]] in the wound.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"/&gt; For example, hypoxia stimulates the endothelial [[transcription factor]], [[hypoxia-inducible factor]] (HIF) to [[transactivate]] a set of proliferative genes including [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[GLUT1|glucose transporter 1]] (GLUT1).

To migrate, endothelial cells need [[collagenase]]s and [[plasminogen activator]] to degrade the clot and part of the ECM.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; [[Zinc]]-dependent [[metalloproteinase]]s digest [[basement membrane]] and ECM to allow cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis.&lt;ref name="Lansdown"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lansdown AB, Sampson B, Rowe A | title = Experimental observations in the rat on the influence of cadmium on skin wound repair | journal = International Journal of Experimental Pathology | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–41 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11422539 | pmc = 2517695 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2613.2001.00180.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When macrophages and other growth factor-producing cells are no longer in a hypoxic, lactic acid-filled environment, they stop producing angiogenic factors.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; Thus, when tissue is adequately [[perfusion|perfused]], migration and proliferation of endothelial cells is reduced. Eventually blood vessels that are no longer needed die by [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt;

===Fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation===
Simultaneously with angiogenesis, [[fibroblast]]s begin accumulating in the wound site. Fibroblasts begin entering the wound site two to five days after wounding as the inflammatory phase is ending, and their numbers peak at one to two weeks post-wounding.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; By the end of the first week, fibroblasts are the main cells in the wound.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Fibroplasia ends two to four weeks after wounding.

As a model the mechanism of fibroplasia may be conceptualised as an analogous process to angiogenesis (see above) - only the cell type involved is fibroblasts rather than endothelial cells. Initially there is a latent phase where the wound undergoes plasma exudation, inflammatory decontamination and debridement. Oedema increases the wound histologic accessibility for later fibroplastic migration. Second, as inflammation nears completion, macrophage and mast cells release fibroblast growth and chemotactic factors to activate fibroblasts from adjacent tissue. Fibroblasts at this stage loosen themselves from surrounding cells and ECM. Phagocytes further release proteases that break down the ECM of neighbouring tissue, freeing the activated fibroblasts to proliferate and migrate towards the wound. The difference between vascular sprouting and fibroblast proliferation is that the former is enhanced by hypoxia, whilst the latter is inhibited by hypoxia. The deposited fibroblastic connective tissue matures by secreting ECM into the extracellular space, forming granulation tissue (see below). Lastly collagen is deposited into the ECM.

In the first two or three days after injury, fibroblasts mainly migrate and proliferate, while later, they are the main cells that lay down the collagen matrix in the wound site.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Origins of these fibroblasts are thought to be from the adjacent uninjured cutaneous tissue (although new evidence suggests that some are derived from blood-borne, circulating adult stem cells/precursors).&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/&gt; Initially fibroblasts utilize the fibrin cross-linking fibers (well-formed by the end of the inflammatory phase) to migrate across the wound, subsequently adhering to fibronectin.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt;   Fibroblasts then deposit [[ground substance]] into the wound bed, and later collagen, which they can adhere to for migration.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/&gt;

[[Granulation tissue]] functions as rudimentary tissue, and begins to appear in the wound already during the inflammatory phase, two to five days post wounding, and continues growing until the wound bed is covered.  Granulation tissue consists of new blood vessels, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and the components of a new, provisional [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM). The provisional ECM is different in composition from the ECM in normal tissue and its components originate from fibroblasts.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; Such components include fibronectin, collagen, [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, [[elastin]], [[glycoprotein]]s and [[proteoglycan]]s.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; Its main components are fibronectin and [[hyaluronan]], which create a very hydrated matrix and facilitate cell migration.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt; Later this provisional matrix is replaced with an ECM that more closely resembles that found in non-injured tissue.

Growth factors ([[PDGF]], [[TGF-β]]) and fibronectin encourage proliferation, migration to the wound bed, and production of ECM molecules by fibroblasts. Fibroblasts also secrete growth factors that attract epithelial cells to the wound site.  Hypoxia also contributes to fibroblast proliferation and excretion of growth factors, though too little oxygen will inhibit their growth and deposition of ECM components, and can lead to excessive, fibrotic [[scar|scarring.]]

====Collagen deposition====
One of fibroblasts' most important duties is the production of [[collagen]].&lt;ref name="Kuwahara"/&gt;

Collagen deposition is important because it increases the strength of the wound; before it is laid down, the only thing holding the wound closed is the fibrin-fibronectin clot, which does not provide much resistance to [[traumatic injury]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; Also, cells involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue construction attach to, grow and differentiate on the collagen matrix laid down by fibroblasts.&lt;ref name="Ruszczak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruszczak Z | title = Effect of collagen matrices on dermal wound healing | journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = 12 | pages = 1595–611 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14623403 | doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Type III collagen]] and [[fibronectin]] generally begin to be produced in appreciable amounts at somewhere between approximately 10 hours&lt;ref name=pollock&gt;Fig. 9-1. The cellular, biochemical, and mechanical phases of wound healing. {{cite book | last1 = Pollock | first1 = Raphael E. | first2 = F.

Their deposition peaks at one to three weeks.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; They are the predominating tensile substances until the later phase of maturation, in which they are replaced by the stronger [[type I collagen]].

Even as fibroblasts are producing new collagen, collagenases and other factors degrade it. Shortly after wounding, synthesis exceeds degradation so collagen levels in the wound rise, but later production and degradation become equal so there is no net collagen gain.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; This homeostasis signals the onset of the later maturation phase. Granulation gradually ceases and fibroblasts decrease in number in the wound once their work is done.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = DiPietro LA, Burns AL | date = 2003 | title =  Wound Healing: Methods and Protocols.  |series = Methods in Molecular Medicine | location = Totowa, N.J. | publisher = Humana Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the granulation phase, fibroblasts begin to commit apoptosis, converting granulation tissue from an environment rich in cells to one that consists mainly of collagen.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt;

===Epithelialization===
The formation of granulation tissue into an open wound allows the reepithelialization phase to take place, as epithelial cells migrate across the new tissue to form a barrier between the wound and the environment.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; [[Stratum basale|Basal]] [[keratinocyte]]s from the wound edges and [[dermal appendage]]s such as [[hair follicle]]s, [[sweat glands]] and [[Sebaceous gland|sebacious (oil) glands]] are the main cells responsible for the epithelialization phase of wound healing.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; They advance in a sheet across the wound site and proliferate at its edges, ceasing movement when they meet in the middle. In healing that results in a scar, sweat glands, hair follicles&lt;ref name="sweatgland"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu XB, Sun TZ, Li XK, Sheng ZY | title = Morphological and distribution characteristics of sweat glands in hypertrophic scar and their possible effects on sweat gland regeneration | journal = Chinese Medical Journal | volume = 118 | issue = 3 | pages = 186–91 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15740645 | url = http://www.cmj.org/Periodical/LinkIn.asp?journal=Chinese%20Medical%20Journal&amp;linkintype=pubmed&amp;year=2005&amp;vol=118&amp;issue=3&amp;beginpage=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=follicles2014/&gt; and nerves do not form.

[[Keratinocyte]]s migrate without first proliferating.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartkova J, Grøn B, Dabelsteen E, Bartek J | title = Cell-cycle regulatory proteins in human wound healing | journal = Archives of Oral Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–32 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12642231 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-9969(02)00202-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration can begin as early as a few hours after wounding. However, epithelial cells require viable tissue to migrate across, so if the wound is deep it must first be filled with granulation tissue.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"&gt;Mulvaney M. and Harrington A.  1994.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20031218072356/http://www.vnh.org/MilitaryDerm/Ch7.pdf Chapter 7: Cutaneous trauma and its treatment].  In, ''Textbook of Military Medicine: Military Dermatology''.  Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army.  Virtual Naval Hospital Project. Accessed through web archive on September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the time of onset of migration is variable and may occur about one day after wounding.&lt;ref name="larjava"&gt;Larjava H., Koivisto L., and Hakkinen L. 2002. Chapter 3: Keratinocyte Interactions with Fibronectin During Wound Healing.  In, Heino, J. and Kahari, V.M. ''Cell Invasion''.  Medical Intelligence Unit ; 33.  Georgetown, Tex., Austin, Tex Landes Bioscience, Inc. Electronic book.&lt;/ref&gt; Cells on the wound margins proliferate on the second and third day post-wounding in order to provide more cells for migration.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt;

If the [[basement membrane]] is not breached, epithelial cells are replaced within three days by division and upward migration of cells in the [[stratum basale]] in the same fashion that occurs in uninjured skin.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; However, if the basement membrane is ruined at the wound site, reepithelization must occur from the wound margins and from skin appendages such as hair follicles and sweat and oil glands that enter the [[dermis]] that are lined with viable keratinocytes.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; If the wound is very deep, skin appendages may also be ruined and migration can only occur from wound edges.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"/&gt;

Migration of keratinocytes over the wound site is stimulated by lack of [[contact inhibition]] and by chemicals such as [[nitric oxide]].&lt;ref name="Witte and Barbul"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witte MB, Barbul A | title = Role of nitric oxide in wound repair | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 183 | issue = 4 | pages = 406–12 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11975928 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9610(02)00815-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before they begin to migrate, cells must dissolve their [[desmosomes]] and [[hemidesmosomes]], which normally anchor the cells by [[intermediate filaments]] in their [[cytoskeleton]] to other cells and to the ECM.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;  [[Transmembrane]]  [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[protein]]s called [[integrin]]s, which are made of [[glycoprotein]]s and normally anchor the cell to the basement membrane by its [[cytoskeleton]], are released from the cell's intermediate filaments and relocate to [[actin]] filaments to serve as attachments to the ECM for [[pseudopod]]ia during migration.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt; Thus keratinocytes detach from the basement membrane and are able to enter the wound bed.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"/&gt;

Before they begin migrating, keratinocytes change shape, becoming longer and flatter and extending cellular processes like [[pseudopod|lamellipodia]] and wide processes that look like ruffles.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;  [[Actin]] filaments and [[pseudopod]]ia form.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"/&gt; During migration, [[integrin]]s on the pseudopod attach to the ECM, and the actin filaments in the projection pull the cell along.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt; The interaction with molecules in the ECM through integrins further promotes the formation of actin filaments, lamellipodia, and [[pseudopod|filopodia]].&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;

Epithelial cells climb over one another in order to migrate.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; This growing sheet of epithelial cells is often called the epithelial tongue.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"/&gt; The first cells to attach to the [[basement membrane]] form the [[stratum basale]]. These basal cells continue to migrate across the wound bed, and epithelial cells above them slide along as well.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"/&gt; The more quickly this migration occurs, the less of a scar there will be.&lt;ref name="Son"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cap.2005.01.011 |title=Effects of β-glucan on proliferation and migration of fibroblasts |year=2005 |last1=Son |first1=Hyun Joo |last2=Bae |first2=Hyun Chul |last3=Kim |first3=Hyun Jeong |last4=Lee |first4=Dong Hee |last5=Han |first5=Dong-Wook |last6=Park |first6=Jong-Chul | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Current Applied Physics |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=468–71 |bibcode=2005CAP.....5..468S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fibrin]], collagen, and fibronectin in the ECM may further signal cells to divide and migrate.  Like fibroblasts, migrating keratinocytes use the fibronectin cross-linked with fibrin that was deposited in inflammation as an attachment site to crawl across.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; 
 
[[File:Scab.jpg|thumb|A scab covering a healing wound]]
As keratinocytes migrate, they move over granulation tissue but stay underneath the scab, thereby separating the scab from the underlying tissue.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="larjava"/&gt; Scabs are formed on locations that are exposed to harmful UVR and the main biological function of
human wound scabs is to inhibit the exposure to UVR, thus protecting otherwise exposed cells in a wound from UVR-induced DNA damage.&lt;ref name="vanderPol, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Pol E, Mudde YD, Coumans FA, van Leeuwen TG, Sturk A, Nieuwland R | title = Wound scabs protect regenerating tissue against harmful ultraviolet radiation | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 96 | pages = 39–41 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27959273 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2016.09.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Epithelial cells have the ability to phagocytize debris such as dead tissue and bacterial matter that would otherwise obstruct their path.  Because they must dissolve any scab that forms, keratinocyte migration is best enhanced by a moist environment, since a dry one leads to formation of a bigger, tougher scab.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falanga V | title = The chronic wound: impaired healing and solutions in the context of wound bed preparation | journal = Blood Cells, Molecules &amp; Diseases | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–94 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14757419 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcmd.2003.09.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To make their way along the tissue, keratinocytes must dissolve the clot, debris, and parts of the ECM in order to get through.&lt;ref name="larjava"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Etscheid"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Etscheid M, Beer N, Dodt J | title = The hyaluronan-binding protease upregulates ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways in fibroblasts and stimulates cell proliferation and migration | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | pages = 1486–94 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16153533 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellsig.2005.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They secrete [[plasminogen activator]], which activates [[plasminogen]], turning it into [[plasmin]] to dissolve the scab.  Cells can only migrate over living tissue,&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; so they must excrete collagenases and proteases like [[matrix metalloproteinases]] (MMPs) to dissolve damaged parts of the ECM in their way, particularly at the front of the migrating sheet.&lt;ref name="larjava"/&gt; Keratinocytes also dissolve the basement membrane, using instead the new ECM laid down by fibroblasts to crawl across.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;

As keratinocytes continue migrating, new epithelial cells must be formed at the wound edges to replace them and to provide more cells for the advancing sheet.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt; Proliferation behind migrating keratinocytes normally begins a few days after wounding&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"/&gt; and occurs at a rate that is 17 times higher in this stage of epithelialization than in normal tissues.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt; Until the entire wound area is resurfaced, the only epithelial cells to proliferate are at the wound edges.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"/&gt;

Growth factors, stimulated by integrins and MMPs, cause cells to proliferate at the wound edges.  Keratinocytes themselves also produce and secrete factors, including growth factors and basement membrane proteins, which aid both in epithelialization and in other phases of healing.&lt;ref name="Bayram"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bayram Y, Deveci M, Imirzalioglu N, Soysal Y, Sengezer M | title = The cell based dressing with living allogenic keratinocytes in the treatment of foot ulcers: a case study | journal = British Journal of Plastic Surgery | volume = 58 | issue = 7 | pages = 988–96 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16040019 | doi = 10.1016/j.bjps.2005.04.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth factors are also important for the innate immune defense of skin wounds by stimulation of the production of antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil chemotactic cytokines in keratinocytes.   
  
Keratinocytes continue migrating across the wound bed until cells from either side meet in the middle, at which point [[contact inhibition]] causes them to stop migrating.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;  When they have finished migrating, the keratinocytes secrete the proteins that form the new basement membrane.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;  Cells reverse the morphological changes they underwent in order to begin migrating; they reestablish [[desmosome]]s and [[hemidesmosome]]s and become anchored once again to the basement membrane.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;  [[Stratum basale|Basal cells]] begin to divide and differentiate in the same manner as they do in normal skin to reestablish the strata found in reepithelialized skin.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;

===Contraction===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Contraction]] --&gt;
Contraction is a key phase of wound healing with repair. If contraction continues for too long, it can lead to disfigurement and loss of function.&lt;ref name="Hinz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hinz B | title = Masters and servants of the force: the role of matrix adhesions in myofibroblast force perception and transmission | journal = European Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 85 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 175–81 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16546559 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejcb.2005.09.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is a great interest in understanding the biology of wound contraction, which can be modelled in vitro using the [[collagen gel contraction assay]] or the [[dermal equivalent]] model.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grinnell F | title = Fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and wound contraction | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 124 | issue = 4 | pages = 401–4 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8106541 | pmc = 2119916 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.124.4.401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contraction commences approximately a week after wounding, when fibroblasts have differentiated into [[myofibroblast]]s.&lt;ref name="Eichler and Carlson"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eichler MJ, Carlson MA | title = Modeling dermal granulation tissue with the linear fibroblast-populated collagen matrix: a comparison with the round matrix model | journal = Journal of Dermatological Science | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–108 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16226016 | doi = 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2005.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[full thickness]] wounds, contraction peaks at 5 to 15 days post wounding.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; Contraction can last for several weeks&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"/&gt; and continues even after the wound is completely reepithelialized.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; A large wound can become 40 to 80% smaller after contraction.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt;  Wounds can contract at a speed of up to 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm per day, depending on how loose the tissue in the wounded area is.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt;  Contraction usually does not occur symmetrically; rather most wounds have an 'axis of contraction' which allows for greater organization and alignment of cells with collagen.&lt;ref name="Eichler and Carlson"/&gt;

At first, contraction occurs without myofibroblast involvement.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mirastschijski U, Haaksma CJ, Tomasek JJ, Agren MS | title = Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM 6001 attenuates keratinocyte migration, contraction and myofibroblast formation in skin wounds | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 299 | issue = 2 | pages = 465–75 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15350544 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.06.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, fibroblasts, stimulated by growth factors, differentiate into myofibroblasts.  Myofibroblasts, which are similar to smooth muscle cells, are responsible for contraction.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"/&gt;  Myofibroblasts contain the same kind of actin as that found in [[smooth muscle]] cells.&lt;ref name="Hinz"/&gt;

Myofibroblasts are attracted by fibronectin and growth factors and they move along fibronectin linked to fibrin in the provisional ECM in order to reach the wound edges.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt;  They form connections to the ECM at the wound edges, and they attach to each other and to the wound edges by [[desmosomes]].  Also, at an adhesion called the [[fibronexus]], actin in the myofibroblast is linked across the cell membrane to molecules in the extracellular matrix like fibronectin and collagen.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"/&gt;  Myofibroblasts have many such adhesions, which allow them to pull the ECM when they contract, reducing the wound size.&lt;ref name="Hinz"/&gt;  In this part of contraction, closure occurs more quickly than in the first, myofibroblast-independent part.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"/&gt;

As the actin in myofibroblasts contracts, the wound edges are pulled together.  Fibroblasts lay down collagen to reinforce the wound as myofibroblasts contract.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; The contraction stage in proliferation ends as myofibroblasts stop contracting and commit apoptosis.&lt;ref name="Hinz"/&gt;  The breakdown of the provisional matrix leads to a decrease in hyaluronic acid and an increase in chondroitin sulfate, which gradually triggers fibroblasts to stop migrating and proliferating.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt;  These events signal the onset of the maturation stage of wound healing.

== Maturation and remodeling==
When the levels of collagen production and degradation equalize, the maturation phase of tissue repair is said to have begun.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; During maturation, [[type III collagen]], which is prevalent during proliferation, is replaced by type I collagen.&lt;ref name="Dealey"/&gt; Originally disorganized collagen fibers are rearranged, cross-linked, and aligned along [[tension lines]].&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt; The onset of the maturation phase may vary extensively, depending on the size of the wound and whether it was initially closed or left open,&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; ranging from approximately 3 days&lt;ref name=pollock/&gt; to 3 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2005/august/Schultz/Extrace-Matric-Acute-Chronic-Wounds.html worldwidewounds.com] &gt; [http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2005/august/Schultz/images/New_fig_3.jpg Figure 3 – The time relationship between the different processes of wound healing.] by Gregory S Schultz, Glenn Ladwig and Annette Wysocki – in turn adapted from Asmussen PD, Sollner B. Mechanism of wound healing. In: Wound Care. Tutorial Medical Series. Stuttgart: Hippokrates Verlag, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The maturation phase can last for a year or longer, similarly depending on wound type.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt;

As the phase progresses, the [[tensile strength]] of the wound increases.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; Collagen will reach approximately 20% of its tensile strength after 3 weeks, increasing to 80% by 12th week. The maximum scar strength is 80% of that of unwounded skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton LM, Phillips TJ | title = Wound healing and treating wounds: Differential diagnosis and evaluation of chronic wounds | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 589–605; quiz 605–6 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26979352 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2015.08.068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since activity at the wound site is reduced, the scar loses its red appearance as [[blood vessel]]s that are no longer needed are removed by [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt;

The phases of wound healing normally progress in a predictable, timely manner; if they do not, healing may progress inappropriately to either a [[chronic wound]]&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; such as a [[venous ulcer]] or pathological scarring such as a [[keloid scar]].&lt;ref name="O'Leary"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Leary R, Wood EJ, Guillou PJ | title = Pathological scarring: strategic interventions | journal = The European Journal of Surgery = Acta Chirurgica | volume = 168 | issue = 10 | pages = 523–34 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12666691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Desmouliere"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Desmoulière A, Chaponnier C, Gabbiani G | title = Tissue repair, contraction, and the myofibroblast | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–12 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15659031 | doi = 10.1111/j.1067-1927.2005.130102.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting wound healing==
Many factors controlling the efficacy, speed, and manner of wound healing fall under two types: local and systemic factors.&lt;ref name="Rieger"/&gt;

===Local factors===
* Moisture; keeping a wound moist rather than dry makes wound healing more rapid and with less pain and less scarring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Metzger S | title = Clinical and financial advantages of moist wound management | journal = Home Healthcare Nurse | volume = 22 | issue = 9 | pages = 586–90 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15359168 | doi = 10.1097/00004045-200409000-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mechanical factors
* [[Edema]]
*[[Ionizing radiation]]
*Faculty technique of wound closure
* [[Ischemia]] and [[necrosis]]
* Foreign bodies. Sharp, small foreign bodies can penetrate the skin leaving little surface wound but causing internal injury and internal bleeding. For a glass foreign body, "frequently, an innocent skin wound disguises the extensive nature of the injuries beneath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iconomou TG, Zuker RM, Michelow BJ | title = Management of major penetrating glass injuries to the upper extremities in children and adolescents | journal = Microsurgery | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–6 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8469109 | doi = 10.1002/micr.1920140202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First-degree nerve injury requires a few hours to a few weeks to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nerve injury |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Johns Hopkins Health System |website=Johns Hopkins Medicine |access-date=2 October 2016 |url= http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/peripheral_nerve_surgery/conditions/nerve_injury.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a foreign body passes by a nerve and causes first-degree nerve injury during entry, then the sensation of the foreign body or pain due to internal wounding may be delayed by a few hours to a few weeks after entry. A sudden increase in pain during the first few weeks of wound healing could be a sign of a recovered nerve reporting internal injuries rather than a newly developed infection.
* Low [[oxygen tension]]
* Perfusion

===Systemic factors===

* [[Inflammation]]
* [[Diabetes]] – Individuals with diabetes demonstrate reduced capability in the healing of acute wounds. Additionally, diabetic individuals are susceptible to developing chronic diabetic foot ulcers, a serious complication of diabetes which affects 15% of people with diabetes and accounts for 84% of all diabetes-related lower leg amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brem H, Tomic-Canic M | title = Cellular and molecular basis of wound healing in diabetes | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 117 | issue = 5 | pages = 1219–22 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17476353 | pmc = 1857239 | doi = 10.1172/jci32169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The impaired healing abilities of diabetics with diabetic foot ulcers and/or acute wounds involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt; This impaired healing involves hypoxia, fibroblast and epidermal cell dysfunction, impaired angiogenesis and neovascularization, high levels of metalloproteases, damage from reactive oxygen species and AGEs (advanced glycation end-products), decreased host immune resistance, and neuropathy.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;
* [[Nutrient]]s – Malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies have a recognizable impact on wound healing post trauma or surgical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnold M, Barbul A | title = Nutrition and wound healing | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 117 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 42S-58S | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16799374 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000225432.17501.6c }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients including proteins, carbohydrates, arginine, glutamine, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, copper, zinc and iron all play significant roles in wound healing.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo S, Dipietro LA | title = Factors affecting wound healing | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–29 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20139336 | pmc = 2903966 | doi = 10.1177/0022034509359125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fats and carbohydrates provide the majority of energy required for wound healing.  Glucose is the most prominent source of fuel and it is used to create cellular ATP, providing energy for angiogenesis and the deposition of new tissues.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt; As the nutritional needs of each patient and their associated wound are complex, it is suggested that tailored nutritional support would benefit both acute and chronic wound healing.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;
* [[Metabolic disease]]s
* [[Immunosuppression]]
* [[Connective tissue]] disorders
* [[Smoking]] – Smoking causes a delay in the speed of wound repair notably in the proliferative and inflammatory phases. It also increases the likelihood of certain complications such as wound rupture, wound and flap necrosis, decrease in wound tensile strength and infection.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;
* Age – Increased age (over 60 years) is a risk factor for impaired wound healing.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt; It is recognized that, in older adults of otherwise overall good health, the effects of aging causes a temporal delay in healing, but no major impairment with regard to the quality of healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gosain A, DiPietro LA | title = Aging and wound healing | journal = World Journal of Surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–6 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14961191 | doi = 10.1007/s00268-003-7397-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed wound healing in patients of increasing age is associated with altered inflammatory response; for example delayed T-cell infiltration of the wound with alterations in the production of chemokines, and reduced macrophage phagocytic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swift ME, Burns AL, Gray KL, DiPietro LA | title = Age-related alterations in the inflammatory response to dermal injury | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 117 | issue = 5 | pages = 1027–35 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11710909 | doi = 10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01539.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alcohol – Alcohol consumption impairs wound healing and also increases the chances of infection. Alcohol affects the proliferative phase of healing. A single [[unit of alcohol]] causes a negative effect on re-epithelialization, wound closure, collagen production and angiogenesis.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;

== Research and development ==
Up until about 2000, the classic paradigm of wound healing, involving [[stem cells]] restricted to organ-specific lineages, had never been seriously challenged. Since then, the notion of [[adult stem cells]] having cellular ''plasticity'' or the ability to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into non-lineage cells has emerged as an alternative explanation.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; To be more specific, [[hematopoietic]] [[progenitor cells]] (that give rise to mature cells in the blood) may have the ability ''de-differentiate''  back into hematopoietic stem cells and/or ''transdifferentiate'' into non-lineage cells, such as fibroblasts.&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song G, Nguyen DT, Pietramaggiori G, Scherer S, Chen B, Zhan Q, Ogawa R, Yannas IV, Wagers AJ, Orgill DP, Murphy GF | title = Use of the parabiotic model in studies of cutaneous wound healing to define the participation of circulating cells | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 426–32 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20546556 | pmc = 2935287 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-475X.2010.00595.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem cells and cellular plasticity===
Multipotent adult stem cells have the capacity to be self-renewing and give rise to different cell types. Stem cells give rise to progenitor cells, which are cells that are not self-renewing, but can generate several types of cells. The extent of stem cell involvement in cutaneous (skin) wound healing is complex and not fully understood.

It is thought that the epidermis and dermis are reconstituted by mitotically active stem cells that reside at the apex of [[rete ridges]] (basal stem cells or BSC), the bulge of [[hair follicle]]s (hair follicular stem cell or HFSC), and the papillary dermis (dermal stem cells).&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; Moreover, bone marrow may also contain stem cells that play a major role in cutaneous wound healing.&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/&gt;

In rare circumstances, such as extensive cutaneous injury, self-renewal subpopulations in the bone marrow are induced to participate in the healing process, whereby they give rise to collagen-secreting cells that seem to play a role during wound repair.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; These two self-renewal subpopulations are (1) bone marrow-derived [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSC) and (2) [[hematopoietic stem cells]] (HSC). Bone marrow also harbors a progenitor subpopulation ([[endothelial]] progenitor cells or EPC) that, in the same type of setting, are mobilized to aid in the reconstruction of blood vessels.&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/&gt; Moreover, it thought that, extensive injury to skin also promotes the early trafficking of a unique subclass of [[leukocytes]] (circulating [[fibrocyte]]s) to the injured region, where they perform various  functions related to wound healing.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;

=== Wound repair versus regeneration ===
An injury is an interruption of morphology and/or functionality of a given tissue. After injury, structural tissue heals with incomplete or complete regeneration.&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen/&gt; Whereas, tissue without an interruption to the morphology almost always completely regenerates. An example of complete regeneration without an interruption of the morphology is non-injured tissue, such as skin.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2/&gt; Non-injured skin has a continued replacement and regeneration of cells which always results in complete regeneration.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2/&gt;

There is a subtle distinction between 'repair' and 'regeneration'.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen/&gt; ''Repair'' means ''incomplete regeneration''.&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 =Su  | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.3 Incomplete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = The new tissue is not the same as the tissue that was lost. After the repair process has been completed, there is a loss in the structure or function of the injured tissue. In this type of repair, it is common that granulation tissue (stromal connective tissue) proliferates to fill the defect created by the necrotic cells. The necrotic cells are then replaced by scar tissue.| url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?contentID=493 | access-date = 2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair or incomplete regeneration, refers to the physiologic adaptation of an organ after injury in an effort to re-establish continuity without regards to exact replacement of lost/damaged tissue.&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt;

An example of a tissue regenerating completely after an interruption of morphology is the [[endometrium]]; the endometrium after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle heals with complete regeneration.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 =Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology| publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal. This type of regeneration is common in physiological situations. Examples of physiological regeneration are the continual replacement of cells of the skin and repair of the endometrium after menstruation. Complete regeneration can occur in pathological situations in tissues that have good regenerative capacity.  | url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?ContentID=492 | access-date = 2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, after a tissue breakdown, such as in skin, a regeneration closer to complete regeneration may be induced by the use of biodegradable ([[collagen]]-[[glycoaminoglycan]]) scaffolds. These scaffolds are structurally analogous to [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) found in normal/un-injured dermis.&lt;ref name="Yannas, Lee, Orgill, Skrabut, Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yannas IV, Lee E, Orgill DP, Skrabut EM, Murphy GF | title = Synthesis and characterization of a model extracellular matrix that induces partial regeneration of adult mammalian skin | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 933–7 | date = February 1989 | pmid = 2915988 | pmc = 286593 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.86.3.933 | bibcode = 1989PNAS...86..933Y | jstor = 33315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental conditions required for tissue regeneration often oppose conditions that favor efficient wound repair, including inhibition of (1) platelet activation, (2) inflammatory response, and (3) wound contraction.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; In addition to providing support for fibroblast and endothelial cell attachment, biodegradable scaffolds inhibit wound contraction, thereby allowing the healing process to proceed towards a more-regenerative/less-scarring pathway. Pharmaceutical agents have been investigated which may be able to turn off [[myofibroblast]] differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Leary R, Ponnambalam S, Wood EJ | title = Pioglitazone-induced myofibroblast cell death: implications for cutaneous scarring | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 665–7 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14511015 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05501.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new way of thinking derived from the notion that [[heparan sulfate]]s are key player in tissue homeostasis:  the process that makes the tissue replace dead cells by identical cells. In wound areas, tissue homeostasis is lost as the heparan sulfates are degraded preventing the replacement of dead cells by identical cells. [[Heparan sulfate analogue]]s cannot be degraded by all know heparanases and glycanases and bind to the free heparin sulfate binding spots on the ECM, therefore preserving the normal tissue homeostasis and preventing scarring.&lt;ref name="Tong2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tong M, Tuk B, Hekking IM, Vermeij M, Barritault D, van Neck JW | title = Stimulated neovascularization, inflammation resolution and collagen maturation in healing rat cutaneous wounds by a heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan mimetic, OTR4120 | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 840–52 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19903305 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-475X.2009.00548.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barritault"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barritault D, Caruelle JP | title = [Regenerating agents (RGTAs): a new therapeutic approach] | language = French | journal = Annales Pharmaceutiques Francaises | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–44 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16568015 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-4509(06)75306-8 | trans-title = Regenerating agents (RGTAs): a new therapeutic approach }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intech"&gt;Van Neck et al, Heparan sulfate proteoglycan mimetics thrive tissue regeneration: an overview.

Repair or regeneration with regards to hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a). In normal circumstances after injury [[HIF1A|HIF-1a]] is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Scientists found that the simple up-regulation of HIF-1a via PHD inhibitors regenerates lost or damaged tissue in mammals that have a repair response; and the continued down-regulation of Hif-1a results in healing with a scarring response in mammals with a previous regenerative response to the loss of tissue. The act of regulating HIF-1a can either turn off, or turn on the key process of mammalian regeneration.&lt;ref name=HIF-1a2015&gt;{{cite web| last = eurekalert.org staff | title = Scientist at LIMR leads study demonstrating drug-induced tissue regeneration | website = eurekalert.org | publisher = Lankenau Institute for Medical Research (LIMR), | date = 3 June 2015 | url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-06/mlhl-sal060215.php | access-date = 3 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HIFregulation2015&gt;Zhang Y, Strehin I, Bedelbaeva K, Gourevitch D, Clark L, Leferovich J, Messersmith PB, Heber-Katz E.

===Scarless wound healing===
''Scarless wound healing'' is a concept based on the healing or repair of the skin (or other tissue/organs) after injury with the aim of healing with subjectively and relatively ''less'' [[scar]] tissue than normally expected. Scarless healing is sometimes mixed up with the concept of ''[[scar free healing]],'' which is wound healing which results in absolutely no scar (''free'' of scarring). However they are different concepts.

A reverse to scarless wound healing is [[scarification]] (wound healing to scar more). Historically, certain cultures consider scarification attractive;&lt;ref name="Rush2005"&gt;Rush, J. (2005). Spiritual tattoo: a cultural history of tattooing, piercing, scarification, branding, and implants, Frog Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this is generally not the case in the modern western society, in which many patients are turning to [[plastic surgery]] clinics with unrealistic expectations. Depending on [[scar]] type, treatment may be [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] (intralesional steroid injections, [[surgery]]) and/or conservative ([[Cold compression therapy|compression therapy]], topical [[silicone gel]], [[brachytherapy]], [[photodynamic therapy]]).&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown BC, McKenna SP, Siddhi K, McGrouther DA, Bayat A | title = The hidden cost of skin scars: quality of life after skin scarring | journal = Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive &amp; Aesthetic Surgery | volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 1049–58 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18617450 | doi = 10.1016/j.bjps.2008.03.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical judgment is necessary to successfully balance the potential benefits of the various treatments available against the likelihood of a poor response and possible complications resulting from these treatments. Many of these treatments may only have a [[placebo effect]], and the evidence base for the use of many current treatments is poor.&lt;ref name="Bayat2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bayat A, McGrouther DA, Ferguson MW | title = Skin scarring | journal = BMJ | volume = 326 | issue = 7380 | pages = 88–92 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12521975 | pmc = 1125033 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.326.7380.88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, comprehension of the basic biologic processes involved in [[wound repair]] and [[tissue regeneration]] have expanded due to advances in cellular and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref name="Clark1996"&gt;Clark, R. (1996). The molecular and cellular biology of wound repair, Springer Us.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the principal goals in wound management are to achieve rapid wound closure with a functional tissue that has minimal aesthetic scarring.&lt;ref name="Tonnesen2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonnesen MG, Feng X, Clark RA | title = Angiogenesis in wound healing | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology.

Scarless wound healing only occurs in mammalian foetal tissues&lt;ref name="Ferguson1996" /&gt; and complete [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] is limited to lower vertebrates, such as [[salamanders]], and [[invertebrates]].&lt;ref name="Brockes2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A, Velloso CP | title = Regeneration as an evolutionary variable | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 199 | issue = Pt 1-2 | pages = 3–11 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11523827 | pmc = 1594962 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2001.19910003.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In adult humans, injured tissue are repaired by [[collagen]] deposition, collagen remodelling and eventual scar formation, where fetal wound healing is believed to be more of a regenerative process with minimal or no scar formation.&lt;ref name="Ferguson1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferguson MW, Whitby DJ, Shah M, Armstrong J, Siebert JW, Longaker MT | title = Scar formation: the spectral nature of fetal and adult wound repair | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 854–60 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8628785 | doi = 10.1097/00006534-199604000-00029 | url = http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&amp;volume=97&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=854 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, foetal wound healing can be used to provide an accessible mammalian model of an optimal healing response in adult human tissues. Clues as to how this might be achieved come from studies of wound healing in embryos, where repair is fast and efficient and results in essentially perfect regeneration of any lost tissue.

===Cancer===
After inflammation, restoration of normal tissue integrity and function is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted cytokines. Disruption of normal feedback mechanisms in cancer threatens tissue integrity and enables a malignant tumor to escape the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karin M, Clevers H | title = Reparative inflammation takes charge of tissue regeneration | journal = Nature | volume = 529 | issue = 7586 | pages = 307–15 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26791721 | pmc = 5228603 | doi = 10.1038/nature17039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulating wound healing from a growth perspective==
Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the physical relationships governing wound healing and subsequent scarring, with mathematical models and simulations developed to elucidate these relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cumming BD, McElwain DL, Upton Z | title = A mathematical model of wound healing and subsequent scarring | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 7 | issue = 42 | pages = 19–34 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19324672 | pmc = 2839370 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2008.0536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of tissue around the wound site is a result of the migration of cells and collagen deposition by these cells.  The alignment of collagen describes the degree of scarring; basket-weave orientation of collagen is characteristic of normal skin, whereas aligned collagen fibers lead to significant scarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gurtner GC, Werner S, Barrandon Y, Longaker MT | title = Wound repair and regeneration | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7193 | pages = 314–21 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18480812 | doi = 10.1038/nature07039 | bibcode = 2008Natur.453..314G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been shown that the growth of tissue and extent of scar formation can be controlled by modulating the stress at a wound site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gurtner GC, Dauskardt RH, Wong VW, Bhatt KA, Wu K, Vial IN, Padois K, Korman JM, Longaker MT | title = Improving cutaneous scar formation by controlling the mechanical environment: large animal and phase I studies | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 254 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–25 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21606834 | doi = 10.1097/SLA.0b013e318220b159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of tissue can be simulated using the aforementioned relationships from a biochemical and biomechanical point of view.  The biologically active chemicals that play an important role in wound healing are modeled with Fickian diffusion to generate concentration profiles.  The balance equation for open systems when modeling wound healing incorporates mass growth due to cell migration and proliferation.  Here the following equation is used:

D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Div (R) + R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,

where ''ρ'' represents mass density, ''R'' represents a mass flux (from cell migration), and ''R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents a mass source (from cell proliferation, division, or enlargement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhl E, Steinmann P | title = Computational modeling of healing: an application of the material force method | journal = Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 187–203 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 14872320 | doi = 10.1007/s10237-003-0034-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships like these can be incorporated into an [[agent-based model]]s, where the sensitivity to single parameters such as initial collagen alignment, cytokine properties, and cell proliferation rates can be tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rouillard AD, Holmes JW | title = Mechanical regulation of fibroblast migration and collagen remodelling in healing myocardial infarcts | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 590 | issue = 18 | pages = 4585–602 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22495588 | pmc = 3477759 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2012.229484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wound closure intentions{{anchor|Types}}==
Successful wound healing is dependent on various cell types, molecular mediators and structural elements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Velnar T, Bailey T, Smrkolj V | title = The wound healing process: an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms | journal = The Journal of International Medical Research | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 1528–42 | date = 2009-10-01 | pmid = 19930861 | doi = 10.1177/147323000903700531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary intention===
Primary intention is the healing of a clean wound without tissue loss.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this process, wound edges are brought together, so that they are adjacent to each other (re-approximated). Wound closure is performed with sutures (stitches), staples, or adhesive tape or glue.

Primary intention can only be implemented when the wound is precise and there is minimal disruption to the local tissue and the epithelial basement membrane, e.g. surgical incisions.&lt;ref name="Armitage 496–501"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armitage|first=Jon|last2=Lockwood|first2=Sonia | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011-10-01|title=Skin incisions and wound closure |journal=Surgery (Oxford)|series=Wound Management|volume=29|issue=10|pages=496–501|doi=10.1016/j.mpsur.2011.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process is faster than healing by secondary intention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also less scarring associated with primary intention, as there are no large tissue losses to be filled with granulation tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Primary intention does require some granulation tissue to form.)
*Examples of primary intention include: well-repaired [[laceration]]s, well reduced [[bone fracture]]s, healing after [[flap surgery]].

===Secondary intention===
* Secondary intention is implemented when primary intention is not possible.
* This is due to wounds being created by major trauma in which there has been a significant loss in tissue or tissue damage.&lt;ref name="Armitage 496–501"/&gt;
*The wound is allowed to granulate.
*Surgeon may pack the wound with a gauze or use a drainage system.
*Granulation results in a broader scar.
*Healing process can be slow due to presence of drainage from infection.
*Wound care must be performed daily to encourage wound debris removal to allow for granulation tissue formation.
*Using antibiotics or antiseptics for the surgical wound healing by secondary intention is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norman G, Dumville JC, Mohapatra DP, Owens GL, Crosbie EJ | title = Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 3 | pages = CD011712 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 27021482 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Examples: [[gingivectomy]], [[gingivoplasty]], [[tooth extraction]] sockets, poorly reduced fractures, burns, severe lacerations, pressure ulcers.

===Tertiary intention===
(Delayed primary closure or secondary suture):
*The wound is initially cleaned, debrided and observed, typically 4 or 5 days before closure.
*The wound is purposely left open.
*Examples: healing of wounds by use of [[tissue graft]]s.

If the wound edges are not reapproximated immediately, delayed primary wound healing transpires. This type of healing may be desired in the case of contaminated wounds. By the fourth day, phagocytosis of contaminated tissues is well underway, and the processes of epithelization, collagen deposition, and maturation are occurring. Foreign materials are walled off by macrophages that may metamorphose into epithelioid cells, which are encircled by mononuclear leukocytes, forming granulomas. Usually the wound is closed surgically at this juncture, and if the "cleansing" of the wound is incomplete, chronic inflammation can ensue, resulting in prominent scarring.

==Complications of wound healing==

The major complications are many:

#Deficient scar formation: Results in [[wound dehiscence]] or rupture of the wound due to inadequate formation of granulation tissue.
#Excessive scar formation: [[Hypertrophic scar]], [[keloid]], [[desmoid]].
#Exuberant granulation ([[proud flesh]]).
#Deficient contraction (in skin grafts) or excessive contraction (in burns).
#Others: [[Dystrophic calcification]], pigmentary changes, painful scars, [[incisional hernia]]

Other complications can include [[Infection]] and [[Marjolin's ulcer]].

==Biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds==
