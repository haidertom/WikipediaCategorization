The '''Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS models''', also known as '''ASSA AIDS models''', are a series of [[mathematical model]]s developed to assist the actuarial profession and the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa]] in assessing and addressing the impact of the [[AIDS|HIV and AIDS]] epidemic in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/south-africa-hiv-aids-statistics.htm South Africa HIV AIDS Statistics and Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS Models]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx Actuarial Society of South Africa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104031521/http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The models have been developed by the [[AIDS|AIDS Committee]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm AIDS Committee Publications till date] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701024530/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm |date=July 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa|Society]] and the Center for Actuarial Research (CARe) at the [[University of Cape Town]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm ASSA AIDS Models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313090613/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==
In 1996 the first and earliest version of ASSA AIDS model ASSA500 was developed by the [[AIDS|AIDS Committee]] of the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa|society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/researchers-estimate-lives-lost-delay-arv-drug-use-hivaids-south-africa.html Harvard School of Public Health Report on ASSA HIV AIDS Models ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA500-3163.htm ASSA500 the first model of AIDS Committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601041036/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA500-3163.htm |date=June 1, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Red Ribbon.svg|100px|thumb|A red ribbon use as logo of ASSA AIDS Committee]] While the ASSA2008 model is the most recent version of ASSA AIDS and demographic model which was released in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA2008-Model-3480.htm The ASSA2008 model the most recent model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410192403/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA2008-Model-3480.htm |date=April 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The models have assisted insurers and those insured to have fair and balanced insurance policies in a country ravaged by AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actuarialsociety.org.za/Portals/1/Documents/fa4bedae-e09d-4ed6-a3aa-47f7a0369ff7.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cover.co.za/long-term-insurance/still-a-lot-of-life-in-life&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint task team of the South African National Department of Health and the Treasury used the ASSA model to estimate the impact of extending the life of AIDS patients.&lt;ref name=IMF&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W_LcnKavtYgC&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=ASSA%20AIDS%20model&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=ASSA%20AIDS%20model&amp;f=false|title= Post-Apartheid South Africa: The First Ten Years|accessdate=25 June 2012|author= Michael Nowak and Luca Antonio Ricci, eds|publisher= International Monetary Fund, 2006, p. 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASSA is one of only two models used in South Africa;&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; both are capable of making projections on the progression of the epidemic through an interaction of many factors. Four population risk groups are included, along with assumptions about sexual behaviour, rates of infection, conception rates, the median duration to mortality of those with HIV/AIDS, and the rates of transmission between mother and child.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; The impact of drug treatments at birth and while nursing, enhanced STD treatment, and risk avoidance is projected by a lower rate scenario&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; The model makes provisions for migration of the population, separate modeling of racial groups, and separate modeling of provincial populations.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;

A study by the South African National Department of Health and the Treasury used the ASSA model to project a positive result for the increased implementation of [[antiretroviral drug]]s (ARV) in the country,&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; although their cost is a problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmg.org.za/report/20100504-public-hearings-provincial-departments-helath-under-spending-hospital Public Hearings with National Treasury, Department of Health on under-expenditure of Hospital Revitalisation, Comprehensive HIV and AIDS, and Forensic Pathology Grants]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleksandr Gelyevich Dugin''' ({{lang-rus|Алекса́ндр Ге́льевич Ду́гин}}; born 7 January 1962) is a Russian philosopher, [[political analyst]], and strategist known for his [[Fascism|fascist]] views.&lt;ref&gt;"Classification of Dugin as a fascist is justified, regardless of the fact that today the MGU professor frequently speaks not as a primitive ethnocentrist or biological racist. ( ... ) By «fascist» we understand the «generic» meaning of the concept, used in comparatory research of contemporary right-wing extremism by such well-known historians-comparativists as Alexandr Galkin (Moscow), Walter Laqueur (Washington), Stanley Payne (Madison), Wolfgang Wippermann (Berlin) or Roger Griffin (Oxford)", {{cite web | url=http://inosmi.ru/politic/20120622/193954633.html | title="Евразийские" проекты Путина и Дугина – сходства и различия |trans-title=Dugin's "Eurasian" projects − similarities and differences | publisher=Geopolitika (Lithuania) | date=22 June 2012 | accessdate=31 August 2015 | author=Андреас Умланд}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a 1999 interview for a Polish "Fronda" Dugin explains: "In [[Russian Orthodox]] christianity a person is a part of the Church, part of the collective organism, just like a leg. So how can a person be responsible for himself? Can a leg be responsible for itself? Here is where the idea of state, total state originates from. Also because of this, Russians, since they are Orthodox, can be the true fascists, unlike artificial Italian fascists: of Gentile type or their Hegelians. The true [[Hegelianism]] is Ivan Peresvetov – the man who in 16th century invented the ''[[oprichnina]]'' for [[Ivan the Terrible]]. He was the true creator of Russian fascism. He created the idea that state is everything and an individual is nothing".

He is the author of more than 30 books, among them ''[[Foundations of Geopolitics]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Fourth Political Theory]]'' (2009).

==Early life and education==
Dugin was born in Moscow, into the family of a colonel-general in the [[GRU|Soviet military intelligence]] and [[Candidate of Science|candidate of law]] Geliy Alexandrovich Dugin and his wife Galina, a doctor and candidate of medicine.&lt;ref name=Literaturnaya&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litrossia.ru/2007/15/01412.html |script-title=ru:Доктор Дугин |publisher=Литературная Россия |accessdate=18 March 2012 |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022031837/http://www.litrossia.ru/2007/15/01412.html |archivedate=22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he entered the [[Moscow Aviation Institute]], but did not graduate due to his association with thinking contrary to the ongoing regime, which caused him to be expelled from the institute.

A self-taught polyglot, he read avidly in his fields of interest, from Middle Age and Renaissance European authors to Oriental Studies, translating into Russian from English, French, and German, and also the writings of Italian fascist [[Julius Evola]] and French author [[René Guénon]]. [[Traditionalist School|Religious Traditionalism]], Conservatism, [[Hermeticism]] and Poetry were topics followed closely by Dugin and a group of philosophers/thinkers also interested in Traditionalism: [[Geydar Dzhemal]], Evgeniy Golovin, Yuri Mamleev, Vladimir Stepanov, and Sergey Jigalkin.

He graduated in Economics and Management at [[Novocherkassk]] Meliorative State Academy in the [[Rostov Oblast]] in 1999, defending his post-graduate degree in Philosophy at [[Rostov-on-Don]] with the dissertation "The Evolution of Paradigmatic Foundations of Science" in 2000, and the PhD in the Faculty of Sociology at the same University in 2004 with the theme "The Transformation of the Political Structures and Institutions in the Process of Modernization of the Civil Society". In 1998, Dugin, Geydar Dzhemal, and Evgeniy Golovin created a study center based on their long time shared interests called the New University project.

In his 1997 article "Fascism – Borderless and Red", Dugin proclaimed the arrival of a "genuine, true, radically revolutionary and consistent, fascist fascism" in Russia. He believes that it was "by no means the racist and chauvinist aspects of [[National Socialism]] that determined the nature of its ideology. The excesses of this ideology in Germany are a matter exclusively of the Germans ... while Russian fascism is a combination of natural national conservatism with a passionate desire for true changes."&lt;ref name="Andreas"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Andreas Umland]] |title=Will United Russia become a fascist party? |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/will-united-russia-become-a-fascist-party.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=will-united-russia-become-a-fascist-party-2008-04-15 |work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Waffen-SS]] and especially the scientific sector of this organization, [[Ahnenerbe]]," was "an intellectual oasis in the framework of the National Socialist regime", according to him."&lt;ref name="Andreas" /&gt;

Dugin soon began publishing his own journal entitled ''Elementy'', which initially began by praising Franco-Belgian [[Jean-François Thiriart]], supporter of a Europe "from Dublin to Vladivostok". Consistently glorifying both [[Tsar]]ist and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] Russia, ''Elementy'' also revealed Dugin's admiration for [[Julius Evola]].  Dugin also collaborated with the weekly journal ''Den'' (The Day), a bastion of [[Rootless cosmopolitan|Russian anti-Cosmopolitanism]]{{clarify|date=April 2016}} previously directed by [[Alexander Prokhanov]].&lt;ref name="Dunlop" /&gt;

Dugin was amongst the earliest members of the [[National Bolshevik Party]] (NBP) and convinced [[Eduard Limonov]] to enter the political arena in 1994. A part of hard-line nationalist NBP members, supported by Dugin, split off to form the more right-wing, anti-liberal, anti-left, anti-[[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]]{{clarify|date=April 2016}} aggressive nationalist organization, [[National Bolshevik Front]]. After breaking with Limonov, he became close to [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and later to [[Vladimir Putin]]'s circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Mankoff |title=Russian Foreign Policy: The Return of Great Power Politics |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |pages=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dugin claims to be disapproving of [[liberalism]] and the West, particularly [[American hegemony]].&lt;ref name="BBC 2014"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Дугин хочет с помощью Путина прояснить свой статус в МГУ|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/russia/2014/06/140630_dugin_msu_university_dismissal|publisher=[[BBC Russian Service]]|date=30 June 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assertions show that he likes [[Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]: "We are on the side of Stalin and the Soviet Union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Иван Зуев|script-title=ru:Александр Дугин: Уроки религии – это великая победа над русофобами|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/16845|publisher=Nakanune.ru|language=Russian|date=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls himself a conservative and says, "We, conservatives, want a strong, solid State, want order and healthy family, positive values, the reinforcing of the importance of religion and the Church in society". He adds, "We want patriotic radio, TV, patriotic experts, patriotic clubs. We want the media that expresses national interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Дугин|script-title=ru:Мы должны забрать у либералов как минимум половину медийного поля!|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/16946/|publisher=Nakanune.ru|language=Russian|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the Eurasia Movement===
The [[Eurasia Party]], later [[Eurasia Movement]], was officially recognized by the Ministry of Justice on 31 May 2001.&lt;ref name="Dunlop"/&gt; The Eurasia Party claims support by some military circles and by leaders of the Orthodox Christian faith in Russia, and the party hopes to play a key role in attempts to resolve the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] problem, with the objective of setting the stage for Dugin's dream of a Russian strategic alliance with European and Middle Eastern states, primarily Iran. Dugin's ideas, particularly those on "a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]-[[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] alliance in the Eurasian sphere" have recently become popular among certain nationalistic circles in Turkey, most notably among alleged members of the [[Ergenekon network]], which is the subject of a high-profile trial (on charges of conspiracy).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Dugin's Eurasianist ideology has also been linked to his adherence to the doctrines of the [[Traditionalist School]]. (Dugin's Traditionalist beliefs are the subject of a book length study by J. Heiser, ''The American Empire Should Be Destroyed—Aleksandr Dugin and the Perils of Immanentized Eschatology.''&lt;ref name="Heiser"&gt;{{cite book|author=James D. Heiser|title=The American Empire Should Be Destroyed: Alexander Dugin and the Perils of Immanentized Eschatology|publisher=Repristination Press|isbn=1891469436}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Dugin also advocates for a Russo-Arab alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Megah Stack |date=4 September 2008 |title=Russian nationalist advocates Eurasian alliance against the U.S. |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fgw-dugin4-2008sep04-story.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location= California |access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reborn Russia, according to Dugin's concept, is said by Charles Clover of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' to be a slightly remade version of the Soviet Union with echoes of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], where [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] was one of three continent-sized super states including [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] and [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]] as the other two and was participating in endless war between them.&lt;ref name="Clover"/&gt;

In the Eurasian public discourse sphere, the totalitarian communist policy deployed in over three decades of works by various international groups that are part of the movement, is "a version of reintegration of the post-Soviet space into a "Eurasian" sphere of influence for Russia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=RAND |date=2017 |title=Russian Views of the International Order |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1826.html |access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North-American program "works with a wide range of partners from all sectors of civil society" and "is advanced through grant making, advocacy and research, regional initiatives, and close engagement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=OSF |title=Eurasia Program |url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/eurasia-program |access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has criticized the "Euro-Atlantic" involvement in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] as a scheme to create a "[[cordon sanitaire]]" around Russia, much like the [[Border states (Eastern Europe)|French and British attempt]] post-[[World War I]].

In 2005, Dugin founded the [[Eurasian Youth Union]] of Russia as the youth wing of the International Eurasia Movement.&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Dugin: The Crazy Ideologue of the New Russian Empire|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/02/alexander-dugin-the-crazy-ideologue-of-the-new-russian-empire.html|work=The Daily Beast|date=4 February 2014}} In Russian: {{cite web|author1=Арсентий Тропаревский|script-title=ru:Дугин: Сумасшедший гений новой Российской империи|url=http://theinternettimes.ru/post/dugin_geniy|work=The Internet Times|language=Russian}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[2008 South Ossetia war|war broke out]] between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Dugin visited South Ossetia and predicted, "Our troops will occupy the Georgian capital Tbilisi, the entire country, and perhaps even Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula, which is historically part of Russia, anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Road to War in Georgia: The Chronicle of a Caucasian Tragedy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/road-to-war-in-georgia-the-chronicle-of-a-caucasian-tragedy-a-574812.html|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards he said Russia should "not stop at liberating South Ossetia but should move further," and "we have to do something similar in Ukraine."&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander Dugin|url=http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/personalno/532383-echo/|title=Interview|publisher=[[Echo of Moscow]]|date=8 August 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dugin stated that Russia should repeat the Georgian scenario in Ukraine, namely attack it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ірина Біла|script-title=uk:Можливість застосування Ющенком силового сценарію; махінації навколо землі.

===Russian Orthodoxy and Rodnovery===

Dugin was [[baptism|baptized]] at the age of six in the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] church of [[Michurinsk]] by his great-grandmother Elena Mikhailovna Kargaltseva. Since 1999, he formally embraced a branch of the [[Old Believers]], a Russian religious movement which rejected the 1652–1666 [[Old Believers#Reforms of Patriarch Nikon|reforms]] of the official [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}} Dugin's Eurasian philosophy owes much to [[Traditionalist School|Traditional Integralism]] and ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movements, and as such it resonates with [[Neopaganism]],{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|pp=11–14}} a category which in this context means the movement of [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery), especially in the forms of [[Anastasianism]] and [[Ynglism]]. Dugin's Eurasianism is often cited as belonging to the same spectrum of these movements,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marat Shterin]] (2016). "[https://g2w.eu/zeitschrift/leseprobe/1250-attraktivitaet-und-dilemma-neue-religioese-bewegungen-in-russland Attraktivität und Dilemma: Neue religiöse Bewegungen in Russland]". ''RGOW'', 2. Institut G2W – Ökumenisches Forum für Glauben, Religion und Gesellschaft in Ost und West. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as also having influences from [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Eastern religions|Eastern]] traditions.{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=15}} He himself calls to rely upon "Eastern theology and mystical currents" for the development of the [[The Fourth Political Theory|Fourth Political Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Dugin. ''The Fourth Political Theory''. Arktos, 2012. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marlene Laruelle]], his adherence to the Old Believers allows him to stand between Paganism and Orthodox Christianity without formally adopting either of them. His choice is not paradoxical, since, according to him — in the wake of [[René Guénon]] —, Russian Orthodoxy and especially the Old Believers have preserved an [[esotericism|esoteric]] and initiatory character which was utterly lost in Western Christianity. As such, the Russian Orthodox tradition may be merged with Neopaganism and may host "Neopaganism's nationalist force, which anchors it in the Russian soil, and separates it from the two other Christian confessions".{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}}

===Esotericism, fascism, and integrative geopolitics===

In the early 1990s Dugin's work at the [[National Bolshevik Front]] included research into the roots of national movements and the activities of [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|supporting esoteric groups]] in the first half of the 20th century. Partnering [[Christian Bouchet]],&lt;ref&gt;The Ordo Templi Orientis Phenomenon.

===Stance on Ukraine and role in Russian politics===

Aleksandr Dugin supports Putin and his foreign policies but has opposed Russian governments due to their economic policies. His 2007 quote, "There are no more opponents of Putin's course and, if there are, they are mentally ill and need to be sent off for clinical examination. Putin is everywhere, Putin is everything, Putin is absolute, and Putin is indispensable" – was voted number two in flattery by readers of ''[[Kommersant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/Tests/Test10.aspx|script-title=ru:Кто похвалит его лучше всех|trans-title=Who will praise him better than the rest|language=ru|work=Kommersant|date=2007|accessdate=24 March 2016}} (Click the "Results" ("Результаты") button at the bottom of the page)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[the Kremlin]], Dugin represents the "war party", a division within the leadership over Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite web|author=Donald N.

Dugin stated he was disappointed in [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]], saying that Putin did not aid the pro-Russian insurgents in Ukraine after the [[Ukrainian Army]]'s [[2014 insurgency in Donbass#Post-ceasefire government offensive|early July 2014 offensive]].&lt;ref name=DOUPOU/&gt; In August 2014, Dugin called for a "genocide" of Ukrainians.&lt;ref name=FT150128&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a87747de-a713-11e4-b6bd-00144feab7de.html |title= Alarm bells ring over Syriza's Russian links |first= Sam |last= Jones |first2= Kerin |last2= Hope |first3= Courtney |last3= Weaver |work= [[Financial Times]] |date= 28 January 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halya Coynash of the [[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]] said that the influence of Dugin's "Eurasian ideology" on events in eastern Ukraine and on Russia's invasion of the Crimea was beyond any doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Halya Coynash|title=Intrigue over 'dismissal' of Putin's ideologue, Alexander Dugin|url=http://khpg.org.ua/en/index.php?id=1404029911|publisher=[[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]]|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vincent Jauvert, Dugin's radical ideology today became the basis for the internal and foreign policy of the Russian authorities.&lt;ref name="Jauvert"&gt;{{cite news|author=Vincent Jauvert|title=Le Raspoutine de Poutine|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/ukraine-la-revolte/20140503.OBS6009/le-raspoutine-de-poutine.html|work=[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]|date=3 May 2014|language=French}} In Russian: {{cite web|author=Венсан Жовер|script-title=ru:Дугин — путинский Распутин|url=http://inosmi.ru/russia/20140512/220188170.html|publisher=[[inoSMI]]|language=Russian|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Dugin is worth listening to, in order to understand to which fate the Kremlin is leading its country and the whole of Europe.&lt;ref name="Jauvert"/&gt; However, according to [[Alexander Nevzorov]], if we had had [[Sergey Kurginyan|Kurginyan]] and Dugin instead of Putin, there would have been hell for all of us to pay, they would have unleashed a European and World War without a shadow of a doubt, without considering consequences at all.&lt;ref name="Быков"/&gt; But Dugin and Kurginyan do not have the slightest impact on what is going on in the Kremlin and do not even get coaching there.&lt;ref name="Быков"/&gt; In another publication, Nevzorov said, "Beliefs are only proven by being under bullets, another prescription does not exist. I do not understand why [[Vitaly Milonov|Milonov]] and Dugin are not there yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Невзоров: Я не понимаю, почему Милонов и Дугин до сих пор не под пулями|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/piter/2014/06/16/1280845.html|publisher=Rosbalt.ru|language=Russian|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2014, Dugin said, "Only after restoring the Greater Russia that is the [[Eurasian Union]], we can become a credible global player. Now these processes slowed down very much. The [[Euromaidan|Ukrainian maidan]] was the response of the West to the advance of the Russian integration."&lt;ref name="Медведева"/&gt; He described the [[Euromaidan]] as a coup d'état carried out not by the Ukrainians but by the United States: "America wishes to wage the war against Russia not by its own hands but by the hands of the Ukrainians. Promising to wink at up to 10 thousand victims among the peaceful population of Ukraine and actually demanding the victims, the United States led to this war. The United States carried out the coup d'état during the maidan for the purpose of this war. The United States raised [[neo-Nazis]] [[Russophobes]] to the power for the purpose of this war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Руслан Горевой|script-title=ru:На пороге войны|url=http://versia.ru/articles/2014/jun/30/na_poroge_voyny|work=Газета "Версия"|issue=24|date=30 July 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugin said Russia is the major driving force for the current events in Ukraine, "Russia insists on its sovereignty, its liberty, responds to challenges thrown down to it, for example, in Ukraine. Russia is attempting to integrate the post-Soviet space ..."&lt;ref name="Медведева"/&gt; As Israeli political scientist Vyacheslav Likhachov states, "If one seriously takes the fact that such a person as Alexander Dugin is the ideologist of the imperial dash for the West, then one can establish that Russia is not going to stop as far as the Atlantic Ocean."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Юрій Савицький|script-title=uk:Путін є найбільшим радикалом Росії – ізраїльський експерт|url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/26599384.html|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|language=Ukrainian|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014 article by [[Dmitry Bykov]] "Why TV, Alexander Dugin and Galina Pyshnyak crucified a boy", [[Channel One Russia]]'s use of the aired story by Dugin and Pyshnyak about the allegedly crucified boy as a pretext for escalating the conflict was compared to the case of [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Дмитрий Быков|script-title=ru:Зачем ТВ, Александр Дугин и Галина Пышняк распяли мальчика|url=http://sobesednik.ru/dmitriy-bykov/20140715-dmitriy-bykov-zachem-tv-aleksandr-dugin-i-galina-pyshnyak-ra|publisher=Sobesednik.ru|language=Russian|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 2014, Dugin on his Facebook account wrote a story that a 6 year old child was allegedly nailed down to an advertisement board and shot to death before his father's eyes.&lt;ref name="Епифанова"&gt;{{cite news|author=Мария Епифанова|script-title=ru:И это — не предел?|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/64440.html|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|issue=77|date=16 July 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2014, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' provided a videotape of its correspondent Eugen Feldman walking along the main square in [[Sloviansk]], asking local old women if they had heard of the murder of the child. They said such an event did not take place.&lt;ref name="Епифанова"/&gt; The website [[Change.org]] hosted a petition of citizens who demanded "a comprehensive investigation with identification for all persons involved in the fabrication of the plot."&lt;ref name="Епифанова"/&gt;

On 2 October 2014, Dugin described the situation in Donbass: "The [[humanitarian crisis]] has long since been raging on the territory of [[Federal State of Novorossiya|Novorossiya]]. Already up to a million, if not more, refugees are in the Russian Federation. A large part of the inhabitants of the [[Donetsk People's Republic|DPR]] and the [[Lugansk People's Republic|LPR]] simply moved abroad."&lt;ref name="заговор"/&gt; In the end of October 2014, Dugin advised the separatists to establish dictatorship in Novorossiya until they win in the confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Новости "Новороссии": для достижения победы Дугин рекомендует террористам диктатуру|url=http://joinfo.ua/politic/1041112_Novosti-Novorossii-dostizheniya-pobedi-Dugin.html|publisher=Joinfo.ua|language=Russian|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhetoric about the fifth column===
The typical rhetoric about the [[fifth column]] as [[foreign agent]]s is used by Dugin for political accusations in many publications. In his 2014 interview published by ''[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]]'' and ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', he says, "A huge struggle is being conducted. And, of course, Europe has its own fifth column, its own [[2011–13 Russian protests|Bolotnaya Square]]-minded people.

That is why they are effective, they work, they are listened to, they get away with anything because they have the world power standing behind them."&lt;ref name="великая война"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KP"/&gt; He sees the American embassy as the center for funding and guiding the fifth column and asserts, "We know that the fifth column receives money and instructions from the American embassy."&lt;ref name="заговор"&gt;{{cite web|author=Александр Дугин|script-title=ru:Против Путина готовится заговор, мы наблюдаем либеральный ответ Русской весне|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/19518/|publisher=Nakanune.ru|date=2 October 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dugin, the fifth column promoted the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] as a land continental construction, seized power under [[Boris Yeltsin]], and headed Russia as the ruling politico-economic and cultural elite until the 2000s; the fifth column is the regime of liberal reformers of the 1990s and includes former [[Russian oligarchs]] [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], former government officials [[Mikhail Kasyanov]], [[Boris Nemtsov]], [[Vladimir Ryzhkov]], artistic, cultural, and media workers,&lt;ref name="Шестая"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Александр Дугин|script-title=ru:Шестая колонна|url=http://vz.ru/opinions/2014/4/29/684247.html|work=[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]]|date=29 April 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Echo of Moscow]], the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]], the highest ranks of the [[National Research University Higher School of Economics]], a significant part of teachers of the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]], and a minority part of teachers of the [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author1=Александр Дугин|title=Пятая колонна и либеральная идеология: аномалия вседозволенности |trans-title=The fifth column and liberal ideology: an anomaly of permissiveness|url=http://eurasiainform.md/pyataya-kolonna-i-liberalnaya-ideologiya-anomaliya-vsedozvolennosti-aleksandr-dugin.html|publisher=Eurasiainform.md|language=Russian|date=24 March 2014|access-date=4 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729212858/http://eurasiainform.md/pyataya-kolonna-i-liberalnaya-ideologiya-anomaliya-vsedozvolennosti-aleksandr-dugin.html|archive-date=29 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugin proposes to deprive the fifth column of Russian citizenship and deport the group from Russia: "I believe it is necessary to deport the fifth column and deprive them of their citizenship."&lt;ref name="Макаревич"&gt;{{cite web|author=Елена Янкелевич|script-title=ru:Андрей Макаревич: "пятая колонна" или жертва травли?|url=http://riafan.ru/56800-andrey-makarevich-pyataya-kolonna-ili-zhertva-travli/|publisher=Riafan.ru|language=Russian|date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, Dugin argued, "There are no longer opponents of Putin's policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Максим Соколов|script-title=ru:Путин абсолютен|trans-title=Putin is absolute|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/329407|work=[[Izvestia]]|date=5 October 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Григорий Пасько|script-title=ru:Шизофрения, или Будьте здоровы!|trans-title=Schizophrenia, or To your health!|journal=[[Index on Censorship]]|year=2007|issue=27|url=http://index.org.ru/journal/27/pask27.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Dugin in an interview to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' confirmed that he considers the opponents of Putin to be mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Neef"/&gt;

In one of his publications, Dugin introduced the term ''the sixth column'' and defined it as "the fifth column which just pretends to be something different",&lt;ref name="Шестая"/&gt; those who are in favor of Putin, but demand that he stand for liberal values (as opposed to the liberal fifth column, which is specifically against Putin). During the [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], Dugin said that all the Russian sixth column stood up staunchly for Ukrainian oligarch [[Rinat Akhmetov]].&lt;ref name="За Ахметова"&gt;{{cite web|author=Александр Дугин|script-title=ru:За Ахметова грудью встала российская шестая колонна|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/news/2014/5/21/22353563/|publisher=Nakanune.ru|language=Russian|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he asserts, "We need to struggle against the fifth and sixth columns."&lt;ref name="Медведева"&gt;{{cite web|author=Татьяна Медведева|script-title=ru:Александр Дугин: "Нужно бороться с "шестой колонной"|url=http://portal-kultura.ru/articles/person/64670-aleksandr-dugin-nuzhno-borotsya-s-shestoy-kolonnoy/|work=Газета "Культура"|issue=35|language=Russian|date=10–16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian-American artist [[Mihail Chemiakin]] says Dugin is inventing "the sixth column". "Soon, probably, there would already be the seventh one as well. "The fifth column" is understandable. That is we, intelligentsia, lousy, dirty, who read [[Albert Camus|Camus]]. And "the sixth column", in his opinion, is more dangerous, because that is the personal entourage of Vladimir Putin. But he is naive and understands nothing. And as for Dugin, he can tell him who to shoot to death and who to imprison. Maybe, [[Alexey Kudrin|Kudrin]] and maybe, [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev]] ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Виктор Резунков|script-title=ru:Попахивает фашизмом|url=http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/26646237.html|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|language=Russian|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

According to Dugin, the whole Internet should be banned: "I think that Internet as such, as a phenomenon is worth prohibiting because it gives nobody anything good."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|74QT-Wcgjbs|God is against Internet (Dugin's speech in Russian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Dugin said in a lecture that chemistry and physics are demonic sciences, and that all Orthodox Russians need to unite around the President of the Russian Federation in the last battle between good and evil, following the example of Iran and North Korea.&lt;ref name="Гольянов"&gt;{{cite web|author=Владислав Гольянов|script-title=ru:Владимир Путин как спаситель от "сатанинского" Запада|url=http://www.baltinfo.ru/2012/06/13/Vladimir-Puti-kak-spasitel-ot-sataninskogo-Zapada-284483|publisher=Baltinfo.ru|language=Russian|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "If we want to liberate ourselves from the West, it is needed to liberate ourselves from textbooks on physics and chemistry."&lt;ref name="Гольянов"/&gt;

Dugin has characterized his position on the Ukrainian conflict as "firm opposition to the Junta and Ukrainian Nazism that are annihilating peaceful civilians" as well as unacceptance of liberalism and American hegemony.&lt;ref name="lenta.ru"/&gt;

==Loss of department headship==
During the conflict in Ukraine, Dugin also lost his post as Head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations of [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref name=DOUPOU&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ben Hoyle|title=Putin accused of betraying and abandoning Ukraine separatists|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/putin-accused-of-betraying-and-abandoning-ukraine-separatists/story-fnb64oi6-1226976223365|work=[[The Australian]]|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebel leaders in Ukraine feel 'abandoned' by Putin|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/rebel-leaders-in-ukraine-feel-abandoned-by-putin/story-fnb64oi6-1226976988427|work=[[The Australian]]|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Sonne|title=Russian Nationalists Feel Let Down by Kremlin|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-nationalists-feel-let-down-by-kremlin-again-1404510139|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Catherine A|title=Russia This Week: Dugin Dismissed from Moscow State University?

There should not be any more conversations. As a professor, I consider it so.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=В России собирают подписи за увольнение профессора МГУ, призвавшего убивать украинцев|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/928851-v-rossii-sobirayut-podpisi-za-uvolnenie-professora-mgu-prizvavshego-ubivat-ukraintsev.html|agency=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]]|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugin claimed to have been fired from this post; the university claimed the offer of a department chairmanship resulted from a technical error and that he would remain a professor under contract until September 2014.&lt;ref name=DOUPOU /&gt; Dugin wrote the statement of resignation from the faculty because it was necessary to be reappointed to the Moscow State University, but the appointment did not happen, so as a result he is no longer a staff member of the faculty and a staff member of the Moscow State University.&lt;ref name="BBC 2014" /&gt;

==Legal cases against Dugin==
At the end of October 2014, [[Sergey Kurginyan]], the leader of all-Russian movement [[Essence of Time (movement)|Essence of Time]], sued Dugin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Дугин: Кургинян подал на меня в суд, а я бы вызвал его на дуэль|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/moscow/2014/10/28/1332014.html|publisher=Rosbalt.ru|language=Russian|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Dugin called Kurginyan a traitor and accused him of destroying [[Donetsk People's Republic|DPR]] deputy foreign minister Proselkov in the following words: "Possessed supporters of traitor Kurginyan, who as now it turns out is working for [[Russian oligarchs|oligarchs]], [[Yukos]] and Israel, declared Sasha Proselkov "main enemy" after he along with Gubarev did not allow denigrating Russian hero [[Igor Girkin|Igor Strelkov]] with impunity." Dugin added: "Kurginyan crossed a red line: the ideological controversy is one thing, the physical destruction of Russian patriots is another one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Владислав Гордеев|script-title=ru:Под Луганском застрелили замминистра иностранных дел ДНР|url=http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/01/08/2014/940397.shtml|publisher=[[RBC Information Systems|RBC]]|language=Russian|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Кургинян требует с РБК и Дугина 5 млн на тепловизоры для ополченцев|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/578509|work=[[Izvestia]]|date=27 October 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanctions==
On 11 March 2015, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] added Dugin, as well as his Eurasian Youth Union, to its list of Russian citizens who are sanctioned as a result of their involvement in the Ukrainian crisis.&lt;ref name=USSanctions&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20150311.aspx |title= U.S. Department of the Treasury Ukraine-related Designations |publisher= treasury.gov |date= 11 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Canada added Dugin to its list of [[List of individuals sanctioned during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctioned individuals]].&lt;ref name=CA150629&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2015/06/29/expanded-sanctions-list |title=Expanded Sanctions List |publisher=pm.gc.ca |date=29 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820173127/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2015/06/29/expanded-sanctions-list |archivedate=20 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
He is a character of ''Yevraziyskoye'' (''Something Eurasian''), a poem by [[Dmitry Bykov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Дмитрий Быков|script-title=ru:Евразийское|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/columns/57802.html|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|issue=44|date=22 April 2013|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dugin's works==

Several of Dugin's books have been published by the publishing house Arktos, an English-language publisher for Traditionalist and New Right books, which specializes in works by prominent fascists and neo-Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2014/winter/White-Identity-Worldwide |title=White Identity Worldwide |author=Heidi Beirich |date=21 November 2014 |work=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asian psychology''' is a branch of [[cultural psychology]] that studies psychological concepts as they relate to [[Culture of Asia|Asian culture]]. Psychologists studying these issue are often aligned with [[cross-cultural psychology]].

==Asian behavior==
As pointed out by Shinobu Kitayama, professor of psychology and Director of the Culture &amp; Cognition Program at the [[University of Michigan]], culture can have a profound impact on the way people think about and perceive the world around them. East Asians may think differently from Westerners (See also, [[Self-concept#Cultural differences|Cultural differences in self-concept]] and [[Construals#Construal_and_.22the_self.22|Self-construal]].) Kitayama proposed that unlike the traditional American point-of-view which accentuates the importance of one's self and makes oneself independent, an Asian will instead feel more interdependent.&lt;ref name="Asian Behavior"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2267|title=Asian Psychology Coming of Age|last=Kitayama|first=Shinobu|publisher=American Association for Psychology Science|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==
Asian psychologists wanted to have an expanding role in the science of psychology, but felt limited due to the heavy western influence. Predominant figures in Asian psychology are Quicheng Jing in China, Hiroshi Azuma in Japan, Ku-Shu Yang in Taiwan, and Durganand Sinha in India.

==''Asian American Journal of Psychology''==
The ''[[Asian American Journal of Psychology]]''® is the official publication of the Asian American Psychological Association and is dedicated to research, practice, advocacy, education, and policy within Asian American psychology. The Journal publishes empirical, theoretical, methodological, and practice oriented articles and book reviews covering topics relevant to Asian American individuals and communities, including prevention, intervention, training, and social justice. Particular consideration is given to empirical articles using quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methodology.

==''Asian Journal of Social Psychology''==
The ''Asian Journal of Social Psychology'' stimulates research and encourages academic exchanges for the advancement of social psychology in Asia. It publishes theoretical and empirical papers by Asian scholars and those interested in Asian cultures and societies.
 
The ''Asian Journal of Social Psychology'' is partly funded by a Grant-in-Aid for Publication of Scientific Research Results from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

==AAPA Online==
AAPA was founded in 1972 and is the largest organization of faculty, students, researchers, and practitioners interested in Asian American psychology. Our members and initiatives have positively impacted psychological treatment, education, training, research, policy and social justice advocacy, through research dissemination, organizational policy statements and collaboration with other psychological organizations for publications, training initiatives, and disseminating resources for serving Asian American communities.

==Contributions==
Over the years, the contribution to the study of psychology was done mostly by US European psychologists, however, in recent years this has been changing. More Asian countries than ever before are contributing to psychology at an ever increasing rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.iaccp.org/xian/PDFs/2_1Adair.pdf |title=Beyond Indigenization: Asian Psychology’s Contribution to the World of Psychology |last=Adair |first=John |publisher=International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology |accessdate=1 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324120411/http://ebooks.iaccp.org/xian/PDFs/2_1Adair.pdf |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8579">'''Breath gas analysis''' is a method for gaining non-invasive information on the clinical state of an individual by monitoring [[volatile organic compound]]s present in the exhaled [[breath]]. Breath gas concentration can then be related to [[blood]] concentrations via [[mathematical modeling]] as for example in [[blood alcohol]] testing.

==History==

The area of modern breath testing commenced in 1971, when [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Linus Pauling]] demonstrated that human breath is a complex gas, containing more than 200 different volatile organic compounds. However, physicians have used breath analysis since the days of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Anil S. Modak:  ''Single time point diagnostic breath tests: a review'', J. Breath Res. 4 (2010), 017002 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1752-7155/4/1/017002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

[[Endogenous]] volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released within the human organism as a result of normal [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity or due to pathological disorders. They enter the blood stream and are eventually metabolized or excreted via [[exhalation]], [[skin]] emission, [[urine]], etc.

Breath sampling is non-invasive and breath samples can be extracted as often as desired.&lt;ref&gt;H. Koc, K. Unterkofler, S. Teschl, and J. King: "Mathematical modeling for breath gas analysis," 3. Forschungsforum der Österreichischen Fachhochschulen, Wien 2011. [http://www.esi.ac.at/~susanne/FFOeFH2011_KUTK.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification and quantification of potential disease [[biomarker]]s can be seen as the driving force for the analysis of exhaled breath. Moreover, future applications for medical diagnosis and therapy control with dynamic assessments of normal physiological function or pharmacodynamics  are intended.

[[Exogenous]] VOCs penetrating the body as a result of  environmental exposure can be used to quantify body burden. Also breath tests are often based on the ingestion of  isotopically labeled precursors, producing isotopically labeled [[carbon dioxide]] and potentially many other metabolites.

However, breath sampling is far from being a standardized procedure due to the numerous confounding factors biasing the concentrations of volatiles in breath. These factors are related to both the breath sampling protocols as well as the complex physiological mechanisms underlying [[pulmonary gas exchange]]. Even under resting conditions exhaled breath concentrations of VOCs can strongly be influenced by specific physiological parameters such as cardiac output and breathing patterns, depending on the physico-chemical properties of the compound under study.

Understanding the influence of all this factors and their control is necessary for achieving an accurate standardization of breath sample collection and for the correct deduction of the corresponding blood concentration levels.

The simplest model relating breath gas concentration to blood concentrations was developed by Farhi&lt;ref&gt;Leon E. Farhi: ''Elimination of inert gas by the lung,'' Respiration Physiology 3 (1967) 1–11 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0034-5687(67)90018-7]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
C_A = \frac{C_{\bar v}}{\lambda_\text{b:air} + \dot V_A/\dot Q_c},
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; C_A &lt;/math&gt; denotes the alveolar concentration which is assumed to be equal to the measured concentration.
It expresses the fact that the concentration of an inert gas in the alveolar air depends on the mixed venous concentration  &lt;math&gt;C_{\bar v} &lt;/math&gt;, the substance-specific blood:air [[partition coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{b:air} &lt;/math&gt;, and the [[ventilation-perfusion ratio]]  &lt;math&gt;\dot V_A/\dot Q_c &lt;/math&gt;.
But this model fails when two prototypical substances like [[acetone]] (partition coefficient  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{b:air} = 340 &lt;/math&gt;) or [[isoprene]] (partition coefficient  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{b:air} = 0.75  &lt;/math&gt; ) are measured.&lt;ref&gt;Julian King, Alexander Kupferthaler, [[Karl Unterkofler]], Helin Koc, Susanne Teschl, [[Gerald Teschl]], Wolfram Miekisch, Jochen Schubert, Hartmann Hinterhuber, and [[Anton Amann]]: ''Isoprene and acetone concentration profiles during exercise at an ergometer'', J. Breath Research 3, (2009) 027006 (16 pp) [http://iopscience.iop.org/1752-7163/3/2/027006]&lt;/ref&gt;

E.g., multiplying the proposed population mean of approximately &lt;math&gt; 1 \mu g/l &lt;/math&gt; acetone  in end-tidal breath by the partition coefficient &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\text{b:air} = 340 &lt;/math&gt; at body temperature  grossly underestimates observed (arterial) blood levels spreading around  &lt;math&gt; 1 mg/l &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, breath profiles of acetone (and other highly soluble volatile compounds such as 2-pentanone or methyl acetate) associated with moderate workload ergometer challenges of normal healthy volunteers drastically depart from the trend suggested by the equation above.

Hence some more refined models are necessary. Such models have been developed recently.&lt;ref&gt;Julian King, Helin Koc,  Karl Unterkofler, Pawel Mochalski, Alexander Kupferthaler, Gerald Teschl, Susanne Teschl, Hartmann Hinterhuber, and Anton Amann: ''Physiological modeling of isoprene dynamics in exhaled breath,''  J. Theoret. Biol.  267  (2010), 626–637, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2145]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian King, Karl Unterkofler, Gerald Teschl, Susanne Teschl, Helin Koc, Hartmann Hinterhuber, and Anton Amann: ''A mathematical model for breath gas analysis of volatile organic compounds with special emphasis on acetone,'' J. Math. Biol. 63 (2011),  959-999, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00285-010-0398-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breath collectors==

Breath can be collected using a variety of home-made and commercially available devices.  The three basic types of breath collector for VOC analysis are:

* Coated stainless steel canister
* End tidal air collector
* Tedlar bag

Each of these can be used as a vehicle for direct introduction of a gas sample into an appropriate analytical instrument, or serve as a reservoir of breath gas into which an absorption device such as an SPME fiber is placed to collect specific compounds.

==Analytical instruments==

Breath analysis can be done with various forms of mass spectrometry, but there are also simpler methods for specific purposes, such as the [[Halimeter]] and the [[breathalyzer]].

* Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [[GC-MS]]
* Gas chromatography-UV spectrometry [[GC-UV]]
* Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry [[PTR-MS]] and [[Time-of-flight mass spectrometry|PTR-TOF]]
* Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry [[SIFT-MS]]
* Ion mobility spectrometry [[Ion mobility spectrometry|IMS]]
* Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [[FTIR]]
* Laser spectrometry [[Spectroscopy]]
* [[Chemical sensors]] resp. [[Electronic nose]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30462">[[Bullying]] is [[abusive]] [[social interaction]] between peers can include [[aggression]], [[harassment]], and [[violence]]. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and [[emotional intelligence]]. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of [[emotion]] as it relates to one's self and others. [[John D. Mayer|Mayer]] et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.D., Roberts, R.D &amp; Barasade, S.G. (2008) Human abilities: Emotional intelligence. ''Annual Review of Psychology'', ''59'', 507-536. DOI: 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name=Tolegenova &gt;Tolegenova, A.A., Jakupov, S.M., Man Cheung Chung, Saduova, S. &amp; Jakupov, M.S (2012) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142 A theoretical formation of emotional intelligence and childhood trauma among adolescents.] “Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences”, 69, 1891-1894. International Conference on Education and Educational Psychology (ICEEPSY 2012). DOI: 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Mckenna, J. &amp; Webb, J. (2013) Emotional intelligence. British Journal of Occupational Therapy, 76(12), 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==

Bullying is the most prevalent form of [[school violence|violence in schools]] and has lasting consequences into adulthood.&lt;ref name=Domino&gt;Domino,  M. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/josh.12047/ Measuring the impact of an alternative approach to school bullying.] ''Journal of School Health'', ''83''(6), 430-437. DOI: 10.1111/josh.12047&lt;/ref&gt; Increased concern regarding [[school bullying]] has been raised in part due to publicized suicides of childhood victims.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;Turner, M. G., Exum, M. L., Brame, R. &amp; Holt, T. J. (2013) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2012.12.005 Bullying victimization and adolescent mental health: General and typological effects across sex.] ''Journal of Criminal Justice'', ''41''(1), 53-59. DOI: 10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2012.12.005&lt;/ref&gt; Around 40% of middle school children are directly involved in bullying at least once a week according to the National Center of Education Statistics.&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt; Pre-adolescent research confirms such a negative relationship between [[Emotional Intelligence#Trait Model|trait EI]]{{efn|There are three different models of Emotional Intelligence. The two main models are the Ability Model and the Trait Model, with a Mixed Model combining the two. The terms used for the dimensions are typically synonymous with those of the other models. The main difference is that the ability model conceives the traits as cognitive abilities, whereas the trait model conceives the traits as personal perceptions of those abilities/self-reported tendencies.&lt;ref name="Kokkinos"/&gt; The mixed model views the traits as capabilities; abilities that can be acquired and enhanced. In most papers where Trait EI is specified, the model is actually mixed.}} and bullying behavior; bullying behavior is negatively associated with  total [[empathy]] and more specifically, the EI dimension of cognitive empathy, which is the ability to understand or take on the emotional experiences and perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="Kokkinos"&gt;Kokkinos, C. M. &amp; Kipritsi, E. (2012) [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11218-011-9168-9 The relationship between bullying, victimization, trait emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and empathy among preadolescents.] ''Social Psychology of Education'', ''15''(1), 41-58. DOI:10.1007/s11218-011-9168-9&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that adolescent bullying peer relations are also significantly negatively correlated with the dimension of  EI that was conceptualized by Lomas et al. (2012) as Understanding the Emotions of Others.&lt;ref name=Lomas&gt;Lomas, J., Stough, C., Hansen, K. &amp; Downey, L. A. (2012) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.03.002 Brief report: Emotional intelligence, victimization and bullying in adolescents.] ''Journal of Adolescence'', ''35''(1), 207-211. DOI: 10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.03.002&lt;/ref&gt; While the term naming the dimension varies within the research, the dimension of EI that appears to have the strongest inverse relationship with enacting  bullying behavior throughout the literature is one’s ability to understand the emotional experience of other people. Because bullying behavior in school-aged children is related to lower levels of understanding of other’s emotions, one theory is that children who exhibit bullying behaviors are not able to fully understand the impact that they have on their victims.&lt;ref name=Lomas /&gt; Indeed, when differentiating between the different components of empathy, it is the cognitive component that bullies seem to have the most deficit in.&lt;ref name="Kokkinos"/&gt; In addition to the inability to relate to the emotions of others, research also suggests that those who engage in bullying behavior may also lack proper skills in dealing with their own emotions, another aspect of EI often referred to as emotional facilitation or [[self-efficacy]].&lt;ref name="Kokkinos"/&gt; The poor use of emotions is found to be significant in predicting problem behavior among adolescents, such as [[aggression]], which can be characteristic in bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Siu, A.F.Y. (2009) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2009.05.004 Trait emotional intelligence and its relationships with problem behavior in Hong Kong adolescents.] ''Personality and Individual Differences'', ''47''(6), 553-557. DOI: 10.1016/j.paid.2009.05.004&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the ability to understand and manage one’s own emotions may play an important role in preventing children from engaging in bullying behavior. For example, in a study among adolescent girls, it was found that better management of stress could prevent the perpetuation of aggression and violence.&lt;ref name=Polan&gt;Polan, J., Sieving, R., Pettingell, S., Bearinger, L. &amp; McMorris, B. (2012) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.10.216 Relationships between adolescent girls' social-emotional intelligence and their involvement in relational aggression and physical fighting.] ''Journal of Adolescent Health'', ''50''(2), S81-S82. DOI: 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2011.10.216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace==
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Workplace bullying is reported to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA&gt;Hutchinson, M. &amp; Hurley, J. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x/ Exploring leadership capability and emotional intelligence as moderators of workplace bullying.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 553-562. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x&lt;/ref&gt; For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the [[organizational structure]] and in pursuing [[goal]]s. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high [[social intelligence]] and low emotional intelligence.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB&gt;Hutchinson, M. (2013) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x/ Bullying as workgroup manipulation: a model for understanding patterns of victimization and contagion within the workgroup.] ''Journal of Nursing Management'', ''21'', 563-571. DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01390.x&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at [[Social influence|influencing]] others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behavior, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be [[persuaded]] to engage in unethical behavior.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalizes]] the behavior, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt; Hutchinson &amp; Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and [[leadership]] skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behavior among other members of the work team have been shown to have a significant impact on ethical behavior of nursing teams.&lt;ref&gt;Deshpande, S.P., &amp; Joseph, J. (2009)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-008-9779-z Impact of emotional intelligence, ethical climate, and behavior of peers on ethical behavior of nurses.] ''Journal of Business Ethics'', ''85''(3), 403-410.

DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2834.2012.01372.x&lt;/ref&gt; Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt; The [[self-awareness]] and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt;

==Theoretical contributions to the relationship==

===Malevolent creativity===
Given lower emotional intelligence, it is also possible that many bullies are more malevolently creative. When original, the acts of aggression and [[abuse]] found in both childhood and adult bullying are considered examples of malevolent creativity (MC).&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;Harris, D. J., Reiter-Palmon, R. &amp; Kaufman, J. C. (2013) [http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=a188ca7e-4f07-4ea3-8d51-a4817e15612f%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=126&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=2013-14374-001 The effect of emotional intelligence and task type on malevolent creativity.] ''Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts'', ''7''(3), 237-244. DOI: 10.1037/a0032139&lt;/ref&gt; Findings suggest that individuals lower in EI conceive more malevolently creative solutions, which theoretically leads to more malevolently creative behaviors.{{efn|EI predicted MC even after controlling for emotional and social context. There was a negative correlation between EI and MC in both study 1 (r{{=}}-.11, p{{=}} .076) and study 2 (r{{=}} -.24, p{{=}}.022); EI also had marginal significance in predicting the number of malevolently creative ideas after controlling for both cognitive ability and instructions (β{{= }}-.25, p{{=}}0.055).&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;  }} It is conjectured that people with lower emotional intelligence may not see the impropriety in malevolently creative ideas or disregard how others would perceive them, and thus they have less issue with disclosing such ideas.&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;  Given the hypothesis that more malevolently creative solutions should lead to more malevolently creative behaviors, this theory makes sense in light of the deficit in cognitive empathy found in bullying behavior.

===Callous and unemotional traits===
{{Main|Callous and unemotional traits}}
{{See also|Conduct disorder|Psychopathy}}
There may also be a subtype of bully that is high in callous and unemotional traits (CU). CU traits include some of the discussed deficits in EI such as lack of empathy, as well as other traits such as a lack of guilt, shallow capacity for emotion and poor behavioral modulation when faced with punishment.&lt;ref name=Viding &gt;Viding, E., Simmonds, E., Petrides, K.V., &amp; Frederickson, N. (2009) The contribution of callous-unemotional traits and conduct problems to bullying in early adolescence. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 50(4), 471-481. DOI: 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02012.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that children who bully often have conduct problems, and CU traits are often co-occurring with conduct problems, Viding et al., (2009)  investigated the relationship between CU and bullying behavior.  Given that previous research suggests children with conduct problems fall into subtypes of those with high CU traits and those without, it was possible that this creates a distinction among bullies.&lt;ref name=Viding /&gt;  Higher CU was independently correlated to direct bullying,{{efn| Direct forms of bullying are those that entail direct contact between the bully and victim, such as physical attack or verbal aggression. Indirect forms of bullying are those that involve other people and are more indirect, such as spreading rumors, or cyber-bullying. }} which is associated with lack of [[empathy]], while indirect bullying is not.&lt;ref name=Viding /&gt;   When combined with conduct problems, CU increased the risk of direct and indirect bullying behaviors. Bullies high in CU traits will probably be resistant to many of the interventions successful with bullies who are not.&lt;ref name=Viding /&gt; Although a defining characteristic of CU is a lack of empathy, which overlaps with bullies deficits in empathy as highlighted above, the other characteristics of the concept would make bullies high in CU less malleable than those who simply have lower EI.&lt;ref name=Viding /&gt;

==Victimization and emotional intelligence==
{{Main|Victimization}}
Being bullied can have a negative impact on the victim's life: Bullied children may go on to be maladjusted socially and emotionally, and worsen in behavior.&lt;ref name=Sapouna&gt;Sapouna, M. &amp; Wolke, D. (2013) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.05.009 Resilience to bullying victimization: The role of individual, family and peer characteristics.] ''Child Abuse &amp; Neglect'', ''37''(11), 997-1006. DOI: 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.05.009&lt;/ref&gt; Adults who are bullied in the workplace may have deteriorated [[self-esteem]], suffer from [[Social rejection|isolation]] and become fearful and avoidant after being victimized. They may disengage and withdraw from their work community.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt;  Both child and adult victims are at greater risk of developing mental pathology.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sapouna /&gt; EI is found to be a significant predictor of variance in adolescent [[peer victimization]] in bullying and also has a negative correlation with adolescent bullying.&lt;ref name=Lomas /&gt; Victim peer relations showed strong negative correlations with the emotional management and facilitation dimensions of EI conceptualized as Emotional Management and Control and Emotions Direct Cognitions respectively, both of which made significant semi-partial contributions to the overall model of Emotional Intelligence.&lt;ref name=Lomas /&gt; These results indicate that victims may have less ability to handle their emotions or to use them to make decisions in response. The inability to manage one’s own emotions can lead to rejection, or further rejection, from peers which can help perpetuate victimization and further damage a victim’s [[social skills]]; peer relationships and support are influential on emotional adjustment.&lt;ref name=Sapouna /&gt; In workplace bullying the workgroup’s [[Social rejection|rejection]] isolates the victim and causes [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[fear]], causing withdrawal from the group and reducing opportunities for social support.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonB /&gt;  In addition to self-efficacy, victimization is also found to be negatively correlated to cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Kokkinos" /&gt;

===Bully-victims===
There is a strong positive relationship between engaging in bullying behaviors and having been victimized by bullying behaviors.&lt;ref name="Kokkinos"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lomas /&gt; This is both a common finding in review of the research and is in tune with what is commonly observed during human adolescence; often victims of bullying go on to become bullies themselves. A history of victimization often leads to a perpetuation of similar behavior.&lt;ref name=Polan /&gt; Having low emotional intelligence increases the likelihood of being both a victim and a bully, which are apparently not mutually exclusive roles. This dual status is sometimes referred to as being a bully-victim. Bully-victims seem to be the most troubled. They tend to exhibit more emotional issues like low impulse control and self-esteem as well as social issues, such as the inability to interpret social cues or make friends.&lt;ref name=Wolke&gt;Wolke, D., Copeland, W. E., Angold, A. &amp; Costello, E. J. (2013) [http://pss.sagepub.com/content/24/10/1958 Impact of bullying in childhood on adult health, wealth, crime, and social outcomes.] ''Psychological Science'', ''24''(10), 1958-1970. DOI: 10.1177/0956797613481608&lt;/ref&gt; They may begin with pre-existing issues with behavior and emotion, and more often come from [[dysfunctional families]].&lt;ref name=Wolke /&gt;  Childhood bully-victims also fare worse in adulthood than 'pure' bullies or victims.&lt;ref name=Wolke /&gt; Across multiple areas, bully-victims had the greatest impairment in adult functioning and worse health outcomes including the diagnosis of a serious illness or psychiatric disorder.&lt;ref name=Wolke /&gt; Bully-victims had similarly poor outcomes in educational achievement as bullies and also shared similar likelihood to some of the measured risk behaviors, all status groups showed impairment in some categories like wealth attainment and social relationships.&lt;ref name=Wolke /&gt; When controlling for other factors pure bullies are no longer at an elevated risk across all these categories, which bullying is predictive of regardless of victim status, though bully-victims and victims remain at higher risk.&lt;ref name=Wolke /&gt; While some dimensions of EI seem more predictive of one status or the other (that of the bully or the victim), there are dimensions of EI, such as empathy and self-efficacy, that have significant negative relationships with both. Additionally, EI as a whole is significant in predicting for victim status.&lt;ref name=Lomas /&gt; Thus, victims may also be deficient in the dimensions of EI that correlate to becoming a bully, a risk that could be expected to be exacerbated by the damage to one's psycho-social health due to being a victim. Students who experience bullying often have a harder time adapting healthy relationships when they get older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/stats.asp|title=Bullying Statistics|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interventions==
[[File:Bullies.jpg|thumb]]
The most effective bullying interventions will likely be those that are dynamic and theory-driven in approach. Conventional intervention efforts have had small impact and mixed results in reducing bullying among children.&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt; These earlier models were based on descriptive data and focused on correcting the behavior of children who were already bullies or victims.&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt; Domino (2013) notes a theoretical shift from focus on deficit-based intervention to strength-based intervention.&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt;

Take The Lead (TTL) is a curriculum for middle school students combining [[social emotional learning]] (SEL) and [[positive youth development]] (PYD). SEL is a process of building social competence and emotional intelligence through a set of pertinent skills. PYD is a SEL program that uses social end emotional learning to promote healthy outcomes for the children by developing, then applying, the learned individual and group skills. Meta-analysis of 213 studies linked SEL to significant improvement in interpersonal relationships, [[social skills]], behavior issues, [[substance abuse]] and aggression.&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt; Positive contributions to the impact of SEL were found to be made by the development and application of social skills, [[social support]] and positive behavior [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt; Meta-analysis of 25 programs illustrated significant positive changes in [[interpersonal skills]], [[self-control]], problem-solving and both peer and adult relationships as a result of PYD as well as significant decrease in negative risk behaviors such as substance abuse, acts of aggression, [[truancy]] and [[risky sexual behavior]].&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt; The most important elements of PYD for positive outcomes in the analysis were incorporation of emotional intelligence and [[self-efficacy]], and the development of [[social norm|pro-social norms]]. Domino (2013) noted that prior research supported SEL and PYD being applied to youth risk behaviors and that their effectiveness was found to be positive and sustainable, however not much research had been done on a link between the constructs and reduction of bullying specifically. The study then investigates a model, TTL, that combines the SEL and PYD frameworks, strengthened by a social support system. TTL consists of 16 lessons, taught once a week for 16 weeks, during regular 45 minute class periods by teachers that are trained for a minimum of 6 hours.&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt;{{efn|The 16 lessons are:
&lt;small&gt;
#Self-assessment and Self-Awareness
#Building confidence and competence 
#Elements of communication
#Communication skills
#Interpersonal relations
#Developing social skills
#Developing social skills
#Identifying and managing emotions
#Identifying and managing emotions
#[[Assertiveness]]
#Exclusion, aggression, and other negative behaviors
#Exclusion, aggression, and other negative behaviors
#Responsible decision making
#Responsible decision making
#Problem solving
#Service-learning&lt;/small&gt;}}
The lessons are accompanied by a goal; for instance, the [[goal]] accompanying lesson 10 on Assertiveness is "Differentiate between assertive, passive, and aggressive communication styles, and practice [[assertive]] and empathic interrelating.".&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt;{{rp|432}} Every lesson includes knowledge, skill and application components so that students are able to practice the learned skills in their life outside of the classroom. A TTL training workshop is offered to the parents of participants and a letter is sent to the parents at the beginning of each segment with information about the lesson, goals and accompanying activities. Domino (2013) applied the TTL intervention to 7th grade students and measured changes in bullying and victim behavior using a quantitative pretest-posttest control group cohort design. Sum scores for bullying and victimization were obtained before and at the completion of the intervention using the PRQ, a self-report survey, completed anonymously.{{efn|Prior to beginning the curriculum bullying behavior scores were similar between the experimental and control group (p {{=}} .188). Using ANOVA, there was significant interaction between assessment point and group for bullying (F(1,321) {{=}} 45.17, p&lt;.001). There was a significant difference in mean sum scores for bullying (p&lt;.001) between group at posttest, with a significant decrease for the intervention group from 1.15 (1.47) to 0.68 (SD {{=}} 1.04) compared to the control group whose mean score increased to 1.98 (SD {{=}} 2.02). There was also significant interaction between assessment point and group for victimization (F(1,321) {{=}} 58.12, p&lt;.001) illustrated by ANOVA. At the outset of the study the intervention group had larger mean victimization scores (Mean {{=}} 2.48, SD {{=}} 2.55) than the control group (Mean {{=}} 1.41, SD {{=}} 1.94). At the post test, there was a significant difference in mean sum scores for victimization (p&lt;.001) between groups with a significant decrease in mean score for the intervention group from 2.48 (2.55) to 1.26 (1.80), while that of the control group increased from 1.41 (1.94) to 2.25 (2.40). When the former control group, that had an increase in bullying and victimization scores, received the intervention the following semester, there were similar decreases in bullying and victimization, and Repeated measures ANOVA illustrated significant differences in bullying (F(2,324) {{=}} 18.41, p&lt;.001)and victimization (F(2,324) {{=}} 21.83, p&lt;.001.). All results remained significant (p&lt;.001) when controlling for gender.&lt;ref name=Domino /&gt;}}

===Resilience===
{{Main|Psychological resilience}}
Beyond preventing bullying, it is also important to consider how interventions based on EI are important in the case that bullying will occur. Increasing EI may be an important step in trying to foster resilience among victims. When a person faces stress and adversity, especially of a repetitive nature, their ability to adapt is an important factor in whether they have a more positive or negative outcome.&lt;ref name=Brisa&gt;Monroy Cortés, B. G. &amp; Palacios Cruz, L. (2011) [http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=58220785008 Resiliencia: ¿Es posible medirla e influir en ella?] ''Salud Mental'', ''34''(3) 237-246. México: Instituto Nacional de Psiquiátrica Ramón de la Fuente Muñiz. {{ISSN|0185-3325}} [Spanish]&lt;/ref&gt; Resilient individuals are those who are considered to have positive developmental outcomes in light of their negative experiences, such as bullying.&lt;ref name=Sapouna /&gt; Sapouna &amp; Wolke (2013) examined adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being negatively associated with resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills as a form of intervention.&lt;ref name=Sapouna /&gt; Emotional Intelligence has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, T. R., Lyons, J. B. &amp; Khazon, S. (2013) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2013.07.460 Emotional intelligence and resilience.] ''Personality and Individual Differences'', ''55''(8), 909-914. DOI: 10.1016/j.paid.2013.07.460&lt;/ref&gt; and  as mentioned  previously the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can be preventative of a victim going on to perpetuate aggression.&lt;ref name=Polan /&gt; One factor that is important in resilience is the regulation of one's own emotions.&lt;ref name=Brisa /&gt; Schneider et al. (2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.&lt;ref name=Schneider /&gt;

'''''Caveman Principles''''' is a book by [[Carl Rosier-Jones]]. It was published in the UK by [[Filament Publishing]] of London in November 2015. The book was designed and written to deliver a different look at stress in a simple and humorous format.

There are currently 3 Principles, all of which are based on the fact that we are evolved Cavemen. Carl's theories are based on the fact that stress is a result of a natural human response. Concentrating on the [[fight-or-flight|fight or flight principles]], he surmises that this once life saving response is now a debilitating condition that cause us the daily stress of today. He uses theories as far back as [[Socrates]] to describe his communication tool, The Caveman Tribal sorter, [[personality-psychology|personality profiling]].

His principles are:

1st principle - is that everyone has a stress mammoth.

2nd principle - is that communication is key.

3rd principle - is that personal change is always needed.

The use of characters and the simplicity in the writing of the book has meant that it is being implemented into schools and teaching methods across the UK.

'''Conceptual Design''' is an early phase of the design process, in which the broad outlines of function and form of something are articulated. It includes the design of interactions, experiences, processes and strategies. It involves an understanding of people's needs - and how to meet them with products, services, &amp; processes. Common artifacts of conceptual design are concept sketches and models.

[[Image:Corpod'aria.jpg|thumb|260px|"Corpo d'Aria", 1960.]]
'''''Corpo d'aria''''' ("Body of Air"; plural ''Corpi d'aria'') is an [[artist's multiple]] by the Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]]. Manufactured between October 1959 and March 1960, the pieces are a box, a tripod base, a deflated balloon and a mouthpiece. 45 copies were made and sold at 30,000 [[Italian lira|lire]] each.  Originally, any buyer could ask Manzoni to inflate the balloon himself, but would be charged an extra [[Deutschmark]] for every litre of air expanded. When fully expanded, the balloons measured 80&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné, Battino &amp; Palazzoli&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public presentation==
The ''Corpi d'aria'' were first exhibited at the Galleria Azimut, run by Manzoni and his friend, the Italian artist Enrico Castellani, from May 3 to May 9, 1960. Manzoni organised an elaborate photo shoot  and a short film to publicise the event. He was to write later in the year that the bodies had sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Heinz Mack, quoted in ''Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale'', vol 1, Celant, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

By making a purely transient work, that would deflate before the buyer’s eyes, Manzoni was parodying the traditional sculptural emphasis on permanence and mocking the traditional emphasis on the artist’s creative force. He was also using modern materials to suggest an aggressively modern aesthetic whilst creating a poetic metaphor for the transience of life itself.

== Related works==

===''Fiato d’artista''===

The most famous related work is the ''Fiato d’artista'' (''Artist’s Breath''), involving red, blue or white balloons inflated by Manzoni himself, closed with string and lead, with the name "Piero Manzoni" punched into it, then attached to a wooden base with a plaque on it using [[gesso]]. The pieces were made in 1960, and 11 examples are known to have survived, although all are now in an extreme state of decomposure. When exhibited now, the works inevitably assume the aura of a modern [[memento mori]],&lt;ref&gt;''Manzoni at the Serpentine Gallery'', London, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a rotting plastic membrane stuck to a polished wooden base, with a brass plaque commemorating the original act.

===Placentarium===
The largest variation on the theme was a giant double-skinned Placentarium, filled with compressed air to keep the balloon inflated. Manzoni designed especially for the projection of [[Otto Piene]]'s ''Light Ballets'', but also referred to the building housing a giant maze, made up of 60 cells controlled by "an electric brain".&lt;ref&gt;"Placentarium" typescript published in ''Piero Manzoni, Catalogo Generale'', Celant, Prearo Editions&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with 73 alcoves for viewers, the Placentarium was intended to be silver on the outside and white internally. Designs and a photograph of a small architectural model survive.&lt;ref&gt;''Manzoni'', Celant, Electa 2007 pp. 242-245&lt;/ref&gt;

Manzoni simultaneously planned a series of public sculptures, of balloons 2.5&amp;nbsp;m diameter, to be installed in parks. These were to be fitted with air compressor to slowly pulsate ‘with a slow unsynchronized rhythm of breathing.’ He never took this idea further than a small experimental version.

The final experiment was for a sphere held suspended by a jet of air. Again, this never advanced beyond a small experimental [[maquette]], but emphasises Manzoni’s conception of balloons representing freedom and weightlessness.

Manzoni is known to have been heavily influenced by [[Yves Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p82&lt;/ref&gt; who had released 1001 blue balloons on the opening night of his "Proposition: Monochrome" exhibition at [[Iris Clert]]’s gallery, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Weitemeier, Taschen 2001, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andy Warhol]] would later use balloons in a similar way, but filled with helium rather than suspended in a stream of compressed air. Indeed, his first balloon, made in 1965, corresponded to an unfulfilled project described by Manzoni in a letter as ‘a cluster of pneumatic cylinders, elongated in shape, like steel, which would vibrate in the blowing of the wind.’&lt;ref&gt;''Paintings &amp; Sculptures, The Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonne'' 02B, Phaidon, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damien Hirst]] has used ping pong balls suspended in compressed air, but within the context of floating above a bed of sharp knives or a skeleton.

His most lasting influence, however, was on [[Arte Povera]], a group of Italian artists, including [[Luciano Fabro]] and [[Alighiero e Boetti]], who brought everyday materials into their work in a movement analogous to contemporary radical politics. (see [[Protests of 1968]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10454 MoMA.org | The Collection | Arte Povera&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seal of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.svg|right|150px|Official seal of the USPTO]]
The '''doctrine of foreign equivalents''' is a rule applied in [[United States trademark law]] which requires courts and the [[TTAB]] to translate foreign words in determining whether they are registrable as trademarks, or confusingly similar with existing marks. The doctrine is intended to protect consumers within the United States from confusion or deception caused by the use of terms in different languages. In some cases, a party will use a word as a mark which is either [[genericness|generic]] or [[descriptiveness|merely descriptive]] of the goods in a foreign language, or which shares the same meaning as an existing mark to speakers of that foreign language.

==Test applied==
The [[Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure]] ("TMEP") states the test for applying the doctrine of foreign equivalents is "whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent".&lt;ref&gt;TMEP § 1207.01(b)(vi)&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to descriptive or generic marks, the TMEP specifies that in determining whether a foreign term is entitled to registration, "[t]he test is whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would have a descriptive or generic connotation".&lt;ref&gt;TMEP § 1209.03(g)&lt;/ref&gt; However, "foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes." This test is also applied by courts to determine "whether that foreign word would be descriptive of the product to that segment of the purchasing public which is familiar with that language."&lt;ref&gt;''Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple'', 747 F.2d 1522, 1531 (4th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear whether the test differs for asserted cases of [[likelihood of confusion]]. The Federal Circuit has recently clarified the applicability of the doctrine of foreign equivalents in likelihood of confusion cases, stating that "When it is unlikely that an American buyer will translate the foreign mark and will take it as it is, then the doctrine of foreign equivalents will not be applied".&lt;ref name="Palm Bay"&gt;''[[Palm Bay Imports, Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772]]'', 396 F.3d 1369, 1377 ([[Fed. Cir.]] 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted that "the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not an absolute rule and should be viewed merely as a guideline".&lt;ref name="Palm Bay"/&gt; Instead "[t]he doctrine should be applied only when it is likely that the ordinary American purchaser would "stop and translate [the word] into its English equivalent".&lt;ref&gt;''Palm Bay Imports'', citing In re Pan Tex Hotel Corp.'', 190 U.S.P.Q. 109, 110 (T.T.A.B. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Circuit specifically found that "it is improbable that the average American purchaser would stop and translate '[[wikt:veuve|VEUVE]]' into '[[widow]]'".&lt;ref&gt;''See also Popular Bank v. Banco Popular'', 9 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1359 (S.D. Fla. 1998) (finding a likelihood of confusion between the marks, and noting that "[g]iven large number of people fluent in Spanish in the South Florida area, the Spanish translation is likely to be recognized as the equivalent by South Florida consumers").&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Palm Bay Imports'' case suggests that it is the same test stating "[u]nder the doctrine of foreign equivalents, foreign words from common languages are translated into English to determine genericness, descriptiveness, as well as similarity of connotation in order to ascertain confusing similarity with English word marks."&lt;ref name="Palm Bay"/&gt;

=== The Ordinary American Purchaser ===
As noted above, in [[Palm Bay Imports, Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772|Palm Bay]], the Federal Circuit held that the doctrine of foreign equivalents only applies when the "ordinary American purchaser" is likely to translate the foreign mark
into English.&lt;ref name="Palm Bay"/&gt;  A short time after ''Palm Bay'' was decided, the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board|T.T.A.B.]] interpreted "ordinary American purchaser" in ''In re Thomas'' and held that the ordinary American purchaser includes only purchasers "familiar with the foreign language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-78334625-EXA-12.pdf In re Thomas], 9 U.S.P.Q.2d 1021, 1024 (T.T.A.B. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  This narrow definition of "ordinary American purchaser" effectively guaranteed that the doctrine would be applied in nearly every case involving a foreign word since "those proficient in a non-English language . . . would ordinarily be expected to translate words into English."&lt;ref name="In re Spirits Int’l, N.V"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13767240001087520782 In re Spirits Int’l, N.V.], 563 F.3d 1347, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

At its next opportunity, however, the Federal Circuit abrogated ''Thomas'' in part.  In [[In re Spirits International]], a geographic deceptiveness&lt;ref&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/1200.htm#_T121001b TMEP 1210.01(b); 1210.01(c)]&lt;/ref&gt; case, the Federal Circuit held that the ordinary American purchaser "''includes all American purchasers'', including those proficient in a non-English language."&lt;ref name="In re Spirits Int’l, N.V"/&gt;

However, because the ''Spirits'' court limited its ruling to the doctrine's application with respect to the geographic deceptiveness bar,&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13767240001087520782 In re Spirits Int’l, N.V.], 563 F.3d 1347, 1356 n.5 (Fed. Cir.
2009)&lt;/ref&gt; the Board currently applies the ''Spirits'' definition of ordinary American purchaser in cases of geographic deceptiveness refusals and the ''Thomas'' definition to all other bars.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Krimnus, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1734567 The Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents at Death's Door], 12 N.C. J.L. &amp; Tech. 159, 185-87 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of words in foreign countries==
Cases have noted that the status accorded to words in foreign countries has no bearing on the registration of marks in the U.S. For example, in ''Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co.]]'', 750 F.2d 631, 641-42 (8th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; the court rejected as irrelevant the generic usage of the phrase "L.A. beer" in Australia for low alcohol beer. In ''Seiko Sporting Goods USA, Inc. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Hattori Tokeiten'',&lt;ref&gt;''''Seiko Sporting Goods USA, Inc. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Hattori Tokeiten'', 545 F. Supp. 221, 226 (S.D.N.Y. 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; the court stated that "[w]hile plaintiff has sought to show that Seiko is a generic term in Japanese, it is not so recognized in this country. Accordingly, the mark must still be regarded as arbitrary and fanciful in the United States."

Furthermore, "[a] number of cases hold that a term may be generic in one country and suggestive in another".&lt;ref&gt;''Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co.'', 750 F.2d 631, 642 (8th Cir. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc.'', 205 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 1075 (E.D. Cal. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; a court rejected as irrelevant the generic use of the term "Greengrocer" in Britain for a retailer of fruit. The defendant argued that the trademark "Greengrocer", which is a generic term in Britain for a retailer of fruits and vegetables, was not entitled to protection as a trademark in the United States. The court rejected this argument on the ground that it is irrelevant how a term is used outside the United States: "The parties agree that the term is generic in Britain. Since we deal here with American trademark law, and thus American consumers, neither British usage nor the dictionary definition indicating such usage are determinative."

==Dead and obscure languages==
TMEP § 1209.03(g) expresses the caveat that "foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes." Emphasis added.  "Descriptiveness is evaluated according to 'that segment of the purchasing public which is familiar with that language.'" General Cigar Co. v. G.D.M. Inc., 988 F. Supp. 647, 660 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (quoting 1 McCarthy § 11.14, p.&amp;nbsp;464-65). In that case, the court found that the strength of the Cohiba mark was not diminished by the fact that Cohiba is the Taino Indian word for tobacco, because the Taino language was an obscure language. The court noted:

{{quote|A word which is not in general or common use, and is unintelligible and non-descriptive to the general public, although it may be known to linguists and scientist, may be properly regarded as arbitrary and fanciful and capable of being used as a trademark or trade-name.&lt;ref&gt;''General Cigar'', 988 F. Supp. at 660 (''quoting Le Blume Import co. v. Coty'', 293 F. 344, 358 (2d Cir. 1923)).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, cases exist where trademark registration has been rejected for a word that was generic or descriptive when translated from a language such as [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek]].

==Transliterations versus translations==
Where a word is a foreign [[transliteration]] of an English mark, the TTAB has held that there is nothing to translate, and the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not invoked. In ''Green Spot (Thailand) Ltd. v. Vitasoy Int'l Holdings Ltd.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Green Spot (Thailand) Ltd. v. Vitasoy Int'l Holdings Ltd.'' Opposition No. 91165010 (February 21, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; the TTAB considered the application of the doctrine where Green Spot sought to register "Vitamilk", and was opposed by Vitasoy, which was the owner of a senior registration. Green Spot also owned a mark in Chinese characters for which the first sets of characters were transliterations of "vi" and "ta" with no meaning in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], while the third, 奶 (nai) was the Chinese word for "[[milk]]". Green Spot argued that its senior Chinese character mark was the equivalent of Vitamilk, and that Green Spot's ownership of the senior mark gave it the right to own the equivalent English mark. The TTAB refused to apply the doctrine of foreign equivalents, because the transliterations of "vi" and "ta" had no actual translation from Chinese to English.

== Criticism ==
The doctrine has been criticized in recent years.  Commentators have noted that courts have "reached irreconcilable holdings" in applying the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth J. Rest, [http://home.comcast.net/%7Ejlw28129/Foreign_Equivalents.pdf Lost in Translation: A Critical Examination of Conflicting Decisions Applying the Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents], 96 Trademark Rep. 1211 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that the doctrine be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Krimnus, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1734567 The Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents at Death's Door], 12 N.C. J.L. &amp; Tech. 159 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''eastern elk''' (''Cervus canadensis canadensis'') was a [[subspecies]] or distinct population of [[elk]] that inhabited the northern and eastern [[United States]], and southern [[Canada]]. The last eastern elk was shot in [[Pennsylvania]] on September 1, 1877.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enlighteneng.net/foolsfate/2008_07.htm "Foolsfate Almanac"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/wrcf/Keynotes/spring02/history.htm "Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The subspecies was declared [[extinction|extinct]] by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/lists/extinct.html "US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service: Endangered Species Program"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another subspecies of [[elk]], the [[Merriam's elk]], also became extinct at roughly the same time.

As of 2017, the IUCN has reclassified all North American elk subspecies aside from the [[Tule elk|tule]] and [[Roosevelt elk|Roosevelt]] elk as ''C. c. canadensis''. If this is accurate, this means that the subspecies has returned to the eastern US as the [[Rocky Mountain elk]] reintroduced to the region since the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/55997823/0|title=Cervus canadensis (Alashan Wapiti, Izubra/Manchurian Wapiti, McNeill's Deer, Merriam's Wapiti, Shou, Siberian Wapiti, Tien Shan Wapiti, Tule Elk, Wapiti)|website=www.iucnredlist.org|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The eastern elk was larger than its western cousins.  A full-grown bull could weigh up to 1000 pounds, stand 50-60&amp;nbsp;inches tall at the shoulder, and carry a rack of antlers six feet in length.

==History==
By the late 15th century, elk were the most widespread in the [[New World]] and could be found throughout most of [[North America]]. Eastern elk inhabited the vast forests of eastern Canada and the eastern United States as far west as the [[Mississippi River]]. As people continued to settle in the region over the next few centuries, elk populations decreased due to [[Hunting|over-hunting]] and the loss of their dense [[woodland]] [[habitat]]. Naturalist [[John James Audubon]] reportedly mentioned that by 1851 a few elk could still be found in the [[Allegheny Mountains]] but that they were virtually gone from the remainder of their range. By the end of the 19th century the Eastern elk was completely extinct. What little is known about this race of elk has been gleaned from remains and historical references. Mitochondrial DNA studies in 2004 indicate that ''Cervus canadensis'' are a species distinct from European red deer.

==Replacement in their former range==
Not long after the last elk was killed in Pennsylvania, federal officials, worried about mushrooming elk herds in and around [[Yellowstone National Park]], offered the animals to anyone willing to take them. The recently formed [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]] took Yellowstone officials up on their offer, and launched a program to reintroduce elk to Pennsylvania. Starting in 1913 and ending in 1926, the Commission released 177 elk in 10 counties, including 50 animals from Yellowstone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/wrcf/Keynotes/spring02/history.htm "Elk in PA today more likely to be shot by camera than gun"]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Pennsylvania's elk herd numbers more than 800 and their range covers approximately 800 square miles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitpago.com/outdoors/elkherd.html "Northwest Pennsylvania's Great Outdoors Majestic Elk Herd"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgc.state.pa.us/pgc/cwp/view.asp?a=471&amp;q=151455 "History of Pennsylvania Elk"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] were conducted to determine if wild, free-ranging elk still had a place in some of their former eastern haunts.  Once this was complete, healthy source herds of [[Rocky Mountain elk]] from [[Arizona]], [[Kansas]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]] and [[Alberta]]’s [[Elk Island National Park]] were used to introduce elk back into the former eastern elk range.

Successful elk populations have now been introduced in [[Arkansas]] (1991),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centuryinter.net/nacent/ozark/elk.html "Elk in Arkansas"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wisconsin]] (1995), [[Ontario]] (2001), [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] in 2002, the area known as [[Northern Michigan]], the [[Missouri]] [[Ozarks]] (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mdc.mo.gov/newsroom/elk-return-missouri-after-150-year-absence|title=Elk return to Missouri after 150-year absence {{!}} Missouri Department of Conservation|website=mdc.mo.gov|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in 2012 [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Mark|title=Elk begin road to recovery in Virginia|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/309033|accessdate=2012-05-20|newspaper=The Roanoke Times|date=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2016, elk were reintroduced into southern [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wvmetronews.com/2016/12/19/the-elk-are-finally-back-in-west-virginias-hills/|title=WV MetroNews  – The elk are finally back in West Virginia's hills|website=wvmetronews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, feasibility studies have also been completed in [[Illinois]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] (although these have not yet resulted in any elk restorations).

==Remnant populations==
There may be more remaining of the eastern elk than old skeletons. In 1905, 18 elk were introduced to [[Fiordland National Park]] in [[New Zealand]]—a gift from [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. The elk were survivors of an original shipment of 20, half of which came from [[Yellowstone National Park]] and half from an Indian [[game reserve]] in [[Brookfield, Massachusetts]], owned by H.E. Richardson. The latter are believed to be eastern elk captured in northern Minnesota by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The possible eastern elk bloodline might explain some unusual [[wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s he has seen in New Zealand elk, such as "bifurcated" [[antler]]s in which the dagger, or fourth point, forks at the tip.&lt;ref name="Eastern Elk: Are They Really Extinct?"&gt;[http://www.pigeonrivercountryforest.org/articles/article3.htm "Eastern Elk: Are They Really Extinct?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the likelihood of a pure [[Heredity|bloodline]] is very low. Even though the animal population had successfully adapted to the harsh terrain, several factors likely contributed to a [[dilution gene|dilution]] of the pure [[gene pool]]. To wit, removal of protection in 1935; the [[crossbreeding]] with [[red deer]] that spread into the area; the [[gazette|gazetting]] of the [[Fiordland]] region as a [[national park]] in 1952; and the resulting status of the elk and all introduced [[Game (food)|game species]] being relegated to that of [[:wikt:noxious|noxious]] animals, or pests, by the government agencies of the time has seen the wild herd go into decline. Today, that herd is but a shadow of its former self, being comprised now only of crossbreeds of varying degree that have defied the efforts of
government agencies to [[wikt:kill|exterminate]] or remove them from Fiordland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elkwapitisociety.co.nz/4.htm/ "History of New Zealand Elk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern elk could have also hung on in the extensive forests of [[Ontario]]. While evidence is sketchy, numerous people reported seeing a band of elk near [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] in the early 1980s. These elk could be of eastern origin—and could still exist in the wilds of Ontario.&lt;ref name="Eastern Elk: Are They Really Extinct?" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23435">The '''effects of advertising on body image''' have been studied by researchers, ranging from psychologists to marketing professionals.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Posavac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bristol"/&gt; "These days we know that the media and body image are closely related. Particularly, the body image advertising portrays affects our own body image. Of course, there are many other things that influence our body image: parenting, education, intimate relationships, and so on. The popular media does have a big impact, though"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirror-mirror.org/the-media-and-body-image.htm#sthash.bAakNi10.dpuf The Media and Body Image]. Mirror-mirror.org (2013-01-24). Retrieved on 2016-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is because thousands of [[advertisements]] contain messages about [[physical attractiveness]] and [[beauty]], examples of which include commercials for clothes, cosmetics, weight reduction, and physical fitness.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt; Researchers have conducted studies in an attempt to see if such advertisements have effects on teenage [[body image]], and what those effects might be.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00913367.1997.10673520|jstor=4189031|title=Stuck in the Model Trap: The Effects of Beautiful Models in Ads on Female Pre-Adolescents and Adolescents|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=26|issue=2|pages=19|year=1997|last1=Martin|first1=Mary C.|last2=Gentry|first2=James W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers, such as Mary Martin and James Gentry, have found that teen advertising reduces teenagers' [[self-esteem]] by setting unrealistic expectations for them about their physical appearances through the use of idealized models.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Other researchers, such as Heidi Posavac, acknowledge this, but believe that this only applies to teenagers who already possess low self-esteem or a poor self-images.&lt;ref name="Posavac"/&gt;

In contrast, researchers, including Terry Bristol, have found teenagers to be generally unaffected by these advertisements due to the idea that repeat exposure can create an immunity to images and messages in advertisements.&lt;ref name="Bristol"/&gt; Moreover, some researchers, such as Paul Humphreys, have concluded that exposure to such advertisements can actually create higher self-esteem in teenagers.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyers"/&gt;

== Background ==
According to Medimark Research Inc., a [[marketing research]] company, teenagers are important to [[marketers]] because they "have significant discretionary income; spend family money, as well as influence their parents' spending on both large and small household purchases; establish and affect [[fashion]], lifestyle, and overall [[Fad|trends]]; and provide a 'window' into our society&amp;nbsp;– a view of how it is now and what it is likely to become."&lt;ref name="Mediamark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080701042344/http://www.magazine.org/content/files/teenprofile04.pdf Teen Market Profile]. magazine.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost half of the space of the most popular magazines for adolescent girls is made up of advertisements.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; In an effort to further reach young men with advertisements, branded content is now being included in video games as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/26214/ |title=MediaPost Publications Targeting Young Males |publisher=Mediapost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researches are trying to determine whether or not these advertisements shape the body image and self-esteem of the teenagers that view them.

==Bad effect==
===Effect on society===
The way beauty is portrayed in the media tends to cause dissatisfaction and negative thoughts about oneself when those results are not achieved. Sociocultural standards of feminine beauty are presented in almost all forms of popular media are bombarding women with these unrealistic images that portray what is considered to be the "ideal body" within this society. Such standards of beauty are unattainable for most women; The majority of the models displayed on television and in advertisements are well below what is considered healthy body weight. Mass media's use of such unrealistic models sends an implicit message that in order for a woman to be considered beautiful, she must be unhealthy. The mindset that a person can never be "too rich or too thin" is prevalent in society, and this makes it difficult for females to achieve any level of contentment with their physical appearance. There has been a plethora of research to indicate that women are negatively affected by constant exposure to models that fulfill the unrealistic media ideal of beauty.

Naomi Wolf's ''The Beauty Myth'' noted the beginning of feminist critiques of societal standards regarding female beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, J., &amp; White, L. (2012). ''Women, Politics, and Public Policy''. Oxford University Press. pp. 240–245.&lt;/ref&gt; This "feminine ideal" is the goal of most women in society, although feminists have been working for decades on eradicating this idea (Brownmiller, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, S. (1975). ''Against our Will: Men, women and rape.'' New York: Simon and Schuster. ''Feminity.'' New York: Fawcett Columbine.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first feminist mass meeting in 1914 included demands such as the 'right to ignore fashion' and the 'right not to have to wear make up'. (Bordo, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, S. (1990). "Feminism, postmodernism, and gender-scepticism", pp. 133–56 In Linda J. Nicholson (Ed.) ''Feminism/postmodernism'' . New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; unfortunately these demands have not yet been fulfilled as women in today's society still feel the need to dress in a particular way and to wear makeup to feel beautiful and attractive to the opposite gender and within today's society.

However, these efforts to erase the 'ideal body image' are opposed by modern reality TV shows that encourage such behaviour. ''Extreme Makeover'' puts individuals through extreme physical changes to change the way they look, which is then viewed by women of all ages. This tends to encourage people to think about their image, and change what they do not like in an unsafe manner. ''The Swan'' (2004) went one step further, and had the contestants compete in a beauty contest following their various reconstructive surgeries. These types of TV shows tend to teach women that it is okay to change their image to fit the "feminine ideal", instead of encouraging them to accept the body that they already have.

Rice (1994) states that 'a woman's essential value is based on her ability to attain a thin body size'. Therefore while women continue to diet, they still dislike their bodies. Another statistic, stated by the Media Awareness Network, is that the average model weighed 8 percent less than the average women twenty years ago, compared to models weighing 23 percent less today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rice | first1 = C | year = 1994 | title = Out from under occupation: Transforming our relationships with our bodies. | journal = Canadian Woman Studies | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 44–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on young women ===
A study by A. Chris Downs and Sheila Harrison from ''[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]]'' found that one out of every 3.8 television [[commercials]] has a message about attractiveness in it. They determined that viewers receive roughly 5,260 advertisements related to attractiveness per year (or at least 14 per day). Of these messages, 1,850 of them are specifically about beauty.&lt;ref name="Downs"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00287457|title=Embarrassing age spots or just plain ugly? Physical attractiveness stereotyping as an instrument of sexism on american television commercials|journal=Sex Roles|volume=13|pages=9|year=1985|last1=Downs|first1=A. Chris|last2=Harrison|first2=Sheila K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study published in the ''[[Journal of Advertising]]'', Marketing professors Mary Martin and James Gentry noted that images of [[blonde]], thin women are predominant in mass media, and that these characteristics are often portrayed as being ideal.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Martin and Gentry also found that advertising can "impose a sense of inadequacy on young women's self-concepts". This is because girls and young women tend to compare their own physical attractiveness to the physical attractiveness of models in advertisements. They then experience lowered [[self-esteem]] if they do not feel that they look like the models in advertisements.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

Today's models weigh 23 percent less than the average woman, while the average model two decades ago weighed eight percent less than the average woman. This currently prevalent media ideal of thinness is met by only about five percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirc.org/publik/mirror.html |title=Mirror, mirror&amp;nbsp;– A summary of research findings on body image |publisher=Sirc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a study of ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen magazine]]'' concluded that the models featured in this popular teen magazine were far less curvy than those portrayed in women's magazines. It was also noted that the hip-to-waist ratio had decreased in these models from 1970 to 1990.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

In a study published in ''Sex Roles'', psychologists Heidi Posavac, Steven Posavac, and Emil Posavac found that many young women will express dissatisfaction with their bodies, particularly with their [[body weight]], when they are exposed to images of thin models who are slimmer than the average woman.&lt;ref name="Posavac"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Posavac, Heidi D., Posavac, Steven S., and Posavac, Emil J. |journal=Sex Roles|volume=38|issue=3/4|pages=187|doi=10.1023/A:1018729015490|year=1998|title=Exposure to Media Images of Female Attractiveness and Concern with Body Weight Among Young Women}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early researchers in the area of sex roles in the mass media examined a large number of ads at a time in order to classify and count particular types of representation (Rakow 1986).

Expressing similar sentiments, an aspiring young model was quoted as saying, "Deep down I still want to be a [[supermodel]]... As long as they're there, screaming at me from the television, glaring at me from the magazines, I'm stuck in the model trap. Hate them first. Then grow to like them. Love them. Emulate them. Die to be them. All the while praying the cycle will come to an end."&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

Academic researchers Philip Myers Jr. and Frank Biocca concluded, in their study published in the ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', that a woman's self-perceived body image can change after watching a half-an-hour of television programming and advertising.&lt;ref name="Meyers"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00802.x|url=http://www.mindlab.org/images/d/DOC828.pdf|title=The Elastic Body Image: The Effect of Television Advertising and Programming on Body Image Distortions in Young Women|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=42|issue=3|pages=108|year=1992|last1=Myers|first1=Philip N.|last2=Biocca|first2=Frank A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Yoku Yamamiya and Thomas F. Cash concluded through their study that "Even a 5 minute exposure to thin-and-beautiful media images results in a more negative body image state than does exposure to images of neutral object."&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2004.11.001|pmid=18089176|title=Women's exposure to thin-and-beautiful media images: Body image effects of media-ideal internalization and impact-reduction interventions|journal=Body Image|volume=2|issue=1|pages=74–80|year=2005|last1=Yamamiya|first1=Yuko|last2=Cash|first2=Thomas F.|last3=Melnyk|first3=Susan E.|last4=Posavac|first4=Heidi D.|last5=Posavac|first5=Steven S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, a study by Stice et al. in the ''[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]]'' concluded that there is a direct relationship between the amount of media exposure that a young woman has and the likelihood that she will develop [[eating disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://athena.uwindsor.ca/users/j/jarry/main.nsf/032ecd0df8f83bdf8525699900571a93/aa9ed943e56182bf85256abe005bc3f6/$FILE/Stice%20et%20al%20%281994%29.pdf|pmid=7822589|year=1994|author1=Stice|first1=E|title=Relation of media exposure to eating disorder symptomatology: An examination of mediating mechanisms|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=103|issue=4|pages=836–40|last2=Schupak-Neuberg|first2=E|last3=Shaw|first3=H. E.|last4=Stein|first4=R. I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin and Gentry also found that the mass media "creates and reinforces a preoccupation with physical attractiveness in young women", which can lead to [[bulimia]], [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], and opting for [[cosmetic surgery]]. She also concluded that, "exposure to ultra-thin models in advertisements and magazine pictures produced [[Depression (mood)|depression]], stress, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[shame]], insecurity, and body dissatisfaction in female college students".&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

In a study published in the ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence'', Paxton et al. found body dissatisfaction to be more prevalent in young women than in young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01537402|pmid=24265063|title=Body image satisfaction, dieting beliefs, and weight loss behaviors in adolescent girls and boys|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=20|issue=3|pages=361|year=1991|last1=Paxton|first1=Susan J.|last2=Wertheim|first2=Eleanor H.|last3=Gibbons|first3=Kay|last4=Szmukler|first4=George I.|last5=Hillier|first5=Lynne|last6=Petrovich|first6=Janice L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low self-esteem that stems from teenage advertising can have detrimental effects on teenagers. Seventy-five percent of young women with low self-esteem report engaging in negative activities such as "cutting, [[bullying]], [[smoking]], or drinking when feeling badly about themselves".

Teen [[promiscuity]] is another possible effect of low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="do"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-teens-and-self-esteem |title=11 Facts about Teens and Self-Esteem |publisher=Do Something |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129140950/http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-teens-and-self-esteem |archivedate=2011-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People fail to recognize that photo-shop is widely used on models in magazines and in advertisements which gives an unrealistic expectation. An online survey in 2010 consisting of 100 girls aged 13–17 was conducted by Girl Scouts.  What they found was that 9 out of 10 girls felt pressure by fashion and media industries to be skinny. More than 60% compared themselves to fashion models, and 46% believed that the ideal body image is portrayed in fashion magazines and refer to the girls in the magazines as who they strive to look like.

Unfortunately thin-idealized bodies are attributed with self control, success and discipline, and therefore proclaimed as being desirable and socially valued. “Being slim means resisting the temptations that surround consumers in countries of overabundance and wealth” (Thompson et al 1995: Halliwell et al 2004).

=== Effects on young men ===
It is more prevalent that young men are more self-conscious and are showing great concern to their bodies. This indicates a huge awareness of both self-appearance and importance to the body itself. In other words, young men tend to be worried about their figure just like young women are. This is present due to the media and the messages it commonly portrays; these messages are mostly targeted toward a younger age group which shows how media has influenced these age groups. 
According to an online article, it states that "The male body in the media has an impact on how males, especially developing males, perceive their own bodies," said Brennan. "Males are being exposed to the same extreme ideals of body perfection as females."

A study published in ''[[JAMA Pediatrics]]'' in January shows concerns about physique and muscularity in particular, among young males are "relatively common". The researchers said approximately 18 percent of participants in their study (which included 5,527 males) were "extremely concerned for their weight and researchers found 7.6 percent of young males were "very concerned about muscularity" and were using techniques that could be harmful to obtain an ideal body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://national.deseretnews.com/article/1483/Extreme-body-image-in-media-impacts-males-too.html#MKwwqJRx6ZlEuCtu.99|title=Extreme body image in media impacts males too|work=Deseret News|author= Polatis, Kandra |date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by insurer Blue Cross Blue shield found that in 1999 to 2000, use of steroids and similar drugs amongst boys ages 12 to 17 jumped 25 percent, with 20 percent saying they use the drug for looks rather than sports.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhauer, Lisa. "Do I Look OK?." St. Louis Post-Dispatch (St. Louis, MO). Nov. 7 2005: HF1+. SIRS Researcher. Web. 25 Oct 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, men in advertisements are more [[muscular]] today than they were 25 to 30 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/973-men-muscle-body-image-problems.html |title=Men Muscle in on Body Image Problems |publisher=LiveScience |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study found that male college students who are exposed to advertisements featuring muscular men show a significant "discrepancy between their own perceived muscularity and the level of muscularity that they ideally wanted to have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/eat.10019 |volume=31 |issue=3 |journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders |pages=334–338|title=The media's representation of the ideal male body: A cause for muscle dysmorphia? |year=2002 |last1=Leit |first1=Richard A. |last2=Gray |first2=James J. |last3=Pope |first3=Harrison G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a study from the ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology'' by Daniel Agliata and Stacey Tantleff-Dunn found that exposure to media images of lean and muscular men increases muscle dissatisfaction and depression in young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://arapaho.nsuok.edu/~scottd/image-1.pdf |title=The Impact of Media Exposure on Males' Body Image |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |volume=23 |pages=7 |doi=10.1521/jscp.23.1.7.26988 |year=2004 |last1=Agliata |first1=Daniel |last2=Tantleff-Dunn |first2=Stacey |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409044427/http://arapaho.nsuok.edu/~scottd/image-1.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers believe that men are usually more satisfied than women with their physical appearance.  Other researchers, however, state that men still struggle with body image.  Men believe that they are either too thin or too heavy and therefore do not meet the male ideal body type of lean and muscular.

Since boys are much less likely to discuss their issues about their [[body image]], the statistics pertaining to the number of boys of whom this affects varies because so many instances are unreported.  Therefore, it is difficult to precisely determine which gender is more affected by body portrayal in the media. One very thorough study, however, conducted by Alison Field, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and a researcher at Boston Children's Hospital, revealed that approximately 18% of adolescent boys, aged 10–17, are concerned about their body and how much they weigh. Furthermore, Frederick and Jamal Essayli from the University of Hawaii at Manoa conducted national online surveys and gathered information from 116,000 men. They concluded that approximately 29% of men were dissatisfied with their bodies specifically because of the media.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Rebecca. "It's Not Just Girls. Boys Struggle With Body Image, Too." The Huffington Post.       TheHuffingtonPost.com, 17 Sept. 2014. Web. 3 Mar 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positive or neutral effects ==

=== Effects on teenagers ===
Heidi Posavac, Steven Posavac, and Emil Posavac found that young women who are already content with their bodies are generally unaffected by media images of models and other attractive women. They concluded that only those who are dissatisfied with their bodies prior to viewing advertisements will then feel poorly after seeing advertisements featuring thin, attractive women.&lt;ref name="Posavac"/&gt;

Furthermore, Myers and Biocca found that some young women actually feel thinner after viewing advertisements featuring thin, idealized women.&lt;ref name="Meyers"/&gt;

Likewise, a study by psychology professors Paul Humphreys and Susan Paxton suggests that young men who view images of idealized men either feel no different or feel more positive about themselves after viewing such images.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Body Image : Impact of exposure to idealised male images on adolescent boys' body image |doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2004.05.001 |volume=1 |issue=3 |journal=Body Image |pages=253–266|year=2004 |last1=Humphreys |first1=Paul |last2=Paxton |first2=Susan J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamara Mangleburg and Terry Bristol's studies featured in the ''Journal of Advertising'' found that teens are not typically swayed by images in advertisements. They suggest the more teens view advertisements, the less they are affected by them and the more they become skeptical of the messages that are in advertisements. This is because repeat exposure to ads can give them a better understanding of the motives behind such ads.&lt;ref name="Bristol"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mangleburg, Tamara F.  |author2=Bristol, Terry|title=Socialization and Adolescents' Skepticism toward Advertising|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=27|issue=3|pages=11|doi=10.1080/00913367.1998.10673559|jstor=4189079|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Marsha Richins, former president of the Association for Consumer Research, theorized that, "by late adolescence... the sight of extremely attractive models is 'old news' and unlikely to provide new information that might influence self-perception".&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; "[Yamamiya and Cash] used 20 model slides as stimuli, presented for a total duration of 5 minutes found that as the number of stimuli exceeded 10, viewers were somewhat less influenced, probably due to habituation."&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"/&gt;

Psychological researchers Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard feel that the media's effects on body dissatisfaction have been over-exaggerated. They believe that media does not heavily influence body dissatisfaction. Instead, they have found peers to have a much greater influence than the media in terms of body dissatisfaction in teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Who |title=Who Is the Fairest One of All?

'''Escalator etiquette''' is the [[etiquette]] of using [[escalator]]s. In many places, there is a [[convention (norm)|convention]] that people should stand on one particular side of an escalator to allow other people to walk on the other side.{{sfn|Geoghegan|2013}}

A 2015 experiment by [[Transport for London]] has suggested that such a convention sometimes reduces the efficiency of escalators: the number of people carried can increase if people stand on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/03/the-results-are-in-the-holborn-escalator-trial-proves-that-it-is-better-to-stand-on-the-escalator-well-sometimes/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Left or right==
The first escalators installed in the [[London Underground]] at [[Earl's Court station]] used the design patented by [[Charles Seeberger]].  These did not let the passengers dismount in the direction of travel, as currently.  Instead, a diagonal partition shunted them off to one side while the stairs disappeared under the partition.  The side chosen for disembarkation was the left hand side and this is the origin of their convention that riders should stand on the right, so that the walking riders would not have to cut into a standing line of people to exit.{{sfn|Malvern|2009}} Locations such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Belgium]] also follow this convention.

However certain countries, for instance Australia, Singapore, most of Japan, and New Zealand, riders stand on the left and walk on the right, following the road rules.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''Evolutionary graph theory''' is an area of research lying at the intersection of [[graph theory]], [[probability theory]], and [[mathematical biology]]. Evolutionary graph theory is an approach to studying how [[topology]] affects [[evolution]] of a [[population]]. That the underlying topology can substantially affect the results of the evolutionary process is seen most clearly in a paper by [[Erez Lieberman]], Christoph Hauert and [[Martin Nowak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = E. | last2 = Hauert | first2 = C. | last3 = Nowak | first3 = M. A. | doi = 10.1038/nature03204 | title = Evolutionary dynamics on graphs | journal = Nature | volume = 433 | issue = 7023 | pages = 312–316 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15662424 | pmc = | bibcode = 2005Natur.433..312L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In evolutionary graph theory, individuals occupy [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of a weighted [[directed graph]] and the weight w&lt;sub&gt;i j&lt;/sub&gt; of an [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]] from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'' denotes the probability of ''i'' replacing ''j''. The weight corresponds to the biological notion of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] where fitter types propagate more readily. 
One property studied on graphs with two types of individuals is the ''fixation probability'', which is defined as the probability that a single, randomly placed mutant of type A will replace a population of type B. According to the ''isothermal theorem'', a graph has the same fixation probability as the corresponding [[Moran process]] if and only if it is isothermal, thus the sum of all weights that lead into a vertex is the same for all vertices. Thus, for example, a [[complete graph]] with equal weights describes a Moran process. The fixation probability is
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
\rho_M = \frac{1-r^{-1}} { 1-r^{-N} } 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the relative fitness of the invading type.

Graphs can be classified into amplifiers of selection and suppressors of selection. If the fixation probability of a single advantageous mutation &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt;/math&gt; is higher than the fixation probability of the corresponding [[Moran process]] &lt;math&gt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; then the graph is an amplifier, otherwise a suppressor of selection. One example of the suppressor of selection is a linear process where only vertex ''i-1'' can replace vertex ''i'' (but not the other way around). In this case the fixation probability is &lt;math&gt; \rho_G = 1/N &lt;/math&gt; (where ''N'' is the number of vertices) since this is the probability that the mutation arises in the first vertex which will eventually replace all the other ones. Since &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; for all ''r'' greater than 1, this graph is by definition a suppressor of selection.

Evolutionary graph theory may also be studied in a dual formulation, as a [[coalescing random walk]], or as a stochastic process.  We may consider the mutant population on a graph as a random walk between absorbing barriers representing mutant extinction and mutant fixation.  For highly symmetric graphs, we can then use martingales to find the ''fixation probability'' as illustrated by Monk (2018).

Also [[Evolutionary game theory|evolutionary games]] can be studied on graphs where again an edge between ''i'' and ''j'' means that these two individuals will play a game against each other.

Closely related stochastic processes include the [[voter model]], which was introduced by Clifford and Sudbury (1973) and independently by Holley and Liggett (1975), and which has been studied extensively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">'''Functional divergence''' is the process by which genes, after [[gene duplication]], shift in function from an ancestral function. Functional divergence can result in either [[subfunctionalization]], where a paralog specializes one of several ancestral functions, or [[neofunctionalization]], where a totally new functional capability evolves. It is thought that this process of gene duplication and functional divergence is a major originator of molecular novelty and has produced the many large [[protein families]] that exist today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gu | first1 = X | date = Jul 2003 | title = Functional divergence in protein (family) sequence evolution | url = | journal = Genetica | volume = 118 | issue = 2–3| pages = 133–41 | doi=10.1007/978-94-010-0229-5_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fay | first1 = JC | last2 = Wu | first2 = CI | year = 2003 | title = Sequence divergence, functional constraint, and selection in protein evolution | url = | journal = Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 213–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional divergence is just one possible outcome of [[gene duplication]] events. Other fates include [[nonfunctionalization]] where one of the [[paralogs]] acquires [[deleterious]] [[mutations]] and becomes a [[pseudogene]] and [[superfunctionalization]] (reinforcement),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dvornyk | first1 = V | last2 = Vinogradova | first2 = ON | last3 = Nevo | first3 = E | year = 2002 | title = Long-term microclimatic stress causes rapid adaptive radiation of kaiABC clock gene family in a cyanobacterium, Nostoc linckia, from "Evolution Canyons" I and II, Israel | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 2082–2087 | doi=10.1073/pnas.261699498 | pmid=11842226 | pmc=123721| bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.2082D }}&lt;/ref&gt; where both paralogs maintain original function. While gene, chromosome, or whole genome duplication events are considered the canonical sources of functional divergence of [[paralogs]], [[orthologs]] (genes descended from speciation events) can also undergo functional divergence &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Studer | first1 = RA | last2 = Robinson-Rechavi | first2 = M | year = 2009 | title = How confident can we be that orthologs are similar, but paralogs differ? | url = | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 210–6 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2009.03.004 | pmid=19368988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Studer | first1 =  | last2 = Robinson-Rechavi | first2 = M | year = 2010 | title = Large-scale analysis of orthologs and paralogs under covarion-like and constant-but-different models of amino acid evolution | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 2618–2627 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msq149 | pmid=20551039 | pmc=2955734}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gharib | first1 = WH | last2 = Robinson-Rechavi | first2 = M | year = 2011 | title = When orthologs diverge between human and mouse | url = | journal = Briefings in Bioinformatics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 436–441 | doi = 10.1093/bib/bbr031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nehrt | first1 = NL | last2 = Clark | first2 = WT | last3 = Radivojac | first3 = P | last4 = Hahn | first4 = MW | year = 2011 | title = Testing the ortholog conjecture with comparative functional genomic data from mammals | url = | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = e1002073 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002073 | pmid=21695233 | pmc=3111532| bibcode = 2011PLSCB...7E2073N }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[horizontal gene transfer]] can also result in multiple copies of a gene in a genome, providing the opportunity for functional divergence.

Many well known protein families are the result of this process, such as the ancient gene duplication event that led to the divergence of [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]], the more recent duplication events that led to the various subunit expansions (alpha and beta) of vertebrate [[hemoglobin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Storz | first1 = Jay F. | last2 = Hoffmann | first2 = Federico G. | last3 = Opazo | first3 = Juan C. | last4 = Moriyama | first4 = Hideaki | date = March 2008 | title = Adaptive Functional Divergence Among Triplicated α-Globin Genes in Rodents | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 178 | issue = 3| pages = 1623–1638 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.107.080903 | pmc = 2278084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the expansion of  G-protein alpha subunits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zheng | first1 = Y | last2 = Xu | first2 = D | last3 = Gu | first3 = X | year = 2007 | title = Functional divergence after gene duplication and sequence-structure relationship: a case study of G-protein alpha subunits | url = | journal = J Exp Zool B Mol Dev Evol. | volume = 308 | issue = 1| pages = 85–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''fusion category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that is [[rigid category|rigid]], [[semisimple category|semisimple]], [[linear category|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-linear]], [[monoidal category|monoidal]] and has only finitely many isomorphism classes of [[Glossary_of_category_theory#simple_object|simple objects]], such that the monoidal unit is simple. If the ground field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is algebraically closed, then the latter is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(1,1)\cong k&lt;/math&gt; by [[Schur's lemma]].

Under [[Tannaka-Krein duality]], every fusion category arises as the representations of a [[weak Hopf algebra]].

The '''Garden of Eden''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] גַּן עֵדֶן, ''Gan ʿEḏen''), also called '''Paradise''', is the biblical "garden of God" described in the [[Book of Genesis]] and the [[Book of Ezekiel]]..&lt;ref name="Metzger2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Metzger|first1= Bruce Manning|last2= Coogan|first2= Michael D|title= The Oxford Guide To People And Places Of The Bible|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=amlXOOaSuLMC|accessdate= 22 December 2012|year= 2004|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0-19-517610-0|page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2011 228–229"&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|2011|pp= 228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis 13:10 refers to the "garden of God",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Genesis+13|title=oremus Bible Browser : Genesis 13|website=bible.oremus.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "trees of the garden" are mentioned in Ezekiel 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Ezekiel+31|title=oremus Bible Browser : Ezekiel 31|website=bible.oremus.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Ezekiel+31|title=oremus Bible Browser : Ezekiel 31|website=bible.oremus.org|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Zechariah]] and the [[Book of Psalms]] also refer to trees and water without explicitly mentioning Eden.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tigchelaar|1999|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name derives from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''edinnu'', from a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] word ''[[Edin (Sumerian term)|edin]]'' meaning "plain" or "steppe", closely related to an [[Aramaic]] root word meaning "fruitful, well-watered".&lt;ref name="Cohen 2011 228–229"/&gt; Another interpretation associates the name with a Hebrew word for "pleasure"; thus the [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] in Genesis 2:8 has the wording
"And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure" rather than "a garden in Eden". The Hebrew term is translated "pleasure" in Sarah's secret saying in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|18:9-15|HE|Genesis 18:12|HE}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/strongs/H5731 H5731 Eden]  – The same as H5730 (masculine); Eden= "pleasure" ... the first habitat of man after the creation; site unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Genesis flood narrative]], the [[Genesis creation narrative]] and the account of the [[Tower of Babel]], the story of Eden echoes the [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian myth]] of a king, as a primordial man, who is placed in a divine garden to guard the [[Tree of Life]].{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p= 33}} The [[Hebrew Bible]] depicts [[Adam and Eve]] as walking around the Garden of Eden naked due to their innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Miller (2007) ''Miller 3-in-1: Blue Like Jazz, Through Painted Deserts, Searching for God'', Thomas Nelson Inc, {{ISBN|978-1418551179}}, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tfHksenSLIEC&amp;pg=PT207#v=onepage&amp;q=naked%20%22garden%20of%20eden%22%20nudity&amp;f=false PT207]&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of Eden is described in the Book of Genesis as the source of four tributaries. The Garden of Eden is considered to be [[Mythology|mythological]] by most scholars.&lt;ref name=loc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc2/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc5/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc4/&gt; Among those that consider it to have been real, there have been various suggestions for its location:&lt;ref name="wilensky2012"/&gt; at the head of the [[Persian Gulf]], in southern Mesopotamia (now Iraq) where the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers run into the sea;&lt;ref name=loc7/&gt; and in [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name=loc8/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc10/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc11/&gt;

===Genesis===
{{main article|Genesis creation narrative|Adam and Eve}}

The second part of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]&lt;!--do not remove the word narrative, click the link and read why it is called this--&gt;, {{bibleverse|Genesis|2:4-3:24|HE}}, opens with [[YHWH]]-[[Elohim]] (translated here "the {{LORD}} God", see [[Names of God in Judaism]]) creating the first man ([[Adam]]), whom he placed in a garden that he planted "eastward in Eden".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levenson|2004|p=13}} "The root of Eden denotes fertility. Where the wondrously fertile gard was thought to have been located (if a realistic location was ever conceived) is unclear. The Tigris and Euphrates are the two great rivers of the Mesopotamia (now found in modern Iraq). But the Piston is unidentified, and the only Gihon in the Bible is a spring in Jerusalem (1 Kings 1.33, 38)."&lt;/ref&gt; "And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Genesis|2:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man was free to eat from any tree in the garden except the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. Last of all, the God made a woman ([[Eve]]) from a rib of the man to be a companion for the man. In chapter three, the man and the woman were seduced by the [[Serpents in the Bible|serpent]] into eating the [[forbidden fruit]], and they were expelled from the garden to prevent them from eating of the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]], and thus living forever. [[Cherub]]im were placed east of the garden, "and a [[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]] which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life" ({{bibleverse|Genesis|3:24}}).

{{bibleverse|Genesis|2:10–14|HE}} lists four rivers in association with the garden of Eden: [[Pishon]], [[Gihon]], Chidekel (the [[Tigris]]), and Phirat (the [[Euphrates]]).

===Ezekiel===
{{main article|Ezekiel's cherub in Eden}}

In {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|28:12–19|HE}} the prophet [[Ezekiel]] the "son of man"&lt;!-- v.12 --&gt; sets down God's word against the king of Tyre: the king was the "seal of perfection",&lt;!-- v.12 --&gt; adorned with precious stones from the day of his creation,&lt;!-- v.13 --&gt; placed by God in the garden of Eden on the holy mountain as a guardian cherub.&lt;!-- v.14 --&gt; But the king sinned through wickedness and violence, and so he was driven out of the garden and thrown to the earth, where now he is consumed by God's fire: "All those who knew you in the nations are appalled at you, you have come to a horrible end and will be no more." (v.19).

According to Terje Stordalen, the Eden in Ezekiel appears to be located in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stordalen|2000|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[I]t appears that the Lebanon is an alternative placement in Phoenician myth (as in Ez 28,13, III.48) of the Garden of Eden",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2001|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are connections between paradise, the garden of Eden and the forests of Lebanon (possibly used symbolically) within prophetic writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swarup|2006|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] and [[Peter Kyle McCarter]] have suggested that the [[Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)]], the oldest [[Sumer]]ian version of the Garden of Eden, relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and [[Anti-Lebanon mountains|Anti-Lebanon ranges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2009|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of Eden is described in the Book of Genesis, chapter 2, verses 10–14:

{{quote|And a river departed from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four tributaries.
The name of the first is Pishon, which is the circumnavigator of the land of Havilah where there is gold.
And the gold of this land is good; there are [[bdellium]] and cornelian stone.
And the name of the second river is Gihon, which is the circumnavigator of the land of Cush.
And the name of the third is Chidekel, which is that which goes to the east of Ashur; and the fourth river is Phirat.|sign=|source=}}

==Parallel concepts==
* [[Dilmun]] in the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] story of ''Enki and Ninhursag'' is a paradisaical abode{{sfn|Mathews|1996|pp=96}} of the immortals, where sickness and death were unknown.{{sfn|Cohen|2011|pp=229}}
* The [[Hesperides|garden of the Hesperides]] in [[Greek mythology]] was somewhat similar to the Christian concept of the Garden of Eden, and by the 16th century a larger intellectual association was made in the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting (''see illustration at top''). In this painting, only the ''action'' that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.
* The Persian term "[[paradise]]" (borrowed as {{lang-he|פרדס}}, ''pardes''), meaning a royal garden or hunting-park, gradually became a synonym for Eden after c. 500&amp;nbsp;BCE. The word "''pardes''" occurs three times in the Hebrew Bible, but always in contexts other than a connection with Eden: in the [[Song of Solomon]] iv. 13: "Thy plants are an orchard (''pardes'') of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard"; [[Ecclesiastes]] 2. 5: "I made me gardens and orchards (''pardes''), and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits"; and in [[Nehemiah]] ii. 8: "And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's orchard (''pardes''), that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city." In these examples ''pardes'' clearly means "orchard" or "park", but in the [[apocalyptic literature]] and in the [[Talmud]] "paradise" gains its associations with the Garden of Eden and its heavenly prototype, and in the [[New Testament]] "paradise" becomes the realm of the blessed (as opposed to the realm of the cursed) among those who have already died, with literary [[Hellenistic]] influences.

==Other views==
===Jewish eschatology===
In the [[Talmud]] and the Jewish [[Kabbalah]],&lt;ref name="Gan Eden"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=39&amp;letter=E Gan Eden] – JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called "Garden in Eden". The first is rather terrestrial, of abundant fertility and luxuriant vegetation, known as the "lower Gan Eden". The second is envisioned as being celestial, the habitation of righteous, Jewish and non-Jewish, immortal souls, known as the "higher Gan Eden". The [[Rabbi|Rabbanim]] differentiate between ''Gan'' and Eden. Adam is said to have dwelt only in the ''Gan'', whereas Eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye.&lt;ref name="Gan Eden"/&gt;

According to [[Jewish eschatology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba – The Afterlife] - JewFAQ.org; 02-22-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eshatology"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=460&amp;letter=E#1239 Eshatology] – JewishEncyclopedia; 02-22-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the higher Gan Eden is called the "Garden of Righteousness". It has been created since the beginning of the world, and will appear gloriously at the end of time. The righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly ''[[chayot]]'' carrying the throne of God. Each of the righteous will walk with God, who will lead them in a dance. Its Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants are "clothed with garments of light and eternal life, and eat of the tree of life" (Enoch 58,3) near to God and His anointed ones.&lt;ref name="Eshatology"/&gt; This Jewish rabbinical concept of a higher Gan Eden is opposed by the Hebrew terms ''[[gehinnom]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Gehinnom is the Hebrew name; Gehenna is Yiddish." [http://www.jewfaq.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi?Keywords=Gehinnom Gehinnom – Judaism 101] websourced 02-10-2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[sheol]]'', figurative names for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in Judaism, a place envisioned as being at the greatest possible distance from [[heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm#Gan |title=Gan Eden and Gehinnom |publisher=Jewfaq.org |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Jewish eschatology it is believed that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be when all mankind returns to the Garden of Eden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End of Days|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/a/48925077.html|work=End of Days|publisher=Aish|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic view===
[[File:Spanish-Arabic map of 1109.jpg|thumb|[[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]] world map from 1109 with Eden in the East (at top)]]
The term ''jannāt ʿadni'' ("Gardens of Eden" or "Gardens of Perpetual Residence") is used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] for the destination of the righteous. There are several mentions of "the Garden" in the Qur'an (2:35, 7:19, 20:117), while the Garden of Eden, without the word ''ʿadn'',&lt;ref&gt;See [http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=lem%3AEadon+pos%3Apn list of occurrences].&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly the fourth layer of the Islamic [[Jannah|heaven]] and not necessarily thought as the dwelling place of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services 1995 {{ISBN|978-8-120-60672-2}} page 133&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran refers frequently over various [[Surah]] about the first abode of Adam and Hawwa (Eve), including surat [[Sad (surah)|Sad]], which features 18 verses on the subject (38:71–88), surat [[al-Baqara]], surat [[al-A'raf]], and surat [[al-Hijr (surah)|al-Hijr]] although sometimes without mentioning the location. The narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of Hawwa and Adam after they were tempted by [[Shaitan]]. Despite the Biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, the tree of immortality, which [[God in Islam|God]] specifically claimed it was forbidden to Adam and Eve. Some [[tafsir|exegesis]] added an account, about [[Satan]], disguised as a serpent to enter the Garden, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, resulting in disobeying God.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman, Oliver ''The Quran, an encyclopedia'', p. 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These stories are also featured in the [[hadith]] collections, including [[al-Tabari]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Brannon ''Mecca and Eden: ritual, relics, and territory in Islam'' p. 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter Day Saints===
{{see also|Adam and Eve (LDS Church)}}

Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (also known as [[Mormons]] or Latter-day Saints) believe that after Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden they resided in a place known as [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], located in present-day [[Daviess County, Missouri]]. It is recorded in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] that Adam blessed his posterity there and that he will return to that place at the time of the [[Last Judgement|final judgement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.53?lang=eng#53|title=Doctrine and Covenants 107:53|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/116.1?lang=eng#1|title=Doctrine and Covenants 116:1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fulfillment of biblical prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/7.13.13-14,22?lang=eng#12|title=Daniel 7:13-14,22|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous early leaders of the Church, including [[Brigham Young]], [[Heber C. Kimball]], and [[George Q. Cannon]], taught that the Garden of Eden itself was located in nearby [[Jackson County, Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Garden_of_Eden_in_Missouri "Joseph Smith/Garden of Eden in Missouri"], FairMormon Answers&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no surviving first-hand accounts of that doctrine being taught by Joseph Smith himself. LDS doctrine is unclear as to the exact location of the Garden of Eden, but tradition among Latter-Day Saints places it somewhere in the vicinity of Adam-ondi-Ahman, or in Jackson County.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Van Orden, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1994/01/i-have-a-question "I Have a Question: What do we know about the location of the Garden of Eden?"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1994, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/mormonism-101#C18|title=What is Mormonism?

==Art==
The Garden of Eden motifs most frequently portrayed in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and paintings are the "Sleep of Adam" ("Creation of Eve"), the "Temptation of Eve" by the Serpent, the "[[Fall of Man]]" where Adam takes the fruit, and the "Expulsion". The idyll of "Naming Day in Eden" was less often depicted. Much of [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' occurs in the Garden of Eden. [[Michelangelo]] depicted a [[:File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 022.jpg|scene]] at the Garden of Eden in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]. In ''[[Divine Comedy|the Divine Comedy]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] places the Garden at the top of [[Purgatory|Mt. Purgatory]]. For many medieval writers, the image of the Garden of Eden also creates a location for human [[love]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], often associated with the classic and medieval [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of the [[locus amoenus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtius|1953|p=200, n.31}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of oldest depictions of Garden of Eden is made in [[Byzantine style]] in [[Ravenna]], while the city was still under Byzantine control. A preserved blue mosaic is part of the mausoleum of Galla Placidia. Circular motifs represent flowers of the garden of Eden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5392">The '''human spirit''' is a component of human [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[art]], and [[knowledge]] - the spiritual or mental part of humanity. While the term can be used with the same meaning as "human soul",  human spirit is sometimes used to refer to the impersonal, universal or higher component of human nature in contrast to [[soul]] or '''''psyche''''' which can refer to the ego or lower element. The human spirit includes our intellect, emotions, fears, passions, and creativity.

In the models of [[Daniel A. Helminiak]] and [[Bernard Lonergan]], human spirit is considered to be the mental functions of [[awareness]], [[insight]], [[understanding]], [[judgement]] and other reasoning powers.  It is distinguished from the separate component of [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] which comprises the entities of [[emotion]], [[image]]s, [[memory]] and [[Personality type|personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DL9hwUBJm18C |title=The human core of spirituality: mind as psyche and spirit |author=Daniel A. Helminiak |isbn=978-0-7914-2950-1 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Teske views human spirit as a [[social construct]] representing the qualities of purpose and [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] which transcend the individual human.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6i5ynN9qX30C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA189 |title=The human person in science and theology |chapter=The Social Construction of the Human Spirit |author=John Teske |isbn=978-0-567-08692-1 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between the human spirit and soul==
According to  historian [[Oswald Spengler]], a distinction between Spirit and Soul has been made by the West and earlier civilizations which influenced its development.&lt;ref name = "spengler"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Spengler
|first=Oswald
|title=The Decline of the west(An abridged edition)
|chapter= vol2, chpt: 3 &amp; 8
|year=1922
|isbn=1-4000-9700-2
|publisher= Vintage Books, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The human spirit can be seen as the heavenly component of  human's non material makeup -  the part that is impersonal or universal.  Whereas souls are the personal element unique to each individual.  As Spengler writes in ''[[The Decline of the West]]'':

{{cquote| ... more important than all this is the opposition of Spirit and Soul (Hebrew: ''ruach'' and ''nephesh'', Persian: ''ahu'' and ''urvan'', Mandasan: ''monuhmed'' and ''gyan'', Greek: ''pneuma'' and ''psyche'') which first comes out in the basic feeling of the prophetic religions, then pervades the whole of Apocalyptic, and finally forms and guides the world-contemplations of the awakened Culture - as seen with Philo, Paul and Plotinus, Gnostics and Mandeans, Augustine and the Avesta, Islam and the Kabbalah. ''Ruach'' means originally "wind" and ''nephesh'' "breath."  The ''nephesh'' is always in one way or another related to the bodily and earthly, to the below, the evil, the darkness. Its effort is the "upward." The ''ruach'' belongs to the divine, to the above, to the light. Its effects in man when it descends are the heroism of a Samson, the holy wrath of an Elijah, the enlightenment of the judge (e.g. Solomon passing judgment) and all kinds of divination and ecstasy. It is poured out. As in Isaiah xi, x, the Messiah becomes the incarnation of the ''ruach''.&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;}}

In Christianity, the [[Bible]] identifies humanity's three basic elements: spirit, soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thes%205:23&amp;version=NIV 1 Thes 5:23]&lt;/ref&gt;  Christians emphasise  that the human spirit is the 'real person', the very core of a person's being, the essential seat of their existence. When a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Saviour, it is their human spirit that is transformed as they become 'new creatures' in Jesus Christ. The soul which is the seat of the will, mind and emotions does not get converted but needs to be renewed on a daily basis through the recommended Christian disciplines such as prayer and reading the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 1 Cor 6:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV 2 Cor 5:17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%206:17&amp;version=NIV Rom 12:2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, Muslims are viewed as having their own spirits, but one that in a sense is one with God's spirit. For [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler]], the perception of unity this idea led to was important for the emergence of the "consensus" that maintained harmony in Islamic culture, especially during the [[Golden Age of Islam]].&lt;ref name = "spengler"/&gt;

The '''innocent prisoner's dilemma''', or '''parole deal''', is a detrimental effect of a legal system in which admission of guilt can result in reduced sentences or early parole. When an innocent person is wrongly convicted of a crime, legal systems which need the individual to admit guilt, for example as a prerequisite step leading to parole, punish an innocent person for his integrity, and reward a person lacking in integrity. There have been many cases where innocent prisoners were given the choice between freedom, in exchange for claiming guilt, and remaining imprisoned and telling the truth. Individuals have [[died in prison]] rather than admit to crimes which they did not commit.

It has been demonstrated in Britain that prisoners who freely admit their guilt are more likely to re-offend than prisoners who maintain their innocence. Other research, however, has found no clear link between denial of guilt and recidivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clark Baim|author2=Lydia Guthrie|title=Changing Offending Behaviour: A Handbook of Practical Exercises and Photocopiable Resources for Promoting Positive Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yisEBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-0-85700-928-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yisEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=recidivism 39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law professor Daniel Medwed says convicts who go before a parole board maintaining their innocence are caught in a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]] which he calls "the innocent prisoner’s dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/06/04/nyregion/1247467961918/the-innocent-prisoner-s-dilemma.html |title=The 'Innocent Prisoner's Dilemma' - Video Library - The New York Times |publisher=Video.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31 |first=Rob |last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; A false admission of guilt and remorse by an innocent person at a parole hearing may prevent a later investigation proving their innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=960125 |title=The Innocent Prisoner's Dilemma: Consequences of Failing to Admit Guilt at Parole Hearings by Daniel Medwed :: SSRN |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detriment to individuals==

===In the United Kingdom===
Michael Naughton, founder of the [[Innocence Network]] UK (INUK), says work carried out by the INUK includes research and public awareness on wrongful convictions, which can effect policy reforms. Most important is the development of a system to assess prisoners maintaining innocence, to distinguish potentially innocent prisoners from the prisoners who claim innocence for other reasons like "ignorance, misunderstanding or disagreement with criminal law; to protect another person or group from criminal conviction; or on 'abuse of process' or technical grounds in the hope of achieving an appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/08/innocence-network | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=Naughton | title=Students for justice: the Innocence Network | date=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system, he says, is being adopted by the prison parole board and prison service, for prisoners serving "indeterminate sentences (where the prisoner has no release date and does not get out until a parole board decides he or she is no longer a risk to the public). Previously, such prisoners were treated as 'deniers' with no account taken of the various reasons for maintaining innocence, nor the fact that some may actually be innocent." Those prisoners are unable to achieve parole unless they undertake offence-behaviour courses that require the admission of guilt as a prerequisite. This was represented in the ''Porridge'' episode ''[[Pardon Me (Porridge)|Pardon Me]]''.  However, in recent years, this has diminished in significance; at the time Simon Hall ended his denials to murder in 2012, the Ministry of Justice denied that this would have any impact on his tariff, and his last online posting had concerned being released from prison in spite of his denials.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Hall confesses to Joan Albert murder 12 years on https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-23611821&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[murder of Linda Cook]] was committed in [[Portsmouth]] on 9 December 1986. The subsequent trial led to a [[miscarriage of justice]] when Michael Shirley, an 18-year-old [[Royal Navy]] sailor, was wrongly convicted of the crime and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="olden"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Olden |first=Mark |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/justice--but-at-what-cost-536404.html |title=Justice - but at what cost? |work=[[The Independent]] |page=10 |date=2003-08-19 |accessdate=2009-08-14 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810100122/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/justice--but-at-what-cost-536404.html |archivedate=August 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shaw|first=Danny|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3039608.stm|title=Sailor awaits murder appeal ruling|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2003-07-02|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving the minimum 15 years, Shirley would have been released from prison had he confessed the killing to the [[Parole Board for England and Wales|parole board]], but he refused to do so and said: "I would have died in prison rather than admit something I didn't do. I was prepared to stay in forever if necessary to prove my innocence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=DNA Evidence Quashes Murder Conviction|work=Police News|date=29 June 2003|url=http://www.policeoracle.com/news/DNA-Evidence-Quashes-Murder-Conviction_1665.html|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=I'd rather have died in jail than admit a murder I didn't do|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|location=London|date=5 July 2003|first=Rod|last=Chaytor|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Shirley's conviction was eventually quashed by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] in 2003, on the basis of exculpatory DNA evidence.)

The [[Stephen Downing case]] involved the conviction and imprisonment in 1974 of a 17-year-old council worker, Stephen Downing, for the murder of a 32-year-old legal secretary, Wendy Sewell. His conviction was overturned in 2002, after Downing had served 27 years in prison. The case is thought to be the longest miscarriage of justice in British legal history,&lt;ref name="NewStatesman"&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200303100020 New Statesman – The editor, the murder and the truth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606034744/http://www.newstatesman.com/200303100020 |date=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1760754.stm] BBC News 15 January 2002 ''Downing murder conviction quashed''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardwebster.net/thenewinjustices.html The new injustices:from false confessions to false allegations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted worldwide media attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/02_february/12/denial_murder.shtml] BBC Press Office 2 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The case was featured in the 2004 [[BBC]] drama ''In Denial of Murder''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Downing claimed that had he falsely confessed he would have been released over a decade earlier. Because he did not admit to the crime he was classified as "IDOM" (In Denial of Murder) and ineligible for parole under English Law.

===In the United States===

In the United States the reality of a person being innocent, called "[[actual innocence]]", is not sufficient reason for the justice system to release a prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2011/3/30/georgia_and_the_us_supreme_court_tinkering_with_the_machinery_of_death&lt;/ref&gt;  Once a verdict has been made, it is rare for a court to reconsider evidence of innocence which could have been presented at the time of the original trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2009/8/19/troy_davis_and_the_meaning_of_actual_innocence&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions by the State Board of Pardons and Paroles regarding its treatment of prisoners who may be actually innocent have been criticized by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, A. (2009, August 19) "Troy Davis and the Meaning of 'Actual Innocence'". Democracy Now. Retrieved on August 11, 2017 from https://www.democracynow.org/2009/8/19/troy_davis_and_the_meaning_of_actual_innocence&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert Murray, who was convicted of murder in 1979, said, "When the judge asked me did I have anything to say, I couldn't say, because tears were coming down and I couldn’t communicate. I couldn't turn around and tell the family that they got the wrong man." The judge said he believed the defense’s alibi witnesses; however, the judge was required by law to respect the jury’s decision. After being locked up for 19 years, his parole officer said "Nineteen years is a long time. [....] But you’re no closer to the rehabilitative process than when you first walked into prison. The first step in that process is the internalization of guilt. You need to do some serious introspection, Mr. Murray, and come to grips with your behavior." Murray agreed with the parole officer, but maintained his innocence: "I agree! But again, I just didn't do it."

In a news interview, Murray says he went before a parole board four times, maintaining his innocence until the fifth: "I said what the hell, let me tell these people what they want to hear." He admitted to the parole board that he committed the crime and was taking responsibility. "I felt like I sold my soul to the devil. Because before, I had that strength, because I stood on the truth. [...] I became so desperate to get out, I had to say something. I had to say something because what I said before didn't work." His parole was denied. After 29 years in prison, [[Medwed's Second Look clinic]], a group dedicated to the release of innocent prisoners, assisted lawyers in his eighth parole board hearing which was successful, releasing him onto indefinite parole. Overturning the original conviction would be hampered by his admissions of guilt at his parole hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mindgatemedia.com/lesson/wrongfully-convicted-prisoners-often-denied-parole/ |title=Wrongfully Convicted Prisoners Often Denied Parole |publisher=Mindgate Media |date= |accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Cole|Timothy Brian Cole]] (1960–99) was an African American military veteran and a student wrongly convicted of [[rape|raping]] a fellow student in 1985. Cole was convicted by a jury of rape, primarily based on the testimony of the victim, Michele Mallin. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. While [[incarceration|incarcerated]], Cole was offered parole if he would admit guilt, but he refused.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Lavandera|first=Ed|title=Family seeks to clear man who died in prison|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2009-02-05|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/05/texas.exoneration/index.html|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; "His greatest wish was to be exonerated and completely vindicated", his mother stated in a press interview. Cole died after serving 14 years in prison.

Another man, Jerry Wayne Johnson, confessed to the rape in 1995. Further, Mallin later admitted that she was mistaken as to the identity of her attacker. She stated that investigators botched the gathering of evidence and withheld information from her, causing her to believe that Cole was the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hearing could lead to exoneration in Cole rape case|publisher=[[News 8 Austin]]|date=2009-02-06|url=http://www.news8austin.com/content/your_news/default.asp?ArID=231175|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mallin told police that the rapist smoked during the rape. However, Cole never smoked because of his severe [[asthma]]. [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] later showed him to be innocent.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodwin|first=Wade|title=Family Of Man Cleared By DNA Still Seeks Justice|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|date=2009-02-05|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100249923|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole died in prison on December 2, 1999; ten years later, a district court judge announced "to a 100 percent moral, factual and legal certainty" that Timothy Cole did not commit the rape. He was posthumously pardoned.

The dilemma can occur even before conviction. [[Kalief Browder]] was arrested in May 2010 for allegedly stealing a backpack. He spent the next three years on Rikers Island awaiting trial, much of it in solitary. During court appearances, prosecutors routinely asked for a short delay which would turn into a much lengthier wait. At times, Browder was offered plea bargains, and at one point, he was encouraged to plead guilty to misdemeanors, for which he would be sentenced to time already served and released. When he refused the plea deal, insisting on his innocence, the judge noted "If you go to trial and lose, you could get up to fifteen [years]." Eventually, in May 2013, the case was dismissed because prosecutors had lost contact with the only witness they had to the alleged crime.&lt;ref name="The New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gonnerman|first=Jennifer|title=Before the Law|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2014-10-06|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/06/before-the-law|accessdate=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detriment to society==
Gabe Tan reported a British conference in 2011, "the dilemma of maintaining innocence", concluded "Denial is not a valid measure of risk. In fact, research has shown that prisoners who openly admit to their crimes have the highest risk of re-offending."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.innocencenetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Gabe-Tan-APL-PPMI-Report-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Michael Naughton suggested the focus on new evidence by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]], rather than an examination of serious problems with evidence at original trials, meant in many cases “that the dangerous criminals who committed these crimes remain at liberty with the potential to commit further serious crimes.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innocencenetwork.org.uk/ccrcreform Potential Wrongful Convictions: Failed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission | INUK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert A. Forde cited two studies at the conference. One, a ten-year study of 180 sex offenders by Harkins, Beech and Goodwill found prisoners who claimed to be innocent were the least likely to be re-convicted, and that those who 'admitted everything', claiming to be guilty, were most likely to re-offend. He also told the conference research by Hanson ''et al.'' in 2002, the denial by the prisoner of their offences had no bearing on their likelihood of re-offending.&lt;!--first paragraph ref repeats here--&gt;

'''Juan Garaizabal''' (born 1971 in [[Madrid]]) is a Spanish [[Plastic arts|plastic artist]], Garaizabal's work encompasses drawings, sculpture, [[Light art|light]] and [[Sound sculpture|acoustic installations]], [[video art]], and [[engraving]]. He is internationally known for his [[Monumental sculpture|monumental]] [[Public art|public sculptures]]. His "Urban Memories", structures intertwining sculpture and illumination, are a recuperation of long-lost architectural elements occupying [[Public space|vacant]], historically significant sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/telediario/escultor-espanol-juan-garai-zabal-presenta-proyecto-memorias-urbanas/1451945/ TVE (Video)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic history==
At 14, Garaizabal entered the IB 67[[Academy figure|drawing academy]] in Madrid where he studied for three years, later graduating from [[Reims Management School|CESEM]] in [[Reims]], France. His early work was split mainly between visual arts and the transforming of sundry spaces into [[loft]]s, a concept formally unknown in Spain. As a [[conceptual art]]ist, a large part of his work has been done by hand, using such techniques as [[forging]], [[carpentry]], electricity, [[plastic arts|plasticity]], and [[masonry]] – all skills acquired through time and experimentation. As of 2008, his main studio is in [[Berlin]], Germany, although he maintains another in [[Madrid]], Spain.

A '''licensed behavior analyst''' is a type of [[behavioral health]] [[professional]] in the United States. They have at least a master's degree, and sometimes a doctorate, in [[behavior analysis]] or a related field.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cautilli, J.D., &amp; Dziewolska, H.|year=2008|title=Licensing behavior analysts: General historical issues and why people oppose them|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1–13|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bct/4/1/1.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|format=PDF|doi=10.1037/h0100827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysts apply [[radical behaviorism]] to people by performing [[applied behavior analysis]].&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;

== Defining the scope of practice ==
The Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) defines behavior analysis as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacb.com BACB]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The field of behavior analysis grew out of the scientific study of principles of learning and behavior. It has two main branches: experimental and applied behavior analysis. The experimental analysis of behavior (EAB) is the basic science of this field and has over many decades accumulated a substantial and well-respected research literature. This literature provides the scientific foundation for applied behavior analysis (ABA), which is both an applied science that develops methods of changing behavior and a profession that provides services to meet diverse behavioral needs. Briefly, professionals in applied behavior analysis engage in the specific and comprehensive use of principles of learning, including [[operant]] and respondent learning, in order to address behavioral needs of widely varying individuals in diverse settings. Examples of these applications include: building the skills and achievements of children in school settings; enhancing the development, abilities, and choices of children and adults with different kinds of disabilities; and augmenting the performance and satisfaction of employees in organizations and businesses."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the above suggests, [[behavior analysis]] is based on the principles of [[operant]] and [[respondent conditioning]]. This places [[behavior analysis]] as one of the dominant models of [[behavior management]], [[behavioral engineering]] and [[behavior therapy]].  Behavior analysis is an active, environmental based approach and some behavior analytic procedures are considered highly restrictive (see [[least restrictive environment]]). For example, these service may make access to preferred items contingent on performance. This has led to abuses in the past, in particular where punishment programs have been involved.&lt;ref name=Cautilli/&gt; In addition, failure to be an independent profession often leads behavior analysts and other behavior modifiers to have their ethical codes supplanted by those of other professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cautilli, J.D. &amp; Weinberg, M.|year=2007|title=Editorial – Beholden To Other Professions|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=8|issue=2|pages=111–113|url=http://www.baojournal.com/|doi=10.1037/h0100606}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a behavior analyst working in the hospital setting might design a [[token economy]], a form of [[contingency management]]. He may desire to meet his ethical obligation to make the program habilitative and in the clients' best long-term interest. The physicians and nurses in the hospital who supervise him may decide that the [[token economy]] should instead create order in the nursing routines so clients get their medication quickly and efficiently. Instead of the ethical code of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board and the [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International's position that those receiving treatment have a right to effective treatment&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/treatment.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119073107/http://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/treatment.asp|archivedate=November 19, 2008|deadurl=yes|title=Statement on the Right to Effective Behavioral Treatment, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a right to effective education.&lt;ref name=ABA/&gt; In addition, failure on the part of a behavior analyst to adequately supervise his or her workers could lead to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bassett, J. E., &amp; Blanchard, E. B.|year=1977|title=The effect of the absence of close supervision on the use of response cost in a prison token economy|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=10|pages=375–380|doi=10.1901/jaba.1977.10-375|pmc=1311200|pmid=924912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, misrepresentations of the field and historical problems between academics has led to frequent calls to professionalize behavior analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cautilli, J. D. &amp; Rosenwasser, B.J.|year=2001|title=The Editors speak out on intellectual bigotry: Why We Need To Become A Profession|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=2|issue=1|pages=2–4|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/2/1/2.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, there is wide support within the profession for licensure.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt;

===Range of populations worked with===
{{Main article|Professional practice of behavior analysis}}

The professional practice of behavior analysis ranges from treatment of individuals with autism and developmental disabilities to behavioral coaching and behavioral psychotherapy. In addition to treatment of [[mental health]] problems and corrections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bednar, R. L., Zelhart, P. F., Greathouse, L., &amp; Weinberg, S.|year=1970|title=Operant conditioning principles in the treatment of learning and behavior problems with delinquent boys|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|volume=17|pages=492–497|doi=10.1037/h0029884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Braukmann, C.

===Certification===
The Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) offers a technical [[Professional certification|certificate]] in behavior analysis. This certification is internationally recognized. This certification states the level of training and requires an exam to show a minimum level of [[competence (human resources)|competence]] to call oneself a board certified behavior analyst (BCBA). Certification came about because of many ethical issues with behavioral interventions being delivered including the use of aversive and humiliating treatments in the name of [[behavior modification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bailey, J.S. &amp; Burch, M.R.|year=2005|title=Ethics for Behavior Analysts: A Practical Guide to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board Guidelines for Responsible Conduct|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|isbn=9780805851175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American psychological association offers a diplomate (post Ph.D. and licensed certification) in behavioral psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Dowd, E.T.|year=2001|title=Board Certification (Diplomate) in Behavioral Psychology|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=2|issue=1|pages=l5–28|url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~edowd/ABPP/diplomate.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The meaning of certification===
BACB is a private non-profit organization without governmental powers to regulate behavior analytic practice. While the BACB certification means that candidates have satisfied entry-level requirements in behavior analytic training, certificants may require a government license for independent practice when treating behavioral health or medical problems. Licensed certificants must operate within the scope of their license and must practice within their areas of expertise. Where the government regulates behavior analytic services unlicensed certificants must be supervised by a licensed professional and operate within the scope of their supervisor’s license when treating disorders. Unlicensed certificants who provide behavior analytic training for educational or optimal performance purposes do not require licensed supervision. Where the government does not regulate the treatment of medical or psychological disorders certificants should practice in accord with the laws of their state, province, or country. All certificants must practice within their personal areas of expertise.

===Licensure===
Recently, a move has occurred to license behavior analysts.&lt;ref name=Cautilli&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cautilli, J.D., &amp; Weinberg, M.|year=2007|title=Editorial: To license or not to license? That is the question:  Or, if we make a profession, will they come?|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–8.[http://www.baojournal.com/]|doi=10.1037/h0100100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abapracticesig.org/pr01.htm|title=Proposed Regulation: Model Licensing Act for Behavior Analysts|year=2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905130810/http://www.abapracticesig.org/pr01.htm|deadurl=yes|archivedate= September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Licensure's purpose is to protect the public from employing unqualified practitioners.&lt;ref name=Hassert&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hassert, D.L, Kelly, A.N., Pritchard, J.K. &amp; Cautilli, J.D.|year=2008|title=The Licensing of Behavior Analysts: Protecting the profession and the public|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention|volume=5|issue=2|pages=8–19|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/eib/5/2/8.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|doi=10.1037/h0100415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model licensing act states that a person is a behavior analyst by training and experience.  The person seeking licensure must have mastered behavior analysis by achieving a master's degree in behavior analysis or related subject matter. Like all other master level licensed professions (see [[counseling]] and [[licensed professional counselor]]) the model act sets the standard for a master's degree. This requirement states that the person has achieved textbook knowledge of behavior analysis which can be then tested through the exam offered by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board or the one offered by the World Center for Behavior Analysis. It also requires an internship in which a behavior analysts works under another master or Ph.D. level behavior analyst for a period of one year (750 hours) with at least two hours/week of supervision. Finally, those 750 hours are considered tutelage time. After that, the behavior analyst must engage in supervised practice under a behavior analyst for a period of another 2 years (2,000 hours).

Once this process is complete, the person applies to a state board who ensures that he or she has indeed met the above conditions.  Once the person is licensed public protection is still monitored by the licensing board, which makes sure that the person receives sufficient ongoing education, and the licensing board investigates ethical complaints. A licensed behavior analyst would have equal training, knowledge, skills and abilities in their discipline as would a [[mental health counselor]] or [[marriage and family therapist]] in their discipline. In February 2008, [[Indiana]], [[Arizona]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], [[Oklahoma]] and other states now have legislation pending to create licensure for behavior analysts. [[Pennsylvania]] was the first state in 2008 to license "behavior specialists" to cover behavior analysts. Arizona, less than three weeks later, became the first state to license "behavior analysts." Other states such as [[Nevada]] and [[Wisconsin]] also have passed behavior analytic licensure.

==Other countries==
Recently{{when|date=October 2013}} licensure efforts have occurred in [[Canada]] for behavior analysts.

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International has a special interest group for practitioner issues, which focuses on key issues related to licensing behavior analysts. In addition, they have a practice board and a policy board to handle legislative issues [http://www.abainternational.org/ ABA:I]. Finally, the association has recently put out its own model licensing act for behavior analysts.

Association for behavior analysis international serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts.&lt;ref name=Hassert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Twyman, J.S.|year=2007|title=A new era of science and practice in behavior analysis|journal=Association for Behavior Analysis International: Newsletter|volume=30|issue=3|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for Behavior Analysis International sponsors 2 conferences per year – one in the U.S. and one international.

'''Limerence''' is a state of mind which results from a [[Romance (love)|romantic attraction]] to another person and typically includes obsessive thoughts and fantasies and a desire to form or maintain a relationship with the object of love and have one's feelings reciprocated.

==Origin and meaning of the term==
[[Psychologist]] [[Dorothy Tennov]] coined the term "limerence" for her 1979 book, ''Love and Limerence:  The Experience of Being in Love'', to describe a concept that had grown out of her work in the mid-1960s, when she interviewed over 500 people on the topic of love.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennov|first=Dorothy|authorlink=Dorothy Tennov|title=Love and Limerence: the Experience of Being in Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPsDAAAACAAJ|accessdate=12 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Scarborough House|isbn=978-0-8128-6286-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence, which is not exclusively sexual, has been defined in terms of its potentially inspirational effects and in relation to [[attachment theory]]. It has been described as being "an involuntary potentially inspiring state of adoration and attachment to a limerent object (LO) involving [[Intrusive thought|intrusive]] and obsessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors from euphoria to despair, contingent on perceived emotional reciprocation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=Lynn|title=Love and Limerence: Harness the Limbicbrain| year= 2012| publisher= Lathbury House|isbn= 978-1481215312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment theory emphasizes that "many of the most intense [[emotion]]s arise during the formation, the maintenance, the disruption, and the renewal of attachment relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first= John |last= Bowlby| title= Attachment| editor-first= Richard |editor-last= Gregory |work= The Oxford Companion to the Mind| publisher= Oxford |year= 1987| page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that "the state of limerence is the conscious experience of sexual incentive motivation" during attachment formation, "a kind of subjective experience of sexual incentive motivation"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|pp=173, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the "intensive ... pair-forming stage"&lt;ref name="Morris1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; of human affectionate bonding.

==Characteristics==
The concept of 'limerence' "provides a particular carving up of the semantic domain of love",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=V. C. |editor-last=De Munck|title=Romantic Love and Sexual Behavior |year=1998 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents an attempt at a scientific study of the nature of love. Limerence is considered as a [[cognitive]] and emotional state of being emotionally attached to or even obsessed with another person, and is typically experienced involuntarily and characterized by a strong desire for reciprocation of one's feelings—a near-obsessive form of [[Romance (love)|romantic love]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite journal
|last= (unknown)
|first= Wanda
|date= January 21, 1980
|title=Let's Fall in Limerence
|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]
|publisher=Time Inc.
|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952554,00.html
|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Tennov, "sexual attraction is an essential component of limerence ... the limerent is a potential sex partner".&lt;ref name="Tennov"&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is sometimes also interpreted as [[infatuation]], or what is colloquially known as a "crush".  However, in common speech, infatuation includes aspects of immaturity and extrapolation from insufficient information, and is usually short-lived.  Tennov notes how limerence "may dissolve soon after its initiation, as in an early teenage buzz-centered crush",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she is more concerned with the point when "limerent bonds are characterized by 'entropy' crystallization as described by [[Stendhal]] in his 1821 treatise ''On Love'', where a new love infatuation perceptually begins to transform ... [and] attractive characteristics are exaggerated and unattractive characteristics are given little or no attention ... [creating] a 'limerent object'".

According to Tennov, there are at least two types of love: limerence, which she describes as, among other things, "loving attachment", and "loving affection", the bond that exists between an individual and their parents and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/dec/14/features.magazine47 |work= The Guardian |title= That crazy little thing called love |date= 14 December 2003 |accessdate= 15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that one form may evolve into the other: "Those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say ... 'We were very much in love when we married; today we love each other very much'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is comparable to that drawn by [[ethologists]] "between the pair-forming and pair-maintaining functions of sexual activity",&lt;ref name="Morris1994" /&gt; just as "the attachment of the attachment theorists is very similar to the emotional reciprocation longed for in Tennov's limerence, and each is linked to sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is characterized by [[Intrusive thoughts|intrusive thinking]] and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual. It can be experienced as intense [[joy]] or as extreme [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], depending on whether the feelings are reciprocated. Basically, it is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned [[passion (emotion)|passion]] or [[love]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} even to the point of [[Addiction|addictive]]-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt;

Tennov differentiates between limerence and other emotions by asserting that [[love]] involves concern for the other person's welfare and feeling. While limerence does not require it, those concerns may certainly be incorporated. [[Affection]] and fondness exist only as a disposition towards another person, irrespective of whether those feelings are reciprocated, whereas limerence deeply desires reciprocation, but it remains unaltered whether or not it is returned. Physical contact with the object is neither essential nor sufficient to an individual experiencing limerence, unlike with one experiencing [[sexual attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=2|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where early, unhealthy attachment patterns or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] influence limerence, the limerent object may be construed as an idealization of the figure or figures involved in the original unhealthy attachment or trauma. Lack of reciprocation may in such instances serve to reinforce lessons learned in earlier, unhealthy bonding experiences, and hence strengthen the limerence.

==Components==
Limerence involves intrusive thinking about the limerent object.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Other characteristics include acute longing for reciprocation, fear of rejection, and unsettling shyness in the limerent object's presence. In cases of unrequited limerence, transient relief may be found by vividly imagining reciprocation from the limerent object. Tennov suggests that feelings of limerence can be intensified through adversity, obstacles, or distance—'Intensification through Adversity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limerent person may have acute sensitivity to any act, thought, or condition that can be interpreted favorably. This may include a tendency to devise, fabricate, or invent "reasonable" explanations for why neutral actions are a sign of hidden passion in the limerent object.

A person experiencing limerence has a general intensity of feeling that leaves other concerns in the background. In their thoughts, such a person tends to emphasize what is admirable in the limerent object and to avoid any negative or problematic attributes.

===Intrusive thinking and fantasy===
During the height of limerence, thoughts of the limerent object (or person) are at once persistent, involuntary and intrusive. Such 'intrusive thoughts about the LO ... appear to be genetically driven':&lt;ref name="moore268"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, limerence is first and foremost a condition of cognitive obsession. This may be caused by low serotonin levels in the brain, comparable to those of people with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Marazziti D, Akiskal HS, Rossi A, Cassano GB. "Alteration of the platelet serotonin transporter in romantic love." ''Psychol Med.'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt; All events, associations, stimuli, and experiences return thoughts to the limerent object with unnerving consistency, while conversely the constant thoughts about the limerent object define all other experiences. If a certain thought has no previous connection with the limerent object, immediately one is made. Limerent fantasy is unsatisfactory unless rooted in reality,&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; because the fantasizer may want the fantasy to seem realistic and somewhat possible.  At their most severe, intrusive limerent thoughts can occupy an individual's waking hours completely, resulting—like severe addiction—in significant or complete disruption of the limerent's normal interests and activities, including work and family.  For serial limerents, this can result in debilitating, lifelong underachievement in school, work, and family life.  Comparisons{{which|date=December 2013}} made between limerence and substance addiction may draw attention to the constant, free availability of the limerent's "drug of choice".

Fantasies that are concerned with far-fetched ideas are usually dropped by the fantasizer.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Sometimes fantasizing is retrospective: actual events are replayed from memory with great vividness. This form predominates when what is viewed as evidence of possible reciprocation can be re-experienced (a kind of selective or revisionist history). Otherwise, the long fantasy is anticipatory; it begins in the everyday world and climaxes at the attainment of the limerent goal. A limerent fantasy can also involve an unusual, often tragic, event.

The long fantasies form bridges between the limerent's ordinary life and that intensely desired ecstatic moment. The duration and complexity of a fantasy depend on the availability of time and freedom from distractions. The bliss of the imagined moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible (though they often represent grave departures from the probable). Not always is it entirely pleasant, and when rejection seems likely the thoughts focus on despair, sometimes to the point of [[suicide]]. The pleasantness or unpleasantness of the state seems almost unrelated to the intensity of the reaction. Although the direction of feeling, i.e. happy versus unhappy, shifts rapidly, with 'dramatic surges of buoyancy and despair',&lt;ref name=moore268/&gt; the intensity of intrusive and involuntary thinking alters less rapidly, and only in response to an accumulation of experiences with the particular limerent object.

Fantasies are occasionally dreamed by the one experiencing limerence. Dreams give out strong emotion and happiness when experienced, but often end with despair when the subject awakens. Dreams can reawaken strong feelings toward the limerent object after the feelings have declined.

=== Fear of rejection ===
Along with an emphasis on the perceived exceptional qualities, and devotion to them, there is abundant doubt that the feelings are reciprocated: [[social rejection#Romantic rejection|rejection]]. Considerable self-doubt is encountered, leading to "personal incapacitation expressed through unsettling timidity in the presence of the person",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; something which causes misery and galvanizes desire.

In most cases, what destroys limerence is a suitably long period of time without [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocation]]. Although it appears that limerence advances with adversity, personal discomfort may foul it.  This discomfort results from a fear of the limerent object's opinions.

=== Hope ===
Limerence develops and is sustained when there is a certain balance of hope and uncertainty. The basis for limerent hope is not in objective reality but in reality as it is perceived. The inclination is to sift through nuances of speech and [[wikt:subtleties|subtleties]] of behavior for evidence of limerent hope. "Lovers, of course, are notoriously frantic [[epistemologist]]s, second only to paranoiacs (and analysts) as readers of signs and wonders."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Adam. ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; "Little things" are noticed and endlessly analyzed for meaning. Such excessive concern over trivia may not be entirely unfounded, however, as body language can indicate reciprocated feeling. What the limerent object said and did is recalled with vividness. Alternative meanings for the behaviors recalled are sought. Each word and gesture is permanently available for review, especially those interpreted as evidence in favor of reciprocated feeling. When objects, people, places or situations are encountered with the limerent object, they are vividly remembered, especially if the limerent object  interacted with them in some way.

The belief that the limerent object does not and will not reciprocate can only be reached with great difficulty. Limerence can be carried quite far before acknowledgment of rejection is genuine, especially if it has not been addressed openly by the limerent object.

==Effects==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===Physical effects===
The physiological correlations of intense limerence can include [[seizure]]-like [[trembling]], [[pallor]], [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[heart palpitations]], [[pupil dilation]] and general [[Muscle weakness|weakness]]. [[Awkwardness]], [[stuttering]], [[shyness]], and [[confusion]] predominate at the behavioral level. Less common effects include [[insomnia]], [[loss of appetite]],  and [[Syncope (medicine)|passing out]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

If there is extensive [[anxiety]], incorrect behaviour may torpedo the relationship, which may cause physical responses to manifest intensely. Some people acutely feel these effects either immediately or following contact with the limerent object.  Blended is dire ecstasy or keen despair, depending on the turn of events.

The sensitivity that stems from fear of rejection can darken limerent objects' perceived body language. Conflicted signs of [[desire]] may be emitted that confuse judgment.  Often the limerent object is currently involved with another or is in some other way unavailable.

A condition of sustained alertness, a heightening of awareness and an enormous fund of energy to deploy in pursuit of the limerent aim is developed. The sensation of limerence is felt in the midpoint of the chest, bottom of the throat, guts, or in some cases in the abdominal region.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; This can be interpreted as ecstasy at times of mutuality, but its presence is most noticeable during [[Broken heart|despair at times of rejection]].

===Psychological effects===
Sufferers complain of abandonment, despair, and diabolically humiliating disappointment. A sense of paralyzing ambiguity predominates, punctuated by pining. The fact of intermittent or nonreciprocal response lends to labile vacillation. This [[limbo]] is the threshold for mental prostration.

== Sexuality ==
Awareness of [[physical attraction]] plays a key role in the development of limerence,&lt;ref name="Tennov" /&gt; but is not enough to satisfy the limerent desire, and is almost never the main focus; instead, the limerent focuses on what could be defined as the "beneficial attributes". Nevertheless, Tennov stresses that "the most consistent result of limerence is mating, not merely sexual interaction but also commitment".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence can be intensified after a sexual relationship has begun, and with more intense limerence there is greater desire for sexual contact. However, while sexual surrender at one time indicated the end of uncertainty felt by the limerent object – because in the past, a sexual encounter more often led to a feeling of obligation to commit – in modern times this is not necessarily the case.

The sexual aspect of limerence is not consistent from person to person.  Most limerents experience limerent sexuality as a component of romantic interest.  Some limerents, however, may experience limerence as a consequence of hyperarousal. In such cases, limerence may form as a [[defense mechanism]] against the limerent object, who is not perceived initially as a romantic ideal, but as a physical threat to the limerent.

[[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] are distinct from limerent fantasies. Limerent fantasy is rooted in reality and is intrusive rather than voluntary. Sexual fantasies are under more or less voluntary control and may involve strangers, imaginary individuals, and situations that could not take place. Limerence elevates body temperature and increases relaxation{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}, a sensation of viewing the world with [[Optimism|rose-tinted glasses]], leading to a greater receptiveness to sexuality, and to daydreaming.

People can become aroused by the thought of sexual partners, acts, and situations that are not truly desired, whereas every detail of the limerent fantasy is passionately desired actually to take place. Limerence sometimes increases sexual interest in other partners when the limerent object is unreceptive or unavailable.

== Limerent reaction ==
The limerent reaction is a composite reaction – that is, it is composed of a series of separate reactions.  These reactions occur only where misperceptions meet adversity in the context of a romance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Perhaps because of this unique specificity, limerent reactions can be uniquely quantified and predicted according to the schema described below.

Involvement increases if obstacles are externally imposed or if the limerent object’s feelings are doubted. Only if the limerent object were to be revealed as highly undesirable might limerence subside. The presence of some degree of doubt causes the intensity of the feelings to increase further.  The stage is reached at which the reaction is virtually impossible to dislodge. This adversity may be superficial or deep, internal or external, so that an individual may sometimes generate deep adversity where none exists.  Also "romance", as it were, need not be present in any genuine way for a limerent reaction to occur.

The course of limerence results in a more intrusive thinking pattern. This thinking pattern is an expectant and often joyous period with the initial focusing on the limerent object’s admirable qualities: [[crystallization (love)|crystallization]]. Then, under appropriate conditions of hope and uncertainty, the limerence intensifies further.

With evidence of reciprocation (real or imagined) from the limerent object, a state of extreme pleasure, even euphoria, is enjoyed. Thoughts are mainly occupied with considering and reconsidering what is attractive in the limerent object, replaying whatever events may have thus far transpired with the limerent object, and appreciating personal qualities perceived as possibly having sparked interest in the limerent object. At peak crystallization, almost all waking thoughts revolve around the limerent object. After this peak, the feelings eventually decline.

Fantasies are preferred to virtually any other activity with the exception of activities that are believed to help obtain the limerent object, and activities that involve actually being in the presence of the limerent object. The motivation to attain a "relationship" continues to intensify so long as a proper mix of hope and uncertainty exist.

== Limerent duration ==

Tennov estimates, based on both questionnaire and interview data, that the average limerent reaction duration, from the moment of initiation until a feeling of neutrality is reached, is approximately three years. The extremes may be as brief as a few weeks or as long as several decades. When limerence is brief, maximum intensity may not have been attained. According to David Sack, M.D., limerence lasts longer than romantic love, but is shorter than a healthy, committed partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Others suggest that 'the biogenetic sourcing of limerence determines its limitation, ordinarily, to a two-year span',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; that limerence generally lasts between 18 months and three years; but further studies on unrequited limerence have suggested longer durations. In turn, a limerent may only experience a single limerent episode, or may experience "serial" episodes, in which nearly one's entire mature life, from early puberty through late adulthood, can be consumed in successive limerent obsessions.

== Bond varieties ==
{{Main|Human bonding}}
Once the ''limerent reaction'' has initiated, one of three varieties of bonds may form, defined over a set duration of time, in relation to the experience or non-experience of limerence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=1|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution of these bonds may vary over the course of the relationship, in ways that may either increase or decrease the intensity of the limerence.

The basis and interesting characteristic of this delineation made by Tennov, is that based on her research and interviews with people, all human bonded relationships can be divided into three varieties being defined by the amount of limerence or non-limerence each partner contributes to the relationship.

With an affectional bond, neither partner is limerent. With a Limerent-Nonlimerent bond, one partner is limerent. In a Limerent-Limerent bond, both partners are limerent.

Affectional bonding characterize those affectionate sexual relationships where neither partner is limerent; couples tend to be in love, but do not report continuous and unwanted intrusive thinking, feeling intense need for exclusivity, or define their goals in terms of reciprocity.  These types of bonded couples tend to emphasize compatibility of interests, mutual preferences in leisure activities, ability to work together, and in some cases a degree of relative contentment.

The bulk of relationships, however, according to Tennov, are those between a limerent person and a nonlimerent other, i.e. ''limerent-nonlimerent bonding''.  These bonds are characterized by unequal reciprocation.

Lastly, those relationship bonds in which there exists mutual reciprocation are defined as ''limerent-limerent bondings''.  Tennov argues that since limerence itself is an "unstable state", mutually limerent bonds would be expected to be short-lived; mixed relationships probably last longer than limerent-limerent relationships. Some limerent-limerent relationships evolve into affectional bondings over time as limerence declines.  Tennov describes such couples as "old marrieds" whose interactions are typically both stable and mutually gratifying.

==Mitigation==
In her study Tennov identified three ways in which limerence subsides: 
;Consummation (reciprocation)
:Each limerent has a slightly different view of acceptable reciprocation, and the reactions to reciprocation vary.  Some limerents remain limerent (as documented by Tennov), while for others the limerence subsides as the certainty of reciprocity grows.  Other limerents do not achieve any "real" consummation (e.g. physical, or in the form of an actual relationship) but find their limerence waning after a limerent object professes similar feelings.
;Starvation
:In this process, a lack of ''any'' notice (i.e. starvation, described by Tennov as "the onslaught of evidence that LO does not return the limerence") causes the limerent to gradually desensitize. This desensitization may take a long time, in which case a limerent's latent hypersensitivity may cause any attention given by a former LO, regardless of how slight, to be interpreted as a reason for hope, precipitating a resurgence of limerence.
;Transference
:The limerent transfers their romantic feelings to another person, thereby ending the initial limerence; the limerence is sometimes transferred as well.

==Continuing research==
Tennov's research has been continued{{when|refers to 2008 articles|date=January 2018}} by Albert Wakin, who knew Tennov at the [[University of Bridgeport]] but did not assist in her research, and Duyen Vo, a graduate student of [[Southern Connecticut State University]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their goal is to refine the term limerence so that it refers mostly to the negative aspects.

The term "limerence" has been invoked in many popular media,{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} including self-help books, popular magazines, and websites.  However, according to a paper by Wakin and Vo, "In spite of the public’s exposure to limerence, the professional community, particularly clinical, is largely unaware of the concept."&lt;ref name="Wakin-Vo"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Wakin and Vo presented their updated research to the American Association of Behavioral and Social Sciences.  They reported that more research must be gathered before the condition is suitable for inclusion in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM'').&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

Critics point out that Tennov's account "is based on interviews rather than on direct observation", but conclude that "despite its shortcomings, Tennov's work may constitute a basis for informed hypothesis formulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">In [[mathematics]], a sequence {{math|''a''}} = {{math| (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of nonnegative real numbers is called a '''logarithmically concave sequence''', or a '''log-concave sequence''' for short, if {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} holds for {{math|0 &lt; ''i'' &lt; ''n'' }}.

'''Remark:''' some authors (explicitly or not) add two further hypotheses in the definition of log-concave sequences:
* {{math|''a''}}  is non-negative
* {{math|''a''}}  has no internal zeros; in other words, the support of {{math|''a''}} is an interval of {{math|'''Z'''}}.
These hypotheses mirror the ones required for [[Logarithmically_concave_function|log-concave functions]].

Sequences that fulfill the three conditions are also called '''Pòlya Frequency sequences of order 2''' ('''PF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' sequences). Refer to chapter 2 of &lt;ref name="brenti"&gt;Brenti, F. (1989). Unimodal Log-Concave and Pòlya Frequency Sequences in Combinatorics. American Mathematical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; for a discussion on the two notions. 
For instance, the sequence {{math|(1,1,0,0,1)}} checks the concavity inequalities but not the internal zeros condition.

Examples of log-concave sequences are given by the [[binomial coefficient]]s along any row of [[Pascal's triangle]] and the [[Newton's inequalities|elementary symmetric means]] of a finite sequence of real numbers.

* Boots (but not "booty" which is a branch of electro)
* Mash-ups
* Mashed hits
* Smashups (or smash-ups)
* Bastard pop (as in the combined songs are unofficial; this term is rarely used anymore)
* Blends
* Cutups (or cut ups, a term originally coined by [[William S. Burroughs]] to describe some of his literary experiments that involved literally "cutting up" different texts and rearranging the pieces to create a new piece.)
* Powermixing (usually the pace has to be sped up to allow for more song to be played and thus cannot play any single blend for the full length of the song)
* Crossovers, but it is in a form of mashup, or version vs. version.
In addition, more traditional terms such as "edits" or (unauthorized) "remixes" are favored by many "[[Bootleg recording|bootleggers]]" (also known as 'leggers).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==History==
The practice of assembling new songs from purloined elements of other tracks stretches back to the beginnings of recorded music. If one extends the definition beyond the realm of pop, precursors can be found in [[musique concrète]], as well as the classical practice of (re-)arranging traditional [[folk music|folk]] material and the jazz tradition of reinterpreting [[Jazz standard|standards]]. In addition, many elements of mashup culture have antecedents in [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and the [[DIY ethic]] of [[punk rock|punk]] as well as overlap with the [[free culture movement]].

===Precursors===

==== "The Flying Saucer" ====
In 1956, [[Bill Buchanan (songwriter)|Bill Buchanan]] and [[Dickie Goodman]] released what they called a "break-in" song, (i.e. material from one song would "break-in" to another) called "The Flying Saucer". The track, a reinterpretation of [[Orson Welles]]' celebrated ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|War of the Worlds]]'' mock-emergency broadcast interspliced with musical snippets comically dramatizing the portentous [[patter]] of the announcer, spawned a raft of imitations. Goodman had several other similar hits in the 1960s and 1970s.

====Novelty records====
There have been a number of novelty records and one-off hits that have included uncleared samples. The song "[[Your Woman]]" by [[White Town]] features an uncredited sample from a 1932 song "My Woman" by the Lew Stone Band taken from the soundtrack of the [[Dennis Potter]] series ''[[Pennies From Heaven (TV series)|Pennies From Heaven]]''. Other notable one-off bootlegs include [[The DNA Disciples|DNA]]'s dance remix of [[Suzanne Vega]]'s "[[Tom's Diner]]"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/music/suzanne-vega&lt;/ref&gt;(1990) and "You Got The Love" by [[The Source (band)|The Source]] featuring [[Candi Staton]] (1991). Vega received quite a few unsolicited mixes of her (a cappella) song, and eventually issued an entire CD of "Tom's Diner" mixes, one notable example being "Jeannie's Diner", in which a resung verse based on Vega's composition describes the premise of the situation comedy "I Dream of Jeannie". "Tom's Diner" is likely to be the first song that was "mash mixed" as we now know the process.

One series was John Morales' (later one half of M and M productions) "Deadly Medleys", in which he mixed-up disco hits of the moment to form beat-consistent collages. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dutch producer Jaap Eggermont produced the [[Stars on 45]] series of records. These records attempted to cram as many hits as possible into the space of a three and a half-minute pop song, and are more accurately described as medleys. A similar series by [[Mirage (medley group)|Mirage]] in the late 1980s took this further by densely layering the songs on its "Jack Mix" records so that these were very close to later mashups.

Singer-producer [[Jonathan King]] anticipated the mashup genre with several novelty singles. In 1987, King accused the [[Pet Shop Boys]] of plagiarizing the melody of [[Cat Stevens]]' "[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]" for their song "[[It's A Sin]]". To prove the point, King recorded a version of "Wild World" with an arrangement virtually identical to that of "It's A Sin". King performed an analogous stunt with a version of "[[He's So Fine]]" by [[The Chiffons]] arranged in the style of [[George Harrison]]'s "[[My Sweet Lord]]", making a cheeky reference to the plagiarism suit over the similarities between the two songs.

[[Little Roger and the Goosebumps]] released their single "Gilligan's Island (Stairway)", later renamed "Stairway to Gilligan's Island" in May 1978 on their own Splash Records label. The song combines the lyrics to the theme song of the television show ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' with the music of "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]]. Later in 1978, Damaskas and [[Barnes &amp; Barnes]] were inspired by Little Roger and the Goosebumps to record "A Day in the Life of Green Acres," a song that combined the music of [[The Beatles]]' "[[A Day in the Life]]" with the lyrics to the theme song of the television show ''[[Green Acres]]''.

====Frank Zappa====
In the 1970s, [[Frank Zappa]] developed a technique he called "[[xenochrony]]" in which a guitar solo was extracted from its original context and placed into a completely different song. His recording engineer referred to this as "the Ampex guitar". In his rock opera ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' (1979), for example, Zappa's xenochrony can be heard on every track apart from ''Watermelon in Easter Hay''.

"Rubber Shirt" from the album ''[[Sheik Yerbouti]]'' consists of a bass track and a drum track taken from two different live performances melded together in the studio.

====John Zorn====
The 1990 [[John Zorn]] album ''[[Naked City (album)|Naked City]]'' features a version of [[Ornette Coleman]]'s "[[Lonely Woman (composition)|Lonely Woman]]" set over the bassline of [[Roy Orbison]]'s "[[Pretty Woman (song)|Pretty Woman]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Is9QbUl1PJ4C&amp;pg=PA286 |title=Dancing in Your Head|publisher=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====John Oswald====
[[John Oswald (composer)|John Oswald]] has been devising illegitimate compositions since the late 1960s. His 1975 track "Power" married frenetic [[Led Zeppelin]] guitars to the impassioned exhortations of a Southern American evangelist at the same time that [[hip hop music|hip hop]] was discovering the potency of the same (and related) kinds of ingredients. Similarly, his 1990 track "Vane", which pitted two different versions of the song "[[You're So Vain]]" (the [[Carly Simon]] original and a cover by [[Faster Pussycat]]) against each other, was a blueprint for the contemporary mashup subgenre, glitch pop. Oswald coined the term "[[plunderphonics]]" to describe his illegitimate craft. In 1993, he released ''Plexure''. Arguably his most ambitious composition to date, it attempted to microsample the history of CD music up to that point (1982–1992) in a 20-minute collage of bewildering complexity. The ambition of this piece would later be recalled by the British bootlegger [[Osymyso]], whose "[[Intro-Inspection]]" captured the pop-junkie feel of ''Plexure''. Osymyso, who at the time was unaware of Oswald's work, used the same structure of an accelerando (arranging his source material in order from the slowest tempo to the fastest) to link a few bars each of 100 songs, creating a simpler sound than the thousands of overlapping and morphing pop "electroquotations" in ''Plexure''.

====Pink Project====
In 1982, [[Italo disco]] composer and producer Stefano Pulga, under the name [[Pink Project]], had a substantial hit with "Disco Project", a completely re-recorded version of [[The Alan Parsons Project]]'s instrumental track "Mammagamma" (from the album ''[[Eye in the Sky (album)|Eye in the Sky]]''), using "Sirius" (from the same album) as an intro, and featuring the schoolchildren's choir vocals (also entirely re-recorded by female session vocalists) from [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Another Brick in the Wall#Part 2|Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2]]" on top of the Parsons track. Technically more similar to a medley of [[cover version]]s (as it did not include any elements directly taken from the original records) than to a mashup, the record was nevertheless identified with the nascent genre by Italian radio DJs.

====Negativland====
Though [[Negativland]] are seldom acknowledged as musical antecedents of mashups, lacking perhaps the sense of fun many contemporary practitioners seek in their craft, their struggle against various forms of "censorship" (in their terms) and legal coercion (for instance, their single "U2" was one of the first pieces of music to be withdrawn for its use of unauthorised samples) has made them poster children for some mashup commentators who approach the issue from a more critical perspective, and with an eye to the complicated cultural issues raised by both accidental and deliberate plundering within music and culture generally.

====The Tape-beatles====
Also known as "Public Works", [[The Tape-beatles]] have used collage techniques to create works of materials appropriated from various sources.

====Double Dee and Steinski====
Working under the name [[Steinski]], New York [[copywriter]] DJ Steve Stein began (in conjunction with engineer and fellow studio boffin Doug "Double Dee" DiFranco) the next chapter in the evolution of illicit pop by producing a trio of underground 12" singles (entitled "The Payoff Mix" (1983), "Lesson 2 (The James Brown Mix)" (1984) and "Lesson 3 (History of Hiphop)" (1985)) which exerted a powerful influence on an entire generation of "samplists".

====Evolution Control Committee====
In 1994, the experimental band [[Evolution Control Committee]] released the first modern mashup tracks on their hand-made cassette album, ''Gunderphonic''. These "Whipped Cream Mixes" combined a pair of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] a cappellas with instrumentals by [[Herb Alpert]] and the [[Tijuana Brass]]. First released on home-made cassettes in early 1992, it was later pressed on 7" vinyl, and distributed by [[Eerie Materials]] in the mid-1990s, the tracks gained some degree of notoriety on [[college radio]] stations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolution-control.com/sounds/gunderphonic/index.htm] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===

==== ''2 Many DJs'' and "A Stroke of Genie-us" ====
The name [[Pop Will Eat Itself]] was taken from an ''[[NME]]'' feature on the band [[Jamie Wednesday]], written by [[David Quantick]], which proposed the theory that because popular music simply recycles good ideas continuously, the perfect pop song could be written by [combining] the best of those ideas into one track. Hence, Pop Will Eat Itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sickamongthepure.com/files/2002/07/Mansell/Mansell.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010210309/http://www.sickamongthepure.com/files/2002/07/Mansell/Mansell.html|title=Who the hell is Clint Mansell?|archivedate=10 October 2004|publisher=Sickamongthepure.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement gained momentum again in 2001 with the release of the ''2 Many DJs'' album, ''[[As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2]]'', by [[Soulwax]]'s Dewaele brothers, which combined 45 different tracks; the same year a remix of [[Christina Aguilera]]'s "[[Genie in a Bottle]]" was also released by [[Freelance Hellraiser]], which coupled the pop star with the raucous guitars of "[[Hard To Explain]]" by New York's [[The Strokes]] in an infectious concoction entitled "A Stroke of Genie-us".&lt;ref name="Barely Legal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-02-05/music/barely-legal/|title=Barely Legal  |first=Douglas|last=Wolk|date=21 January 2008|publisher=Villagevoice.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Software tools====
As a result of this, industry standard tools such as the [[digital audio workstation]] [[Cubase]] and the sound editors [[Wavelab]], [[Soundforge]] and [[Cool Edit Pro]] quickly became ubiquitous. Moreover, new tools such as [[Ableton Live]] and [[Sonic Foundry]]'s (now [[Magix]]'s) [[ACID Pro]] were tweaked to accommodate the needs of this new "scene". Most notably, such features as beat-mapping (a technique that simplifies the synchronization of samples of different tempos) and online previewing (allowing the composer to audition a sample, playing at the right pitch and tempo, alongside their existing composition) made it easy for many people with musical ability but little professional studio experience to knock together new combinations in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional tools, such as the magnetic tape [[John Oswald (composer)|John Oswald]] (and even [[Coldcut]]) slaved over in their early days.

[[Go Home Productions|Mark Vidler]], known as Go Home Productions, summarized it by saying the benefits of such technology of AcidPro: "You don't need a distributor, because your distribution is the internet. You don't need a record label, because it's your bedroom, and you don't need a recording studio, because that's your computer. You do it all yourself."

==== Get Your Bootleg On, Mashuptown, Bootie, Boomselection, A.D.D ====
Around 2001–2002, the blog Boomselection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boomselection.info/|title=DYMTEST|publisher=Boomselection.info|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched. It publicised various challenges which resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of new bootlegs being uploaded to sites around the world. While the scene began as a primarily British phenomenon, the U.S., France and Germany are currently the hotbeds of the modern mashup movement. However, there are notable bootleggers to be found in practically every corner of the globe – wherever an Internet connection and a record collection can be found – including Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden.

The Get Your Bootleg on site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gybo5.com/|title=GYBO - Index page|publisher=Gybo5.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (affectionately abbreviated to GYBO) became an important launchpad for new mashup tunes, and was the home of a lively community of bootleggers who offered critiques of new songs, tips for newbies, pointers on where to find a cappellas, legal advice, publicity for mashup events and general discussion of issues surrounding the mashup phenomenon.

The name "Get Your Bootleg On" comes from the [[Missy Elliott]] track "[[Get Ur Freak On]]", which alongside [[Eminem]]’s "[[Without Me (Eminem song)|Without Me]]" remains perhaps the most bootlegged, manipulated, remixed and reinterpreted song from the heyday of the genre. Other popular, frequently bootlegged artists include [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]].

In early 2005, Boomselection retired itself after a long period of inactivity. The year also marked a series of cease-and-desist orders brought against a number of bootleg sites, and in early 2006 GYBO received its first such notice. To survive, the site prohibited the posting of direct links to copyrighted material within the forums, but allowed users to post links to their own sites containing such material, the defence being that now GYBO was no more in violation of copyright law than Google. For the most part, the community has rallied around the site, and continues to support it in its new form.

The void left by Boomselection's demise was rapidly replaced by Mashuptown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashuptown.com|title=Mashuptown.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was started in early 2005 and is currently the biggest blog source of mashups on the Internet. The site has recently become the official supplier of mashups to [[Adam Curry]]'s [[Daily Source Code]] [[podcast]].

Also in 2005, [[Bootie (club night)|Bootie]], the biggest bootleg mashup party in the world, began its monthly Bootie Top 10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bootieusa.com/blog/labels/Top10.html |title=Bootie Blog |publisher=Bootieusa.com |accessdate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222011812/http://www.bootieusa.com/blog/labels/Top10.html |archivedate=22 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it posts for free download its ten best mashups, as selected by Bootie creators and DJs [[A Plus D]]. Launched in San Francisco in 2003, Bootie was the first club night in the United States dedicated solely to the burgeoning art form of the bootleg mashup, and now hosts monthly parties in several cities around the globe, including Los Angeles, Paris, Boston, Munich, and New York City. The party's slogan, "Music for the A.D.D. Generation" also inspired the creation of "A.D.D", Israel's first mash-up dedicated party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jam, Billy|url= http://www.newyorkpress.com/20/20/music/Music3.cfm|title= Music For Generation ADD: Mashups quietly mature into a thriving subculture|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725000000/http://www.newyorkpress.com/20/20/music/Music3.cfm |archive-date= July 25, 2008|work=[[New York Press]]|date= May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bonna Music and "Enjoy the Sheket"====
Legal mashups are hard to find, but in some relatively small music markets, legal mashups have been released. Some say that this is because publishers have understood the potential of clearing the rights of major international artist to be combined with local repertoires, to create a wider consumption for both artists on a given track.

In Israel, for example, a group called Bonna Music remixed the [[Depeche Mode]] song "[[Enjoy the Silence]]" with Balagan's "Sheket" ({{lang-he|שקט}}; "Silence"). The mashup was approved by [[Martin Gore]] and released officially a month before [[Depeche Mode]]'s new album ''[[Playing the Angel]]'' in 2005. It was a major hit locally and when Depeche Mode's first single was released they were more welcome in a market where the local repertoire is dominant.

====''Good Copy Bad Copy''====
''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'' is a 2007 documentary about the current state of copyright and culture. It has a heavy focus on the mashup community, containing interviews with [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]] and [[Danger Mouse (music producer)|Danger Mouse]] that reveal an emerging understanding of digital works and the obstacle to their authoring copyright presents.

====''Glee''====
{{Main article|Glee (TV series)}}
Mash-ups have been featured on many episodes of the popular American TV series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. They first appeared in the episode "[[Vitamin D (Glee)|Vitamin D]]", which featured mashing up [[Bon Jovi]]'s "[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]" with [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s "[[Confessions Part II]]" and [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]]'s "[[Halo (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Halo]]" with "[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking on Sunshine]]" by [[Katrina and the Waves]].

====''DJ Hero''====
{{Main article|DJ Hero}}
The 2009 video game ''[[DJ Hero]]'' brought mash-ups together with gameplay elements from the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' series using many of the same songs that are routinely cut-up in the online remixing scene. Notably, the tracks which use musical ideas from "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]" credit the sample source [[Andrew Oldham Orchestra]] rather than [[The Verve]], even though the Verve's use of the sample and the surrounding legal controversy is what popularized the frequent use of the sample in mash-ups.

====''RIP: A Remix Manifesto''====
{{Main article|RiP!: A Remix Manifesto}}
''RIP!: A Remix Manifesto'' is an [[open source]] documentary created by Brett Gaylor and Greg Gillis ([[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]]). The film consists of a remix of clips submitted by numerous contributors to the [[Open Source Cinema]] project. It focuses in particular on the legal "grey area" of remixing existing copyrighted works.

===Legal issues===

====Copyright Act of 1976====
*Lists the rights of copyright holders in the United States, including several copyright provision amendments. It became a law in October 1976 and was implemented in January 1978. 
*Mashup artists are permitted to remake an original song as long as the new song is substantially similar to the original song. In turn, the mashup artist must pay the original artist $0.94 for every copy of the song they sell for a profit. 
*Asking permission to use the song is not required, as long as payment is made.

====Fair Use Law====
*There are 4 factors a piece of work being considered for infringement must go through:
**1. Purpose and character of the use
**2. Nature of the work being used
**3. Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole
**4. Effect on the market for the original

==Subgenres==

===A vs B===
{{See also|List of mashup songs}}

The original manifestation of mashups in the 2000s was putting an a cappella against a completely different backing track, in order to make a "third song". Following "A Stroke of Genie-us" in 2001, the genre has continued to focus on this basic premise.

Another notable "versus" song is "Zombi – [[Zombie Nation (band)|Zombie Nation]]" which combined [[Zombie Nation (band)|Zombie Nation]]'s "[[Kernkraft 400]]" with [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]]'s ''Zombi'' theme and was featured on the official soundtrack of the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.

In addition, [[Go Home Productions]], [[Party Ben]] and [[DJ BC]], amongst many others, have produced a number of critically acclaimed songs in this vein, and in some instances have secured record deals on the back of these exercises, which arguably serve as "demo MP3s" of their musical and production skills.

Another example of a legitimate release on the back of an unofficial one can be seen in [[Illicit (Dance music group)|Illicit]]'s "Sneaky Armada",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Exquisite-EP/release/72643|title=Sneaky Armada|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined [[Groove Armada]]'s "[[I See You Baby]]" with [[Teddy Pendergrass]]'s "You Can't Hide From Yourself". This was subsequently re-played, re-vocalised and re-released on [[Azuli Records|Azuli]]'s Yola label as "Cheeky Armada"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Illicit-Feat-Gramma-Funk-Cheeky-Armada/release/1069370|title=Cheeky Armada|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2001 when it reached number 72 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, David. Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums. Guinness World Records Ltd 17th edition (2004), p. 267 {{ISBN|0-85112-199-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illicit also released numerous other unofficial "versus" songs during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Not+On+Label+(Illicit+Remix+Series)|title=Not On Label (Illicit Remix Series)|publisher=Discogs.com|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all mash-ups are as simple as A vs B. In some cases, DJs will mash 3, 4, 5, and even 6 songs to form one complete track. Mixing more than two tracks together can be a daunting task, and it requires a great deal of skill. Notably, [[DJ Earworm]] has combined the yearly top 25 songs according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' into a single mashup since 2007, which has spawned similar creations from popular DJs such as Robin Skouteris or Daniel Kim. These mashups are typically uploaded to [[YouTube]] and attract a lot of attention in the pop culture world.

[[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]] is known for his style of multi-track mashing; most of his mashups contain samples from 20–30 different tracks. Girl Talk is famous for his style of "cutting" through different songs and often building to the climax of a song, upon which the song settles into a groove before cutting away again.

===Version vs Version===
Mixing two or more versions of a song to create a duet or alternative version of a song is what a version vs version is set to accomplish. It can mix two different versions of a song, such as a ballad and original version, or a [[cover version]] of the song. Some of the more popular version to version mixes are language mixes, which is mixing multiple languages into one song. A slightly less popular style of this is mashing two different remixes or the original and a specific remix of a song together. Version vs Version mashups usually have the same original instrumental but sometimes it is changed to benefit the song.

===Abstract Mash Ups===
Music [[collage]]s which refer to [[avant-garde]] music practice and [[Musique Concrète]]. These are not intended for the dance floor and are made using all types of music and sound as valid sound sources to be played simultaneously and often manipulated. Beat matching and stylistic or aesthetic similarities are not an important factor in these mash ups. Chaos, dissonance and harmony are all possible results.

An early example of this can be heard on [[John Cage]]'s multi-radio composition "Imaginary Landscapes No. 4" (1951) for 12 radios, 24 performers and a conductor. Perhaps the most famous Abstract Mash Up is [[The Beatles]] "[[Revolution 9]]" featuring on their White Album from 1968 which includes samples of conversations, classical music and edited and manipulated samples played simultaneously. Other examples of the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] nature of these mash ups can be heard on "[[Heart Beat, Pig Meat]]" by [[Pink Floyd]] from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''; "[[The Beatles Play the Residents and the Residents Play the Beatles]]" and the album ''[[The Third Reich 'n Roll]]'' by [[The Residents]] and early turntable work by [[Christian Marclay]].

A current (2013) example of Abstract Mash Ups can be heard on radio shows by [[Joel Cahen]] ({{aka}} 'Spax') on [[Resonance fm]] in London. The series of shows which began in 2005, feature live abstract mash ups using MP3s, turntables, CDs, DVDs and field recordings as simultaneously played sound sources. The third season of this series, ''Soundsoup'', March 2008–April 2010, veered the style towards a more narrative based one.

===Glitch pop===
[[Glitch pop]] is a subgenre of the mashup scene which marries the [[Digital Signal Processing]] (DSP) wizardry associated with [[Kid 606]] and [[Tigerbeat6]] records to the ostensibly familiar contours of pop. Sometimes this is done in a spirit of "homage"; sometimes it serves merely as a form of ridicule and even vilification; often it is both at the same time.

An example of the "double science" at play in glitch pop is Skkatter's "Dirty Pop", which takes a song that is already an epic of carefully constructed digital micro-malfunctions ([[Brian Transeau|BT]]'s [[deconstruction]] of [[*NSYNC]]'s "Pop") and pushes it even further out to the margins of musical mayhem. Similarly, Australian bootlegger and glitch pop co-conspirator [[Dsico]] (real name Luke Collinson) has reworked a number of [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] tunes by such artists as [[The Neptunes]] and (again) *NSYNC in a spirit that is at once both satirical and steeped in [[Fan (aficionado)#Fanboy|fanboydom]]. In most cases these remixes render ostensibly mainstream songs "avant garde" and fresh, sometimes by working against the spirit of the original, but often by leveraging the sugar rush at the heart of much of the best contemporary pop, and adding sonic [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to its emotional armoury.

===Audio-Viz Mash===
SiX DwArF is a non-commercial mashup artist from Scotland in the UK with a twist. He creates cross-genre mashup tunes but also invents mashup promo videos to go with them which feature on Mash TV, hosted on Veetle and on various video hosting sites. SiX DwArF also creates homemade promos to champion songs that do not already have one in which he feels deserves it, receiving praise from various artists. His modus operandi is: "There's no campaigns, zero commercial gain, no vested interests. Nothing is sacred. Don't do genre... it's stereotype by another name."{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Remixes===
Technically, all mashups are [[remix]]es. But while most are made up entirely of plundered material, some bootleggers have fused old a cappella tracks with completely new compositions of their own device. An example of popular remix artists that primarily remixes single songs but also mashes songs are [[The White Panda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewhitepanda.com/|title=The White Panda|website=www.thewhitepanda.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Chicago-based duo has emerged as one of the biggest upcoming DJs.

Another popular example with fans of [[J-pop|Japanese pop]] is ''Evil Morning'', an album which combines vocal tracks from [[Morning Musume]] and their associated artists with new instrumental tracks that rearrange or replay the original music in the style of [[hard rock]] or [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

===Bootleg albums===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:GreyAlbum.gif|thumb|right|Promotional artwork by Justin Hampton. This was not used for the actual cover, but appeared on the Danger Mouse website.]] --&gt;
[[DJ Danger Mouse]]'s critically acclaimed remix project ''[[The Grey Album]]'' effectively launched a new pop subgenre. While [[The Beatles]] had made appearances on several mash-up tracks prior to this album (for instance PPM's "A Life in the Day" and JPL's "Let It Be Missy Elliott (Beatlesmix)"), ''The Grey Album'' distinguished itself by being made up entirely of samples from The Beatles' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' and vocals from [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z)|The Black Album]]''. The project received considerable attention following [[EMI]]'s legal threats towards distributors of the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rambarran|first=Shara|year=2013|title=‘99 Problems’ but Danger Mouse Ain’t One: The Creative and Legal Difficulties of Brian Burton, ‘Author’ of The Grey Album|url=http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/03/rambarran.html|journal=Popular Musicology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another album is ''Jon Moskowitz Presents Blue Eyes Meets Bed-Stuy'', produced by DJ Cappel &amp; Smitty (2005). This is a remix/mash-up album of [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. The project was very well received, with major online and print coverage. It was conceived and executive produced by Jon Moskowitz. DJ Cappel and Smitty took The Notorious B.I.G.'s a cappellas and remixed them with notable Frank Sinatra songs, by contributing Sinatra's solos, hooks and choruses.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The ''Best of Bootie'' mashup compilation series is compiled and produced each year by [[A Plus D]], creators of the international mashup club [[Bootie (club night)|Bootie]]. The compilations have been released in December every year since 2005, and are annual Internet sensations, with each album garnering over 5000GB+ of downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/11/mashup-bestof-2006-a.html|title=Mashup best-of 2006 album|work=Boing Boing|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This is NOT a link farm!

===Cut-ups===
While there is some overlap between the terms "cut up" and "mash up", the former has increasingly come to refer to pieces that rely on the humour (or pathos) of reconstructed spoken word and video material. This may be due to the fact that the term "cut up" was used decades earlier by novelist and artist [[William S. Burroughs]] to refer to his literary cutups as well as his tape recorder experiments, which featured spliced vocal tracks in the same way that his written cut-ups literally cut up and rearranged various texts.

The best known cutups remix political speeches and rallies to satirical effect. Simon Hunt, under the pseudonym [[Pauline Pantsdown]] used the speeches of [[Pauline Hanson]], an anti-immigration, controversial Australian politician to parodic effect in the songs [[I Don't Like It]] and [[Backdoor Man]]. Johan Söderberg's "Endless Love", in which [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] appear to serenade each other like lovebirds, [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]' "[[Bushwhacked MP3|Bushwhacked]]", a ''[[Detournement|détournement]]'' of Bush's 2003 [[State of the Union Address]], or ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090906090215/http://onsfoudkilao.neufblog.com/reggaetime/2005/07/sarko_skanking.html Sarkoskanking]'' by Polémix and La Voix Off, a cut-off of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s speeches.

Notable cut up artists include [[Cassetteboy]], [[Osymyso]], [[Rx (band)|rx]], Cartel Communique and [[Evolution Control Committee]].

==Notable mash-up artists==

===Girl Talk===
One of the most well known artists in the mashup industry is Gregg Michael Gillis, otherwise known as [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]]. He studied engineering in college and then quit the industry in 2007 in order to focus solely on his music career. He is originally from Pittsburgh, PA and is one of many artists under the record label, [[Illegal Art]], which specializes in music sampling. Other artists with Illegal Art include Junk Culture and People Like Us. Girl Talk has released five albums with Illegal Art: [[Secret Diary]], [[Unstoppable (Girl Talk album)|Unstoppable]], [[Night Ripper]], [[Feed the Animals]], and [[All Day (Girl Talk album)|All Day]]. Girl Talk does not believe that they are violating any factor of the Fair Use Laws as the law does not specify for mashups and remixes and the length of the song that is used. Thus, Girl Talk feels that they should not have to pay the sustained artists a fee for the work they are using. However, others feel that Girl Talk is violating the Fair Use Law and should be penalized.

===Djs from Mars===
With the rise of [[electronic dance music]] in the mainstream media, Italian duo [[Djs from Mars]] became a notable act in mash-up making.
Most well known for mixing opposite genres, on a 128BPM club beat, the duo has toured the world extensively and their mashups have been played by DJs such as [[David Guetta]], [[Bob Sinclar]], [[Martin Solveig]], among others.
Wearing box-masks over their heads, the satirical duo has been mixing [[Lady Gaga]] with [[Metallica]], [[Skrillex]] with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and over 30 different songs into one with their "Megashuffle MultiBootleg". Djs from Mars' success was confirmed in March 2011, when the pair opened a show for [[Tiesto]], in Atlantic City.

===DJ Earworm===
Jordan Roseman (a.k.a. [[DJ Earworm]]) gained popularity when he came out with his mashup "United States of Pop" in 2007. The mashup contains the top 25 songs of the year according to the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2007]]. He has since released one at the end of each year. Earworm has also released mashups he has done for Capital FM's Summertime Ball since 2010. In addition, Earworm was asked to create multiple mixes for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] to be played at various venues throughout London.

===Mashd N Kutcher===
[[Mashd N Kutcher]] are an Australian live electronic act established in 2014. The duo found acclaim through the mashup releases ‘Mash Machine’, combining vocal rock and pop anthems with current electronic club music. Most well known for their mashup style ‘Collab’ videos, the duo amassed over 1 million followers on Facebook, and are known for their live mashup performances throughout North America and Europe, regularly supporting DJ acts such as [[Borgore]], [[Tiesto]] and [[DJ Snake]]. In 2016 Mashd N Kutcher signed with [[Universal Music Group]] and have achieved multiple gold record status with their singles ‘Do It Now’ and ‘My Sunshine’.

===dj BC===
Bob Cronin (a.k.a. [[dj BC]]) has been heard on radio stations from New York to Paris. He is known for founding both Mash Ave and Bootie Boston. dj BC is associated with the fictional band [[The Beastles]] which BC created in 2004. The band is a combination of music from [[The Beatles]] and the [[Beastie Boys]]. BC's band has released three albums, ''dj BC presents The Beastles'', ''Let It Beast'', and ''Ill Submarine''. Other notable works from BC are ''Glassbreaks'', in which the music of [[Philip Glass]] is combined with artists such as [[Lil Jon]] and [[Kanye West]], and ''Wu Orleans'', a mashup of [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and the local music found in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana for the first anniversary of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

===Max Tannone===
[[Max Tannone]] is a New York-based producer who has released multiple mashup albums. He is most well known for his first album entitled ''[[Jaydiohead]]'' released in 2009. The album combined the music of [[Jay-Z]] and [[Radiohead]]. Tannone has since released seven more albums, ''[[Doublecheck Your Head]]'', ''[[Mos Dub]]'', ''[[Dub Kweli]]'', ''Selene'', ''Ghostfunk'', ''Mic Check 1234!'', and ''Champagne Jerry - For Real, You Guys''.

===The Kleptones===
[[The Kleptones]] is a one-man musical group led by English producer Eric Kleptone. Their first release was in 2003 with their album ''[[Yoshimi Battles the Hip-Hop Robots]]''. It was not until 2004 though that they received attention with their album ''[[A Night at the Hip-Hopera]]''. The album combined the music of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] with various music selections from rap, movies, and other various sources. In 2005, Eric Kleptone was awarded the [[Webby Award]] for Artist of the Year by the [[International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/specialwin.php]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003145130/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/specialwin.php |date=3 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DJ Cummerbund===
NY-based DJ Craigory Morgoone (a.k.a. DJ Cummerbund) received worldwide attention and critical acclaim after releasing his mashup "The Sound of Smash Mouth" which featured a variety of sad movie scenes to accompany the melancholy amalgamation of [[All Star (song)|All Star]] by [[Smash Mouth]] and a cover of [[The Sound of Silence]] by American heavy metal band [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/shed-a-tear-for-this-sad-remix-of-smash-mouths-all-star/|title=Shed A Tear For This Sad Remix Of Smash Mouth's 'All Star'|publisher=nerdist.com|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, he continues to release mashups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digg.com/video/pantsfeet-dj-cummerbund-nickelback/|title='PantsFeet' Is The Cool New Nickelback Jam That Will Speak To Your Soul|publisher=digg.com|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-11-30/rushs-yyz-finally-gets-a-vocal-in-mysterious-milkshake-mash-up|title=Rush's YYZ finally gets a vocal in mysterious Milkshake mash-up|publisher=teamrock.com|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; via [[YouTube]] and occasionally perform live DJ sets in the NY metro area.

===The Legion of Doom===
[[The Legion of Doom (mash up group)|The Legion of Doom]] is an electronic production team consisting of [[Chad Blinman]] and [[Trever Keith]]. The group is most known for their album ''[[Incorporated (Legion of Doom album)|Incorporated]]'' which featured a variety of A vs B style mashups. The album was originally leaked online due to multiple artists not wanting their music being used in mashups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-legion-of-doom.com/?p=10 |title=The Legion of Doom  » Blog Archive   » ‘Incorporated’ goes live |publisher=The-legion-of-doom.com |accessdate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210040453/http://www.the-legion-of-doom.com/?p=10 |archivedate=10 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/15898|title=The Legion of Doom leak own album|publisher=Punknews.org|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album has since been released through [[Illegal Art]].

In [[probability]] and [[statistics]], a '''mixture distribution''' is the [[probability distribution]] of a [[random variable]] that is derived from a collection of other random variables as follows: first, a random variable is selected by chance from the collection according to given probabilities of selection, and then the value of the selected random variable is realized. The underlying random variables may be random real numbers, or they may be [[random vector]]s (each having the same dimension), in which case the mixture distribution is a [[multivariate distribution]].

In cases where each of the underlying random variables is [[Continuous random variable|continuous]], the outcome variable will also be continuous and its [[probability density function]] is sometimes referred to as a '''mixture density'''. The [[cumulative distribution function]] (and the [[probability density function]] if it exists) can be expressed as a [[convex combination]] (i.e. a weighted sum, with non-negative weights that sum to 1) of other distribution functions and density functions. The individual distributions that are combined to form the mixture distribution are called the '''mixture components''', and the probabilities (or weights) associated with each component are called the '''mixture weights'''.  The number of components in mixture distribution is often restricted to being finite, although in some cases the components may be [[countable|countably infinite]]. More general cases (i.e. an [[uncountable]] set of component distributions), as well as the countable case, are treated under the title of '''[[compound probability distribution|compound distributions]]'''.

A distinction needs to be made between a [[random variable]] whose distribution function or density is the sum of a set of components  (i.e. a mixture distribution) and a random variable whose value is the sum of the values of two or more underlying random variables, in which case the distribution is given by the [[convolution]] operator.  As an example, the sum of two [[Multivariate normal distribution|jointly normally distributed]] random variables, each with different means, will still have a normal distribution.  On the other hand, a mixture density created as a mixture of two normal distributions with different means will have two peaks provided that the two means are far enough apart, showing that this distribution is radically different from a normal distribution.

Mixture distributions arise in many contexts in the literature and arise naturally where a [[statistical population]] contains two or more [[subpopulation]]s. They are also sometimes used as a means of representing non-normal distributions. Data analysis concerning [[statistical model]]s involving mixture distributions is discussed under the title of [[mixture model]]s, while the present article concentrates on simple probabilistic and statistical properties of mixture distributions and how these relate to properties of the underlying distributions.

== Finite and countable mixtures ==
[[Image:Gaussian-mixture-example.svg|thumb|Density of a mixture of three normal distributions (μ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, 10, 15, σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) with equal weights. Each component is shown as a weighted density (each integrating to 1/3)]]

Given a finite set of probability density functions ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), …, ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), or corresponding cumulative distribution functions  ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), …, ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') and '''weights''' ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''w&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that {{nowrap|''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ 0}} and {{nowrap|∑''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1, }} the mixture distribution can be represented by writing either the density, ''f'',  or the distribution function, ''F'', as a sum (which in both cases is a convex combination):
:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, P_i(x), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, p_i(x) .&lt;/math&gt;
This type of mixture, being a finite sum, is called a '''finite mixture,''' and in applications, an unqualified reference to a "mixture density" usually means a finite mixture. The case of a countably infinite set of components is covered formally by allowing &lt;math&gt; n = \infty\!&lt;/math&gt;.

== Uncountable mixtures ==
{{Main article|Compound distribution}}

Where the set of component distributions is [[uncountable]], the result is often called a [[compound probability distribution]]. The construction of such distributions has a formal similarity to that of mixture distributions, with either infinite summations or integrals replacing the finite summations used for finite mixtures.

Consider a probability density function ''p''(''x'';''a'') for a variable ''x'', parameterized by ''a''. That is, for each value of ''a'' in some set ''A'', ''p''(''x'';''a'') is a probability density function with respect to ''x''. Given a probability density function ''w'' (meaning that ''w'' is nonnegative and integrates to 1), the function

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \int_A \, w(a) \, p(x;a) \, da &lt;/math&gt;

is again a probability density function for ''x''. A similar integral can be written for the cumulative distribution function. Note that the formulae here reduce to the case of a finite or infinite mixture if the density ''w'' is allowed to be a [[generalized function]] representing the "derivative" of the cumulative distribution function of a [[discrete distribution]].

==Mixtures within a parametric family==
The mixture components are often not arbitrary probability distributions, but instead are members of a [[parametric family]] (such as normal distributions), with different values for a parameter or parameters. In such cases, assuming that it exists, the density can be written in the form of a  sum as:
:&lt;math&gt; f(x; a_1, \ldots , a_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, p(x;a_i) &lt;/math&gt;
for one parameter, or
:&lt;math&gt; f(x; a_1, \ldots , a_n, b_1, \ldots , b_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, p(x;a_i,b_i) &lt;/math&gt;
for two parameters, and so forth.

== Properties ==

=== Convexity ===
A general [[linear combination]] of probability density functions is not necessarily a probability density, since it may be negative or it may integrate to something other than 1. However, a [[convex combination]] of probability density functions preserves both of these properties (non-negativity and integrating to 1), and thus mixture densities are themselves probability density functions.

=== Moments ===
Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denote random variables from the ''n'' component distributions, and let ''X'' denote a random variable from the mixture distribution. Then, for any function ''H''(·) for which &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[H(X_i)]&lt;/math&gt; exists, and assuming that the component densities ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') exist,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[H(X)] &amp; = \int_{-\infty}^\infty H(x) \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i p_i(x) \, dx \\
&amp; = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \int_{-\infty}^\infty p_i(x) H(x) \, dx = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \operatorname{E}[H(X_i)].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is a trivial matter to note that the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; moment about zero (i.e. choosing {{nowrap|''H''(''x'') {{=}} ''x&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;''}}) is simply a weighted average of the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; moments of the components.  Moments about the mean {{nowrap|''H''(''x'') {{=}} (''x − μ'')&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;}} involve a binomial expansion:&lt;ref&gt;Frühwirth-Schnatter (2006, Ch.1.2.4)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[(X - \mu)^j] &amp; = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \operatorname{E}[(X_i - \mu_i + \mu_i - \mu)^j] \\
&amp; = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=0}^j \left( \begin{array}{c} j \\ k \end{array} \right) (\mu_i - \mu)^{j-k} w_i \operatorname{E}[(X_i- \mu_i)^k],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the mean of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component.

In case of a mixture of one-dimensional distributions with weights ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', means ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and variances ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the total mean and variance will be:
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[X] = \mu = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \mu_i ,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[(X - \mu)^2] = \sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i(\mu_i^{2} + \sigma_i^2) - \mu^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

These relations highlight the potential of mixture distributions to display non-trivial higher-order moments such as [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]] ('''[[fat tail]]s''') and multi-modality, even in the absence of such features within the components themselves.  Marron and Wand (1992) give an illustrative account of the flexibility of this framework.&lt;ref name="Marron92"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Exact Mean Integrated Squared Error |first1=J.

===Modes===

The question of [[Multimodal distribution|multimodality]] is simple for some cases, such as mixtures of [[exponential distribution]]s: all such mixtures are [[Unimodality|unimodal]].&lt;ref&gt;Frühwirth-Schnatter (2006, Ch.1)&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the case of mixtures of [[normal distribution]]s, it is a complex one. Conditions for the number of modes in a multivariate normal mixture are explored by Ray and Lindsay&lt;ref name=rayLindsay&gt;{{citation

Here the problem of evaluation of the modes of a ''n'' component mixture in a ''D'' dimensional space is reduced to identification of critical points (local minima, maxima and saddle points) on a [[manifold]] referred to as the ridgeline surface, which is the image of the ridgeline function
:&lt;math&gt; x^{*}(\alpha) = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \Sigma_i^{-1} \right]^{-1} \times \left[  \sum_{i=1}^{n}  \alpha_i \Sigma_i^{-1} \mu_i \right],
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''α'' belongs to the {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} dimensional '''unit simplex'''
&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}_n  = 
 \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n: \alpha_i \in [0,1], \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i = 1 \}
&lt;/math&gt;
and {{nowrap|Σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''D'' × ''D''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;}} correspond to the covariance and mean of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component.  Ray and Lindsay{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} consider the case in which {{nowrap|''n'' − 1 &lt; ''D''}} showing a one-to-one correspondence of modes of the mixture and those on the '''elevation function''' {{nowrap|''h''(''α'') {{=}} ''q''(''x*''(''α''))}}
thus one may identify the modes by solving  &lt;math&gt;  \frac{d h(\alpha)}{d \alpha} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;  with respect to ''α'' and determining the value ''x*''(''α'').

Using graphical tools, the potential multi-modality of {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} {2, 3}}} mixtures is demonstrated; in particular it is shown that the number of modes may exceed ''n'' and that the modes may not be coincident with the component means.   For two components they develop a graphical tool for analysis by instead solving the aforementioned differential with respect to ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and expressing the solutions as a function Π(''α''), {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ [0, 1]}} so that the number and location of modes for a given value of ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the number of intersections of the graph on the line {{nowrap|Π(''α'') {{=}} ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  This in turn can be related to the number of oscillations of the graph and therefore to solutions of &lt;math&gt; \frac{d \Pi(\alpha)}{d \alpha} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; leading to an explicit solution for a two component [[homoscedastic]] mixture given by
:&lt;math&gt;  1 - \alpha(1-\alpha) d_M(\mu_1, \mu_2, \Sigma)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where {{nowrap|''d&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''(''μ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Σ) {{=}} (''μ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''μ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the [[Mahalanobis distance]].

Since the above is quadratic it follows that in this instance there are at most two modes irrespective of the dimension or the weights.

== Examples ==

Simple examples can be given by a mixture of two normal distributions. (See [[Multimodal distribution#Mixture of two normal distributions]] for more details.)

Given an equal (50/50) mixture of two normal distributions with the same standard deviation and different means ([[homoscedastic]]), the overall distribution will exhibit low [[kurtosis]] relative to a single normal distribution – the means of the subpopulations fall on the shoulders of the overall distribution. If sufficiently separated, namely by twice the (common) standard deviation, so &lt;math&gt;\left|\mu_1 - \mu_2\right| &gt; 2\sigma,&lt;/math&gt; these form a [[bimodal distribution]], otherwise it simply has a wide peak.&lt;ref name="Schilling2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is Human Height Bimodal?|first1=Mark F. |last1=Schilling |first2= Ann E.| last2=Watkins|author2-link=Ann E. Watkins |first3=William |last3=Watkins| journal=[[The American Statistician]]| doi=10.1198/00031300265 |volume=56 |year=2002| pages=223–229 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variation of the overall population will also be greater than the variation of the two subpopulations (due to spread from different means), and thus exhibits [[overdispersion]] relative to a normal distribution with fixed variation &lt;math&gt;\sigma,&lt;/math&gt; though it will not be overdispersed relative to a normal distribution with variation equal to variation of the overall population.

Alternatively, given two subpopulations with the same mean and different standard deviations, the overall population will exhibit high kurtosis, with a sharper peak and heavier tails (and correspondingly shallower shoulders) than a single distribution.

== Applications ==
{{details|Mixture model}}
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
Mixture densities are complicated densities expressible in terms of simpler densities (the mixture components), and are used both because they provide a good model for certain data sets (where different subsets of the data exhibit different characteristics and can best be modeled separately), and because they can be more mathematically tractable, because the individual mixture components can be more easily studied than the overall mixture density.

Mixture densities can be used to model a [[statistical population]] with [[subpopulation]]s, where the mixture components are the densities on the subpopulations, and the weights are the proportions of each subpopulation in the overall population.

Mixture densities can also be used to model [[experimental error]] or contamination – one assumes that most of the samples measure the desired phenomenon,

Parametric statistics that assume no error often fail on such mixture densities – for example, statistics that assume normality often fail disastrously in the presence of even a few [[outliers]] – and instead one uses [[robust statistics]].

In [[meta-analysis]] of separate studies, [[study heterogeneity]] causes distribution of results to be a mixture distribution, and leads to [[overdispersion]] of results relative to predicted error. For example, in a [[statistical survey]], the [[margin of error]] (determined by sample size) predicts the [[sampling error]] and hence dispersion of results on repeated surveys. The presence of study heterogeneity (studies have different [[sampling bias]]) increases the dispersion relative to the margin of error.

[[File:Ramesses II cartouches at Tanis.jpg|right|thumb|A [[cartouche]] indicates that the [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s  enclosed are a [[pharaoh|royal]] name.]]
  
A '''name''' is a [[term (language)|term]] used for identification. Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. The entity identified by a name is called its [[referent]]. A [[personal name]] identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a ''specific'' individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a [[proper name]] (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a [[proper noun]]. Other nouns are sometimes called "'''common names'''" or ([[obsolete]]) "'''general names'''". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name.

Caution must be exercised when translating, for there are ways that one language may prefer one type of name over another. For example, the French sometimes refer to [[Aristotle]] as "le Stagirite" from one spelling of his place of birth, and English speakers often refer to [[Shakespeare]] as "The [[Bard]]", recognizing him as a paragon writer of the language.

== Etymology ==
The word "name" comes from [[Old English]] ''nama''; cognate with [[Old High German]] (OHG) ''namo'', [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|नामन्}} (''nāman''), [[Latin]] ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'', [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ὄνομα}} (''onoma''), and [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|نام}} (''nâm''), from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) ''*h₁nómn̥''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Online Etymology Dictionary |url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=name&amp;searchmode=none |accessdate = 2008-09-20 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080928032054/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=name&amp;searchmode=none |archivedate = 2008-09-28 |df =  }}; The asterisk before a word indicates that it is a hypothetical construction, not an attested form.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps connected to non-Indo-European terms such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]] {{lang|ta|நாமம்}} (''namam'') and [[Proto-Uralic language|Proto-Uralic]] ''*nime''.

== Individual names ==
A [[personal name]] is an identifying word or words by which an individual is intimately known or designated such as "Andre," "Sophia-Grace," or "Mohammed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=personal name |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/personal%20name |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditional for individuals to have a personal name (also called a "first name") and a last name (also called a "[[family name]]" or "[[surname]]" because it is shared by members of the same family).&lt;ref name="general"&gt;{{cite web |title=General words for names, and types of name |url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/thesaurus-category/british/general-words-for-names-and-types-of-name |website=macmillandictionary.com |publisher=Macmillan Dictionary |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middle names]] are also used by many people as a third identifier, and can be chosen for personal reasons including signifying relationships, preserving pre-marital/maiden names (a popular practice in the United States), and to perpetuate family names.

The practice of using middle names dates back to ancient Rome, where it was common for members of the elite to have a ''[[praenomen]]'' (a personal name), a ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' (a family name, not exactly used the way middle names are used today), and a ''[[cognomen]]'' (a name representing an individual attribute or the specific branch of a person's family).&lt;ref name="middle"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fabry |first1=Merrill |title=Now You Know: Why Do We Have Middle Names? |url=http://time.com/4451977/history-of-middle-names/ |website=Time.com |publisher=Time |accessdate=18 June 2018 |language=English |format=web article |date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle names eventually fell out of use, but regained popularity in Europe during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="middle" /&gt;

Besides first, middle, and last names, individuals may also have [[nicknames]], [[aliases]], or [[titles]]. Nicknames are informal names used by friends or family to refer to a person ("Chris" may be used as a short form of the personal name "Christopher"). A person may choose to use an alias, or a fake name, instead of their real name, possibly to protect or obscure their identity. People may also have titles designating their role in an institution or profession (members of royal families may use various terms such as [[King]], [[Queen (disambiguation)|Queen]], [[Duke]], or [[Duchess]] to signify their positions of authority or their relation to the throne).&lt;ref name="general" /&gt;

== In religious thought ==

{{Globalize|section|date=October 2017}}
{{Further|Names of God}}

In the ancient world, particularly in the ancient near-east ([[Israel]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], [[Persia]]) names were thought to be extremely powerful and act, in some ways, as a separate manifestation of a person or deity.&lt;ref&gt;"Egyptian Religion", E. A. Wallis Budge", Arkana 1987 edition, {{ISBN|0-14-019017-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint is responsible both for the [[Names of God in Judaism|reluctance to use]] the [[YHWH|proper name]] of [[God]] in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] writing or speech, as well as the common understanding in ancient [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] that magical rituals had to be carried out "in [someone's] name". By invoking a [[deity|god]] or [[spirit]] by name, one was thought to be able to summon that spirit's power for some kind of miracle or magic (see [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 9:49, in which the disciples claim to have seen a man driving out [[demons]] using the name of [[Jesus]]). This understanding passed into later religious tradition, for example the stipulation in [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[exorcism]] that the demon cannot be expelled until the exorcist has forced it to give up its name, at which point the name may be used in a stern command which will drive the demon away.

'''Quranic names''' (Arabic names)

We can see many Arabic names in the Quran and in Muslim people. Like the names Allah, Muhammad, Khwaja, Ismail, Mehboob, Suhelahmed, Shoheb Ameena, Aaisha, Sameena, Rumana, Swaleha, etc. The name Mohammed and Ahmed are same, for example Suhel Ahmad or Mohammad Suhel are same. In Islam and in Christianity we can see many similar names like (the first name is Islamic name and the second name is Christian name Islamic/Christian) Adam/Adam, Yusuf/Joseph, Dawood/David, Rumana/Romana, Maryam/Mary, Noah/Nuh and etc.

=== Biblical names ===
{{Main|List of biblical names}}

In the [[Old Testament]], the names of individuals are meaningful, and a change of name indicates a change of status. For example, the patriarch [[Abram]] and his wife Sarai were renamed "[[Abraham]]" and "[[Sarah]]" at the institution of the [[Abrahamic covenant]] ([[Genesis 17]]:4, 17:15). Simon was renamed Peter when he was given the [[Keys to Heaven]]. This is recounted in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] chapter 16, which according to Roman Catholic teaching&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church, para 881: "The episcopal college and its head, the Pope"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906142233/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm |date=2010-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was when [[Jesus]] promised to [[Saint Peter]] the power to take binding actions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Companion to the Christian Church'' by Gerard Mannion and Lewis S. Mudge (Jan 30, 2008) {{ISBN|0415374200}} page 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Bible]], characters are given names at birth that reflect something of significance or describe the course of their lives.  For example: ''[[Solomon]]'' meant [[peace]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}, and the king with that name was the first whose reign was without [[war]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.  Likewise, [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] named his firstborn son [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] (Hebrew: "causing to forget")(Genesis 41:51); when Joseph also said, "“God has made me forget all my troubles and everyone in my father's family.”

Biblical Jewish people did not have surnames which were passed from generation to generation.  However, they were typically known as the child of their father.  For example: דוד בן ישי (David ben Yishay) meaning, [[David]], son of [[Jesse]] (1 Samuel 17:12,58).

=== Talmudic attitudes ===
The [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] maintains that names exert a mystical influence over their bearers, and a change of name is one of four actions that can avert an evil heavenly decree, that would lead to punishment after one's death.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Rabbinical commentators differ as to whether the name's influence is [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], connecting a person to their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], or bio-socio-psychological, where the connection affects his personality, appearance and social capacities. The Talmud also states that all those who descend to [[Gehenna]] will rise in the time of Messiah. However, there are three exceptions, one of which is he who calls another by a derisive [[nickname]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Naming convention ==
: ''For Wikipedia's own naming conventions see [[Wikipedia:Article titles]]''
A '''naming convention''' is an attempt to systematize names in a field so they unambiguously convey similar information in a similar manner.

Several major naming conventions include:
* In [[astronomy]], '''[[planetary nomenclature]]'''
* In [[classics]], '''[[Roman naming conventions]]'''
* In [[computer programming]], '''[[identifier naming convention]]s'''
* In [[computer networking]], '''[[computer naming scheme]]s'''
* In the [[science]]s, '''[[systematic name]]s''' for a variety of things

Naming conventions are useful in many aspects of everyday life, enabling the casual user to understand larger structures.

[[Street name]]s within a city may follow a naming convention; some examples include:
* In [[Manhattan]], [[roads]] that cross the island from east to west are called "Streets".  Those that run the length of the island (north–south) are called "Avenues". Most of Manhattan's streets and avenues are numbered, with "1st Street" being near the southern end of the island, and "219th Street" being near the northern end, while "1st Avenue" is near the eastern edge of the island and "12th Avenue" near the western edge.
* In [[Ontario]], numbered [[concession (contract)|concession]] roads are east–west whereas "lines" are north–south routes.
* In [[San Francisco]] at least three series of parallel streets are alphabetically named, e.g. ''Irving, Judah, Kirkham, Lawton, Moraga, Noriega, Ortega, Pacheco, Quintara, Rivera, Santiago, Taraval, Ulloa, Vicente, Wawona''.
* The same tendency is seen in the [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]] neighborhood of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where Arlington Street is followed by roads to the west running parallel to it and named Berkeley, Clarendon, Dartmouth, Exeter, Fairfield, Gloucester, and Hereford.
* In [[Washington, DC]], East Capitol Street runs east–west through the Capitol. East–west streets moving away from Capitol Street toward both the south (toward the [[Potomac River]]) and the north are lettered A, B, C,..., omitting J to avoid confusion on street signs and addresses, but after these are exhausted to the north, the streets are named with simple words in alphabetical order, omitting a few letters such as "x". The first cycle of names consists all of one-syllable words; then followed by a cycle of two-syllable words; then followed by a cycle of three-syllable words, and before these are exhausted, Maryland is reached. (Washington has north-south streets that are numbered, increasing to either side of North Capitol which likewise runs through the Capitol.) Suffixes (NE, SW, etc.) are used to distinguish between (up to four) duplicate addresses. For example, 140 D Street SW, to indicate  the 140 D Street location southwest of the Capitol
* In [[Montgomery, Alabama]], the old major avenues are named for the Presidents of the United States, in their order of entering office, omitting John Quincy Adams. Hence, these streets are Washington Ave., Adams Ave., Jefferson Ave., Madison Ave., Monroe Ave., Jackson Ave.
* In [[Brampton, Ontario]], different sections of town all have streets starting with the same letter and the alphabetical order reflects [[chronology]].
* In [[Phoenix, Arizona]], roads east of Central Avenue are termed streets, while those west are avenues. A similar system applies in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], but only to the numbered avenues and streets, west and east of the [[Cumberland River]] respectively, all of which run roughly north–south.

Large corporate, university, or government campuses may follow a naming convention for rooms within the buildings to help orient [[tenants]] and visitors. Otherwise, rooms may be numbered in some kind of a rational scheme.

Parents may follow a naming convention when selecting names for their children.  Some have chosen alphabetical names by birth order. In some East Asian cultures, it is common for one syllable in a two-syllable given name to be a [[generation name]] which is the same for immediate siblings.  In many cultures it is common for the son to be named after the father or a grandfather. In certain African cultures, such as in Cameroon, the eldest son gets the family name for his given name.

In other cultures, the name may include the place of residence, or the place of birth. The [[Roman naming convention]] denotes social rank.

Products may follow a naming convention.  [[Automobile]]s typically have a binomial name, a "make" (manufacturer) and a "model", in addition to a model year, such as a 2007 [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. Sometimes there is a name for the car's "decoration level" or "trim line" as well: e.g., [[Cadillac Escalade EXT]] ''[[Platinum]]'', after the precious metal. [[Computers]] often have increasing numbers in their names to signify the next generation.

Courses at schools typically follow a naming convention: an abbreviation for the subject area and then a number ordered by increasing level of difficulty.

Many numbers (e.g. bank accounts, government IDs, credit cards, etc.) are not random but have an internal structure and convention.  Virtually all organizations that assign names or numbers will follow some convention in generating these identifiers.  Airline flight numbers, [[List of space shuttle missions|space shuttle flight numbers]], even [[phone number]]s all have an internal convention.

===Brand names===
{{Main|Brand}}

Developing a name for a brand or product is heavily influenced by [[marketing research]] and [[marketing strategy|strategy]] to be appealing and marketable.  The brand name is often a [[neologism]] or [[pseudoword]], such as [[Kodak]] or [[Sony]].

==Name used by animals==

The use of personal names is not unique to humans. [[Dolphin]]s and [[green-rumped parrotlet]]s also use symbolic names, as has been shown by recent research.&lt;ref name="dolphin names"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/060508_dolphins.html|publisher=National Geographic News|title=Dolphins Name Themselves With Whistles, Study Says|date=May 8, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114081946/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/060508_dolphins.html|archivedate=November 14, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual dolphins have distinctive whistles, to which they will respond even when there is no other information to clarify which dolphin is being referred to.

{{Nationalism sidebar |Development|nocat=false}} 
A '''national language''' is a [[language]] (or [[variety (linguistics)|language variant]], e.g. [[dialect]]) that has some connection—[[de facto]] or [[de jure]]—with people and the territory they occupy. There is little consistency in the use of this term. One or more languages spoken as  [[first language]]s in the territory of a country may be referred to informally or designated in legislation as national languages of the country. National or [[national language]]s are mentioned in over 150 world constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/index.html Jacques Leclerc, ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', CEFAN, Université Laval]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- it would be helpful to narrow this down to just the number of constitutions that mention "national language," or to be precise as to the number of constitutions mentioning each or both, and it would be helpful to look for better sources --&gt;

[[C.M.B. Brann]], with particular reference to India, suggests that there are "four quite distinctive meanings" for national language in a polity:&lt;ref&gt;Brann, C.M.B. 1994. "The National Language Question: Concepts and Terminology." ''Logos'' [University of Namibia, Windhoek] Vol 14: 125–134&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Territorial language" (''chthonolect'', sometimes known as ''chtonolect''&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, H. Ekkehard "African Languages: An Introduction Ch./Art: Language and Society p. 321 pub. Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;) of a particular people
*"[[Regional language]]" (''choralect'')
*"Language-in-common or community language" (''demolect'') used throughout a country
*"Central language" (''politolect'') used by government and perhaps having a symbolic value.
The last is usually given the title of [[official language]].

[[Standard language]]s, such as [[Standard German]], [[Standard French]], and [[Standard Spanish]], may serve as national (language-in-common), regional, and international languages.

== Official versus national languages ==
{{See also|Linguistic prescription|Linguistic rights}}
"National language" and "[[official language]]" are best understood as two concepts or legal categories with ranges of meaning that may coincide, or may be intentionally separate. [[Stateless nation]]s are not in the position to legislate an [[official language]], but their languages may be sufficiently distinct and well-preserved to be national languages. Some languages may be recognized popularly as "national languages," while others may enjoy official recognition in use or promotion.

In many African countries, some or all indigenous [[African languages]] are officially used, promoted, or expressly allowed to be promoted (usually taught in schools and written in important publications) as semi-official languages whether by long-term legislation or short-term, case-by-case executive (government) measures. 
To be official, spoken and written languages may enjoy government or federalised use, major tax-funded promotion or at least full tolerance as to their teaching and employers' recognition in [[public education]], standing on equal footing with the official language(s). Further, they may enjoy recognition as a language used in compulsory schooling and treasury money may be spent to teach or encourage adults in learning a language which is a minority language in a particular area to restore its understanding and spread its moral stories, rhymes, poems, phrases, songs, and other literary heritage which will promote [[social cohesion]] (where other languages remain) or will promote [[nationalism|nationalist differentiation]] where another, non-indigenous language is deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;''20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language'' http://www.plean2028.ie/en/node/14{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Williams | first = Colin H. | editor-last = Coupland | editor-first = Nikolas | title = English in Wales: Diversity, Conflict, and Change | place = Clevedon, Avon | publisher = Multilingual Matters | year = 1990 | contribution = The Anglicisation of Wales | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=monoglot+welsh+speakers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;sig=TiQ9apFsrgJiFz1ielo2OZCPRq8 | pages = 38–41 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=G1SHcB_0Rl&amp;dq=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armenia===
Armenia's national language is a separate branch in the linguistic family of Indo-European languages, Armenian. Armenian is widely spoken in Armenia as well as in its diaspora. The Armenian spoken in Armenia is known as Eastern Armenian, and this dialect is spoken as well, in the Armenian communities of Russia and Iran. While on the other hand, other Armenian communities such as the Armenian communities of Lebanon, Syria, Jerusalem etc. speak the Western Armenian dialect. |°

=== Australia ===
Australia has no [[official language]], but is largely [[monoglottism|monolingual]] with English being the ''de facto'' national language. A considerable proportion of first and second generation migrants are bilingual. According to Ethnologue, 81% of people spoke English at home, including [[second language|L2]] speakers. Other languages spoken at home included Chinese 2.9%, Italian 1.2%, Arabic 1.1%, Greek 1%, Vietnamese 0.9% and Spanish 0.4%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/0&lt;/ref&gt;

There were almost 400 languages spoken by [[Indigenous Australians]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Only about 70 of these languages have survived and all but 30 of these are now endangered.

=== Bulgaria ===
[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] is the national language in [[Bulgaria]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Nationalisms in Canada|Bilingualism in Canada|Languages of Canada}}
[[Canada]]'s official languages since the [[Official Languages Act of 1969]] are [[English language|English]] ([[Canadian English]]) and [[French language|French]] ([[Canadian French]]).  Depending on one's views of what constitutes a "nation", these two languages may be considered two equal national languages of the nation of Canada, or the national languages of two nations within one state, [[English Canada]] and [[French Canada]].

[[Quebec nationalists]] consider [[Quebec French]] the language of the Quebec nation.

Two of Canada's northern territories legislate a variety of Indigenous languages. [[Nunavut]] holds [[Inuktitut]] and [[Inuinnaqtun]] as official languages, and [[Northwest Territories]] has nine official languages aside from English and French: [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Chipewyan language|Dënesųłiné]], [[Gwich’in language|Gwich’in]], Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, [[Slavey language|North and South Slavey]] and [[Dogrib language|Tłı̨chǫ]]. As these official languages are legislated at a territorial (sub-federal) level, they can be construed as national languages.

Besides these there many [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Indigenous languages of Canada]] which are the national languages of one or more of Canada's [[First Nations]] groups, [[Inuit]] and [[Metis people (Canada)|Métis]] (mixed First Nations-European peoples); a number of First Nations legislate at the Indigenous government levels their language as an official language of the Nation, such is the case with the [[Nisg̱a’a language]] in [[Nisg̱a’a]]. Notably the [[Cree language]] is spoken (with variations) from Alberta to Labrador,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Ojibwe language|Anishinaabemowin]] is spoken across central Canada and Inuktitut is spoken across the arctic.

=== China ===
{{see also|Languages of China|Standard Chinese|History of Mandarin}}
There are many languages spoken across [[China]], with most people speaking one of several [[varieties of Chinese]]. During successive imperial dynasties, the spoken language of the capital city served as the official spoken language and was used across the country by government officials who traveled to communicate with one another. Dialects used for this purpose in different eras included those of [[Xi'an]], [[Luoyang]], [[Nanjing]], [[Beijing]], and [[Historical capitals of China|other historical capital cities]].

After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese nationalists) founded the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. In order to promote a sense of national unity and enhance the efficiency of communications within the nation, the government decided to designate a national language. The [[Beijing dialect]] of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese|Guangzhou dialect]] of [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] were each proposed as the basis for a national language for China.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In the beginning, there were attempts to introduce elements from other Chinese varieties into the national language in addition to those from the Beijing dialect; this was reflected in the first official dictionary of the national language, given the name 國語 ([[Pinyin]]: Guóyǔ, literally "national language"). But this artificial language had no native speakers and was difficult to learn, so it was abandoned in 1924. Ultimately, the Beijing dialect was chosen as the national language and it continued to be referred to as 國語 in Chinese in the Republic of China. Since then, the Beijing dialect has become the main standard for pronunciation, due to its prestigious status during the preceding [[Qing Dynasty]].

Still, elements from other dialects do exist in the standard language, which is now defined as reflecting the pronunciation of Beijing, the grammatical patterns of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] dialects spoken in the northern parts of China, and the vocabulary of modern vernacular Chinese literature. The People's Republic of China renamed the national language 普通话 (Pinyin: Pǔtōnghuà, literally "common speech"), without otherwise changing the definition of the standard national language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Philippines ===
{{Main|Languages of the Philippines}}
The 1973 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Philippine constitution]] hegemonically imposed [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] national language at the expense of all other ethnic nationalities in the country and mandated development and formal adoption of a common national language to be known as [[Filipino language|Filipino]]. English ([[Philippine English]]) was also designated as an official language, "until otherwise provided by law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1973-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-2/|title=1973 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|at=Article XV, Section 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1987 constitution designated the [[Filipino language]], which is based on Tagalog with the inclusion of terms from all recognized [[languages of the Philippines]], as the national language.

=== Singapore ===
{{Main|Languages of Singapore}}
[[Singapore]] has four official languages: [[English language|English]] ([[Singapore English]]), [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Although English is the primary language of business, government, and education, Malay is designated as the national language. This is due to the geographical and historical ties to [[Malaysia]] as well as the recognition of ethnic [[Malays in Singapore|Malays]] (about 14% of the population) as the indigenous people of Singapore.

Traditionally, the [[lingua franca]] among the different ethnic groups in Singapore was [[Malay trade and creole languages|Bazaar Malay]], a Malay-based [[Malay-based creole languages|creole]]. Since independence, the government has been promoting English as the main language of Singapore. The bilingual education policy requires students to study two languages: English and a "mother tongue" corresponding to the student's ethnicity. Malay is only offered to non-Malay students as an optional third language in secondary schools. As a result, English has displaced Bazaar Malay as the common language among Singaporeans. Therefore, despite the status of Malay as the national language, the majority doesn't speak it.

=== United States ===
{{Main|Languages of the United States}}

In the [[United States]], English ([[American English]]) is the national language only in an informal sense, by numbers and by historical and contemporary association.

{{as of|2015|alt=On February 13, 2015}}, Representative [[Peter T. King]] introduced H.R.997, the ''English Language Unity Act of 2015'', in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. This bill would establish English as the official language of the United States. A companion bill, S.678, was introduced by Senator [[Jim Inhofe]] in the [[United States Senate]] on March 9, 2015. Both bills were referred to committee.

'''Nose tombs''' ({{Lang-ja|鼻の墓}} ''hana no haka''; {{Lang-ko|코 무덤}} ''ko mudeom'') are [[tombs]] that contain [[human nose]]s or other body parts that were brought back to [[Japan]] as trophies during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions of Korea]] in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Diamond | first = Jared | title = The Japanese Roots (Part 1) | publisher = Association for Asia Research | date = 2004-10-27 | url = http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2348.html | accessdate = 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[War trophies]] were a part of Japanese tradition at the time and [[samurai]] warriors were often paid according to how many they collected.

One such nose tomb was discovered in 1983 in [[Okayama]] near [[Osaka]].

The current Special Representative is [[Pramila Patten]] of Mauritius, who was appointed by United Nations Secretary General [[António Guterres]] in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sga1719.doc.htm|title=Secretary-General Appoints Pramila Patten of Mauritius Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the SRSG-SVC is supported by the United Nations Team of Experts on the Rule of Law/Sexual Violence in Conflict, co-led by the [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO), [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), also established under Security Council Resolution 1888.

==History and Role==

The mandate was established in 2009 by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888]], one in a series of resolutions which recognized the detrimental impact that sexual violence in conflict has on communities, and acknowledged that the crime undermines peace and security efforts. The resolution signaled a change in the way the international community views and responds to conflict-related sexual violence. It is no longer seen as an inevitable by-product of war, but rather a, a crime that is preventable and punishable under international human rights law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.int/pm/special-representative-secretary-general-sexual-violence-conflict-srsgsvc|title=Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG/SVC) {{!}} Permanent Missions|website=www.un.int|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the first Special Representative, [[Margot Wallström]] of Sweden took office and in September 2012 [[Zainab Bangura|Zainab Hawa Bagura]] of Sierra Leone took over and served until early 2017. Progress achieved by the Office so far includes:

• Greater visibility, political will and momentum than ever before;

• Development of a robust legislative framework in the Security Council, which has given the Office new tools to drive the mandate to the ground and begin to effect some changes in behaviour;

• More strategic and structured engagement with the security and justice sectors, as part of a prevention strategy;

• Beginning to see some accountability at international and national levels, as a vital aspect of deterrence and prevention;

• Beginning to see national ownership, leadership and responsibility, evident in formal commitments that many governments are making to deal with this problem in their countries as well as commitments by regional organizations.

The three priorities of current SRSG [[Pramila Patten]] are:

i. Converting cultures of impunity into cultures of prevention and deterrence through justice and accountability

ii. Addressing structural gender-based inequality as the root cause and invisible driver of sexual violence in times of war and peace

iii. Fostering national ownership and leadership for a sustainable and holistic survivor-centered response.

According to the 2017 Report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, the Office focuses on 19 country situations, including 13 conflict settings, four post-conflict countries and two additional situations of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/key-documents/reports/sg-reports/|title=SG Reports {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Team of Experts ==
The Office's Team of Experts (TOE) on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict works to strengthen the capacity of national rule of law and justice actors to investigate and prosecute for acts of conflict-related sexual violence. The lack of adequate national capacity to deliver justice often leads to widespread impunity and threatens survivors' access to justice, security and safety. The Team of Experts has been operational since 2011 and is the sole Security Council-mandated body tasked with building national capacity to enhance accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. It includes experts from the [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO), the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), which serve as co-lead entities. In addition, the Team is complemented by a law enforcement expert seconded by the Government of [[Sweden]] and a reparations expert. Pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Security Council Resolution 1888]] (2009), the Team focuses on: (i) working closely with national legal and judicial officials and other personnel in the relevant governments’ civilian and military justice systems to address impunity, including by strengthening national capacity and drawing attention to the full range of justice mechanisms to be considered; (ii) identifying gaps in national response and encouraging a holistic national approach in addressing conflict-related sexual violence, including by enhancing criminal accountability, judicial capacity and responsiveness to victims (such as reparations mechanisms); (iii) making recommendations to coordinate domestic and international efforts and resources to reinforce governments’ ability to address conflict-related sexual violence; and (iv) working with other UN mechanisms including UN Missions, Country Teams, and the SRSG-SVC towards the full implementation of resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|1820]] (2008), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|1888]] (2009), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1960|1960]] (2010), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2106|2106]] (2013) and 2331 (2016). In line with its mandate, the Team of Experts provides assistance to governments, including in the areas of criminal investigation and prosecution; military justice; legislative reform; protection of victims and witnesses; reparations for survivors; and security sector oversight. In support of the Office of the SRSG-SVC, the TOE also serves a catalytic role in implementing joint communiqués and frameworks of cooperation agreed between the SRSG-SVC and national authorities, regional actors and other UN entities, complementing the work of UN country presences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/key-documents/reports/team-of-experts-rule-of-lawsexual-violence-in-conflict-reports/|title=Team of Experts Reports {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict (UN Action) ==
UN Action is a cross-UN initiative that unites the work of 14 entities with the goal of ending conflict-related sexual violence. The Chair of UN Action is the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. [[Pramila Patten]]. Endorsed by the Secretary-General's Policy Committee in June 2007, it represents a concerted effort by the UN to work as one by amplifying advocacy, improving coordination and accountability and supporting country efforts to prevent conflict-related sexual violence and respond effectively to the needs of survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stoprapenow.org/about/|title=Stop Rape Now - About|last=luccaco.com|website=stoprapenow.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Action Secretariat is based in the OSRSG-SVC and focuses on three main pillars:

Country-level Action: Strategic support to integrated UN Missions to help them design comprehensive strategies to combat conflict-related sexual violence and targeted support to strengthen joint UN programming.

Advocacy for Action: Raising public awareness and generating political will to address conflict-related sexual violence as part of a broader campaigns to Stop Rape Now and Unite to End Violence Against Women.

Learning by Doing: Creating a knowledge hub on the scale of conflict-related sexual violence and effective responses by the UN and partners.

The 14 entities in the network are: [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs]] (DPA), [[UN Women|United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] (UN Women), [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS), [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO), [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office (UN-PBSO), [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR), [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA), [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM).

== Secretary-General's Report on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence ==
The Office publishes the Report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence annually to highlight a number of new and emerging concerns in relation to the use of sexual violence by parties to armed conflict as a tactic of war and terrorism. The report contains an annex of a list of parties credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape or other forms of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict, the majority of whom are non-state actors. It tracks developments relevant to the implementation of Resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|1820]] (2008), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|1888]] (2009) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1960|1960]] (2010) in 19 conflict-affected and post-conflict states and it is compiled through the analysis of data provided by United Nations offices, civil society and regional organizations, as well as Member States. The 2017 Report covers the following countries: Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, Central African Republic, Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan (Darfur), Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/key-documents/reports/sg-reports/|title=SG Reports {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overbelief''' (also written as "''over-belief''") is a [[philosophical]] term&lt;ref&gt;"Overbelief." Merriam-Webster.com. Accessed June 3, 2014. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/overbelief.&lt;/ref&gt; for a belief adopted that requires more evidence than one presently has. Generally, acts of overbelief are justified on emotional need or [[faith]], and a need to make sense of spiritual experience, rather than on empirical  [[evidence]]. This idea originates from the works of William James in [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/621 The Varieties of Religious Experience] online text&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the conceptual framework that individuals have. For James, a typical example of an overbelief would be R. W. Trine's contention that "The great central fact of the universe is that spirit of infinite life and power that is back of all, that manifests itself in and through all." James acknowledges that his own over-beliefs are so minimal that to some religious believers they may seem like "under-beliefs".

'''Pacifism''' is opposition to [[war]], [[militarism]], or [[violence]]. The word ''pacifism'' was coined by the French peace campaigner [[Émile Arnaud]] (1864–1921) and adopted by other peace activists at the tenth Universal Peace Congress in [[Glasgow]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;''The Abolition of War: the Peace Movement in Britain, 1914–1919'' by [[Keith Robbins]]. University of Wales Press, 1976. {{ISBN|978-0-7083-0622-2}} (p.10).&lt;/ref&gt; A related term is ''[[ahimsa]]'' (to do no harm), which is a core philosophy in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. While modern connotations are recent, having been explicated since the 19th century, ancient references abound.

In modern times, interest was revived by [[Leo Tolstoy]] in his late works, particularly in ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]''. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (1869–1948) propounded the practice of steadfast [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent opposition]] which he called "[[satyagraha]]", instrumental in its role in the [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Its effectiveness served as inspiration to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], [[James Bevel]],&lt;ref&gt;James L. Bevel, The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement" by Randy Kryn, a paper in [[David Garrow]]'s 1989 book ''We Shall Overcome, Volume II'', Carlson Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]&lt;ref name="aavw.org"&gt;"Searching for the Enemy of Man", in Nhat Nanh, Ho Huu Tuong, Tam Ich, Bui Giang, Pham Cong Thien. ''Dialogue''. Saigon: La Boi, 1965. P.&amp;nbsp;11–20., archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website, [http://www.aavw.org/protest/king_journey_abstract09.html King's Journey: 1964 - April 4, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt; and many others in the [[civil rights movement]].

== Definition ==
Pacifism covers a spectrum of views, including the belief that international disputes can and should be peacefully resolved, calls for the abolition of the institutions of the military and war, opposition to any organization of society through governmental force ([[anarcho-pacifism|anarchist or libertarian pacifism]]), rejection of the use of physical violence to obtain political, economic or social goals,  the obliteration of force, and opposition to violence under any circumstance, even defence of self and others. Historians of pacifism [[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Thomas Paul Socknat define pacifism "in the sense generally accepted in English-speaking areas" as "an unconditional rejection of all forms of warfare".&lt;ref&gt;''Challenge to Mars: Essays on Pacifism from 1918 to 1945''. Edited by Brock and Socknat University of Toronto Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8020-4371-2}} (p. ix)&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Jenny Teichman]] defines the main form of pacifism as "anti-warism", the rejection of all forms of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism and the Just War: A Study in Applied Philosophy'' by Jenny Teichman. Basil Blackwell, 1986
{{ISBN|0-631-15056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teichman's beliefs have been summarized by [[Brian Orend]] as "...&amp;nbsp;A pacifist rejects war and believes there are no moral grounds which can justify resorting to war. War, for the pacifist, is always wrong." In a sense the philosophy is based on the idea that the ends do not justify the means.&lt;ref&gt;''War and International Justice: a Kantian perspective'' by Brian Orend. Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-88920-337-7}} p.&amp;nbsp;145–6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral considerations ===

[[File:Pacifista Arresto.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-war activist arrested in [[San Francisco]] during the March 2003 protests against the war in [[Iraq]]]]
Pacifism may be based on [[morality|moral]] principles (a [[deontological]] view) or [[pragmatism]] (a [[consequentialist]] view). Principled pacifism holds that at some point along the spectrum from war to interpersonal physical violence, such violence becomes morally wrong. Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and interpersonal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found. Pacifists generally reject theories of [[Just War]].

=== Nonviolence ===
Some pacifists follow principles of [[nonviolence]], believing that nonviolent action is morally superior and/or most effective. Some however, support physical violence for emergency defence of self or others. Others support [[property damage|destruction of property]] in such emergencies or for conducting symbolic acts of resistance like pouring red paint to represent blood on the outside of military recruiting offices or entering air force bases and hammering on military aircraft.

Not all [[nonviolent resistance]] (sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]) is based on a fundamental rejection of all violence in all circumstances. Many leaders and participants in such movements, while recognizing the importance of using non-violent methods in particular circumstances, have not been absolute pacifists. Sometimes, as with the civil rights movement's march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, they have called for armed protection. The interconnections between civil resistance and factors of force are numerous and complex.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]. Includes chapters by specialists on the various movements.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute pacifism===

An absolute pacifist is generally described by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] as one who believes that human life is so valuable, that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense. The principle is described as difficult to abide by consistently, due to violence not being available as a tool to aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815030756/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/against/pacifism_1.shtml|title=Ethics - War: Pacifism|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/against/pacifism_1.shtml|website=BBC|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police actions and national liberation==
Although all pacifists are opposed to war between [[nation states]], there have been occasions where pacifists have supported military conflict in the case of [[civil war]] or [[revolution]].&lt;ref name="ffw"&gt;"When the American Civil War broke out&amp;nbsp;... both the American Peace Society and many former nonresistants argued that the conflict was not properly war but rather police action on a grand scale" Brock, Peter, ''Freedom from War: Nonsectarian Pacifism, 1814–1914'' University of Toronto Press, 1991 {{ISBN|0-8020-5883-3}}, (p. 176)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, during the [[American Civil War]], both the [[American Peace Society]] and some former members of the [[Non-Resistance Society]] supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]'s military campaign, arguing they were carrying out a "[[police action]]" against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose act of [[Secession]] they regarded as criminal.&lt;ref name="ffw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H., ''The Advocates of Peace in Antebellum America''. Mercer University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-726-2}} (p.158).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], French pacifist [[René Gérin]] (1892–1957) urged support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].&lt;ref name="tpod"&gt;Ingram, Norman. ''The Politics of Dissent : Pacifism in France, 1919–1939''. University of Edinburgh, 1988.  (p. 219)&lt;/ref&gt; Gérin argued that the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Nationalists]] were "comparable to an individual enemy" and the Republic's war effort was equivalent to the action of a domestic police force suppressing crime.&lt;ref name="tpod"/&gt;

In the 1960s, some pacifists associated with the [[New Left]] supported [[wars of national liberation]] and supported groups such as the [[Viet Cong]] and the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], arguing peaceful attempts to liberate such nations were no longer viable, and war was thus the only option.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century'', by Peter Brock and [[Nigel Young]]. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}}  (p.296)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early traditions of pacifism==
[[File:Apotheosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Vasily Vereshchagin|Vereshchagin]]'s painting ''[[The Apotheosis of War]]'' (1871) came to be admired as one of the earliest artistic expressions of pacifism]]
Advocacy of pacifism can be found far back in history and literature.

===China===
During the [[Warring States period]], the pacifist [[Mohist]] School opposed aggressive war between the feudal states. They took this belief into action by using their famed defensive strategies to defend smaller states from invasion from larger states, hoping to dissuade feudal lords from costly warfare. The [[Seven Military Classics]] of ancient China view warfare negatively, and as a last resort. For example, the ''[[Three Strategies of Huang Shigong]]'' says: "As for the military, it is not an auspicious instrument; it is the way of heaven to despise it", and the ''[[Wei Liaozi]]'' writes: "As for the military, it is an inauspicious instrument; as for conflict and contention, it runs counter to virtue".&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Realism: Strategic Culture and Grand Strategy in Chinese History|first=Alastair I|last=Johnston|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1998|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taoist scripture "''Classic of Great Peace'' (''[[Taiping Jing|Taiping jing]]'')" foretells "the coming Age of Great Peace (''taiping'')."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/daoism.htm#H10 ''Daoist Philosophy'' -- 10.

===Lemba===
The [[Lemba people|Lemba]] religion of southern French Congo, along with its symbolic herb, is named for pacifism : "''lemba, lemba''" (peace, peace), describes the action of the plant ''lemba-lemba'' (''Brillantaisia patula T. Anders'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Lemba, 1650–1930 | first = John M. | last = Janzen | publisher = Garland Publishing, Inc. | location = New York | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8240-9306-2 | page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in Cabinda, "''Lemba'' is the spirit of peace, as its name indicates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Lemba, 1650–1930 | first = John M. | last = Janzen | publisher = Garland Publishing, Inc. | location = New York | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8240-9306-2 | pages = 303 (8)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moriori===
[[File:Chatham Island Tree Carving.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Moriori tree carving found in the Chatham Islands.]]
The [[Moriori people|Moriori]], of the [[Chatham Islands]], practiced pacifism by order of their ancestor [[Nunuku-whenua]]. This enabled the Moriori to preserve what limited resources they had in their harsh climate, avoiding waste through warfare. In turn, this led to their almost complete annihilation in 1835 by invading [[Ngāti Mutunga]] and [[Ngāti Tama]] [[Māori people|Māori]] from the [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] region of the [[North Island]] of New Zealand. The invading Māori killed, enslaved and [[cannibalism|cannibalised]] the Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled : "[The Maori] commenced to kill us like sheep&amp;nbsp;... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed - men, women and children indiscriminately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]] | publisher = W.W. Norton | year = 1997 | location = New York | page = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
In [[Ancient Greece]], pacifism seems not to have existed except as a broad moral guideline against violence between individuals. No philosophical program of rejecting violence between states, or rejecting all forms of violence, seems to have existed. Aristophanes, in his play [[Lysistrata]], creates the scenario of an [[Athens|Athenian]] woman's anti-war sex strike during the [[Peloponnesian War]] of 431–404 BC, and the play has gained an international reputation for its anti-war message. Nevertheless, it is both fictional and comical, and though it offers a pragmatic opposition to the destructiveness of war, its message seems to stem from frustration with the existing conflict (then in its twentieth year) rather than from a philosophical position against violence or war. Equally fictional is the nonviolent protest of [[Hegetorides]] of [[Thasos]]. [[Euripides]] also expressed strong anti-war ideas in his work, especially ''[[The Trojan Women]]''.&lt;ref name="fsn"&gt;"Peace, War and Philosophy" by F. S. Northedge, in [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Volume 6, Collier Macmillan, 1967 (pgs&amp;nbsp;63–67).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
Several Roman writers rejected the militarism of Roman society and gave voice to anti-war sentiments,&lt;ref name="fsn" /&gt;
including [[Propertius]], [[Tibullus]] and [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;''Restless Youth in Ancient Rome'', Emiel Eyben, Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0-203-16848-8}},  p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Seneca the Younger]] criticised warfare in his book ''[[Naturales quaestiones]]'' (circa 65 AD).&lt;ref&gt;''Panorama of the Classical World'' by Nigel Spivey and Michael Squire. Getty Publications, 2011, {{ISBN|1-60606-056-2}} (p.200).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maximilian of Tebessa]] was a Christian conscientious objector. He was killed for refusing to be conscripted.&lt;ref&gt;''The Riddle of Saint Maximilian of Tebessa'' by Peter Brock. University of Toronto Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{See also|Christian pacifism}}
Throughout history many have understood [[Jesus]] of Nazareth to have been a pacifist,&lt;ref name="weidhorn"&gt;{{Cite journal|  first =Manfred |last = Weidhorn | title = Pacifism Lost | journal = International Journal of Humanities and Peace | year = 2004 | volume = 20|issue = 1|pages = 13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on his [[Sermon on the Mount]]. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should "not resist an evildoer" and promoted his [[turn the other cheek]] philosophy. "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well&amp;nbsp;... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew+5 oremus Bible Browser : Matthew 5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Luke+6 oremus Bible Browser : Luke 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aqa"&gt;{{Cite book| title = GCSE Religious Studies for AQA Christianity: Christianity: Behaviour, Attitudes &amp; Lifestyles | first = Joanne | last = Cleave |author2=Geddes, Gordon D. |author3=Griffiths, Jane | publisher = Heinemann Educational Publisher | location = Oxford | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-435-30714-2 | page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Testament story is of Jesus, besides preaching these words, surrendering himself freely to an enemy intent on having him killed and proscribing his followers from defending him.

There are those, however, who deny that Jesus was a pacifist&lt;ref name="weidhorn" /&gt; and state that Jesus never said not to fight,&lt;ref name="aqa" /&gt; citing examples from the New Testament. One such instance portrays an angry Jesus driving dishonest market [[Cleansing of the Temple|traders from the temple]].&lt;ref name="aqa" /&gt;  A frequently quoted passage is Luke 22:36: "He said to them, 'But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must [[Sell your cloak and buy a sword|sell his cloak and buy one]].'" Pacifists have typically explained that verse as Jesus fulfilling prophecy, since in the next verse, Jesus continues to say: "It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." Others have interpreted the non-pacifist statements in the New Testament to be related to [[self-defense]] or to be metaphorical and state that on no occasion did Jesus shed blood or urge others to shed blood.&lt;ref name="weidhorn" /&gt;

==Modern history==
[[File:Edward Hicks - Penn's Treaty.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Penn's Treaty with the Indians|Penn's Treaty]] with the Indians. This treaty was never violated.]]
Beginning in the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] gave rise to a variety of new Christian sects, including the [[Peace churches|historic peace churches]]. Foremost among them were the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], and [[Church of the Brethren]]. The humanist writer [[Desiderius Erasmus]] was one of the most outspoken pacifists of the [[Renaissance]], arguing strongly against warfare in his essays ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'' (1509) and ''The Complaint of Peace'' (1517).&lt;ref name="fsn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Erasmus, Desiderius" by Garrett L. McAinsh, in ''The World Encyclopedia of Peace''.Edited by [[Linus Pauling]], [[Ervin László]], and [[Jong Youl Yoo]]. Oxford : Pergamon, 1986. {{ISBN|0-08-032685-4}}, (Volume 1, p.293).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quakers were prominent advocates of pacifism, who as early as 1660 had repudiated violence in all forms and adhered to a strictly pacifist interpretation of [[Christianity]]. They stated their beliefs in a declaration to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "We utterly deny all outward wars and strife, and fightings with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretense whatever; this is our testimony to the whole world.  The Spirit of Christ&amp;nbsp;... which leads us into all truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quaker Traditions of Pacifism and Nonviolence|url=http://events.stanford.edu/events/352/35227/|author=Eric Roberts|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout the many 18th century wars in which Britain participated, the Quakers maintained a principled commitment [[Conscientious objector|not to serve in the army and militia]] or even to pay the alternative £10 fine.

The English Quaker [[William Penn]], who founded the [[Province of Pennsylvania]], employed an anti-militarist public policy. Unlike residents of many of the colonies, Quakers chose to trade peacefully with the Indians, including for land. The colonial province was, for the 75 years from 1681 to 1756, essentially unarmed and experienced little or no warfare in that period.

From the 16th to the 18th centuries, a number of thinkers devised plans for an international organisation that would promote peace, and reduce or even eliminate the occurrence of war. These included the French politician [[Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully|Duc de Sully]], the philosophers [[Émeric Crucé]] and the [[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre|Abbe de Saint-Pierre]], and the English Quakers William Penn and [[John Bellers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Power and the Pursuit of Peace: Theory and Practice in the History of Relations between States'', by [[Francis Harry Hinsley]], Cambridge University Press, 1967, {{ISBN|0-521-09448-8}}, (pp.&amp;nbsp;13–45).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Thinking About Peace in History" by [[Charles Chatfield]], in ''The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective : Essays in Honour of Peter Brock'', edited by [[Harvey L. Dyck]]. Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8020-0777-5}} (p.&amp;nbsp;36–51).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacifist ideals emerged from two strands of thought that coalesced at the end of the 18th century. One, rooted in the secular [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], promoted peace as the rational antidote to the world's ills, while the other was a part of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical religious revival]] that had played an important part in the campaign for the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. Representatives of the former included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in ''Extrait du Projet de Paix Perpetuelle de Monsieur l'Abbe Saint-Pierre'' (1756),&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley, pp.&amp;nbsp;46–61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''Thoughts on Perpetual Peace'',&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–80.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeremy Bentham]] who proposed the formation of a peace association in 1789. Representative of the latter, was [[William Wilberforce]] who thought that strict limits should be imposed on British involvement in the [[French Revolutionary War]] based on Christian ideals of peace and brotherhood. Bohemian [[Bernard Bolzano]] (1781–1848) taught about the social waste of militarism and the needlessness of war. He urged a total reform of the educational, social, and economic systems that would direct the nation's interests toward peace rather than toward armed conflict between nations.

===Peace movements===
During the period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although no formal peace movement was established until the end of hostilities, a significant peace movement animated by universalist ideals did emerge, due to the perception of Britain fighting in a [[reactionary]] role and the increasingly visible impact of the war on the welfare of the nation in the form of higher taxation levels and high casualty rates. Sixteen peace petitions to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] were signed by members of the public, anti-war and anti-[[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] demonstrations convened and peace literature was widely published and disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4xr3PsdI8C&amp;dq=freemason+hall+1843+london+peace&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Origins of War Prevention: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1730–1854|author=Ceadel, Martin|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press,|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Richard, Vanity Fair, 1880-09-04.jpg|thumb|"Peace". Caricature of [[Henry Richard]], a prominent advocate of pacifism in the mid-19th century]]
The first peace movements appeared in 1815–16. In the United States the first such movement was the [[New York Peace Society]], founded in 1815 by the theologian [[David Low Dodge]], and the [[Massachusetts Peace Society]]. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on [[Christianity|Christian]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism to 1914 : an overview'' by Peter Brock. Toronto, Thistle Printing, 1994. (pp.&amp;nbsp;38–9).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace Society|London Peace Society]] (also known as the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace) was formed in 1816 to promote permanent and universal peace by the [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[William Allen (philanthropist)|William Allen]]. In the 1840s, British women formed "Olive Leaf Circles", groups of around 15 to 20 women, to discuss and promote pacifist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Long Road to Greenham : Feminism and Anti-Militarism in Britain since 1820'', by [[Jill Liddington]]. London, Virago, 1989 {{ISBN|0-86068-688-4}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;14–5).&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace movement began to grow in influence by the mid-nineteenth century. The London Peace Society, under the initiative of American consul to [[Birmingham]] [[Elihu Burritt]] and the reverend [[Henry Richard]], convened the first [[International Peace Congress]] in London in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Peace.html?id=JCgvvXUzu-oC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas|author=Cortright, David|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congress decided on two aims: the ideal of peaceable arbitration in the affairs of nations and the creation of an international institution to achieve that. [[Henry Richard|Richard]] became the secretary of the Peace Society in 1850 on a full-time basis, a position which he would keep for the next 40 years, earning himself a reputation as the 'Apostle of Peace'. He helped secure one of the earliest victories for the peace movement by securing a commitment from the [[Great Power]]s in the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] at the end of the [[Crimean War]], in favour of arbitration. On the European continent, wracked by [[1848 Revolution|social upheaval]], the first peace congress was held in [[Brussels]] in 1848 followed by [[Paris]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gustave Moynier and the peace societies|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnaw.htm|publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]|author=André Durand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing a recession in support due to the resurgence of militarism during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Crimean War]], the movement began to spread across Europe and began to infiltrate the new [[working class]] [[socialism|socialist]] movements. In 1870, [[Randal Cremer]] formed the [[International Arbitration League|Workman's Peace Association]] in London. Cremer, alongside the French economist [[Frédéric Passy]] was also the founding father of the first international organisation for the arbitration of conflicts in 1889, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]. The [[National Peace Council]] was founded in after the 17th [[Universal Peace Congress]] in London (July August 1908).

An important thinker who contributed to pacifist ideology was Russian writer [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In one of his latter works, ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', Tolstoy provides a detailed history, account and defense of pacifism. Tolstoy's work inspired a [[Tolstoyan movement|movement named after him]] advocating pacifism to arise in Russia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;''Tolstoy's Pacifism'', by [[Colm McKeogh]], Cambria Press, 2009, {{ISBN|1-60497-634-9}}, (pp.&amp;nbsp;105–107).&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a major early influence on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] (1869–1948), and the two engaged in regular correspondence while Gandhi was active in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century'', by [[Peter Brock]] and [[Nigel Young]]. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}} (p.73)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertha von Suttner]], the first woman to be a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, became a leading figure in the peace movement with the publication of her novel, ''Die Waffen nieder!'' ("Lay Down Your Arms!") in 1889 and founded an Austrian pacifist organization in 1891.

===Non-violent resistance===
[[File:WeFightCartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|"Leading Citizens want War and declare War; Citizens Who are Led fight the War" 1910 cartoon]]
In New Zealand, during the latter half of the 19th century British colonists used many tactics to confiscate land from the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]], including warfare. In the 1870s and 1880s, [[Parihaka]], then reputed to be the largest Māori village in New Zealand, became the centre of a major campaign of non-violent resistance to European occupation of confiscated land in the area. One Māori leader, [[Te Whiti-o-Rongomai]], inspired warriors to stand up for their rights without using weapons, which had led to defeat in the past. In 1881 he convinced 2000 Maori to welcome battle-hardened British soldiers into their village and even offered food and drink. He allowed himself and his people to be arrested without resistance for opposing land confiscation. He is remembered as a great leader because the "passive resistance" his practice prevented British massacres and even protected far more land than violent resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/conflict/pacifistofparihaka.htm Winder, Virginia, "Conflict and Protest  - Pacifist of Parihaka - Te Whiti o Rongomai"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705092832/http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/conflict/pacifistofparihaka.htm |date=July 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] was a major political and spiritual leader of India, instrumental in the [[Indian independence movement]]. The Nobel prize winning great poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], who was also an Indian, gave him the honorific  "[[Mahatma]]", usually translated "Great Soul." He was the pioneer of a brand of nonviolence (or ''[[ahimsa]]'') which he called ''[[satyagraha]]''—translated literally as "truth force". This was the resistance of tyranny through civil disobedience that was not only nonviolent but also sought to change the heart of the opponent. He contrasted this with ''duragraha'', "resistant force," which sought only to change behaviour with stubborn protest.

During his 30 years of work (1917–1947) for the independence of his country from the [[British Raj]], Gandhi led dozens of nonviolent campaigns, spent over seven years in prison, and [[hunger strike|fasted nearly to the death]] on several occasions to obtain British compliance with a demand or to stop inter-communal violence.  His efforts helped lead India to independence in 1947, and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom worldwide.

===World War I===
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|''The Deserter'' (1916) by [[Boardman Robinson]]]]
Peace movements became active in the Western world after 1900, often focusing on Treaties that would settle disputes through arbitration, and efforts to support the Hague conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Hollander,  ''Elusive Dove: The Search for Peace During World War I'' (2014), ch 1 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RZHLAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=4jcnQMsOb9&amp;sig=c9hArkuNZq6iMvmVh8uTPdEeYsk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sudden outbreak of the [[First World War]] in July 1914 dismayed the peace movement. Socialist parties in every industrial nation had committed themselves to antiwar policies, but when the war came, all of them, except in Russia and the United States, supported their own government. There were highly publicized dissidents, some of whom went to jail for opposing the draft laws, like [[Eugene Debs]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Harry W. Laidler, Harry W. ''Socialism in thought and action'' (1920) covers wartime roles in many countries [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DKINAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=harry+laidler+socialism&amp;ots=r5TR5vSoqn&amp;sig=izQuyzD-HCFuo_FNvpyEt78HMPo#v=onepage&amp;q=harry%20laidler%20socialism&amp;f=false online].&lt;/ref&gt;  In Britain, the prominent activist [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]] went to prison for refusing military service, citing his convictions as an "International Socialist and a Christian"&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Adam, ''To end all wars : a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914–1918'', p. 277, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011, {{ISBN|0-618-75828-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[socialism|socialist]] groups and movements were [[antimilitarist]], arguing that war by its nature was a type of governmental coercion of the [[working class]] for the benefit of [[capitalism|capitalist]] elites. The French socialist pacifist leader [[Jean Jaurès]] was assassinated by a nationalist fanatic on July 31, 1914.  The national parties in the [[Second International]] increasingly supported their respective nations in war and the International was dissolved in 1916.
 
[[File:Peace-Marcher.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|A World War I-era female peace protester]]
In 1915 the [[League of Nations Society]] was formed by British [[liberalism|liberal]] leaders to promote a strong international organisation that could enforce the peaceful resolution of conflict. Later that year the [[League to Enforce Peace]] was established in America to promote similar goals. [[Hamilton Holt]] published an editorial in his New York City weekly magazine the ''Independent'' called "The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal" on September 28, 1914. It called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt's plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Viscount James Bryce]], a former ambassador from the U.K. to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, 56-7&lt;/ref&gt; These and other initiatives were pivotal in the change in attitudes that gave birth to the [[League of Nations]] after the war.

Some of the many groups that protested against the war, as well as the traditional peace churches, were the [[Woman's Peace Party]] (which was organized in 1915 and led by noted reformer [[Jane Addams]]), the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) (also organized in 1915),&lt;ref&gt;

===Between the two World Wars===

The immense loss of life during the war, for what became regarded as futile reasons, caused a sea-change in public attitudes to militarism. Organisations formed in this period included the [[War Resisters' International]]&lt;ref&gt;''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915–1963'' by Scott H. Bennett. New York, Syracuse University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8156-3028-X}}, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], the [[No More War Movement]] and the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU). The [[League of Nations]] also convened several disarmament conferences in the inter-war period such as the [[Geneva Naval Conference|Geneva Conference]].

Pacifism and revulsion with war were very popular sentiments in 1920s Britain. A stream of novels and poems on the theme of the futility of war and the slaughter of the youth by old fools were published, including, [[Death of a Hero]] by [[Richard Aldington]], [[Erich Remarque]]'s translated [[All Quiet on the Western Front]] and [[Beverley Nichols]]'s expose ''Cry Havoc''. A debate at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1933 on the motion 'one must fight for King and country' captured the changed mood when the motion was resoundingly defeated. [[Hugh Richard Lawrie Sheppard|Dick Sheppard]] established the [[Peace Pledge Union]] in 1934 totally renouncing war and aggression. The idea of collective security was also popular; instead of outright pacifism the public generally exhibited a determination to stand up to aggression, but preferably with the use of economic sanctions and multilateral negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Hom-c5.html|title=Pacifism|publisher=[[University of Wellington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the Peace Pledge Union later joined the Bruderhof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; during its period of residence in the Cotswolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, English, Jews and Germans lived side by side despite local persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Peace-Experiment-Bruderhof-Community/dp/1532639988|title=A Christian Peace Experiment: The Bruderhof Community in Britain, 1933–1942|last=Randall|first=Ian M.|last2=Wright|first2=Nigel G.|date=2018-03-14|publisher=Cascade Books|isbn=9781532639982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prats-de-Mollo Children's Home.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Refugees from the Spanish Civil War at the [[War Resisters' International]] children's refuge in the French Pyrenees]]
The British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had a strong pacifist wing in the early 1930s and between 1931 and 1935 was led by [[George Lansbury]], a Christian pacifist who later chaired the No More War Movement and was president of the PPU. The 1933 annual conference resolved unanimously to "pledge itself to take no part in war". "Labour's official position, however, although based on the aspiration towards a world socialist commonwealth and the outlawing of war, did not imply a renunciation of force under all circumstances, but rather support for the ill-defined concept of 'collective security' under the League of Nations. At the same time, on the party's left, [[Stafford Cripps]]'s small but vocal [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]] opposed the official policy, on the non-pacifist ground that the League of Nations was 'nothing but the tool of the satiated imperialist powers'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.exeter.ac.uk/exeter/bitstream/10036/26952/3/Rearmament.pdf Richard Toye, ''The Labour Party and the Economics of Rearmament, 1935–1939''] {{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lansbury was eventually persuaded to resign as Labour leader by the non-pacifist wing of the party and was replaced by [[Clement Attlee]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhiannon Vickers, ''Labour and the World'',  Manchester University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7190-6745-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-7190-6745-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the threat from [[Nazi Germany]] increased in the 1930s, the Labour Party abandoned its pacifist position and supported re-armament, largely due to the efforts of [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Hugh Dalton]] who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].&lt;ref&gt;A.J.Davies, ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[League of Nations]] attempted to play its role of ensuring world peace in the 1920s and 30s, although with the increasingly revisionist and aggressive behaviour of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Imperial Japan]], it ultimately failed to maintain such a world order. [[Economic sanctions]] were used against states that committed aggression, such as Italy when it [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Abyssinia]], but there was no will on the part of the principal League powers, Britain and France, to subordinate their interests to a multilateral process or to disarm at all themselves.

The [[Spanish Civil War]] proved a major test for international pacifism, and the work of pacifist organisations (such as [[War Resisters' International]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]) and individuals (such as [[José Brocca]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón|Amparo Poch]]) in that arena has until recently{{when|date=May 2011}} been ignored or forgotten by historians, overshadowed by the memory of the [[International Brigades]] and other militaristic interventions. Shortly after the war ended, [[Simone Weil]], despite having volunteered for service on the republican side, went on to publish ''[[The Iliad or the Poem of Force]]'', a work that has been described as a pacifist manifesto.&lt;ref name="NYB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=4551 |title=War and the Iliad |publisher=The New York Review of books |accessdate=29 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501053342/http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=4551 |archivedate=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as [[Richard B. Gregg]], devised plans for a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]] in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Lynd, Staughton. ''Nonviolence in America: a documentary history'', Bobbs-Merrill, 1966, (pps.&amp;nbsp;271–296).&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Student Peace Strike. About half of the students assembled at the... - NARA - 532103.tif|thumb|upright=0.9|A peace strike rally at [[University of California]], Berkeley, April 1940]]
With the start of [[World War II]], pacifist and anti-war sentiment declined in nations affected by war. Even the communist-controlled [[American Peace Mobilization]] reversed its anti-war activism once Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], mainstream [[isolationist]] groups like the [[America First Committee]], declined, but many smaller religious and socialist groups continued their opposition to war. [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that the necessity of defeating [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] was a unique circumstance where war was not the worst of the possible evils; he called his position ''relative pacifism''. Shortly before the outbreak of war, British writers such as [[E. M. Forster]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[David Garnett]] and [[Storm Jameson]] all rejected their earlier pacifism and endorsed military action against Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Patterson, "Pacifists and Conscientious Objectors", in Adam Piette and Mark Rawlinson, ''The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century British and American War Literature'', Edinburgh University Press 2012. {{ISBN|0-7486-3874-1}}  (p. 311).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Albert Einstein]] wrote: "I loathe all armies and any kind of violence; yet I'm firmly convinced that at present these hateful weapons offer the only effective protection."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on [http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/infodocs/people/pp-einstein2.html Albert Einstein] at Peace Pledge Union, and but also discussed in detail in articles in Einstein, Albert (1954), ''Ideas and Opinions'', New York: Random House, {{ISBN|0-517-00393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British pacifists [[Reginald Sorensen, Baron Sorensen|Reginald Sorensen]] and [[Cecil John Cadoux|C. J. Cadoux]], while bitterly disappointed by the outbreak of war, nevertheless urged their fellow pacifists "not to obstruct the war effort".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ceadel, ''Pacifism in Britain, 1914–1945 : The Defining Of A Faith''. Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1980. {{ISBN|0-19-821882-6}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;298–99).&lt;/ref&gt;

The French pacifists [[André and Magda Trocmé]] helped conceal hundreds of Jews fleeing the Nazis in the village of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]].&lt;ref name="pph"&gt;''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: The Story of Le Chambon and How Goodness Happened There'' Philip P. Hallie, (1979)  New York: Harper &amp; Row, {{ISBN|0-06-011701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the Trocmés were declared [[Righteous Among the Nations]].&lt;ref name="pph" /&gt;

Pacifists in the [[Third Reich]] were dealt with harshly; German pacifist [[Carl von Ossietzky]],&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olaf Kullmann]], a Norwegian pacifist active during the Nazi occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Socknat, pp.&amp;nbsp;402–3.&lt;/ref&gt; were both imprisoned in concentration camps and died as a result of their mistreatment there. Austrian farmer [[Franz Jägerstätter]] was executed in 1943 for refusing to serve in the [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[In Solitary Witness: The Life and Death of Franz Jägerstätter]]'' by [[Gordon Zahn]].Springfield, Illinois: Templegate Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87243-141-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the war, it was discovered that "[[The Black Book]]" or ''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'' list of Britons to be arrested in the event of a Nazi invasion of the UK included three active pacifists; [[Vera Brittain]], [[Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Aldous Huxley]] (who had left the country).&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard R. Doerries, ''Hitler's Intelligence Chief: Walter Schellenberg'', New York. Enigma Books, 2013 {{ISBN|1-936274-13-2}} (p.33)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hetherington, ''Swimming Against the Tide:The Peace Pledge Union Story, 1934–2009''. London; The Peace Pledge Union, {{ISBN|978-0-902680-51-7}} (p.14)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were [[conscientious objectors]] and war [[tax resisters]] in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  The United States government allowed sincere objectors to serve in noncombatant military roles. However, those [[draft dodgers|draft resisters]] who refused any cooperation with the war effort often spent much of each war in federal prisons. During World War II, pacifist leaders like [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Ammon Hennacy]] of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] urged young Americans not to enlist in military service.

===Later twentieth century===
[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police at an [[Opposition to Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War protest]], 1967]]
[[Martin Luther King Jr]] (1929–68), a [[Baptist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]], led the [[civil rights movement]], which successfully used Gandhian [[nonviolent resistance]] to repeal laws enforcing racial segregation and work for integration of schools, businesses and government. In 1957, his wife [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Benjamin Spock]], and others formed the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (now [[Peace Action]]) to resist the [[nuclear arms race]]. In 1958 British activists formed the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] with Bertrand Russell as its president.

In 1960, [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] came to the US to study [[comparative religion]] at [[Princeton University]] and subsequently was appointed lecturer in Buddhism at [[Columbia University]]. Thich Nhat Hanh had written a letter to Martin Luther King in 1965 entitled "Searching for the Enemy of Man" and during his 1966 stay in the US met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="aavw.org"/&gt; King gave his famous speech at the [[Riverside Church]] in New York City in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aavw.org/special_features/speeches_speech_king01.html Beyond Vietnam]", 4 April 1967, speech made by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Riverside Church, NYC, archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website&lt;/ref&gt; his first to publicly question the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.

Other examples from this period include the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] led by [[Cory Aquino]], and the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square Protests]] which included the broadly publicized "[[Tank Man]]" incident.

On December 1, 1948, President [[José Figueres Ferrer]] of [[Costa Rica]] abolished the [[military of Costa Rica|Costa Rican military]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm Costa Rica]". U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the abolition of the military was introduced in Article 12 of the Costa Rican constitution. The budget previously dedicated to the military is now dedicated to providing health care services and education.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/opinion/07kristof.html?_r=1 The Happiest People]".

==Religious attitudes{{anchor|Pacifism and religion}}==
{{see also|Religion and peacebuilding}}

===Ahmadiyya===
{{Further|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad}}
According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of Islam, pacifism is a strong current, and jihad is one's personal inner struggle and should not be used violently for political motives. Violence is the last option only to be used to protect religion and one's own life in extreme situations of persecution. [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, said that in contrary to the current views, Islam ''does not allow the use of sword in religion, except in the case of defensive wars, wars waged to punish a tyrant, or those meant to uphold freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Jihad-Brochure.pdf|title=Jihad the True Islamic Concept|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadiyya claims its objective to be the peaceful propagation of [[Islam]] with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the pen. Ahmadis point out that as per prophecy, who they believe was the promised messiah, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, rendered the concept of violent jihad unnecessary in modern times. They believe that the answer of hate should be given by love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000064.html|title=Jihad of the Pen|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] abolished [[religious war|holy war]] and emphasized its abolition as a central teaching of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://bahai-library.com/wilmette_lawh_ridvan_notes | last = Troxel | first = Duane |author2=Cole, Juan |author3=Lambden, Stephen | title = Tablet of Ridván: Wilmette Institute faculty notes | date =17 October 2003 | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | publisher = bahai-library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bahá'í Faith does not have an absolute pacifistic position. For example, Bahá'ís are advised to do social service instead of active army service, but when this is not possible because of obligations in certain countries, the [[Bahá'í laws|Bahá'í law]] of ''loyalty to one's government'' is preferred and the individual should perform the army service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=1 | title = Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | first = Peter | last = Mazal | date = 21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ud1"&gt;{{Cite book| url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/UD/ud-136.html | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi|title = Unfolding Destiny|pages = 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, noted that in the Bahá'í view, absolute pacifists are anti-social and exalt the individual over society which could lead to anarchy; instead he noted that the Bahá'í conception of social life follows a moderate view where the individual is not suppressed or exalted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-144.html#gr1 | title = Directives from the Guardian | last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | pages = 53–54 | publisher = Baha'i Publishing Trust | location = India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the level of society, Bahá'u'lláh promotes the principle of [[collective security]], which does not abolish the use of force, but prescribes "a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Shoghi

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism and violence|Engaged Buddhism|Religion and peacebuilding#Buddhism and peacebuilding}}

Buddhism is generally seen as among the least violent religious traditions,&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Warfare by Michael Jerryson and Mark Juergensmeyer / Oxford University Press 2010, p.3 {{ISBN|978-0-19-539484-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ahimsa]] (do no harm), is a primary virtue in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Baroni2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Josephine Baroni|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smNM4ElP3XgC&amp;pg=PA3|date=January 2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-2240-6|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aung San Suu Kyi]] is a Buddhist [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] pro-democracy activist and leader of the [[National League for Democracy]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma), who became State Counsellor (similar to prime minister) of Myanmar in April 2016. A devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], Suu Kyi won the [[Rafto Prize]] and the [[Sakharov Prize|Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought]] in 1990 and in 1991 was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a repressive [[military dictatorship]]. One of her best known speeches is the "Freedom From Fear" speech, which begins, "It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1991/kyi-bio.html |title=Aung San Suu Kyi — Biography |publisher=Nobel Foundation |accessdate=4 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian pacifism}}
[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|right|''[[Blessed are the peacemakers|Blessed are the Peacemakers]]'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]]]]

====Peace churches====
[[Peace churches]] are Christian denominations explicitly advocating pacifism.  The term "historic peace churches" refers specifically to three church traditions: the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Mennonites]] (and some other [[Anabaptists]], such as [[Amish]] [[Hutterites]], and the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof_Communities|title=Bruderhof Communities - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[Quakers]] (Religious Society of Friends). The historic peace churches have, from their origins as far back as the 16th century, always taken the position that [[Jesus]] was himself a pacifist who explicitly taught and practiced pacifism, and that his followers must do likewise. Pacifist churches vary on whether physical force can ever be justified in [[self-defense]] or protecting others, as many adhere strictly to [[nonresistance]] when confronted by violence.  But all agree that violence on behalf of a country or a government is prohibited for Christians.

====Pentecostal churches====
Jay Beaman's thesis&lt;ref name='beaman'&gt;Beaman, J: Pentecostal Pacifism: The Origin, Development, and Rejection of Pacific Belief among the Pentecostals, Center for Mennonite Brethren Studies, Hillsboro, Kansas, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; states that 13 of 21, or 62% of American Pentecostal groups formed by 1917 show evidence of being pacifist sometime in their history. Furthermore, Jay Beaman has shown in his thesis&lt;ref name='beaman'/&gt; that there has been a shift away from pacifism in the American Pentecostal churches to more a style of military support and chaplaincy. The major organisation for Pentecostal Christians who believe in pacifism is the PCPF, the [[Pentecostal Charismatic Peace Fellowship]].

The [[United Pentecostal Church]], the largest Apostolic/[[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness]] denomination, takes an official stand of conscientious objection: its Articles of Faith read, "We are constrained to declare against participating in combatant service in war, armed insurrection&amp;nbsp;... aiding or abetting in or the actual destruction of human life. We believe that we can be consistent in serving our Government in certain noncombatant capacities, but not in the bearing of arms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritualabuse.org/aof.html The Articles of Faith 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Christian denominations====
[[File:Constantines-Sword.png|thumb|left|The shadow of the cross symbolizes the connection between religion and war in ''[[Constantine's Sword|Constantine's Sword (film)]]'']]
The [[Peace Pledge Union]] was a pacifist organisation from which the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship (APF) later emerged within the Anglican Church. The APF succeeded in gaining ratification of the pacifist position at two successive [[Lambeth Conferences]], but many Anglicans would not regard themselves as pacifists. South African Bishop [[Desmond Tutu]] is the most prominent Anglican pacifist. [[Rowan Williams]] led an almost united Anglican Church in Britain in opposition to the 2003 [[Iraq War]].  In Australia [[Peter Carnley]] similarly led a front of bishops opposed to the [[Government of Australia]]'s involvement in the invasion of Iraq.

The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] is concerned with both social justice and pacifist issues, and voiced consistent opposition to the [[Spanish Civil War]] and World War II. Many of its early members were imprisoned for their opposition to [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworker.org/ Catholic Worker Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Roman Catholic Church, the [[Pax Christi]] organisation is the premiere pacifist lobby group. It holds positions similar to APF, and the two organisations are known to work together on ecumenical projects. Within Roman Catholicism there has been a discernible move towards a more pacifist position through the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Popes [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] were all vocal in their opposition to specific wars. By taking the name [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], some suspected that [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] would continue the strong emphasis upon nonviolent conflict resolution of his predecessor. However, the Roman Catholic Church officially maintains the legitimacy of Just War, which is rejected by some pacifists.

In the twentieth century there was a notable trend among prominent Roman Catholics towards pacifism.  Individuals such as [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Henri Nouwen]] stand out among them. The monk and mystic [[Thomas Merton]] was noted for his commitment to pacifism during the [[Vietnam War]] era.  Murdered [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] Bishop [[Óscar Romero]] was notable for using non-violent resistance tactics and wrote meditative sermons focusing on the power of prayer and peace. [[School of the Americas Watch]] was founded by Maryknoll Fr. Roy Bourgeois in 1990 and uses strictly pacifist principles to protest the training of Latin American military officers by United States Army officers at the School of the Americas in the state of Georgia.

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] also tends towards pacifism, though it has accepted defensive warfare through most of its history. However, more recently{{when|date=May 2011}} it took a strong stance towards the war in Lebanon and its large community there refused to take up arms during its civil wars. It also supports dialogue with Islam.  In 1998 the Third Pre-conciliar Pan-Orthodox Conference drew up a text on "the contribution of the Orthodox Church to the achievement of peace" emphasizing respect for the human person and the inseparability of peace from justice. The text states in part: "Orthodoxy condemns war in general, for she regards it as a consequence of the evil and sin in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incommunion.org/articles/for-the-peace-from-above/the-orthodox-church-and-peace Clément, Olivier, "The Orthodox Church and Peace Some Reflections"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902132037/http://incommunion.org/articles/for-the-peace-from-above/the-orthodox-church-and-peace |date=2009-09-02 }} on the Orthodox Peace Fellowship website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has stated in the [[Baptist Faith and Message]], "It is the duty of Christians to seek peace with all men on principles of [[righteousness]]. In accordance with the spirit and teachings of Christ they should do all in their power to put an end to war."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp#xvi SBC, " Baptist Faith and Message 2000"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Methodist Church]] explicitly supports conscientious objection by its members "as an ethically valid position" while simultaneously allowing for differences of opinion and belief for those who do not object to military service.&lt;ref&gt;Article V, section 2 of [http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=4&amp;mid=989 The United Methodist Church and Peace]&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Rastafari Movement]]'s Mansion [[Mansions of Rastafari#Niyabinghi|Nyabinghi]] are specifically noted for having a large population of Pacifist members, though not all of them are.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Ahimsa}}

Non violence, or [[ahimsa]], is a central part of Hinduism and is one of the fundamental [[Yamas]] - self restraints needed to live a proper life. The concept of ahimsa grew gradually within Hinduism, one of the signs being the discouragement of ritual animal sacrifice. Most Hindus today have a vegetarian diet. There are debates on how far the principle of ahimsa applies and if there is such a thing as a "just war".

===Jainism===
[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Non-violence, Compassion for all life, human and non-human]], is central to [[Jainism]]. Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment. Killing any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably terrible. It is a religion that requires monks, from all its sects and traditions, to be [[vegetarian]]. Some Indian regions, such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination are also vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, Kurt, Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Mohtilal Banarsidass, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The attitude of Jews toward pacifism, as with most other aspects of religion, is heavily influenced by the Holocaust which was a program of Nazi Germany to murder every man, woman and child who was Jewish as well as people of other religions who had a Jewish grandparent.  As a result, some six million people were exterminated by various means because the Nazis considered them Jews and therefore unworthy of life.  In hindsight, there were opportunities for a number of years to defeat Nazi Germany before it could build a military force strong enough to capture and kill most of the Jews of Europe.&lt;ref name="May, Earnest R. 2000"&gt;May, Earnest R., ''Strange Victory: Hitler's Conquest of France'' (Hill and Wang ed. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Forces which deterred the democracies from acting to stop Hitler early on and at a much, much lower cost in human life were pacifism, appeasement, and isolationism.&lt;ref name="May, Earnest R. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Lynne, ''Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939–1941''(Random House 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  People who offered no resistance to the Nazis enabled them to carry out their oppression and aggression, costing tens of millions of lives in World War II. Had pacifism gained more support, the Allies might have lost the war and virtually all Jews would have been killed.
 
The Jewish Peace Fellowship is a New-York based [[nonprofit]], [[Jewish denominations|nondenominational]] organization set up to provide a [[Judaism|Jewish]] voice in the [[peace movement]]. The organization was founded in 1941 in order to support Jewish [[conscientious objectors]] who sought exemption from combatant military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpeacefellowship.org/index.php?p=about Jewish Peace Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt; It is affiliated to the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifor.org/members.htm IFOR Members] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423022546/http://www.ifor.org/members.htm |date=April 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The small [[Neturei Karta]] group of anti-Zionist, ultra-orthodox Jews, supposedly take a pacifist line, saying that "Jews are not allowed to dominate, kill, harm or demean another people and are not allowed to have anything to do with the Zionist enterprise, their political meddling and their wars.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/aboutus/index.cfm What is the Neturei Karta?]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Neturei Karta group do support groups such as [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]] that are violent towards Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/anti-zionist-ultra-orthodox-jews-celebrate-sabbath-in-gaza-1.265558 Anti-Zionist ultra-Orthodox Jews celebrate Sabbath in Gaza]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Bible is full of examples when Jews were told to go and war against enemy lands or within the Israelite community as well as instances where God, as destroyer and protector, goes to war for non-participant Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Niditch, Susan, ''War in the Hebrew Bible'' (Oxford University Press ed. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Holocaust Remembrance Day (called Yom Hashoah in Hebrew) is a day a remembrance for many Jews as they honor those who fought to end the Hitler government which starved, shot, gassed and burned over six million Jews to death.  It is observed on the day corresponding to the 27th day of the month of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Remembrance Day Calendar, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, ushmm.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raëlism===
Non-violence is an important doctrine within [[Raëlism]]. The founder of this religion Rael has said "''The one holding the weapon is as responsible as the one giving the orders''". Other Rael statements include "''even if the Elohim asked them to kill someone they should refuse''".&lt;ref&gt;Aliens adored: Raël's UFO religion - Page 62, Susan J. Palmer - 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and political movements==
[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|[[Erich Maria Remarque|Remarque]]'s anti-war novel ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' was banned and burned by war-glorifying Nazis]]
While many governments have tolerated pacifist views and even accommodated pacifists' refusal to fight in wars, others at times have outlawed pacifist and anti-war activity. In 1918, The United States Congress passed the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]. During the periods between World Wars I and World War II, pacifist literature and public advocacy was banned in [[Italy]] under [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Germany]] after the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref name="bz"&gt;Benjamin Ziemann, "Pacifism"
in ''World Fascism:An Encyclopedia'', edited by Cyprian P. Blamires. ABC-CLIO Ltd, 2006.  {{ISBN|1-57607-940-6}} (p.&amp;nbsp;495–6)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Francoist Spain|Spain]] under [[Francisco Franco]],&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–7, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name="nsleu"&gt;''Notes sur l'anarchisme en U.R.S.S : De 1921 à nos jours''.Les Cahiers du Vent du Chemin. Paris,1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In these nations, pacifism was denounced as cowardice; indeed, Mussolini referred to pacifist writings as the "propaganda of cowardice".&lt;ref name="bz" /&gt;

Today, the United States requires that all young men register for selective service but does not allow them to be classified as conscientious objectors unless they are drafted in some future reinstatement of the draft, allowing them to be discharged or transferred to noncombatant status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objector.org/advice/conscientious_objector-6.html#pgfId-183 "Conscientious Objection Today, Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some European governments like [[Swiss Civilian Service|Switzerland]], [[Greece]], [[Norway]] and [[Germany]] offer [[civilian service]]. However, even during periods of peace, many pacifists still refuse to register for or report for military duty, risking criminal charges.

Anti-war and "pacifist" political parties seeking to win elections may moderate their demands, calling for [[de-escalation]] or major [[arms reduction]] rather than the outright [[disarmament]] which is advocated by many pacifists. [[Green parties]] list "[[non-violence]]" and "[[decentralization]]" towards anarchist co-operatives or minimalist village government as two of their ten key values. However, in power, Greens often compromise. The German Greens in the cabinet of Social Democrat [[Gerhard Schröder]] supported an intervention by German troops in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001 if that they hosted the peace conference in Berlin. However, during the 2002 election Greens forced Schröder to swear that no German troops would invade Iraq.

The controversial [[democratic peace theory]] holds that [[liberal democracies]] have never (or rarely) made war on one another and that lesser conflicts and internal violence are rare between and within democracies. It also argues that the growth in the number of democratic states will, in the not so distant future, end warfare.
[[File:Марш за мир и свободу (15).jpg|thumb|[[March of Peace]], which took place in Moscow in March 2014]]

Some pacifists and [[multilateralism|multilateralists]] are in favor of international criminal law as means to prevent and control international aggression. The [[International Criminal Court]] has jurisdiction over war crimes, but the crime of aggression has yet to be clearly defined in international law.

The [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] enforces a mild pacifist character on the Italian Republic, as Article 11 states that "Italy repudiates war as an instrument offending the liberty of the peoples and as a means for settling international disputes&amp;nbsp;..." Similarly, Articles 24, 25 and 26 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]] (1949), Alinea 15 of the French Constitution (1946), Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]] (1953), [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] (1947) and several other mostly European constitutions correspond to the United Nations Charter by rejecting the institution of war in favour of [[collective security]] and peaceful cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/peace/unitednationsreform2007/liste24list_en.html "Constitutional clauses providing for limitations of national sovereignty to achieve cooperation, peace and disarmament"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720025109/http://www.ne.jp/asahi/peace/unitednationsreform2007/liste24list_en.html |date=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacifism and abstention from political activity===
However, some pacifists, such as the [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[autarchist]] [[Robert LeFevre]], consider the state a form of warfare. In addition, for doctrinal reason that a manmade government is inferior to divine governance and law, many pacifist-identified religions/religious sects also refrain from political activity altogether, including the [[Anabaptists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mandaeans]]. This means that such groups refuse to participate in government office or serve under an oath to a government.

===Anarcho-pacifism===
{{Main|Anarcho-pacifism}}
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Henry David Thoreau]], early proponent of [[anarcho-pacifism]]]]Anarcho-pacifism (also pacifist anarchism or anarchist pacifism) is a form of [[anarchism]] which completely rejects the use of violence in any form for any purpose. The main precedent was [[Henry David Thoreau]] who through his work [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] influenced the advocacy of both Leo Tolstoy and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] for [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence The pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; As a global movement, Anarchist pacifism emerged shortly before [[World War II]] in the Netherlands, Great Britain and the United States and was a strong presence in the subsequent campaigns for [[nuclear disarmament]].

Violence has always been controversial in anarchism. While many anarchists during the 19th century embraced [[propaganda of the deed]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and other anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change. He argued that anarchism must by nature be nonviolent since it is, by definition, opposition to coercion and force and since the state is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic. His philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], an [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] leader and pacifist who self-identified as an anarchist. [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]] was also instrumental in establishing the pacifist trend within the anarchist movement.&lt;ref name=woodcock&gt;{{Cite book|last=Woodcock |first=George |title=Anarchism: a History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements |publisher=Broadview Press |location=Peterborough |year=2004 |isbn=1-55111-629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France anti-militarism appeared strongly in individualist anarchist circles as [[Émile Armand]] founded "Ligue Antimilitariste" in 1902 with [[Albert Libertad]] and George Mathias Paraf-Javal.

===Opposition to military taxation===
Many pacifists who would be conscientious objectors to military service are also [[tax resistance|opposed to paying taxes]] to fund the military. In the United States, [[The National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund]] works to pass a national law to allow conscientious objectors to redirect their tax money to be used only for non-military purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacetaxfund.org/aboutus/mission.htm Mission of National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165301/http://www.peacetaxfund.org/aboutus/mission.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One common argument against pacifism is the possibility of using violence to prevent further acts of violence (and reduce the "net-sum" of violence). This argument hinges on [[consequentialism]]: an otherwise morally objectionable action can be justified if it results in a positive outcome. For example, either violent rebellion, or foreign nations sending in troops to end a dictator's violent oppression may save millions of lives, even if many thousands died in the war. Those pacifists who base their beliefs on [[deontology|deontological]] grounds would oppose such violent action. Others would oppose organized military responses but support individual and small group self-defense against specific attacks if initiated by the dictator's forces. Pacifists may argue that military action could be justified should it subsequently advance the general cause of peace.

Still more pacifists would argue that a nonviolent reaction may not save lives immediately but would in the long run. The acceptance of violence for any reason makes it easier to use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message that violence is, in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.

In light of the common criticism of pacifism as not offering a clear alternative policy, one approach to finding "more effective ways" has been the attempt to develop the idea of "defence by [[civil resistance]]", also called "[[social defence]]". This idea, which is not necessarily dependent on acceptance of pacifist beliefs, is based on relying on [[nonviolent resistance]] against possible threats, whether external (such as invasion) or internal (such as [[coup d'état]]).
[[File:Ghetto Vilinus.gif|thumb|Jewish armed resistance against the Nazis during World War II]]

There have been some works on this topic, including by [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]]&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, ed. ''The Strategy of Civilian Defence: Non-violent Resistance to Aggression'', Faber, London, 1967. (Also published as ''Civilian Resistance as a National Defense'', Stackpole Books, Harrisburg, USA, 1968; and, with a new Introduction on "Czechoslovakia and Civilian Defence", as ''Civilian Resistance as a National Defence'', Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, and Baltimore, USA, 1969. {{ISBN|0-14-021080-6}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gene Sharp]].&lt;ref&gt;Gene Sharp, ''Social Power and Political Freedom'', Porter Sargent, Boston, 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;195–261. {{ISBN|0-87558-093-9}} (paperback); and ''Civilian-based Defence: A Post-military Weapons System'', Princeton University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-691-07809-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no country has adopted this approach as the sole basis of its defence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], in Roberts and Garton Ash (ed.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics'', Introduction, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; (For further information and sources see [[social defence]].)

Japanese, Italian and Nazi aggression that precipitated [[World War II]] often is cited {{By whom|date=June 2010}}as an argument against pacifism. If these forces had not been challenged and defeated militarily, the argument goes, many more people would have died under their oppressive rule. [[Adolf Hitler]] told the British Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] in 1937 that the British should "shoot Gandhi, and if this doesn't suffice to reduce them to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of the Congress, and if that doesn't suffice shoot 200, and so on, as you make it clear that you mean business."&lt;ref&gt;Ghose, Sankar (1992). ''Jawaharlal Nehru, A Biography'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=MUeyUhVGIDMC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p.138]. Allied Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] noted in his [[Second Book]]: "...&amp;nbsp;Later, the attempt to adapt the living space to increased population turned into unmotivated wars of conquest, which in their very lack of motivation contained the germ of the subsequent reaction. Pacifism is the answer to it. Pacifism has existed in the world ever since there have been wars whose meaning no longer lay in the conquest of territory for a Folk's sustenance. Since then it has been war's eternal companion. It will again disappear as soon as war ceases to be an instrument of booty hungry or power hungry individuals or nations, and as soon as it again becomes the ultimate weapon with which a Folk fights for its daily bread."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Adolf Hitler#The Second book (1928)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermann Göring]] described, during an interview at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], how denouncing and outlawing pacifism was an important part of the Nazis' seizure of power: "The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Hermann Göring#Nuremberg Diary (1947)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators on the most nonviolent forms of pacifism, including [[Jan Narveson]], argue that such pacifism is a self-contradictory doctrine. Narveson claims that everyone has rights and corresponding responsibilities not to violate others' rights. Since pacifists give up their ability to protect themselves from violation of their right not to be harmed, then other people thus have no corresponding responsibility, thus creating a paradox of rights. Narveson said that "the prevention of infractions of that right is precisely what one has a right to when one has a right at all". Narveson then discusses how rational persuasion is a good but often inadequate method of discouraging an aggressor. He considers that everyone has the right to use any means necessary to prevent deprivation of their civil liberties and force could be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Narveson, January 1965. "Pacifism: A Philosophical Analysis." ''Ethics'', LXXV: 4, pp&amp;nbsp;259–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pastry War''' ({{lang-es|Guerra de los pasteles}}, {{lang-fr|Guerre des Pâtisseries}}),&lt;ref&gt;Commonly known in Spanish as the ''Primera intervención francesa en México'', "First French intervention in Mexico".&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''First French intervention in Mexico''' or the '''First Franco-Mexican War''' (1838–1839), began in November 1838 with the naval blockade of some Mexican ports and the capture of the fortress of [[San Juan de Ulúa]] in Veracruz by [[French Armed Forces|French forces]] sent by King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe]]. It ended several months later in March 1839 with a British-brokered peace. The intervention followed many claims by French nationals of losses due to unrest in [[Mexico]].

This incident was the first and lesser of Mexico's two 19th-century wars with France, being followed by the [[French intervention in Mexico|French invasion of 1861–67]] which supported the short reign of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] who was [[The Execution of Emperor Maximilian|executed by firing squad]] at the end of that later conflict.&lt;ref name="Napoléon" /&gt;

== Background ==
During the early years of the new Mexican republic there was widespread civil disorder as factions competed for control of the country. The fighting often resulted in the destruction or looting of private property. Average citizens had few options for claiming compensation as they had no representatives to speak on their behalf. Foreigners whose property was damaged or destroyed by rioters or bandits were usually  also unable to obtain compensation from the Mexican government and they began to appeal to their own governments for help and compensation.

Commercial relationships between France and Mexico existed prior to France's recognition of [[Independence of Mexico|Mexico's independence]] in 1830, and after the establishment of diplomatic relationships France rapidly became Mexico's third largest trade partner. However, France had yet to secure trade agreements similar to those that the United States and Great Britain (then Mexico's two largest trade partners) had, and as a result of this French goods were subject to higher taxes

==Chronology of the conflict==
[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|French troops under [[Prince François, Prince of Joinville|Prince de Joinville]] attack residence of General [[Mariano Arista|Arista]] in Veracruz, 1838.]]
In a complaint to King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], a French [[pastry]] chef known only as Monsieur Remontel claimed that in 1832 Mexican officers looted his shop in [[Metro Tacubaya|Tacubaya]] (then a town on the outskirts of [[Mexico City]]). Remontel demanded 60,000 pesos as reparations for the damage (his shop was valued at less than 1,000 pesos).&lt;ref name="Aguilar Casas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plumas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coerver" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klein|first1=Christopher|title=The Pastry War, 175 Years Ago|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-pastry-war-175-years-ago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of Remontel's complaint (which gave its name to the ensuing conflict) and of other complaints from French nationals (among them the looting in 1828 of French shops at the [[Zócalo|Parian market]] and the execution in 1837 of a French citizen accused of piracy) in 1838 prime minister [[Louis-Mathieu Molé]] demanded from Mexico the payment of 600,000 [[Spanish dollar|pesos]] (3 million [[Francs]]) in damages,&lt;ref name="Penot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plumas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Acuerdo entre México y Francia pone fin a la Guerra de los Pasteles|url=http://plumaslibres.com.mx/2015/03/09/acuerdo-entre-mexico-y-francia-pone-fin-a-la-guerra-de-los-pasteles/}}&lt;/ref&gt; an enormous sum for the time, when the typical daily wage in Mexico City was about one peso (8 [[Mexican real]]s).

When president [[Anastasio Bustamante]] made no payment, the King of France ordered a fleet under Rear Admiral [[Charles Baudin]] to declare and carry out a [[blockade]] of all Mexican ports on the Atlantic coast from [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] to the [[Rio Grande]], to bombard the Mexican fortress of [[Battle of Veracruz (1838)|San Juan de Ulúa]], and to seize the city of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], which was the most important port on the Gulf coast. French forces captured Veracruz by December 1838 and Mexico declared war on France.

 {{Further information|Battle of Veracruz (1838)}}

With trade cut off, the Mexicans began smuggling imports via [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi, Republic of Texas]] and into Mexico. Fearing that France would blockade the Republic's ports as well, a battalion of Texan forces began patrolling [[Corpus Christi Bay]] to stop Mexican smugglers. One smuggling party abandoned their cargo of about a hundred barrels of flour on the beach at the mouth of the bay, thus giving [[Flour Bluff]] its name. The United States, ever watchful of its relations with Mexico, sent the schooner ''[[USRC Woodbury (1837)|Woodbury]]'' to help the French in their blockade &lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nofi" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Nofi|first1=Albert A.|title=The Alamo and the Texas War for Independence|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-80563-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, acting without explicit government authority, [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], known for his military leadership, came out of retirement from his hacienda near [[Xalapa]] and surveyed the defenses of Veracruz. He offered his services to the government, which ordered him to fight the French by any means necessary. He led Mexican forces against the French. In a skirmish with the rear guard of the French, Santa Anna was wounded in the leg by French grapeshot. His leg was amputated and buried with full military honors.&lt;ref name=Orange&gt;[http://orangeleader.com/local/x2056600153/Santa-Anna-s-Leg "Santa Anna's Leg"], ''The Orange Leader'' (Orange, Texas)  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104115445/http://orangeleader.com/local/x2056600153/Santa-Anna-s-Leg |date=November 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting his wounds with eloquent propaganda, Santa Anna catapulted back to power.

==Peace restored==
The French forces withdrew on 9 March 1839 after a peace treaty was signed. As part of said treaty the Mexican government agreed to pay 600,000 [[peso]]s as damages to French citizens while France received promises for future trade commitments in place of war indemnities. However, this amount was never paid and that was later used as one of the [[Casus belli|justifications]] for the second [[French intervention in Mexico]] of 1861.&lt;ref name="Aguilar Casas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Napoléon" /&gt;

Following the Mexican victory in 1867 and the collapse of the second French empire in 1870, Mexico and France would not resume diplomatic relationships until 1880 when both countries left behind claims related to the wars.&lt;ref name=Coerver&gt;Coerver, Don M.

The '''''Polish Operation''''' of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[NKVD|security service]] in 1937–1938 was a [[Mass operations of the NKVD|mass operation of the NKVD]] carried out in the [[Soviet Union]] against [[Poles]] (labeled by the Soviets as "agents") during the period of the [[Great Purge]]. It was ordered by the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] against the so-called "Polish spies" and customarily interpreted by the [[NKVD]] officials as relating to 'absolutely all Poles'. It resulted in the sentencing of 139,835 people, and summary executions of 111,091 Poles.&lt;ref name="Gellately-Kiernan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman2011-217"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wendy Z.

==Order № 00485==
{{main article|Order № 00485}}
The top secret [[NKVD Order No. 00485]], titled "''On the liquidation of the Polish diversionist and espionage groups and POW units''," was approved on August 9, 1937 by [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|the Party's]] [[Central Committee]] [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]], and was signed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]] on August 11, 1937.&lt;ref name="Russian1" /&gt; It was distributed to the local subdivisions of the NKVD simultaneously with Yezhov's thirty-page "secret letter," explaining what the "Polish operation" was all about. The letter from Yezhov was titled, "''On fascist-resurrectionist, spying, diversional, defeationist, and terrorist activity of Polish intelligence in the USSR''".&lt;ref name="Russian2"&gt;Original document. [http://perpetrator2004.narod.ru/documents/Great_Terror/Letter_On_POV.doc  Full text of the Order in the Russian language.] "О фашистско-повстанческой, шпионской, диверсионной, пораженческой и террористической деятельности польской разведки в СССР."

The "Order" adopted the simplified so-called "[[album procedure]]" (as it was called in NKVD circles). The long lists of Poles condemned by a lower NKVD organ (so-called ''dvoika'', a two-man team) during early meetings,{{r|Sanford2007}} were then collected into "albums" and sent to the midrange NKVD offices for a stamp of approval by a ''troika'' (a three-man team; a communist official, NKVD leader, and party procurator). Poles were the first ever major Soviet population group to be sentenced in this manner.&lt;ref name="Sanford2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Katyn and the Soviet Massacre of 1940: Truth, Justice and Memory |author=[[George Sanford (political scientist)|George Sanford]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tV2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33 |publisher=Routledge |date=2007 |ISBN=1134302991 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the approval of the entire "album", the executions were carried out immediately. This procedure was also used later on in other [[mass operations of the NKVD]].&lt;ref name="Werth2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tyrollins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SEMELIN-MASS-VIOLENCE-IN-USSR-NATION-FRON-OPERATIONS-OF-THE-NKVD-1937-TO-1938.pdf |title=The NKVD Mass Secret National Operations (August 1937 - November 1938) |publisher=MassViolence.org |work=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |date=20 May 2010 |via=Internet Archive |author=Nicolas Werth |pages=4 of 10 |format=PDF |ISSN=1961-9898 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220170831/http://www.tyrollins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SEMELIN-MASS-VIOLENCE-IN-USSR-NATION-FRON-OPERATIONS-OF-THE-NKVD-1937-TO-1938.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Polish Operation" was a second in a series of [[Mass operations of the NKVD|national operations of the NKVD]], carried out by the Soviet Union against ethnic groups including Latvian, Finnish, German and Romanian, based on a theory about an internal enemy (i.e. the [[fifth column]]) labelled as the "hostile capitalist surrounding" residing along its western borders.&lt;ref name="arlindo-correia-2" /&gt; In opinion of historian [[Timothy Snyder]], this fabricated justification was intended only to cover-up the state-sanctioned campaign of mass-murder aiming to eradicate Poles as a national (and linguistic) minority group.&lt;ref name="arlindo-correia-2" /&gt; Another possible cause according to Snyder might have sprung from the necessity to explain the [[Holodomor|Soviet-made famine in Ukraine]] which required a political scapegoat. A top Soviet official [[Vsevolod Balitsky]] chose the [[Polish Military Organization]] which was disbanded in 1921. The NKVD declared that it continued to exist. Some Soviet Poles were tortured in order to confess to its existence, and denounce other individuals as spies. Meanwhile, the Communist International helped by revisiting its files in search of Polish members, producing another bountiful source of made-up evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder (2005), ''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=LkZlidUKEl8C&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=elections%20Poland%201930&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=sabotaging+collectivization&amp;f=false  Sketches from a Secret War]'' Yale University Press, p. 129. {{ISBN|030010670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scale of the Polish Operation and its victims==
The operation took place approximately from August 25, 1937 to November 15, 1938.&lt;ref name="balticnorthernminorities"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balticnorthernminorities.org/pdf/project_abstracts.pdf |title=The 'Polish operation' of the NKVD |publisher=[[Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw|University of Stefan Wyszyński]] in [[Warsaw]] |work=The Baltic and Arctic Areas under Stalin.

Among them were tens of thousands of peasants, railway workers, industrial labourers, engineers and others. An additional 17 percent of victims came from the Soviet Byelorussia. The rest came from around Western Siberia and Kazakhstan, where exiled Poles had lived since the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]], as well as from the southern Urals, northern Caucasus and the rest of Siberia, including the Far East.&lt;ref name="Gellately-Kiernan"&gt;{{cite book | title=The specter of genocide: mass murder in historical perspective. | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | author=Robert Gellately, Ben Kiernan | year=2003 | pages=396 | isbn=0521527503 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=k9Ro7b0tWz4C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=%22lead,+in+the+next+fourteen+months,+to+the+arrest+of+143,810+people%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XHC3TdekDoPniALfvPE7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lead%2C%20in%20the%20next%20fourteen%20months%2C%20to%20the%20arrest%20of%20143%2C810%20people%22&amp;f=false | quote= Polish operation (page 233 –) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following categories of people were arrested by the NKVD during its Polish operation, as described in Soviet documents:
# "Active" members of the [[Polish minority in Soviet Union]] (practically all Poles).&lt;ref name="Gellately-Kiernan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman2011-217"/&gt;
# All [[immigrant]]s from [[Poland]].

# Former and present members of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] and other non-[[communist]] Polish political parties.
# All [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from the [[Polish-Soviet war]] remaining in the Soviet Union.
# Members of [[Polish Military Organisation|Polska Organizacja Wojskowa]] listed in the special list (most of them were not members of that organisation).

===Killing process and death toll===
According to archives of the NKVD: 111,091 [[Poles]] and people accused of ties with Poland, were sentenced to death, and 28,744 were sentenced to [[labor camp]]s (known as the "dry guillotine" of slow death by exposure, malnutrition, and overwork);&lt;ref name="grhs.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grhs.org/heritage/SovietRepression.pdf | title=Soviet "Paradise" Revisited: Genocide, Dissent, Memory and Denial | publisher=GRHS Heritage Society | accessdate=April 26, 2011 | author=Eric J.

The Operation was only a peak in the persecution of the Poles, which spanned more than a decade. As the Soviet statistics indicate, the number of ethnic Poles in the USSR dropped by 165,000 in that period. "It is estimated that Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30%, while in the Belorussian SSR... the Polish minority was almost completely annihilated."&lt;ref name="balticnorthernminorities" /&gt;

[[Timothy Snyder]] gives a conservative estimate of 85,000 confirmed Poles executed simultaneously across the country.&lt;ref name="Snyder2010-103"/&gt;

Almost all victims of the NKVD shootings were men, wrote Michał Jasiński, most with families. Their wives and children were dealt with by the [[NKVD Order № 00486]]. The women were generally sentenced to deportation to Kazakhstan for an average of 5 to 10 years. Their children were put in orphanages to be brought up as Soviet, with no knowledge of their origins. All possessions of the accused were confiscated. The parents of the executed men – as well as their in-laws – were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well. Statistical extrapolation, wrote Jasiński, increases the number of Polish victims in 1937–1938 to around 200–250,000 depending on size of their families.&lt;ref name="fronda"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fronda.gliwice.pl/czytelnia.php5?id=84 | title=Zapomniane ludobójstwo stalinowskie (The forgotten Stalinist genocide) | publisher=Gliwicki klub Fondy.

{{Postmodernism}}
'''Postmodernity''' ('''post-modernity''' or the '''postmodern condition''') is the economic or cultural state or condition of society which is said to exist ''after'' [[modernity]]. (In this context, "modern" is not used in the sense of "contemporary", but merely as a name for a specific period in history.) Some schools of thought hold that modernity ended in the late 20th century – in the 1980s or early 1990s – and that it was replaced by postmodernity, while others would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity, while some believe that modernity ended after World War II. The idea of the post-modern condition is sometimes characterised as a culture stripped of its capacity to function in any linear or autonomous state{{huh|date=August 2018}}&lt;!-- what is autonomous from what?--&gt; as opposed to the progressive mindstate of [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, ''Postmodernism'' (London 1991), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodernity can mean a personal response to a postmodern society, the conditions in a society which make it postmodern or the [[state of being]] that is associated with a postmodern society as well a historical epoch. In most contexts it should be distinguished from [[postmodernism]], the adoption of [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern philosophies]] or traits in art, literature, culture and society. In fact, today, historical perspectives on the developments of postmodern art (postmodernism) and postmodern society (postmodernity) can be best described as two umbrella terms for processes engaged in an ongoing dialectical relationship{{huh|date=August 2018}}, the result of which is the evolving culture of the contemporary world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nilges|first1=Mathias|title=The Presence of Postmodernism in Contemporary American Literature|journal=American Literary History|date=Spring 2015|volume=27|issue=1|pages=186–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the term ==
''Postmodernity'' is the state or condition of being postmodern – after or in reaction to that which is modern, as in [[postmodern art]] (''see [[postmodernism]]''). [[Modernity]] is defined as a period or condition loosely identified with the Progressive Era, the [[Industrial Revolution]], or [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]]. In [[philosophy]] and [[critical theory]] ''postmodernity'' refers to the state or condition of society which is said to exist ''after'' [[modernity]], a historical condition that marks the reasons for the end of [[modernity]]. This usage is ascribed to the philosophers [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]].

One "project" of modernity is said by [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]] to have been the fostering of progress by incorporating principles of [[rationality]] and [[hierarchy]] into public and artistic life. (See also [[postindustrial]], [[Information Age]].) Lyotard understood [[modernity]] as a cultural condition characterized by constant change in the pursuit of progress. Postmodernity then represents the culmination of this process where constant change has become the ''[[status quo]]'' and the notion of progress obsolete. Following [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s critique of the possibility of absolute and total knowledge, Lyotard further argued that the various [[metanarrative]]s of progress such as [[Positivism|positivist]] [[science]], [[Marxism]], and [[structuralism]] were defunct as methods of achieving progress.

The literary critic [[Fredric Jameson]] and the geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] have identified postmodernity with "[[late capitalism]]" or "flexible accumulation", a stage of capitalism following [[finance capitalism]], characterised by highly mobile labor and capital and what Harvey called "time and space compression". They suggest that this coincides with the breakdown of the [[Bretton Woods system]] which, they believe, defined the economic order following the Second World War. (See also [[consumerism]], [[critical theory]].)

Those who generally view modernity as obsolete or an outright failure, a flaw in humanity's evolution leading to disasters like [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]], see postmodernity as a positive development. Other philosophers, particularly those seeing themselves as within the modern project, see the state of postmodernity as a negative consequence of holding postmodernist ideas. For example, [[Jürgen Habermas]] and others contend that postmodernity represents a resurgence of long running [[counter-enlightenment]] ideas, that the modern project is not finished and that [[Universal (metaphysics)|universality]] cannot be so lightly dispensed with. Postmodernity, the consequence of holding postmodern ideas, is generally a negative term in this context.

==Postmodernism==
{{Main article|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernity is a condition or a state of being associated with changes to institutions and creations ([[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]], 1990) and with social and political results and innovations, globally but especially in the West since the 1950s, whereas [[postmodernism]] is an aesthetic, literary, political or social philosophy, the "cultural and intellectual phenomenon", especially since the 1920s' new movements in the arts. Both of these terms are used by philosophers, social scientists and social critics to refer to aspects of contemporary culture, economics and society that are the result of features of late 20th century and early 21st century life, including the fragmentation of authority and the [[commoditization]] of knowledge (''see'' "[[Modernity]]"). {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The relationship between postmodernity and critical theory, sociology and philosophy is fiercely contested. The terms "postmodernity" and "postmodernism" are often hard to distinguish, the former being often the result of the latter. The period has had diverse political ramifications: its "anti-ideological ideas" appear to have been associated with the [[feminist movement]], racial equality movements, [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movements]], most forms of late 20th century [[anarchism]] and even the [[peace movement]] as well as various hybrids of these in the current [[anti-globalization movement]]. Though none of these institutions entirely embraces all aspects of the postmodern movement in its most concentrated definition they all reflect, or borrow from, some of its core ideas. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== History ==
Some authors, such as [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]], believe that modernity ended in the late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity, namely postmodernity, while others, such as [[Zygmunt Bauman|Bauman]] and [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]], would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity. Others still contend that modernity ended with the [[Victorian Age]] in the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = William D. | title = Black Intellectuals, Black Cognition, and a Black Aesthetic | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-275-95542-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodernity has been said{{By whom|date=September 2009}} to have gone through two relatively distinct phases the first beginning in the late 1940s and 1950s and ending with the [[Cold War]] (when [[Analog signal|analog]] media with limited [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] encouraged a few, authoritative media channels) and the second beginning at the end of the Cold War (marked by the spread of cable television and "new media" based on [[Digital data|digital]] means of information dissemination and broadcast).

The first phase of postmodernity overlaps the end of [[modernity]] and is regarded by many{{By whom|date=September 2009|Whom}} as being part of the modern period ''(see [[lumpers/splitters]], [[periodization]])''. Television became the primary news source, manufacturing decreased in importance in the economies of Western Europe and the United States but trade volumes increased within the developed core. In 1967–1969 a crucial cultural explosion took place within the developed world as the [[baby boom]] generation, which had grown up with postmodernity as its fundamental experience of society, demanded entrance into the political, cultural and educational power structure. A series of demonstrations and acts of rebellion – ranging from nonviolent and cultural, through violent acts of terrorism – represented the opposition of the young to the policies and perspectives of the previous age. Opposition to the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Vietnam War]], to laws allowing or encouraging racial segregation and to laws which overtly discriminated against women and restricted access to [[divorce]], increased use of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[Psychedelic Drug|psychedelics]], the emergence of pop cultural styles of music and drama, including [[Rock and roll|rock music]] and the ubiquity of [[stereo]], television and [[radio]] helped make these changes visible in the broader cultural context. This period is associated with the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], a philosopher who focused on the results of living in a [[media culture]] and argued that participation in a mass media culture both overshadows actual content disseminated and is liberating because it loosens the authority of local social normative standards.

The second phase of postmodernity is defined {{By whom|date=December 2017}} by "[[digitality]]" – the increasing power of personal and [[Digital data|digital]] means of communication including fax machines, modems, cable and high speed internet, which has altered the condition of postmodernity dramatically: digital production of information allows individuals to manipulate virtually every aspect of the media environment. This has brought producers into conflict with consumers over [[intellectual capital]] and [[intellectual property]] and led to the creation of a [[new economy]] whose supporters argue that the dramatic fall in information costs will alter society fundamentally.

It began to be argued {{By whom|date=December 2017}} that digitality or what [[Esther Dyson]] referred to as "being digital" had emerged as a separate condition from postmodernity. Those holding this position argued that the ability to manipulate items of popular culture, the World Wide Web, the use of search engines to index knowledge, and telecommunications were producing a "convergence" which would be marked by the rise of "[[participatory culture]]" in the words of [[Henry Jenkins]] and the use of [[media device]]s, such as Apple's [[iPod]].

The simplest, but not necessarily most correct demarcation point of this era is {{according to whom|date = December 2017}} the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the liberalisation of China in 1991. [[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote "The End of History" in 1989 in anticipation of the fall of the Berlin wall. He predicted that the question of political philosophy had been answered, that large scale wars over fundamental values would no longer arise since "all prior contradictions are resolved and all human needs satisfied." This is a kind of 'endism' also taken up by [[Arthur Danto]] who in 1984 acclaimed that Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes asked the right question of art and hence art had ended.

=== Distinctions in philosophy and critical theory ===

The debate on postmodernity has two distinct elements that are often confused; (1) the nature of contemporary society and (2) the nature of the critique of contemporary society. The first of these elements is concerned with the nature of changes that took place during the late 20th century. There are three principal analyses. Theorists such as [[Callinicos]] (1991) and [[Craig Calhoun|Calhoun]] (1995) offer a conservative position on the nature of contemporary society, downplaying the significance and extent of socio-economic changes and emphasizing a continuity with the past. Second a range of theorists have tried to analyze the present as a development of the "modern" project into a second, distinct phase that is nevertheless still "modernity": this has been termed the "second" or "risk" society by [[Ulrich Beck]] (1986), "late" or "high" modernity by [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Giddens]] (1990, 1991), "liquid" modernity by [[Zygmunt Bauman]] (2000), and the "network" society by [[Manuel Castells|Castells]] (1996, 1997). Third are those who argue that contemporary society has moved into a literally post-modern phase distinct from modernity. The most prominent proponents of this position are [[Lyotard]] and [[Baudrillard]].

Another set of issues concerns the nature of critique, often replaying debates over (what can be crudely termed) [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] and [[relativism]], where modernism is seen to represent the former and postmodernity the latter. Seyla Benhabib (1995) and [[Judith Butler]] (1995) pursue this debate in relation to feminist politics, Benhabib arguing that postmodern critique comprises three main elements; an [[Anti-foundationalism|anti-foundationalist]] concept of the subject and identity, the [[The End of History and the Last Man|death of history]] and of notions of [[teleology]] and progress, and the death of [[metaphysics]] defined as the search for objective truth. Benhabib argues forcefully against these critical positions, holding that they undermine the bases upon which feminist politics can be founded, removing the possibility of agency, the sense of self-hood and the appropriation of women’s history in the name of an emancipated future. The denial of normative ideals removes the possibility for utopia, central for ethical thinking and democratic action.

Butler responds to Benhabib by arguing that her use of postmodernism is an expression of a wider paranoia over anti-foundationalist philosophy, in particular, [[poststructuralism]].

{{quote|A number of positions are ascribed to postmodernism – Discourse is all there is, as if discourse were some kind of monistic stuff out of which all things are composed; the subject is dead, I can never say “I” again; there is no reality, only representation.  These characterizations are variously imputed to postmodernism or poststructuralism, which are conflated with each other and sometimes conflated with deconstruction, and understood as an indiscriminate assemblage of French feminism, deconstruction, Lacanian psychoanalysis, Foucauldian analysis, Rorty’s conversationalism, and cultural studies ... In reality, these movements are opposed: Lacanian psychoanalysis in France positions itself officially against poststructuralism, that Foucauldian rarely relate to Derridideans ... Lyotard champions the term, but he cannot be made into the example of what all the rest of the purported postmodernists are doing.  Lyotard’s work is, for instance, seriously at odds with that of Derrida}}

Butler uses the debate over the nature of the post-modernist critique to demonstrate how philosophy is implicated in power relationships and defends poststructuralist critique by arguing that the critique of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] itself is the beginning of analysis, not the end,  because the first task of enquiry is the questioning of accepted "universal" and "objective" norms.

The Benhabib-Butler debate demonstrates that there is no simple definition of a postmodern theorist as the very definition of postmodernity itself is contested. [[Michel Foucault]] rejected the label of postmodernism explicitly in interviews yet is seen by many, such as Benhabib, as advocating a form of critique that is "postmodern" in that it breaks with utopian and transcendental "modern" critiques by calling universal norms of the Enlightenment into question. [[Giddens]] (1990) rejects this characterisation of "modern critique", pointing out that a critique of Enlightenment universals was central to philosophers of the modern period, most notably Nietzsche.

=== Postmodern society ===

[[Fredric Jameson|Jameson]] views a number of phenomena as distinguishing postmodernity from modernity. He speaks of "a new kind of [[superficiality]]" or "depthlessness" in which models that once explained people and things in terms of an "inside" and an "outside" (such as [[hermeneutics]], the [[dialectic]], [[Freud]]ian [[Psychological repression|repression]], the [[existentialist]] distinction between authenticity and inauthenticity, and the [[Sign (semiotics)|semiotic]] distinction of signifier and signified) have been rejected.

Second is a rejection of the modernist "[[Utopia]]n gesture", evident in Van Gogh, of the transformation through art of misery into beauty whereas in the postmodernism movement the object world has undergone a "fundamental mutation" so that it has "now become a set of texts or [[Simulacrum|simulacra]]" (Jameson 1993:38). Whereas modernist art sought to redeem and sacralize the world, to give life to world (we might say, following Graff, to give the world back the enchantment that science and the decline of religion had taken away from it), postmodernist art bestows upon the world a "deathly quality… whose glacéd X-ray elegance mortifies the reified eye of the viewer in a way that would seem to have nothing to do with death or the death obsession or the death anxiety on the level of content" (ibid.). Graff sees the origins of this transformative mission of art in an attempted substitution of art for religion in giving meaning to the world that the rise of science and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationality had removed – but in the postmodern period this is seen as futile.

The third feature of the postmodern age that Jameson identifies is the "waning of affect" – not that all [[emotion]] has disappeared from the postmodern age but that it lacks a particular kind of emotion such as that found in "[[Rimbaud]]'s magical flowers 'that look back at you'". He notes that "[[pastiche]] eclipses [[parody]]" as "the increasing unavailability of the personal style" leads to pastiche becoming a universal practice.

Jameson argues that distance "has been abolished" in postmodernity, that we "are submerged in its henceforth filled and suffused volumes to the point where our now postmodern bodies are bereft of spatial co-ordinates". This "new global space" constitutes postmodernity's "moment of truth". The various other features of the postmodern that he identifies "can all now be seen as themselves partial (yet constitutive) aspects of the same general spatial object". The postmodern era has seen a change in the [[Structural functionalism|social function]] of culture. He identifies culture in the modern age as having had a property of "semi-autonomy", with an "existence… above the practical world of the existent" but, in the postmodern age, culture has been deprived of this autonomy, the cultural has expanded to consume the entire social realm so that all becomes "cultural". "Critical distance", the assumption that culture can be positioned outside "the massive Being of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" upon which left-wing theories of cultural politics are dependent, has become outmoded. The "prodigious new expansion of multinational capital ends up penetrating and colonizing those very pre-capitalist enclaves (Nature and the Unconscious) which offered extraterritorial and [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] footholds for critical effectivity". (Jameson 1993:54)

=== Social sciences ===

[[History of sociology#20th Century: Critical theory, postmodernism, and positivist revival|Postmodern sociology]] can be said to focus on conditions of life which became increasingly prevalent in the late 20th century in the most industrialized nations, including the ubiquity of mass media and mass production, the rise of a global economy and a shift from manufacturing to [[service economy|service economies]]. Jameson and Harvey described it as [[consumerism]], where manufacturing, distribution and dissemination have become exceptionally inexpensive but social connectedness and community have become rarer. Other thinkers assert that postmodernity is the natural reaction to mass broadcasting in a society conditioned to mass production and mass politics. The work of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] informs the versions of postmodernism elaborated by such authors as Murphy (2003) and Bielskis (2005), for whom MacIntyre's postmodern revision of [[Aristotelianism]] poses a challenge to the kind of consumerist ideology that now promotes capital accumulation.

The sociological view of postmodernity ascribes it to more rapid transportation, wider communication and the ability to abandon standardization of mass production, leading to a system which values a wider range of capital than previously and allows value to be stored in a greater variety of forms. Harvey argues that postmodernity is an escape from "[[Fordism]]", a term coined by [[Antonio Gramsci]] to describe the mode of industrial regulation and accumulation which prevailed during the Keynesian era of economic policy in OECD countries from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Fordism for Harvey is associated with Keynesianism in that the first concerns methods of production and capital-labor relations while the latter concerns economic policy and regulation. [[Post-fordism]] is therefore one of the basic aspects of postmodernity from Harvey's point of view.

[[Social artifact|Artifacts]] of postmodernity include the dominance of [[television]] and [[popular culture]], the wide accessibility of information and mass telecommunications. Postmodernity also exhibits a greater resistance to making sacrifices in the name of progress discernible in [[environmentalism]] and the growing importance of the [[anti-war]] movement. Postmodernity in the industrialised core is marked by increasing focus on [[civil rights]] and [[equal opportunity]] as well as movements such as [[feminism]] and [[multiculturalism]] and the backlash against these movements. The postmodern political sphere is marked by multiple arenas and possibilities of citizenship and [[political action]] concerning various forms of struggle against oppression or alienation (in collectives defined by sex or ethnicity) while the modernist political arena remains restricted to class struggle.

Theorists such as [[Michel Maffesoli]] believe that postmodernity is corroding the circumstances that provide for its subsistence and will eventually result in a decline of individualism and the birth of a new [[Neo-Tribalism|neo-Tribal]] era.

According to theories of postmodernity, [[economic]] and [[technological]] conditions of our age have given rise to a decentralized, media-dominated society in which ideas are only [[simulacra]], inter-referential representations and copies of each other with no real, original, stable or objective source of [[communication]] and meaning. [[Globalization]], brought on by innovations in [[communication]], [[manufacturing]] and [[transportation]], is often{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} cited as one force which has driven the decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication or intellectual production. The postmodernist view is that [[Intersubjectivity|inter-subjective]], not objective, knowledge will be the dominant form of [[discourse]] under such conditions and that ubiquity of dissemination fundamentally alters the relationship between reader and that which is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.

In ''Spaces of Hope'' Harvey argues that postmodern political movements have been indirectly responsible for weakening class issues (in the Marxist sense) and the critical consciousness of this field of action which, in his opinion, is now more significant than during the Fordist period. For Harvey this [[class conflict]] is far from solved (something postmodern theorists ignore, according to his argument): globalization has made it more difficult for labour organisations to tackle underpaid work in poor conditions without labour rights and the amount of surplus value earned by corporations is far larger because of the differential between the high prices paid by western consumers and the low wages earned by south-east Asian labourers.

=== Postmodernity as a shift of epistemology ===
Another conceptualization has argued that postmodernity might be best described within the framework of epistemological [[paradigm shift|shifts]]. This argument presupposes that epistemological shifts occur as a result of changes in culture, society, and technology and suggests that the political, cultural, and technological changes of the 1960s and 1970s stimulated an epistemological shift from modernity to postmodernity. Or said differently, the ways in which people communicate, receive, and justify knowledge (i.e. epistemology) change and these changes are argued to broadly influence cultures, worldviews, and people groups.

== Criticisms ==
{{Main article|Criticism of postmodernism}}
Criticisms of the postmodern condition can broadly be put into four categories: criticisms of postmodernity from the perspective of those who reject [[modernism]] and its offshoots, criticisms from supporters of [[modernism]] who believe that postmodernity lacks crucial characteristics of the modern project, critics from within postmodernity who seek reform or change based on their understanding of [[postmodernism]], and those who believe that postmodernity is a passing, and not a growing, phase in social organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18674">'''Reality in Buddhism''' is called ''[[dharma]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]) or ''[[dhamma]]'' ([[Pali]]). This word, which is foundational to the conceptual frameworks of the Indian religions, refers in Buddhism to the system of natural laws which constitute the natural order of things. ''Dharma'' is therefore reality as-it-is (''yatha-bhuta''). The teaching of [[Gautama Buddha]] constituting as it does a method by which people can come out of their condition of suffering (''[[dukkha]]'') involves developing an awareness of reality (''see'' [[mindfulness]]). Buddhism thus seeks to address any disparity between a person's view of reality and the actual state of things. This is called developing Right or Correct View (Pali: ''[[Noble Eightfold Path|samma ditthi]]''). Seeing reality as-it-is {{Not a typo|is}} thus an essential prerequisite to mental health and well-being according to Buddha's teaching.

Buddhism addresses deeply philosophical questions regarding the nature of reality. One of the fundamental teachings is that all the constituent forms (''[[sankhara]]s'') that make up the universe are transient (Pali: ''[[anicca]]''), arising and passing away, and therefore without concrete identity or ownership (''[[Atta (Buddhism)|atta]]''). This lack of enduring ownership or identity (''[[anatta]]'') of phenomena has important consequences for the possibility of liberation from the conditions which give rise to suffering. This is explained in the doctrine of inter[[dependent origination]].

One of the most discussed themes in Buddhism is that of the emptiness (''[[sunyata]]'') of form ([[Pali]]: ''[[rūpa]]''), an important corollary of the transient and conditioned nature of phenomena. Reality is seen, ultimately, in Buddhism as a form of '[[Philosophy of perception|projection]]', resulting from the fruition (''[[vipaka]]'') of karmic seeds (''sankharas''). The precise nature of this 'illusion' that is the phenomenal universe is debated among different schools. For example;

* Some consider that the concept of the unreality of "reality" is confusing. They posit that, in Buddhism, the perceived reality is considered illusory not in the sense that reality is a fantasy or unreal, but that our perceptions and preconditions mislead us to believe that we are separate from the elements that we are made of. Reality, in Buddhist thought, would be described as the manifestation of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]].
* Other schools of thought in Buddhism (e.g., [[Dzogchen]]), consider ''perceived reality'' literally unreal. As a prominent contemporary teacher puts it: "In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream [...]".&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"&gt;[[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light'' Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term 'visions' denotes not only visual perceptions, but appearances perceived through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations, and operations on received mental objects.

__TOC__

==Reality in Buddhist sutras==
[[Buddhist]] [[Sūtra|sutras]] devote considerable space to the concept of reality, with each of two major doctrines&amp;mdash;the Doctrine of Dependent Origination (''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'') and the Doctrine of Cause and Effect (''[[karma]]'' and ''[[vipaka]]'')&amp;mdash;attempting to incorporate both the natural and the spiritual into its overall world view. Buddhist teachings continue to explore the nature of the world and our place in it.

The Buddha promoted experience over theorizing. According to Karel Werner, &lt;blockquote&gt;Experience is ... the path most elaborated in early Buddhism. The doctrine on the other hand was kept low. The Buddha avoided doctrinal formulations concerning the final reality as much as possible in order to prevent his followers from resting content with minor achievements on the path in which the absence of the final experience could be substituted by conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith, a situation which sometimes occurs, in both varieties, in the context of Hindu systems of doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner, ''Mysticism and Indian Spirituality.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press, 1989, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Mahayana developed those statements he did make into an extensive, diverse set of sometimes contrasting descriptions of reality "as it really is."&lt;ref&gt;See Henshall, Ron (2007), ''The Unborn and Emancipation from the Born''[http://www.theunborn.org.uk/Microsoft_Word_-_Ron_Henshall__Dissertation__2007.pdf], a master's thesis by a student of Peter Harvey.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Gelugpa]] draw a distinction between [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction|Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika]] in [[Madhyamika]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction was most prominently promulgated by [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419 CE), when he argued that this distinction can be found explicitly and implicitly within in the works of [[Nagarjuna]], [[Chandrakirti]], and [[Buddhapalita]].&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theravada]] school teaches that there is no universal personal god. The world as we know it does not have its origin in a primordial being such as [[Brahman]] or the [[Abrahamic]] [[God]]. What we see is only a product of transitory factors of existence, which depend functionally upon each other. The Buddha is said to have said: "The world exists because of causal actions, all things are produced by causal actions and all beings are governed and bound by causal actions. They are fixed like the rolling wheel of a cart, fixed by the pin of its axle shaft." (Sutta-Nipata 654)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'illusion' is frequently associated with [[Buddhism]] and the nature of reality. Some interpretations of Buddhism teach that reality is a coin with two sides: the not-permanent characteristic or ''[[anicca]]'' and the "not-self characteristic" or ''[[anatta]]'', referred to as "emptiness" in some [[Mahayana]] schools.  Dzogchen, as the [[non-dual]] culmination of the [[Nyingmapa|Ancient School]] (a school with a few million followers out of a few hundred million Buddhists) of [[Mantrayana]], resolves [[Ātman (Buddhism)|atman]] and [[anatman]] into the [[Mindstream]] Doctrine of [[Tapihritsa]]. The Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have taught the variously understood and interpreted concept of "not-self" in the [[Anatta-lakkhana Sutta]]. In this sutta, he lists the characteristics that we often associate with who we are, and found that these characteristics, ultimately, are not who we are because they are subject to change without control. He further illustrates the changing nature of our feelings, perceptions, and consciousness.

We can look at the concepts of not-permanent and not-self in objective terms, for example by [[Deconstruction|deconstructing]] the concept of an [[skandha|aggregated]] object such as a [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] and seeing that the flower is made up entirely of non-flower elements like soil, nutrients, photosynthetic energy, rain water and the effort of the entities that nourished and grew the flower. All of these factors, according to the [[Diamond Sutra]],  co-exist with each other to manifest what we call a 'flower'. In other words, there is no essence arisen from nothingness that is unique and personal to any being. In particular, there is neither a human [[soul]] that lives on beyond the death of the physical body nor one that is extinguished at death since, strictly speaking, there is nothing to extinguish. The relative reality (i.e., the illusory perceived reality) comes from our belief that we are separate from the rest of the things in the universe and, at times, at odds with the processes of nature and other beings. The ultimate or absolute reality, in some schools of Buddhist thought, shows that we are inter-connected with all things. The concept of non-discrimination expands on this by saying that, while a chair is different from a flower, they 'inter-are' because they are each made of non-flower and non-chair elements. Ultimately those elements are the same, so the distinction between chair and flower is one of quantity not of quality.

The [[Diamond Sutra]], a [[Mahayana]] scripture, has many passages that use the formula: A is not A, therefore A is called A.

==Reality and dreams in Dzogchen==
In [[Dzogchen]], perceived reality is considered to be relatively unreal.

{{Quotation|align=center|The real sky is (knowing) that [[saṃsāra|samsara]] and [[nirvana]] are merely an illusory display.&lt;ref&gt;In: [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga and the Practice of Natural Light''. Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham Rinpoche]]|Quintessential Instructions of Mind, p. 117}}

According to contemporary teacher [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] [[Rinpoche]], all appearances perceived during the whole life of an individual, through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations in their totality, are like a big [[dream]]. It is claimed that, on careful examination, the dream of life and regular nightly dreams are not very different, and that in their essential nature there is no difference between them.

The non-essential difference between the dreaming state and ordinary waking experience is that the latter is more concrete and linked to attachment; the dreaming experience while sleeping is slightly detached.

Also according to this teaching, there is a correspondence between the states of sleep and dream and our experiences when we die. After experiencing the intermediate state of [[bardo]], an individual comes out of it, a new karmic illusion is created and another existence begins. This is how [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] happens.

According to [[Dzogchen]] teachings, the energy of an individual is essentially without form and free from [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]]. However, [[karmic traces]] contained in the individual's [[mindstream]] give rise to two kinds of forms:

* forms that the individual experiences as his or her body, voice and mind
* forms that the individual experiences as an external environment.

What appears as a world of permanent external phenomena, is the energy of the individual him or herself. There is nothing completely external or separate from the individual. Everything that manifests in the individual's field of experience is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. This is the '[[Great Perfection]]' that is discovered in [[Dzogchen]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;The Crystal and The Way of Light. Sutra, Tantra and Dzogchen by [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]]. Compiled and Edited by [[John Shane]], [[Snow Lion Publications]], Ithaca, NY, USA, 2000, {{ISBN|1-55939-135-9}}, pp. 99, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to do yogic practice such as [[Dream Yoga]] and [[Yoga Nidra]] whilst dreaming, sleeping and in other [[bardo]] states of [[trance]]. In this way the yogi can have a very strong experience and with this comes understanding of the dream-like nature of daily life. This is also very relevant to diminishing attachments, because they are based on strong beliefs that life's perceptions such as objects are real and as a consequence: important. If one really understands what Buddha Shakyamuni meant when he said that everything is (relatively) unreal, then one can diminish attachments and tensions.

The teacher advises that the realization that life is only a big dream can help us finally liberate ourselves from the chains of various emotions, different kinds of attachment and the chains of ego. Then we have the possibility of ultimately becoming enlightened.&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"/&gt;

Different schools and traditions in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] give different explanations of what is called "reality".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. A. Berzin.

== Reality in the Tathagatagarbha Sutras ==

Prior to the period of the Tathagatagarbha Sutras, Mahayana [[metaphysics]] had been dominated by teachings on [[emptiness]] in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Tathagatagarbha genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-192. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting with some forms of Buddhism, the Buddha's teaching on 'reality' in the [[Tathagatagarbha]] Mahayana scriptures - which the Buddha states constitute the ultimate manifestation of the [[Mahayana]] Dharma (other Mahayana sutras make similar claims about their own teachings) - insists that there truly ''is'' a sphere or realm of ultimate truth - not just a repetitious cycle of interconnected elements, each dependent on the others. That suffering-filled cycle of x-generating-y-and-y-generating-z-and-z-generating-a, etc., is ''Samsara'', the prison-house of the reincarnating non-self; whereas liberation from dependency, enforced rebirth and bondage is [[nirvana]] or reality / spiritual essence (''tattva'' / ''dharmata''). This sphere also bears the name ''Tathagatagarbha'' (Buddha matrix). It is the deathless realm where dependent origination holds no sway, where non-self is supplanted by the everlasting, sovereign (''[[aishvarya]]'') self ([[Atman (Buddhism)|atman]]) (as a trans-historical, unconditioned, ultimate, liberating, supra-worldly yet boundless and immanent awakened mind). Of this real truth, called nirvana - which, while salvationally infused into samsara, is not bound or imprisoned in it - the Buddha states in the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]:&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, Kosho (tr.), Page, Tony (ed.) (1999&amp;ndash;2000).[https://web.archive.org/web/20131019072030/http://webzoom.freewebs.com/nirvana-sutra/convenient/Mahaparinirvana_Sutra_Yamamoto_Page_2007.pdf ''The Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra''] in 12 volumes.

"What is the Real (''tattva'')? Knowledge of the true attributes of Nirvana; the Tathagata, the Dharma, the Sangha, and the attributes of space ... is the Real. What is knowledge of the attributes of Nirvana? The attributes of Nirvana are eightfold. What are these eight? Cessation [of ignorance and suffering]; loveliness/ wholesomeness; Truth; Reality; Eternity, Bliss, the Self [''atman''], and complete Purity: that is Nirvana."

He further comments: " ... that which is endowed with the Eternal, Bliss, the Self, and Purity is stated to be the meaning of 'Real Truth' ... Moreover, the Real is the Tathagata [i.e., the Buddha]; the Tathagata is the Real ... The Tathagata is not conditioned and not tainted, but utterly blissful: this is the Real ...".

Thus, in such doctrines, a very positive goal is envisioned, which is said to lie beyond the grasp of the five senses and the ordinary, restless mind, and only attainable through direct meditative perception and when all inner pollutants (twisted modes of view, and all moral contaminants) are purged, and the inherently deathless, spotless, radiantly shining mind of Buddha stands revealed. This is the realm of the ''Buddha-dhatu'' (popularly known as [[buddha nature]]) - inconceivable, beginning-less, endless, omniscient truth, the [[Dharmakaya]] (quintessential body-and-mind) of the Buddha. This reality is empty of all falsehood, impermanence, ignorance, afflictions, and pain, but filled with enduring happiness, purity, knowingness (''jnana''), and omni-radiant loving-kindness (''maitri'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7111">In computer [[programming language]]s, a '''recursive data type''' (also known as a '''recursively-defined''', '''inductively-defined''' or '''inductive data type''') is a [[data type]] for values that may contain other values of the same type. Data of recursive types are usually viewed as [[directed graph]]s.

An important application of recursion in computer science is in defining dynamic data structures such as Lists and Trees.  Recursive data structures can dynamically grow to an arbitrarily large size in response to runtime requirements; in contrast, a static array's size requirements must be set at compile time.

Sometimes the term "inductive data type" is used for [[algebraic data type]]s which are not necessarily recursive.

==Example==
{{also|Recursion (computer science)#Recursive data structures (structural recursion)}}
An example is the [[List (computing)|list]] type, in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
&lt;/source&gt;

This indicates that a list of a's is either an empty list or a '''cons cell''' containing an 'a' (the "head" of the list) and another list (the "tail").

Another example is a similar singly linked type in Java:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
class List&lt;E&gt; {
    E value;
    List&lt;E&gt; next;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This indicates that non-empty list of type E contains a data member of type E, and a reference to another List object for the rest of the list (or a null reference to indicate that this is the end of the list).

===Mutually recursive data types===
{{see|Mutual recursion#Data types}}
Data types can also be defined by [[mutual recursion]]. The most important basic example of this is a [[tree (data structure)|tree]], which can be defined mutually recursively in terms of a forest (a list of trees). Symbolically:
 f: &lt;nowiki&gt;[t[1], ..., t[k]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 t: v f
A forest ''f'' consists of a list of trees, while a tree ''t'' consists of a pair of a value ''v'' and a forest ''f'' (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types.

This mutually recursive definition can be converted to a singly recursive definition by inlining the definition of a forest:
 t: v &lt;nowiki&gt;[t[1], ..., t[k]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
A tree ''t'' consists of a pair of a value ''v'' and a list of trees (its children). This definition is more compact, but somewhat messier: a tree consists of a pair of one type and a list another, which require disentangling to prove results about.

In [[Standard ML]], the tree and forest data types can be mutually recursively defined as follows, allowing empty trees:{{sfn|Harper|2000|loc="[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/introsml/core/datatypes.htm Data Types]"}}
&lt;source lang=sml&gt;
datatype 'a tree = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a forest
and      'a forest = Nil | Cons of 'a tree * 'a forest
&lt;/source&gt;

==Theory==
In [[type theory]], a recursive type has the general form μα.T where the [[type variable]] α may appear in the type T and stands for the entire type itself.

For example, the natural numbers (see [[Peano arithmetic]]) may be defined by the Haskell datatype:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
&lt;/source&gt;

In type theory, we would say: &lt;math&gt;nat = \mu \alpha. 1 + \alpha&lt;/math&gt; where the two arms of the [[sum type]] represent the Zero and Succ data constructors. Zero takes no arguments (thus represented by the [[unit type]]) and Succ takes another Nat (thus another element of &lt;math&gt;\mu \alpha. 1 + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

There are two forms of recursive types: the so-called isorecursive types, and equirecursive types.  The two forms differ in how terms of a recursive type are introduced and eliminated.

===Isorecursive types===
With isorecursive types, the recursive type &lt;math&gt;\mu \alpha . T&lt;/math&gt; and its expansion (or ''unrolling'') &lt;math&gt;T[\mu \alpha.T / \alpha]&lt;/math&gt; (Where the notation&lt;math&gt;X[Y/Z]&lt;/math&gt; indicates that all instances of Z are replaced with Y in X) are distinct (and disjoint) types with special term constructs, usually called ''roll'' and ''unroll'', that form an [[isomorphism]] between them.  To be precise: &lt;math&gt;roll : T[\mu\alpha.T/\alpha] \to \mu\alpha.T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;unroll : \mu\alpha.T \to T[\mu\alpha.T/\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;, and these two are [[inverse function]]s.

===Equirecursive types===
Under equirecursive rules, a recursive type &lt;math&gt;\mu \alpha . T&lt;/math&gt; and its unrolling &lt;math&gt;T[\mu\alpha.T/\alpha]&lt;/math&gt; are ''equal'' -- that is, those two type expressions are understood to denote the same type.  In fact, most theories of equirecursive types go further and essentially stipulate that any two type expressions with the same "infinite expansion" are equivalent.  As a result of these rules, equirecursive types contribute significantly more complexity to a type system than isorecursive types do.  Algorithmic problems such as type checking and [[type inference]] are more difficult for equirecursive types as well.  Since direct comparison does not make sense on an equirecursive type, they can be converted into a canonical form in O(n log n) time, which can easily be compared.&lt;ref name="canonicalize"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.4.2276|title=Numbering Matters: First-Order Canonical Forms for Second-Order Recursive Types}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Equirecursive types capture the form of self-referential (or mutually referential) type definitions seen in procedural and [[object-oriented]] programming languages, and also arise in type-theoretic semantics of objects and [[Class (computer science)|class]]es.
In functional programming languages, isorecursive types (in the guise of datatypes) are far more common.

====In type synonyms====
Recursion is not allowed in [[type synonym]]s in [[Miranda programming language|Miranda]], [[OCaml]] (unless -rectypes flag is used or it's a record or variant), and Haskell; so for example the following Haskell types are illegal:

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type Bad = (Int, Bad)
type Evil = Bool -&gt; Evil
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead, you must wrap it inside an algebraic data type (even if it only has one constructor):

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Good = Pair Int Good
data Fine = Fun (Bool-&gt;Fine)
&lt;/source&gt;

This is because type synonyms, like [[typedef]]s in C, are replaced with their definition at compile time. (Type synonyms are not "real" types; they are just "aliases" for convenience of the programmer.) But if you try to do this with a recursive type, it will loop infinitely because no matter how many times you substitute it, it still refers to itself, e.g. "Bad" will grow indefinitely: (Int, (Int, (Int, ... .

Another way to see it is that a level of indirection (the algebraic data type) is required to allow the isorecursive type system to figure out when to ''roll'' and ''unroll''.

{{Forms of government}}
The '''rule according to a higher law''' means that no law may be enforced by the government unless it conforms with certain universal principles (written or unwritten) of fairness, morality, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;West's Encyclopedia of American Law (in 13 volumes), 2nd Ed., edited by Jeffrey Lehman and Shirelle Phelps. Publisher: Thomson Gale, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7876-6367-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''the rule according to a higher law'' may serve as a practical legal criterion to qualify the instances of political or economical decision-making, when a [[government]], even though acting in conformity with clearly defined and properly enacted legal [[Law|rules]], still produces results which many observers find unfair or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers|M.N.S. Sellers]], ''Republican Legal Theory: The History, Constitution and Purposes of Law in a Free State'', Basingstoke, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The idea of a law of ultimate justice over and above the momentary law of the state—a higher law—was first introduced into post-Roman Europe by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]] jurists.&lt;ref&gt;Wormser, ''The Story of the LAW'', pg. 189&lt;/ref&gt; "Higher law" can be interpreted in this context as the [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]] or basic legal values, established in the [[international law]] – the choice depending on the viewpoint. But this is definitely a Law above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Corwin, ''The “Higher Law” Background of American Constitutional Law'' (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; And it is in this capacity that it possesses the equal legal value for both the [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, as opposed to natural law which is largely associated with common law.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie F. Goldstein, ''Popular Sovereignty, the Origins of Judicial Review, and the Revival of Unwritten Law'', Journal of Politics 48 (1986): 51–71&lt;/ref&gt; "To recognize the necessary connection between the rule of law as an ideal and well-constructed constitutional government does not and should not be taken to imply that all states can or should maintain the same constitutional structures in practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mortimer Sellers]], ''An Introduction. The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, pp. 4–5. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The rule according to higher law'' is a practical approach to the implementation of the higher law theory which creates a bridge of mutual understanding (with regard to universal legal values) between the English language doctrine of the [[rule of law]], traditional for the countries of common law, and the originally German doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'', translated into other languages of continental Europe as ''État de droit'' (Fr.), ''Estado de derecho'' (Sp.), ''Stato di diritto'' (It.), and ''Правовое государство'' (Ru.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter doctrine is the product of continental European legal thought which had adopted it from German legal philosophy. Its name can be translated into English as "state of law" —meaning the state in which the exercise of governmental power is kept in check by the higher law rather than by the changeable law established by this state.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Amartya Sen]] mentioned that the legal theorists in ancient India used term of classical Sanskrit "nyāya" in the sense of not just a matter of judging institutions and rules, but of judging the societies themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Amartya Sen, ''Global justice'' in ''Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law'', edited by [[James J. Heckman]], Robert L. Nelson, Lee Cabating and Paul Lepore, Routledge, London and New York, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Before the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], [[African American]]s were legally denied equal rights and freedoms pursuant to formally valid codes prescribing the relations between master and slave. Although these codes were ''de jure'' fully suitable for application in legal practice, their enforcement by the then U.S. government ''de facto'' violated basic human rights of a significant part of the population. [[William H. Seward]] famously proclaimed that slavery is forbidden under "a higher law than the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]."

Generally speaking, the occurrence of such "justly enacted unjust laws" fully depends on the stance taken by the country's political leadership towards [[the rule of law]] principle.

In some countries, the political leaders assert that the rule of law is purely a procedural concept. Therefore, they argue that any government may strip its subjects of their fundamental freedoms or infringe their vital interests so long as this is done by way of a duly implemented legal mechanism. For example, at the [[Nuremberg trials]], in an attempt to justify their crimes against Jewish and Romany population of Europe during [[World War II]], some of the former leaders of [[Nazi Germany]] argued that they had broken none of the laws effective when Hitler had been in power. It was only by invoking the rule according to a higher law that the Allied prosecutors were able to overcome such defenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/ga_95-I/ga_95-I.html Introductory note by Antonio Cassese] for General Assembly resolution 95(I) of 11 December 1946 (Affirmation of the Principles of International Law recognized by the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal) on the website of the [https://www.un.org/law/avl/ UN Audiovisual Library of International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, conversely, the political leaders assert that all written laws must be kept in line with the universal principles of morality, fairness, and justice. These leaders argue that, as a necessary corollary to the axiom that "no one is above the law," the rule of law requires the government to treat all persons equally under the law. However, the proclaimed right to equal treatment is susceptible to instantly becoming void each time the government denies a sufficient level of respect, dignity, and autonomy to a certain class of individuals or to human rights in general."&lt;ref&gt;Augusto Zimmermann, ''Constitutions Without Constitutionalism: The Failure of Constitutionalism in Brazil, The Rule of Law in Comparative Perspectives'', edited by [[Mortimer Sellers]] and Tadeusz Tomaszewski, Springer, Heidelberg – London – New York, 2010, p.101. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government. It is these principles that are often referred to as "natural law." They also constitute the basis of the "higher law theory".

==''Rechtsstaat''==
The ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' doctrine (legal state, state of right, constitutional state, constitutional government) was first introduced by the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in his latest works completed after the U.S. and French constitutions had been adopted in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=[[The Constitution of Liberty]]|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|date=1960|pages=196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of country’s written [[constitution]] created using principles of the Higher Law. This supremacy meant creating guarantees for the implementation of his central idea: a permanently peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness and prosperity of the citizens. Kant was basing his doctrine exclusively on the idea of constitutionalism and constitutional government.

The Russian legal system, born in the 19th century as a result of the transformations initiated by the reforms of the [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]], was (and still is) based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from the latter that Russia had adopted the doctrine of ''Rechtsstaat'', which literally translates as "Legal State." Its closest English analogue is "the rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, ''Defining the rules'', ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as the country's supreme law (the rule of constitution). It is a fundamental but undefined principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s post-Communist constitution: "The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance." Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of Ukraine’s Constitution declares that "Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state." Hence, the effort to invest meaning to the "Legal State" definition is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, wrote in 2003, "Becoming a legal state has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination. Such a legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and just society. Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by the society."&lt;ref&gt;''The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform'', edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of Legal state has adopted many segments of [[constitutional economics]] which serves as a practical implementation of the higher law theory in economics.

Economist [[James M. Buchanan]] argues that, in the framework of constitutional government, any governmental intervention or regulation must be conditioned by the three following assumptions. First, every failure of the market economy to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention. Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being. And third, changing the government responsibilities towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the [[state (polity)|state]] as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members." This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan, together with Kant, believes that a [[constitution]] in its capacity as the Higher Law, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions, while balancing interests of the state and society against those of individuals, with their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.

Buchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms. He writes that "the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J., ''Logical Formulations of Constitutional Liberty'', Vol. 1., Indianapolis, 1999. P. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social impact entertainment''' ('''SIE''') is a variety of mainstream entertainment, predominately films and TV, that intends to have social impact next to great entertainment value.

The practitioners in this field are predominately producers and directors who want to add a "social surplus" to their entertainment, as contrasted to the field of [[Entertainment-education]] which often starts out with a social change directive and then creates the entertainment around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/entertainment-education/|title=Entertainment-Education|date=2012-10-24|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus in the field is the study of actual effects (social impact measurement), while the predominant interest is still to create entertaining, profitable content and work within the ecosystem of commercial film production and distribution. A common theme in the field of SIE is that mainstream film production companies employ so-called "[[Impact producer|Impact Producers]]" who specialize in impact-oriented distribution campaigns which can often include community screenings, screenings for legislators as well as impact measurement and evidence-building.

[[Cinema of Change]] reports on progress in the Social Impact Entertainment world. Currently, there are approximately 130 organizations, companies and film festivals operating in the ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemaofchange.com/the-cinema-of-change-ecosystem/|title=The Cinema of Change EcosystemThe Cinema of Change Ecosystem - Cinema of Change|website=www.cinemaofchange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable being [[Participant Media]] due to its $100 million+ funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jmkdbrhlfK8C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Tech Billionaires: Reshaping Philanthropy in a Quest for a Better World|last=Solomon|first=Lewis D.|date=2011-12-31|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412813747|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social impact entertainment is taught at a few universities and has taken foot with a handful of institutes, most notably [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Norman Lear Center]] and [[UCLA TFT]]'s Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment.

'''Stop Abuse For Everyone''' ('''SAFE''') is a [[domestic violence]] and conservative lobbying organization started in 1996. It was formed in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] and now is based out of [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[California]]. Stop Abuse For Everyone advocates for what they term an "inclusive" model of domestic violence. They state that their focus is on groups that are "lacking in services", such as men, gay, lesbian, and transgender victims, and the elderly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.safe4all.org Stop Abuse For Everyone]&lt;/ref&gt;

SAFE claims that men are more victimized by physical abuse than women and "men were also the victims of psychological aggression and control over sexual or reproductive health more often than women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopabuseforeveryone.org/finding-help/research.html|title=Stop Abuse for Everyone - Research|last=Perwin|first=Jeff|website=www.stopabuseforeveryone.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relevancy ==
Stop Abuse For Everyone is an organization that professes to advocate for the plight of abused men and other "underserved" domestic violence groups, such as LGBT victims.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

SAFE has made appearances at national conferences on domestic violence, media coverage, and lobbies to government entities in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safe4all.org/news/ SAFE News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

SAFE was founded by Jade Rubick in 1996, and became a non-profit organization in 2001 with co-founders Phil Cook and Stanley Green.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safe4all.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community Organizations ==
SAFE is a national organization. One of the many community organizations working to extend SAFE to the community is [[Women in Distress]] (WID), a nationally accredited, state-certified, full service domestic violence center in [[Broward County, Florida]].

'''Structure-mapping theory''' is a theory of [[analogical reasoning]], developed by [[Dedre Gentner]],&lt;ref name="Gentner 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gentner|first1=Dierdre|title=Structure-Mapping: A Theoretical Framework for Analogy|journal=Cognitive Science|date=1983|volume=7|pages=155–170|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/38bf/b182de181738eb50e142e215c67f4cbb4fe3.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for which she was awarded the 2016 [[Rumelhart Prize|David E. Rumelhart Prize]] for Contributions to the Theoretical Foundations of Human Cognition.&lt;ref name="rumelhart-prize" /&gt;

==Distinguishing analogy from other comparisons==

Structure-mapping theory aims to improve upon previous theories of analogy, by distinguishing analogy from literal similarity. Previous theories, like [[Amos Tversky]]'s contrast theory, assumed that an analogy is stronger, the more attributes the base and target have in common. Instead, structure-mapping theory recognizes that there can be differences between base and target domains which make no difference to the strength of the analogy. For example, we can see a battery as being like a reservoir despite them being different in shape, size, colour and substance.

Structure-mapping theory respond by arguing that it is not ''object attributes'' which are mapped in an analogy. Instead the theory contends that an analogy alerts the hearer to a similarity in the ''relationships'' between objects in a domain. The distinction is made in terms of the number of predicates - attributes are predicates with one argument, while relationships are predicates which take two or more arguments. So the proposition "x is large" asserts an attribute, while "x revolves around y" asserts a relationship. (Higher order predicates assert relationships between propositions)

===Analogy vs literal similarity===

By distinguishing attributes and relationships, we can distinguish literal similarities from analogies.

For example:
* The X12 star system in the Andromeda nebula is our solar system. - This is a literal similarity, because the intention is to map both relationships (e.g. between planets and the sun) and attributes (e.g. the size and temperature of the sun)
* The hydrogen atom is like our solar system. (Rutherford, 1906) - This is an analogy, because only relational predicates, like relative motion and size, are to be mapped between domains

===Analogy vs general laws===

Analogies can also be distinguished from general laws

* The hydrogen atom is a central force system. - This is a general law, in the sense that the base domain is an abstract domain of relationships, and actually includes no object attributes. Compare this to an analogy, where the base domain includes object attributes, which are ''excluded'' from the comparison.

===Analogy vs chronology===

The distinction in the role of objects, attributes and relationships in the comparison also allows us to characterise a '''chronology''' as a comparison in which objects are compared (remain relatively constant), but relationships are not (i.e. are expected to differ).

===Summary table===

Gentner provides the following table to summarize the different types of domain comparison above:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| || No. attributes mapped || No. relations mapped || Example
|-
| Literal similarity || Many || Many || The K5 solar system is like our solar system
|-
| Analogy || Few || Many || The atom is like our solar system
|-
| Abstraction || Few* || Many || The atom is a central force system
|-
| Anomaly || Few || Few || Coffee is like the solar system
|}

== Systematicity principle ==

"Part of our understanding about analogy is that it conveys a system of connected knowledge, not a mere assortment of independent facts. Such a system can be represented by an interconnected predicate structure in which higher-order predicates enforce connections among lower-order predicates. reflect this tacit preference for coherence in analogy, I propose the '''systematicity principle: A predicate that belongs to a mappable system of mutually interconnecting relationships is more likely to be imported into the target than is an isolated predicate.'''" (Gentner 1983, p162-163; emphasis added)

The systematicity principle helps to explain why, when comparing the atom to the solar system, we don't try to map the relative temperature of sun and the earth onto the nucleus-electron system. In short, the temperature has no strong connection to the other object relationships - such as distance, attractive force, relative mass, and relative motion (who revolves around who) - which we do map. What these other relationships share is a strong interdependence - reversing the mass relationship reverses the relative motion relationship, and changing the distance changes the attractive force, and so on.

'''''The Big Mo: Why Momentum Rules Our World''''' is a book by [[Mark Roeder]], first published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harpercollins.com.au/9780730494485/the-big-mo-why-momentum-now-rules-our-world&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/the-big-mo/9780753539378&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the phenomenon of large-scale momentum and how it impacts society.

==Overview==

The book suggests that the rapid integration of digital technologies, communications and markets, has accelerated the velocity at which events unfold – and generates momentum on a massive scale ([[Big Mo]]). Roeder warns, 'As our world becomes more efficient and automated, there is less ‘friction’ to slow the momentum, which can lead to catastrophic results.’ The book examines the impact of [[Big Mo]] on finance, media, politics, wars, religion and science. Roeder, an ex-executive at [[UBS]], bank, argues that momentum played an instrumental role in the [[Global Financial Crisis]], and that it distorted decision-making in the lead up to the [[second Iraq War]]. He suggests that momentum ‘has become the zeitgeist of our time’

==Key concepts==

:*The momentum effect has recently become more powerful and pervasive, driven by rapid advances in technology and the integration of global systems.

:*When momentum increases to a critical level, it creates a Big Mo effect that is self perpetuating and difficult to slow down or stop.

:*Paradoxically, organisations and networks that are highly integrated and efficient are most susceptible to [[Big Mo]]. This is because momentum feeds on internal efficiency to accelerate and magnify its impact – there is little ‘friction’ to slow it down. Hence, the global financial system – which is now highly integrated and driven by automated computer-based trading systems (algorithms) – is particularly vulnerable to the momentum effect.

:*The momentum-driven environment causes people and organisations to become ‘swept up in the flow’. It also encourages people to behave opportunistically, with less regard for the longer-term consequences of their actions. As Roeder explains, ‘They become ‘momentum surfers’ who are willing to ride the wave rather than question its direction.’

==Reception==

The Big Mo was described by the [[Financial Times]] as ‘A compelling book that journeys seamlessly from finances to the Iraq war, from oil prices and climate change to religion and pop culture in an effort to explain how we behave and why we are so easily led.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a2fa4a8c-39fc-11e0-a441-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3vs5lm3rj&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian broadcaster [[Phillip Adams]], wrote, ‘In our personal, political and economic lives we seem to be swept along by circumstances. Our attempts to change direction are doomed. The Big Mo explains why.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/why-momentum-rules-our-world/2975654&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/australiatalks/live-simply-connect-less/3015768&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]]’s [[Steven Poole]] criticized the book for 'overstretching the Newtonian-physics analogy'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/05/steven-poole-nonfiction-choice-reviews&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Matcham, writing in [[The Australian]], said, ‘Speed and size define the events of our age. As news travels ever faster, its impact increases. The strength of [Roeder’s] book is the idea that momentum’s effects can be felt right across society, including in the media, where 15 minutes of fame is possible on a scale unimaginable a decade ago.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/education/edex/article476219.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tuamherald.ie/plus/roundup/articles/2014/03/28/4023611-bookshelf--the-big-mo-why-momentum-rules-our-world&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialriskstoday.com/bigmo_june.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Mo was first published by HarperCollins Australia (2011), Random House (Virgin books) UK, Europe &amp; USA (2011) and Xinhua Publishing House, Beijing, China (2012).

'''''True20''''' is a [[role-playing game system]] designed by [[Steve Kenson]] and published by [[Green Ronin Publishing]]. The system was first published as a part of the ''[[Blue Rose (RPG)|Blue Rose]]'' [[Role-playing game|RPG]] before being published as a standalone universal generic [[role-playing game]], True20 Adventure Roleplaying.

==History==
The True20 system was originally used in Green Ronin's award-winning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = 2005 ENnie Awards Archives | work = | publisher = ENWorld | date = | url = http://www.ennieawards.com/2005.html | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080120190138/http://www.ennieawards.com/2005.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blue Rose (RPG)|Blue Rose]]'',&lt;ref name=rpg&gt;{{cite web | last = Gray | first = Tim | authorlink = | title = REVIEW OF TRUE20 ADVENTURE ROLEPLAYING | work = | publisher = RPGNet | date = 2005-07-11| url = http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11392.phtml | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; itself based on their multiple-award winning ''[[Mutants &amp; Masterminds]]'' RPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Grigsby | first = John | authorlink = | title = True20 Adventure Roleplaying Review | work = | publisher =d20 Magazine Rack | date = 2006-09-20| url = http://www.d20zines.com/v7/node/2941 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Green Ronin released a PDF distillation of the ''Blue Rose'' rules, with an appendix of some modern-era rules, as a generic form of the game. This was followed by an expanded hardcover release in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Richeson| first = Christopher| authorlink = | title = REVIEW OF TRUE20 ADVENTURE ROLEPLAYING | work = | publisher = RPGNet | date = 2006-06-23| url = http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12267.phtml | format = Review | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised softcover rulebook, combining the rules section of the ''True20 Adventure Roleplaying'' book with the ''True20 Companion'' was released April 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://true20.com/comments.php?id=119_0_2_0_C Message by Chris Pramas concerning 2008 True20 products] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214221802/http://true20.com/comments.php?id=119_0_2_0_C |date=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com True 20 https://www.amazon.com/dp/193454714X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settings==
The original setting for the system was the Blue Rose in which the system first saw print.&lt;ref name=rpg/&gt; In its generic role-playing game, the original hardcover printing of the ''True20 Adventure Roleplaying'' book included four sample settings.

==System==
Utilizing the [[Open Gaming License]], ''True20'' is derived from [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s ''[[d20 System]]''. Differences from the parent game include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= True20 Adventure Roleplaying |work = |publisher= [[Green Ronin]] |date= 2005-06-16 |url= http://greenronin.com/2005/06/true20_adventure_roleplaying.php |accessdate= 2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schneider |first= Wesley |title= First Watch: Natural 20 |journal= [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |volume= 30 |issue= 7/338 |pages= 20 |publisher= Pazio Publishing| location = Bellevut, WA |date= December 2005| issn = 1062-2101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are only three character classes, referred to as roles: warrior, adept and expert.
* A single [[20-sided die]] is used for each roll.
* [[Ability score]]s are given as simple modifiers (+1, +2, etc.) rather than as a statistic in the range from 3-18 (which in some other systems, such as [[D20 System|''d20'']], would then be converted to simple modifiers).
* There are no class-specific or restricted skills, thus characters of any role can have any skill.
* New [[Feat (d20 System)|feats]] are available at each level.
* Magic spells are treated as feats and do not have "levels".
* Instead of [[hit point]]s, characters simply experience "damage conditions" like that of ''[[Mutants &amp; Masterminds]]''.
* Instead of [[experience point]]s, characters automatically increase in level at the Narrator's discretion, usually after one or two adventures.

== Licenses and third-party products ==

Since before its release, the True20 system has been open to users under the terms of the Open Gaming License.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Baichtal | first = John | authorlink = | title = True20: D&amp;D With a Twist | work = Review | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date = 2008-06-09| url = http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2008/06/true20-dd-with.html| doi = | accessdate = 2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To use the True20 logo though required a separate license and license fee purchased from Green Ronin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2270">'''VERDE (Visualizing Energy Resources Dynamically on the Earth)''' is a visualization and analysis capability of the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). The system, developed and maintained by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), provides wide-area situational understanding of the U.S. electric grid. Enabling grid monitoring, weather impacts prediction and analysis, VERDE supports preparedness and response to potentially large outage events. As a real-time geo-visualization capability, it characterizes the dynamic behavior of the grid over interconnects giving views into bulk transmission lines as well as county-level power distribution status. By correlating grid behaviors with cyber events, the platform also enables a method to link cyber-to-infrastructure dependencies.

VERDE integrates different data elements from other available on-line services, databases, and social media. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) and other major utilities spanning multiple regions across the electric grid interconnection provide real-time status of their systems. Social media sources such as Twitter provide additional data-sources for visualization and analyses.

The VERDE software, which was developed by the Computational Sciences and Engineering Division (CSED) of ORNL, is used outside of the DOE for a number of related national security requirements.

[[File:WashboardPiano.JPG|thumb|200px|Washboard player accompanying piano]]  The '''washboard''' and '''frottoir''' (from [[Cajun French]] "frotter", to rub) are used as a [[percussion instrument]], employing the ribbed metal surface of the cleaning device as a rhythm instrument. As traditionally used in [[jazz]], [[zydeco]], [[skiffle]], [[jug band]], and [[old-time music]], the washboard remained in its wooden frame and is played primarily by tapping, but also scraping the washboard with thimbles. Often the washboard has additional traps, such as a [[wood block]], a [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]], and even small [[cymbal]]s. Conversely, the frottoir (zydeco rubboard) dispenses with the frame and consists simply of the metal ribbing hung around the neck. It is played primarily with spoon handles or bottle openers in a combination of strumming, scratching, tapping and rolling.  The frottoir or ''[[vest frottoir]]'' is played as a stroked percussion instrument, often in a band with a [[drum]]mer, while the washboard generally is a replacement for drums. In Zydeco bands, the frottoir is usually played with bottle openers, to make a louder sound. It tends to play counter-rhythms to the drummer. In a jug band, the washboard can also be stroked with a single [[Broom|whisk broom]] and functions as the drums for the band, playing only on the back-beat for most songs, a substitute for a [[snare drum]]. In a four-beat measure, the washboard will stroke on the 2-beat and the 4-beat. Its best sound is achieved using a single steel-wire snare-brush or whisk broom.  However, in a jazz setting, the washboard can also be played with [[thimble]]s on all fingers, tapping out much more complex rhythms, as in [[The Washboard Rhythm Kings]], a full-sized band, and [[Newman Taylor Baker]].
[[File:Washboard busker.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Busking]] on a washboard.]]

There are three general ways of deploying the washboard for use as an instrument. The first, mainly used by American players like Washboard Chaz of the Washboard Chaz Blues Trio and Ralf Reynolds of the Reynolds Brothers Rhythm Rascals, is to drape it vertically down the chest. The second, used by European players like David Langlois of the Blue Vipers of Brooklyn, Ben Turner of Piedmont Bluz, and Stephane Seva of Paris Washboard, is to hold it horizontally across the lap, or, for more complex setups, to mount it horizontally on a purpose-built stand. The third (and least common) method, used by [[Washboard Sam]], Súle Greg Wilson of the [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]] and Sankofa Strings, and [[Deryck Guyler]], is to hold it in a perpendicular orientation between the legs while seated, so that both sides of the board might be played at the same time.

There is a Polish traditional jazz festival and music award named "[[Złota Tarka]]" (Golden Washboard).  Washboards, called "[[zatula]]s", are also occasionally used in Ukrainian folk music.

==History==
The washboard as a percussion instrument ultimately derives from the practice of [[hamboning]] as practiced in West Africa and brought to the new world by African slaves.   This led to the development of [[Jug bands]] which used [[Jug (musical instrument)|jugs]], [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoon]]s, and washboards to provide the rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermanbennett.com/washboards.php Herman Bennett: History of washboard playing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jug bands became popular in the 1920s.

The '''frottoir''', also called a '''[[Zydeco]] rub-board''', is a mid-20th century invention designed specifically for Zydeco music.  It is one of the few musical instruments invented entirely in the United States and represents a distillation of the washboard into essential elements ([[percussive]] surface with shoulder straps).  It was designed in 1946 by [[Clifton Chenier]] and fashioned by Willie Landry, a friend and metalworker at the Texaco refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. Clifton's brother Cleveland Chenier famously played this newly designed rubboard using bottle openers. Likewise, Willie's son, Tee Don Landry, continues the traditional hand manufacturing of rubboards in his small shop in [[Sunset, Louisiana]], between Lafayette and Opelousas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://keyofzrubboards.com/ Key of Z Rubboards web page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 [[Saint Blues Guitar Workshop]] launched an electric washboard percussion instrument called the Woogie Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guitarless.com/2010/02/woogie-board-electric-washboard-craziness/ Woogie Board Electric Washboard Craziness] Retrieved November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Well known washboard musicians==
{{See also|:Category:Washboard players}}

In British Columbia, Canada, Tony McBride, known as "Mad Fingers McBride", performs with a group called The Genuine Jug Band. Tony is referred to as "The Canadian Washboard King". His percussion set-up was created by Douglas Fraser, of the same band. The washboard set-up was seen in Modern Drummer magazine, August 2014 edition.

Musician [[Steve Katz (musician)|Steve Katz]] famously played washboard with the [[Even Dozen Jug Band]].  His playing can be heard on the group's legendary [[The Even Dozen Jug Band (album)|self-titled]] [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] recording from 1964. Katz reprised his washboard playing on ''Played a Little Fiddle'', a 2007 recording featuring [[Steve Katz (musician)|Steve Katz]], [[Stefan Grossman]] and [[Danny Kalb]]. Katz's washboard approach is notable as he plays the instrument horizontally. Additionally, Katz uses fingerpicks instead of thimbles.
[[File:Steve Katz Washboard.jpg|thumb|Steve Katz]]

In their earliest incarnations as [[The Quarrymen]], [[The Beatles]] were a [[skiffle]] band, featuring [[Pete Shotton]] on washboard.

During their early years, [[Mungo Jerry]] frequently featured washboard on stage and on record, played by Joe Rush.

[[Jim "Dandy" Mangrum]], lead singer of [[Southern rock]] band [[Black Oak Arkansas]], is well known for incorporating the washboard into many of the band's songs, notably "When Electricity Came to Arkansas".  Self-taught Elizabeth Bougerol has made the washboard a key element of [[The Hot Sardines]] jazz band.

Cody Dickinson, a member of hill country blues bands the [[North Mississippi Allstars]] and [[Country Hill Revue]] plays an electrified washboard on a self-written track, "Psychedelic Sex Machine". The song is almost entirely centered around the sound of the washboard, captured by a small clip-on microphone. The sound is then sent through a wah-wah and other effects pedals to create a fresher, more innovative and up-to-date sound for the washboard. A frottoir is played with a stroking instrument (usually with spoon handles or a pair of bottle-openers) in each hand. In a 4-beat measure, the frottoir will be stroked 8 to 16 times. It plays more like a [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] percussion instrument, rather than as a drum. The rhythms used are often similar to those played on [[Guiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipassio.com/hobbies/percussion-instruments/guiro|title=Guiro {{!}} ipassio|website=www.ipassio.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[Deryck Guyler]] was well known for his washboard-playing skills.

[[File:George Lusk, President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.jpg|thumb|[[George Lusk]], President of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.]]
The '''Whitechapel Vigilance Committee''' was a group of local volunteers who patrolled the streets of London's [[Whitechapel District (Metropolis)|Whitechapel District]] during the period of the [[Whitechapel murders]] of 1888. The volunteers patrolled mainly at night in the search of the murderer. The committee was set up by local businessmen who were concerned that the killings were affecting commerce in the area. It was led by [[George Lusk]], a local builder who was elected chairman during the committee's first meeting on 10 September 1888.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/timeline.html | title=Jack the Ripper Timeline |publisher=[[Casebook: Jack the Ripper]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other committee members included Publican Joseph Aarons (treasurer), Mr. B. Harris (secretary),&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;Eddleston, John J. 'Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia' Published by ABC-CLIO (2001) pg 139 {{ISBN|1-57607-414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Messrs. Barnett, Cohen, H. A. Harris, Hodgkins, Houghton, Isaacs, Jacobs, Laughton, Lindsay, Lord, Mitchell, Reeves, and Rogers. The ''Daily Telegraph'' reported on 5 October 1888 that the leading members of the committee were "drawn principally from the trading class, and include a builder, a cigar-manufacturer, a tailor, a picture-frame maker, a licensed victualler, and 'an actor.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Telegraph]] 5 October 1888&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was probably the entertainer Charles Reeves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casebook.org/notable_people/charles-reeves.html|title=Charles Reeves|publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis-inline|date=January 2017}}

As chairman of the committee, Lusk's name appeared in the national newspapers and on posters in Whitechapel appealing for information concerning the identity of [[Jack the Ripper]] and complaining about the lack of a reward for such information from the government. Due to this publicity, Lusk received threatening letters through the post, allegedly from the murderer. Lusk is also mentioned in a letter dated 17 September 1888, reportedly discovered among archive materials in the late 20th century; however, most experts dismiss this as a modern hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/ripper_letters/ |title=Ripper Letters |publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:vigilancecommittee.jpg|thumb|left|300px|&lt;center&gt;Members of the Vigilance Committee examine the contents of the box sent to Lusk&lt;/center&gt;]]
On 30 September 1888 the committee members wrote to the government under [[Lord Salisbury]] in an attempt to persuade them to offer a reward for information leading to the apprehension of the killer. When the [[Home Secretary]] [[Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff|Henry Matthews]] refused, the committee offered its own reward.&lt;ref name=timeline/&gt; The committee also employed two private detectives, Mr. Le Grand (or Grand) and Mr. J. H. Batchelor,&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt; to investigate the murders without the involvement of the local police.

The committee was unhappy with the level of protection that the community was receiving from the [[Metropolitan Police|police]], so it introduced its own system of local patrols, using hand-picked unemployed men to patrol the streets of the East End every evening from midnight to between four and five the next morning. Each of these men received a small wage from the Committee, and patrolled a particular beat, being armed with a [[police whistle]], a pair of [[galoshes]] and a strong stick. The committee itself met each evening at nine in The Crown, and once the public house closed at 12.30&amp;nbsp;am the committee members would inspect and join the patrols. These patrols were shortly to be joined by those of the Working Men's Vigilance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Sugden Philip 'The Complete History of Jack the Ripper' Robinson, London (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[From Hell letter|"From Hell" letter]], which was sent with half of a human kidney, was posted to the committee's chairman George Lusk, who received it on 16 October 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/press_reports/west_ham_guardian/881020.html |title=The East London Horrors. An Extraordinary Parcel |publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars&lt;ref&gt;Sugden Philip, Ibid &lt;citation #5&gt;, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; of the Jack the Ripper murders regard this letter as being the communication most likely to have been sent by the killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/dst-fromhellfact.html |title=From Hell: Fact or Fiction? |publisher=Casebook: Jack the Ripper}}&lt;/ref&gt;
