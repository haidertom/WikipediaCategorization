The term "'''Atomic engineering'''" appears to have been first used in 1946 by Theodore von Kármán,&lt;ref&gt;Theodore von Kármán, "Atomic Engineering?", Journal of Applied Physics 17 (1946) 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "And now it seems we are at the threshold of the new atomic age. I do not know whether or not this is true, but certainly, we shall have 'atomic engineering' in the fields of power and transportation. Are we prepared for the problems involved?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Atomic power]], which, today, is generally considered to be in the discipline of [[nuclear engineering]], is an example of what he had in mind.

Atomic engineering may be a superset of [[nuclear engineering]], due to the historical usage of terms like [[Atoms for Peace]] , [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], 'atomic engineer', etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.
An inclusive definition is: "exploiting the atomic characters of matter for [[engineering]] applications." For example, an [[atomic clock]] and potential applications of [[ultracold atoms|ultra-cold atom]] belong to atomic engineering. The atomic character could be the atomic spin (e.g. in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] and [[quantum computing]] applications), atomic position (e.g. [[Optical lattice]]), atomic mass (e.g. atomic power), etc.

The creation of the atomic bomb by Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the "Father of the atomic bomb", is based on atomic engineering. Oppenheimer was a university professor and physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.

[[Richard Feynman]], in his famous 1959 lecture "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]" on the trend of [[miniaturization]], envisioned:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "But I am not afraid to consider the final question as to whether, ultimately – in the great future – we can arrange the atoms the way we want; the very atoms, all the way down! What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them. … When we get to the very, very, small world – say circuits of seven atoms – we have a lot of new things that would happen that represent completely new opportunities for design. Atoms on a small scale behave like nothing on a large scale, for they satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics. So, as we go down and fiddle around with the atoms down there, we are working with different laws, and we can expect to do different things. We can manufacture in different ways. We can use, not just circuits, but some system involving the quantized energy levels, or the interactions of quantized spins, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Feynman, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom", Caltech Engineering and Science 23 (5), 22 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most practices of [[nanotechnology]] and [[materials science]] today have foci distinct from Feynman's ultimate vision of manipulating individual atomic position and spin, which may be better described by "Atomic engineering", that addresses characteristic length scales from 1 [[femtometer]] (the [[atomic nucleus]] size) to 1 [[nanometer]] (about 5 atoms across in linear dimension).  Coherent quantum control of individual atomic defect like the [[Nitrogen-vacancy center]], and the eventual "[[3D atom printing]]" ("2D atom printing" was realized in 1990 by IBM&lt;ref&gt;D. M. EIGLER and E. K. SCHWEIZER, "Positioning single atoms with a scanning tunnelling microscope", Nature 344 (1990) 524-526.&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[scanning tunnelling microscope]]), fit Feynman's ultimate vision.

'''Band III''' is the name of the range of [[radio frequency|radio frequencies]] within the [[very high frequency]] (VHF) part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from 174 to 240 [[megahertz]] (MHz).  It is primarily used for [[radio]] and [[television]] broadcasting.  It is also called '''high-band VHF''', in contrast to Bands I and II.

==Broadcast Television==

===North America===

The band is subdivided into seven channels for television broadcasting, each occupying 6&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csgnetwork.com/tvfreqtable.html TV Frequency Table] csgnetwork.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|12||204-210&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|13||210-216&amp;nbsp;MHz
|}

===Europe===

European Band III allocations vary from country to country, with channel widths of 7 or 8&amp;nbsp;MHz. 

The standard channel allocations for European countries that use [[Broadcast_television_systems#ITU standards|System B]] with 7&amp;nbsp;MHz channel spacing are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Channel
! Frequency Range
|-
|E5||174-181&amp;nbsp;MHz

|-
|E11||216-223&amp;nbsp;MHz
|-
|E12||223-230&amp;nbsp;MHz
|}

The [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] (8&amp;nbsp;MHz) system is shown below.

==Radio==

The band came into use for radio broadcasting at the turn of the 21st century and is used for [[Digital audio broadcasting|Digital Audio Broadcasting]].

It is subdivided into a number of frequency blocks:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Block

==Worldwide usage==

===Europe===

In the UK and part of Ireland, Band III was originally used for [[monochrome]] [[405-line]] [[television]]; however, this was discontinued by the mid-1980s. Other European countries (including Ireland) continued to use Band III for analogue [[576i|625-line]] colour television.

Digital television in the [[DVB-T]] standard can be used in conjunction with VHF Band III and is used as such in some places. The use of sub-band 2 and sub-band 3 band for [[Digital audio broadcasting|Digital Audio Broadcasting]] is now being widely adopted. Sub-band 1 is used for MPT-1327 trunked PMR radio, remote wireless microphones and PMSE links.

===North America===
In North America, use of the band for color television broadcasts is still widespread. Favorable propagation characteristics and reasonable power limits (up to 65&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt|kW]] for [[list of North American broadcast station classes|full-power]] [[digital television]], versus 20&amp;nbsp;kW or less on [[VHF]] [[Band I]]) has meant that many US broadcasters elected to move their full-power [[ATSC]] stations from [[UHF]] frequencies to Band III [[VHF]] when all full-power [[NTSC]] [[analog television]] services in the US shut down in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?state=&amp;call=&amp;arn=&amp;city=&amp;chan=&amp;cha2=13&amp;serv=DT&amp;type=4&amp;facid=&amp;list=1&amp;dist=&amp;dlat2=&amp;mlat2=&amp;slat2=&amp;dlon2=&amp;mlon2=&amp;slon2=&amp;size=9 FCC TV Query: US DTV construction permit listings for VHF Band I (ch 2-6) and III (ch 7-13)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bathroom reading''' is the act of [[Reading (process)|reading]] text while in a [[bathroom]], usually while sitting on the [[toilet]] and [[Defecation|defecating]]. The practice has been common throughout history and remains widespread today with both printed material and [[smartphone]]s.

==History==
Bathroom reading has been commonplace throughout history. [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Thermae|bath houses]] often contained libraries with scrolls for reading.&lt;ref name="Alford"&gt;{{Cite newspaper

The advent of the [[smartphone]] is believed to have significantly increased bathroom reading. A 2009 study conducted in Israel found that a majority of adults read from their smartphones on the toilet, and a 2015 study conducted by [[Verizon]] found that 90% of cell phone users admitted to reading from their phones while on the toilet.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web

==Bathroom reading and literature==
The term "bathroom reading" refers to any literary material deemed suitable for casual or light reading. In 2011, the Canadian author [[Margaret Atwood]] wrote:

{{quote|Bathroom reading is a certain kind of reading—episodic, but encouraging first thing in the morning. Sometimes the readers there prefer to read the newspaper, but when that's not available, they resort to their hand phones. The hand phone has a huge contributor in the rise of bathroom pollution.

The bathroom is a place where you can go in and pretend to be doing one thing while actually you're reading. Nobody can interrupt you. Compendiums of this and that are very useful for bathroom reading: small reading packages within a larger book. You wouldn't want to read ''[[War and Peace]]'' in there. You'd never come out. They'd probably call the police and get the door broken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Pulp magazine]]s were associated with bathroom reading, which the film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' references in repeated scenes of [[John Travolta]]'s character Vincent Vega reading the pulpy [[spy fiction|spy]] novel ''[[Modesty Blaise (novel)|Modesty Blaise]]'' while sat on a toilet.&lt;ref name=screenprism&gt;{{cite web

In [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', the protagonist [[Leopold Bloom]] reads a magazine on the toilet and then wipes himself with it.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

==Sanitation, hygiene and health== 
According to a professor at the [[Columbia University Medical Center]], reading in the bathroom can potentially facilitate [[Transmission (medicine)|the spread of disease]] if [[Airborne disease|airborne]] [[bacteria]] land on reading material and are transmitted to the reader; however, the activity is not a significant health concern as long as the reading environment is [[Sanitation|sanitary]], the reader does not have a [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune system]], and the reader practices ordinary [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A [[University of Arizona]] [[microbiologist]] who researched the topic in 2002 found that bathroom reading at the workplace was not a significant hygiene risk, noting that paper is a relatively unattractive environment for bacteria and that [[desk]] areas often have more bacteria than bathrooms because they are cleaned less frequently.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt;

Although time spent on the toilet can increase the incidence of [[hemorrhoid]]s, a 2009 study found that bathroom readers were not more likely than non-bathroom readers to have hemorrhoids.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

==Bathroom reading and psychology==
Even when people read for extended periods of time during defecation, it is rare for bathroom readers to feel [[disgust]]ed by the smell of their own [[human feces|feces]], or even to consciously notice the smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Otto Fenichel]] believed bathroom reading was an indication of [[early childhood trauma]]. He wrote that the activity is "an attempt to preserve the equilibrium of [[Id, ego and super-ego|the ego]]; part of one's bodily substance is being lost and so fresh matter must be absorbed through the eyes."&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; [[James Strachey]], who translated Freud's works into English, similarly noted that the activity of casual reading while defecating was essentially "infantile" behavior.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

[[DiMassimo Goldstein|DiMassimo Brand Advertising]] once tested [[Campaign advertising|political advertising]] in bathrooms by placing various messages about [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] in New York City public restrooms. The company's study found that 62 percent of people "remembered the exact message" of bathroom ads, compared to 16 percent for [[billboard]] advertisements.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt;&lt;!--

'''Bird vocalization''' includes both '''bird calls''' and '''bird songs'''. In non-technical use, [[bird]] songs are the bird sounds that are melodious to the human ear. In [[ornithology]] and [[birding]], songs (relatively complex vocalizations) are distinguished by function from calls (relatively simple vocalizations).

==Definition==
[[File:PipraWing.jpg|thumb|Wing feathers of a male [[club-winged manakin]], with the modifications noted by P. L. Sclater in 1860&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= List of Birds collected by Mr. Fraser in Ecuador, at Nanegal, Calacali, Perucho, and Puellaro, with notes and descriptions of new species|journal=Proc. Zool. Soc. London|author=Sclater, PL|year=1860|pages=83–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed by Charles Darwin in 1871&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Darwin, Charles|year=1871|url=https://archive.org/stream/descentofmansele02darw#page/65/mode/1up/|pages=65–66|title=The descent of man and selection in relation to sex. volume 2|publisher=John Murray, London|isbn=978-1-108-00510-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The distinction between songs and calls is based upon complexity, length, and context. Songs are longer and more complex and are associated with [[Bird#Breeding|courtship and mating]], while calls tend to serve such functions as alarms or keeping members of a [[herd|flock]] in contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ehrlich, Paul R. |author2=David S. Dobkin |author3=Darryl Wheye |last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/SUFRAME.html|title="Bird Voices" and "Vocal Development" from Birds of Stanford essays|accessdate=9 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authorities such as Howell and Webb (1995) make the distinction based on function, so that short vocalizations, such as those of pigeons, and even non-vocal sounds, such as the drumming of [[woodpecker]]s and the "[[Drumming (snipe)|winnowing]]" of [[snipe]]s' wings in display flight, are considered songs.&lt;ref name=howell&gt;{{cite book |author1=Howell, Steve N. G. |author2=Sophie Webb |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A Guide to the Birds of Mexico and Northern Central America |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-19-854012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others require song to have syllabic diversity and temporal regularity akin to the repetitive and transformative patterns that define [[music]]. It is generally agreed upon in birding and ornithology which sounds are songs and which are calls, and a good field guide will differentiate between the two.

Bird song is best developed in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[passerine|Passeriformes]]. Some groups are nearly voiceless, producing only [[percussive]] and [[rhythm]]ic sounds, such as the [[stork]]s, which clatter their bills. In some manakins ([[Pipridae]]), the males have evolved several mechanisms for mechanical sound production, including mechanisms for [[stridulation]] not unlike those found in some insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bostwick, Kimberly S. |author2=Richard O. Prum |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005|title=Courting Bird Sings with Stridulating Wing Feathers |journal=Science|volume=309|issue=5735|page=736|doi=10.1126/science.1111701 |pmid=16051789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Contopus-virens-001.ogg|left|thumb|eastern wood pewee:  note the simple repetitive pattern of ascending and descending tones from a grounding note.]]
Song is usually delivered from prominent perches, although some species may sing when flying. The production of sounds by mechanical means as opposed to the use of the [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]] has been termed variously ''instrumental music'' by [[Charles Darwin]], ''mechanical sounds''&lt;ref&gt;Manson-Barr, P. and Pye, J. D. (1985). Mechanical sounds. In A Dictionary of Birds (ed. B. Campbell and E. Lack), pp. 342-344. Staffordshire: Poyser.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently ''[[sonation]]''.&lt;ref name="bostwick"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bostwick, Kimberly S. |author2=Richard O.

In extratropical [[Eurasia]] and [[the Americas]] almost all song is produced by male birds; however in the tropics and to a greater extent the [[desert]] belts of [[Australia]] and [[Africa]] it is more typical for females to sing as much as males. These differences have been known for a long time&lt;ref name="biological"&gt;Robinson, Angus; [http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/MU948291.htm "The Biological Significance of Bird Song in Australia"] in ''[[Emu (journal)|Emu]]''; 48(4), pp. 291-315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartshorne, Charles; "Some Biological Principles Applicable to Song Behavior" in ''The Wilson Bulletin'' Vol. 70, No. 1 (Mar., 1958), pp. 41-56&lt;/ref&gt; and are generally attributed to the much less regular and seasonal climate of Australian and African arid zones requiring that birds breed at any time when conditions are favourable, although they cannot breed in many years because food supply never increases above a minimal level.&lt;ref name="biological"/&gt; With aseasonal irregular breeding, both sexes must be brought into breeding condition and vocalisation, especially duetting, serves this purpose. The high frequency of female vocalisations in the tropics, Australia and Southern Africa may also relate to very low mortality rates producing much stronger pair-bonding and territoriality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Slater Peter J. B., Mann Nigel I. | year = 2004 | title = Why do the females of many bird species sing in the tropics? | url = | journal = Journal of Avian Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 289–294 | doi=10.1111/j.0908-8857.2004.03392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy and physiology==
The avian vocal organ is called the [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]];&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough, D. 1998. ''The Life of Birds''. BBC publication.0563-38792-0&lt;/ref&gt; it is a bony structure at the bottom of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] (unlike the [[larynx]] at the top of the [[mammal]]ian trachea). The syrinx and sometimes a surrounding air sac resonate to sound waves that are made by membranes past which the bird forces air. The bird controls the pitch by changing the tension on the membranes and controls both pitch and volume by changing the force of exhalation. It can control the two sides of the trachea independently, which is how some species can produce two notes at once.

Scientists hypothesize that bird song has evolved through [[sexual selection]], and experiments suggest that the quality of bird song may be a good indicator of fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Read, A.

Communication through bird calls can be between individuals of the same species or even across species. Birds communicate alarm through vocalizations and movements that are specific to the threat, and bird alarms can be understood by other animal species, including other birds, in order to identify and protect against the specific threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |title=A Bird's World: Speaking in a Bird's Language |publisher=Museum of Science, Boston |url=http://www.mos.org/educators/field_trip_resources/field_trip_activities/exhibits&amp;d=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobbing behaviour|Mobbing]] calls are used to recruit individuals in an area where an owl or other predator may be present. These calls are characterized by wide-frequency spectra, sharp onset and termination, and repetitiveness that are common across species and are believed to be helpful to other potential "mobbers" by being easy to locate. The alarm calls of most species, on the other hand, are characteristically high-pitched, making the caller difficult to locate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marler, P. |year=1955 |title=Characteristics of some animal calls |journal=Nature |volume=176 |issue=4470 |pages=6–8 |doi=10.1038/176006a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual birds may be sensitive enough to identify each other through their calls.

Sometimes, songs vocalized in post-breeding season act as a cue to [[conspecificity|conspecific]] eavesdroppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Betts |first=M.G. |author2=Hadley, A.S. |author3=Rodenhouse, N. |author4= Nocera, J.J. |title=Social Information Trumps Vegetation Structure in Breeding-Site Selection by a Migrant Songbird |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |year=2008 |volume=275 |issue=1648 |series=1648 |pages=2257–2263 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0217|pmc=2603235 |pmid=18559326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[black-throated blue warbler]]s, males that have bred and reproduced successfully sing to their offspring to influence their vocal development, while males that have failed to reproduce usually abandon the nests and stay silent. The post-breeding song therefore inadvertently informs the unsuccessful males of particular habitats that have a higher likelihood of reproductive success. The [[animal communication|social communication]] by vocalization provides a shortcut to locating high quality habitats and saves the trouble of directly assessing various vegetation structures.

The range of frequencies at which birds call in an environment varies with the quality of habitat and the ambient sounds. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that narrow bandwidths, low frequencies, and long elements and inter-element intervals should be found in habitats with complex vegetation structures (which would absorb and muffle sounds), while high frequencies, broad bandwidth, high-frequency modulations (trills), and short elements and inter-elements may be expected in open habitats, without obstructive vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Derryberry|first=Elizabeth|title=Ecology Shapes Birdsong Evolution: Variation in Morphology and Habitat Explains Variation in White-Crowned Sparrow Song|journal=The American Naturalist|date=July 2009|volume=174|issue=1|pages=24–33|doi=10.1086/599298|pmid=19441960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boncoraglio, G. |author2=Nicola Saino |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title=Habitat structure and the evolution of bird song: a meta-analysis of the evidence for the acoustic adaptation hypothesis|journal= Functional Ecology|volume=21|pages=134–142|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2006.01207.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morton, E.S. |year=1975|title= Ecological sources of selection on avian sounds|journal=American Naturalist|volume=109|pages=17–34|doi=10.1086/282971|issue=965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesized that the available frequency range is partitioned, and birds call so that overlap between different species in frequency and time is reduced.

The songs of different species of birds vary and are generally typical of the species. Species vary greatly in the complexity of their songs and in the number of distinct kinds of song they sing (up to 3000 in the [[brown thrasher]]); individuals within some species vary in the same way. In a few species, such as [[lyrebird]]s and [[mockingbird]]s, songs imbed arbitrary elements learned in the individual's lifetime, a form of mimicry (though maybe better called "appropriation" [Ehrlich et al.], as the bird does not pass for another species). As early as 1773, it was established that birds learned calls, and [[cross-fostering]] experiments succeeded in making linnet ''[[Acanthis cannabina]]'' learn the song of a skylark, ''Alauda arvensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barrington, D. |year=1773 |title=Experiments and observations on the singing of birds |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=63 |pages=249–291 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1773.0031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many species, it appears that although the basic song is the same for all members of the species, young birds learn some details of their songs from their fathers, and these variations build up over generations to form [[dialects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marler, P. |author2=M.

Song learning in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile listening to the father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konishi, M.|year=2010|title=From central pattern generator to sensory template in the evolution of birdsong|journal=Brain &amp; Language|volume=115|issue=1|pages=18–20|pmid= 20955898|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2010.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the sensorimotor learning phase, song production begins with highly variable sub-vocalizations called "sub-song", which is akin to [[babbling]] in human infants.Soon after, the juvenile song shows certain recognizable characteristics of the imitated adult song, but still lacks the stereotypy of the crystallized song – this is called "plastic song".&lt;ref name = "Nottebohm 2005" &gt;{{cite journal |author=Nottebohm, F. |year=2005 |title=The Neural Basis of Birdsong|journal=PLoS Biol|pmid=15884976|volume=3 |issue=5 |pmc=1110917|page=163 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030164}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After two or three months of song learning and rehearsal (depending on species), the juvenile produces a crystallized song, characterized by spectral and temporal stereotypy (very low variability in syllable production and syllable order).&lt;ref name="Leonardo1999"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leonardo, A. |author2= Konishi, M. |year=1999|title=Decrystallization of adult birdsong by perturbation of auditory feedback|journal=Nature |volume= 399|pages=466–470|doi=10.1038/20933 |pmid=10365958|issue=6735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some birds, such as [[zebra finch]]es, which are the most popular species for birdsong research, have overlapping sensory and sensorimotor learning stages.&lt;ref name="Brainard 2002 351-358"/&gt;

Research has indicated that birds' acquisition of song is a form of [[motor learning]] that involves regions of the [[basal ganglia]]. Further, the PDP (see ''Neuroanatomy'' below) has been considered [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to a mammalian motor pathway originating in the [[cerebral cortex]] and descending through the [[brain stem]], while the AFP has been considered homologous to the mammalian cortical pathway through the basal ganglia and thalamus.&lt;ref name = "Nottebohm 2005" /&gt; Models of bird-song [[motor learning]] can be useful in developing models for how humans learn [[speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Teramitsu I |author2=Kudo LC |author3=London SE |author4=Geschwind DH |author5=White SA |last-author-amp=yes |year=2004|title=Parallel FoxP1 and FoxP2 expression in songbird and human brain predicts functional interaction|journal=J.

Researchers have hypothesized that learned songs allow the development of more complex songs through cultural interaction, thus allowing intraspecies dialects that help birds to identify kin and to adapt their songs to different acoustic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/08927014.1989.9525529 |author=Slater, P.

==Neuroanatomy==
[[Image:Birdbrain.svg |thumb|Song-learning pathway in birds&lt;ref name="Nottebohm 2005" /&gt;]]

The acquisition and learning of bird song involves a group of distinct brain areas that are aligned in two connecting pathways:&lt;ref name="Nottebohm 2005" /&gt;
* Anterior forebrain pathway ([[vocal learning]]): composed of Area X, which is a homologue to mammalian basal ganglia; the lateral part of the [[magnocellular cell|magnocellular]] nucleus of anterior nidopallium (LMAN), also considered a part of the avian basal ganglia; and the dorso-lateral division of the medial thalamus (DLM).
* Posterior descending pathway (vocal production): composed of HVC (proper name, although sometimes referred to as the [[high vocal center]]); the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA); and the tracheosyringeal part of the [[hypoglossal nucleus]] (nXIIts).&lt;ref name = "Brainard 2000 31-40" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brainard, M. S. |author2=Doupe, A. J.
 |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000 |title=Auditory feedback in learning and maintenance of vocal behavior |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |pmid=11252766 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=31–40 |doi=10.1038/35036205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carew&gt;{{cite book |author=Carew, Thomas J. |title=Behavioral Neurobiology: The Cellular Organization of Natural Behavior |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-87893-092-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The posterior descending pathway (PDP) is required throughout a bird's life for normal song production, while the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) is necessary for song learning in juvenilles and plasticity/maintenance in adults, but not for adult song production.&lt;ref name="Kao2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kao, M.H. |author2=Doupe, A.J. |author3= Brainard, M.S. |year=2005|title=Contributions of an avian basal ganglia-forebrain circuit to real=time modulation of song|journal=Nature |volume=433 |issue=7026 |pages=638–642 |doi=10.1038/nature03127 |pmid=15703748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both neural pathways in the song system begin at the level of [[high vocal center|HVC]], which projects information both to the RA (premotor nucleus) and to Area X of the anterior forebrain. Information in the posterior descending pathway (also referred to as the vocal production or motor pathway) descends from [[high vocal center|HVC]] to RA, and then from RA to the tracheosyringeal part of the [[hypoglossal nerve]] (nXIIts), which then controls muscular contractions of the syrinx.&lt;ref name = "Nottebohm 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Suthers, R. |year=2004 |chapter=How birds sing and why it matters|editor=Marler, P. |editor2=Slabbekoorn, H. |title=Nature's music:The science of birdsong |publisher=Academic Press |pages=272–295|isbn= 978-0-12-473070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information in the anterior forebrain pathway is projected from [[high vocal center|HVC]] to Area X (basal ganglia), then from Area X to the DLM (thalamus), and from DLM to LMAN, which then links the [[vocal learning]] and vocal production pathways through connections back to the RA. Some investigators have posited a model in which the connection between LMAN and RA carries an instructive signal based on evaluation of auditory feedback (comparing the bird's own song to the memorized song template), which adaptively alters the motor program for song output.&lt;ref name = "Kao2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brainard_2000b"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brainard, M.

Models regarding the real-time error-correction interactions between the AFP and PDP will be considered in the future. Other current research has begun to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying [[high vocal center|HVC]] control of temporal patterns of song structure and RA control of syllable production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Long, M.A. |author2=Jin, D.Z. |author3= Fee, M.S. |year=2010 |title=Support for a synaptic chain model of neuronal sequence generation |journal=Nature| volume=468 |issue=7322 |pages=394–399| doi=10.1038/nature09514 |pmid=20972420 |pmc=2998755}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brain structures involved in both pathways show [[sexual dimorphism]] in many bird species, usually causing males and females to sing differently. Some of the known types of dimorphisms in the brain include the size of nuclei, the number of neurons present, and the number of neurons connecting one nucleus to another.&lt;ref name="BalthazartAdkinsRegan2002"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Balthazart, J. |author2=Adkins-Regan |year=2002 |title=Sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in birds |journal=Hormones, Brain and Behavior |volume=4 |pages=223–301 |doi=10.1016/b978-012532104-4/50068-8|isbn=9780125321044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the extremely dimorphic zebra finches (''Taeniopygia guttata''), a species in which only males typically sing, the size of the HVC and RA are approximately three to six times larger in males than in females, and Area X does not appear to be recognizable in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nottebohm, F. |author2=Arnold, A.P. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1976 |title=Sexual dimorphism in vocal control areas of the songbird brain |journal=Science |volume=194 |issue=4261 |pages=211–213|doi=10.1126/science.959852 |pmid=959852}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that exposure to sex steroids during early development is partially responsible for these differences in the brain. Female zebra finches treated with estradiol after hatching followed by testosterone or [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) treatment in adulthood will develop an RA and HVC similar in size to males and will also display male-like singing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gurney, M.E. |author2=Konishi, M. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Hormone-induced sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in zebra finches |journal=Science  |year=1980 |volume=208 |issue=4450 |pages=1380–1383 |doi=10.1126/science.208.4450.1380 |pmid=17775725}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hormone treatment alone does not seem to produce female finches with brain structures or behavior exactly like males. Furthermore, other research has shown results that contradict what would be expected based on our current knowledge of mammalian sexual differentiation. For example, male zebra finches castrated or given sex steroid inhibitors as hatchlings still develop normal masculine singing behavior.&lt;ref name="BalthazartAdkinsRegan2002"/&gt; This suggests that other factors, such as the activation of genes on the z chromosome, might also play a role in normal male song development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tomaszycki, M.L. |author2=Peabody, C. |author3=Replogle, K. |author4=Clayton, D.F |author5=Tempelman, R.J. |author6=Wade, J. |year= 2009|title=Sexual differentiation of the zebra finch song system: potential roles for sex chromosome genes |journal=BMC Neuroscience |volume=10 |doi=10.1186/1471-2202-10-24 |pmid=19309515 |pmc=2664819 |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hormones also have activational effects on singing and the song nuclei in adult birds. In canaries (''Serinus canaria''), females normally sing less often and with less complexity than males. However, when adult females are given androgen injections, their singing will increase to an almost male-like frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=S.

==Auditory feedback in birdsong learning==
Early experiments by Thorpe in 1954 showed the importance of a bird being able to hear a tutor's song. When birds are raised in isolation, away from the influence of conspecific males, they still sing. While the song they produce, called "isolate song", resembles the song of a wild bird, it shows distinctly different characteristics from the wild song and lacks its complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thorpe, W.|year=1954|title=The process of song-learning in the chaffinch as studied by means of the sound spectrograph|journal= Nature|volume=173 |pages=465–469|doi=10.1038/173465a0|issue=4402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzmacher, M. |year=2016 |title= Alauda: Chaffinch song learning : Thorpe conclusions revisited |journal=Alauda |volume=84 |pages=465–469|hdl=2268/204189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the bird being able to hear itself sing in the sensorimotor period was later discovered by Konishi. Birds deafened before the song-crystallization period went on to produce songs that were distinctly different from the wild type and isolate song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konishi, M.|year=1965|title=The role of auditory feedback on the control of vocalization in the white-crowned sparrow|journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie|volume= 22|pages=770–783|pmid=5874921|issue=7|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1965.tb01688.x|doi-broken-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marler, P.|year=1970|title=A comparative approach to vocal learning: Song development in the white-crowned sparrows|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiological Psychology|volume=71|issue=2, Pt.2|pages=1–25|doi=10.1037/h0029144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the emergence of these findings, investigators have been searching for the neural pathways that facilitate sensory/sensorimotor learning and mediating the matching of the bird's own song with the memorized song template.

Several studies over recent decades have looked at the neural mechanisms underlying birdsong learning by performing lesions to relevant brain structures involved in the production or maintenance of song or by deafening birds before and/or after song crystallization. Another recent experimental approach was recording the bird's song and then playing it back while the bird is singing, causing perturbed auditory feedback (the bird hears the superposition of its own song and a fragmented portion of a previous song syllable).&lt;ref name = "Leonardo1999" /&gt; After Nordeen &amp; Nordeen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nordeen, K.W. |author2= Nordeen, E.J. |year=1994|title=Auditory feedback is necessary for the maintenance of stereotyped song in adult zebra finches|journal=Behavioral and Neural Biology|volume=71|issue=1|doi=10.1016/0163-1047(92)90757-U|pages=58–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a landmark discovery as they demonstrated that auditory feedback was necessary for the maintenance of song in adult birds with crystallized song, Leonardo &amp; Konishi (1999) designed an auditory feedback perturbation protocol in order to explore the role of auditory feedback in adult song maintenance further, to investigate how adult songs deteriorate after extended exposure to perturbed auditory feedback, and to examine the degree to which adult birds could recover crystallized song over time after being removed from perturbed feedback exposure. This study offered further support for role of auditory feedback in maintaining adult song stability and demonstrated how adult maintenance of crystallized birdsong is dynamic rather than static.

Brainard &amp; Doupe (2000) posit a model in which LMAN (of the anterior forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an instructive error signal to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to correct or modify the motor program for song production. In their study, Brainard &amp; Doupe (2000) showed that while deafening adult birds led to the loss of song stereotypy due to altered auditory feedback and non-adaptive modification of the motor program, lesioning LMAN in the anterior forebrain pathway of adult birds that had been deafened led to the stabilization of song (LMAN lesions in deafened birds prevented any further deterioration in syllable production and song structure).

Currently, there are two competing models that elucidate the role of LMAN in generating an instructive error signal and projecting it to the motor production pathway:

*''Bird's own song (BOS)-tuned error correction model''

: During singing, the activation of LMAN neurons will depend on the match between auditory feedback from the song produced by the bird and the stored song template. If this is true, then the firing rates of LMAN neurons will be sensitive to changes in auditory feedback.

*''Efference copy model of error correction''

: An [[efference copy]] of the motor command for song production is the basis of the real-time error-correction signal. During singing, activation of LMAN neurons will depend on the motor signal used to generate the song, and the learned prediction of expected auditory feedback based on that motor command. Error correction would occur more rapidly in this model.

Leonardo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leonardo, A.|year=2004|title=Experimental test of error-correction birdsong model|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=101|issue=48|pages=16935–16940|doi=10.1073/pnas.0407870101|pmid=15557558|pmc=534752}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested these models directly by recording spike rates in single LMAN neurons of adult zebra finches during singing in conditions with normal and perturbed auditory feedback. His results did not support the BOS-tuned error correction model, as the firing rates of LMAN neurons were unaffected by changes in auditory feedback and therefore, the error signal generated by LMAN appeared unrelated to auditory feedback. Moreover, the results from this study supported the predictions of the efference copy model, in which LMAN neurons are activated during singing by the efference copy of the motor signal (and its predictions of expected auditory feedback), allowing the neurons to be more precisely time-locked to changes in auditory feedback.

===Mirror neurons and vocal learning===

A [[mirror neuron]] is a [[neuron]] that discharges both when an individual performs an action and when he/she perceives that same action being performed by another.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti, G. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rizzolatti G. |author2=Craighero L. | year = 2004 | title = The mirror-neuron system | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Neurosci. | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 169–192 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 | pmid = 15217330}}&lt;/ref&gt; These neurons were first discovered in [[macaque]] monkeys, but recent research suggests that mirror neuron systems may be present in other animals including humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Oberman L. M. |author2=Pineda J. A. |author3=Ramachandran V. S. |year=2007 |title=The human mirror neuron system: A link between action observation and social skills |url= |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=62–66 |pmid=18985120 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsl022 |pmc=2555434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Song selective HVCx neurons.svg|thumb|300px|'''Song selectivity in HVCx neurons:''' neuron activity in response to calls heard (green) and calls produced (red). '''a.''' Neurons fire when the primary song type is either heard or sung. '''b, c.''' Neurons do not fire in response to the other song type, regardless of whether it is heard or sung.&lt;ref name=Prather2008/&gt;]]

Mirror neurons have the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti, G. 2004"/&gt;
* They are located in the [[premotor cortex]].
* They exhibit both sensory and motor properties.
* They are action-specific – mirror neurons are only active when an individual is performing or observing a certain type of action (e.g., grasping an object).

Because mirror neurons exhibit both [[sensory neuron|sensory]] and [[motor neuron|motor]] activity, some researchers have suggested that mirror neurons may serve to map sensory experience onto motor structures.&lt;ref name="Dinstein, I. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dinstein I. |author2=Thomas C. |author3=Behrmann M. |author4=Heeger D.J. | year = 2008 | title = A mirror up to nature | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = R13–18 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.004 | pmid=18177704 | pmc=2517574}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has implications for birdsong learning– many birds rely on auditory feedback to acquire and maintain their songs. Mirror neurons may be mediating this comparison of what the bird hears, how it compares to a memorized song template, and what he produces.

In search of these auditory-motor neurons, Jonathan Prather and other researchers at Duke University recorded the activity of single neurons in the [[High vocal center|HVCs]] of [[swamp sparrow]]s.&lt;ref name=Prather2008&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Prather J. F. |author2=Peters S. |author3=Nowicki S. |author4=Mooney R. | year = 2008 | title = Precise auditory-vocal mirroring in neurons for learned vocal communication | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7176| pages = 305–310 | doi = 10.1038/nature06492 | pmid = 18202651}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that the neurons that project from the HVC to Area X (HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; neurons) are highly responsive when the bird is hearing a playback of his own song. These neurons also fire in similar patterns when the bird is singing that same song. Swamp sparrows employ 3-5 different song types, and the neural activity differs depending on which song is heard or sung. The HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; neurons only fire in response to the presentation (or singing) of one of the songs, the primary song type. They are also temporally selective, firing at a precise phase in the song syllable.

Prather, et al. found that during the short period of time before and after the bird sings, his HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; neurons become insensitive to [[Sound|auditory]] input. In other words, the bird becomes "deaf" to his own song. This suggests that these neurons are producing a [[corollary discharge]], which would allow for direct comparison of motor output and auditory input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tchernichovski O. |author2=Wallman J. | year = 2008 | title = Behavioral neuroscience: Neurons of imitation | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7176| pages = 249–250 | doi = 10.1038/451249a | pmid = 18202627}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the mechanism underlying learning via auditory feedback. These findings are also in line with Leonardo's (2004) efference copy model of error correction in birdsong learning and production.

Overall, the HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; auditory motor neurons in swamp sparrows are very similar to the visual motor mirror neurons discovered in [[primates]]. Like mirror neurons, the HVC&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; neurons:

* Are located in a [[premotor]] brain area
* Exhibit both sensory and motor properties
* Are action-specific – a response is only triggered by the "primary song type"

The function of the mirror neuron system is still unclear. Some scientists speculate that mirror neurons may play a role in understanding the actions of others, [[imitation]], [[theory of mind]] and [[language acquisition]], though there is currently insufficient [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] evidence in support of these theories.&lt;ref name="Dinstein, I. 2008"/&gt; Specifically regarding birds, it is possible that the mirror neuron system serves as a general mechanism underlying [[vocal learning]], but further research is needed. In addition to the implications for song learning, the mirror neuron system could also play a role in [[territorial behavior]]s such as song-type matching and countersinging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Miller G | year = 2008 | title = Mirror neurons may help songbirds stay in tune | url = | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5861| page = 269| doi=10.1126/science.319.5861.269a |pmid=18202262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1644/20130179.full.pdf | title=Auditory–vocal mirroring in songbirds | publisher=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences Online | date=5 June 2014 | accessdate=December 16, 2015 | author=Richard Mooney }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification and systematics==

The specificity of bird calls has been used extensively for species identification. The calls of birds have been described using words or nonsense syllables or line diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Aretas A (1951) Guide to Bird Songs. Doubleday and Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000M4}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Common terms in English include words such as ''quack'', ''chirp'' and ''chirrup''. These are subject to imagination and vary greatly; a well-known example is the [[white-throated sparrow]]'s song, given in [[Canada]] as ''O sweet Canada Canada Canada'' and in [[New England]] as ''Old Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody'' (also ''Where are you Frederick Frederick Frederick?''). In addition to nonsense words, grammatically correct phrases have been constructed as likenesses of the vocalizations of birds. For example, the [[barred owl]] produces a motif which some bird guides describe as ''Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all?'' with the emphasis placed on ''you''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sibley, David|title=The Sibley Guide to Birds |publisher=Knopf |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-679-45122-8 |authorlink=David Allen Sibley|title-link=The Sibley Guide to Birds }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bird language==



The [[language of the birds]] has long been a topic for anecdote and speculation. That calls have meanings that are interpreted by their listeners has been well demonstrated. Domestic [[chicken]]s have distinctive alarm calls for aerial and ground predators, and they respond to these alarm calls appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Collias, N. E.|year= 1987|title=The vocal repertoire of the Red Junglefowl: A spectrographic classification and the code of communication|journal=The Condor|volume= 89|issue=3|pages=510–524|doi=10.2307/1368641|jstor=1368641}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans, C.

However, a [[language]] has, in addition to words, [[grammar]] (that is, structures and rules). Studies to demonstrate the existence of language have been difficult due to the range of possible interpretations. For instance, some have argued that in order for a communication system to count as a language it must be "combinatorial",&lt;ref name="Ficken1986" /&gt; having an open ended set of grammar-compliant sentences made from a finite vocabulary. 

Research on [[parrot]]s by [[Irene Pepperberg]] is claimed to demonstrate the innate ability for grammatical structures, including the existence of concepts such as nouns, adjectives and verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pepperberg, I.M.|year=2000|title= The Alex Studies: Cognitive and Communicative Abilities of Grey Parrots|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild, [[Black-capped Chickadee]]s innate vocalizations have been rigorously shown&lt;ref name="Ficken1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hailman|first1=Jack|last2=Ficken|first2=Millicent|title=Combinatorial animal communication with computable syntax: Chick-a-dee calling qualifies as "language" by structural linguistics.|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1986|volume=34|issue=6|page=1899–1901|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80279-2|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347286802792?via%3Dihub|accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have combinatorial language.

The term ''bird language'' may also more informally refer to patterns in bird vocalizations that communicate information to other birds or other animals in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Young, Jon|year=2008|title=Bird Language: Exploring the Language of Nature with Jon Young|publisher=OWLink Media|url=http://birdlanguage.com/about/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728131947/http://birdlanguage.com/about/|archivedate=2010-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Birds in music|In music]], [[birdsong]] has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Beethoven]] did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as [[Ottorino Respighi]] first did; or like [[Beatrice Harrison]] and [[David Rothenberg]], they can duet with birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthew Head |title=Birdsong and the Origins of Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |volume=122 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1093/jrma/122.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark, Suzannah |year=2001 |title=Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-77191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ledger&gt;{{cite news |last=Reich |first=Ronni |title=NJIT professor finds nothing cuckoo in serenading our feathered friends |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/10/njit_professor_finds_nothing_c.html |accessdate=19 June 2011 |newspaper=Star Ledger |date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Hollis |date=2011-03-21 |title=Composers' Appropriation of Pied Butcherbird Song: Henry Tate's "undersong of Australia" Comes of Age |url=http://www.jmro.org.au/index.php/mca2/article/view/43 |journal=Journal of Music Research Online |volume=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors including Rothenberg have claimed that birds sing on traditional scales as used in human music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rothenberg |first1=David |title=Why Birds Sing |date=2005 |publisher=Allen Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Motion |first1=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Motion |title=In full flight |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview5|accessdate=24 April 2016 |agency=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Birds Sing|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qn8p |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC Four) |accessdate=24 April 2016 |date=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at least one songbird does not choose notes in this way.&lt;ref name=Underwood&gt;{{cite web |last1=Underwood |first1=Emily |title=Birdsong Not Music, After All |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/08/birdsong-not-music-after-all |publisher=Science |accessdate=24 April 2016 |date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Birds in culture}}

Bird song is a popular subject in [[poetry]]. Famous examples inspired by bird song include the 1177 [[Persian poetry|Persian poem]] "[[The Conference of the Birds]]", in which the birds of the world assemble under the wisest bird, the [[hoopoe]], to decide who is to be their king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conference of the Birds |author=Attar, Farid al-Din |authorlink=Farid al-Din Attar |editor1=Darbandi, Afkham |editor2=Davis, Dick |publisher=Penguin Classics |date=1984 |isbn=978-0-14-044434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English poetry, [[John Keats]]'s 1819 "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]" and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s 1820 "[[To a Skylark]]" are popular classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooks |first=Cleanth |last2=Warren |first2=Robert Penn |title=The ''Ode to a Nightingale'' |work=Keats's Odes |editor-first=Jack |editor-last=Stillinger |pages=44–47 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Sandy | first=Mark | title=To a Skylark | encyclopedia=The Literary Encyclopedia | date=2002 | url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=7305 | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Hughes]]'s 1970 collection of poems about a bird character, "[[Crow (poetry)|Crow]]", is considered one of his most important works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/crow.htm |title=Crow - The Ted Hughes Society Journal |publisher=The Ted Hughes Society |date=2012 |accessdate=22 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702124543/http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/crow.htm |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird poems by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] include "Sea and Skylark" and "[[The Windhover]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopkins |first1=Gerard Manley |title=Poems and Prose |date=1985 |publisher=Penguin Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afjmf6TpHagC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227|isbn=9780140420159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29914">Formerly known as the '''World Life Issues on Environment and Development''' (WCED), the mission of the '''Brundtland Commission''' is to unite countries to pursue [[sustainable development]] together. The Chairperson of the Commission, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], was appointed by [[United Nations]] [[UNSG|Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] in December 1983. At the time, the [[UN General Assembly]] realized that there was a heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources. To rally countries to work and pursue sustainable development together, the UN decided to establish the '''Brundtland Commission'''. Gro Harlem Brundtland was the former [[Prime Minister of Norway]] and was chosen due to her strong background in the sciences and [[public health]]. The Brundtland Commission officially dissolved in December 1987 after releasing ''[[Our Common Future]]'', also known as the ''[[Our Common Future|Brundtland Report]]'', in October 1987. The document popularized (and defined) the term 
"[[Sustainable Development]]". ''[[Our Common Future]]'' won the [[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=grawemeyer.org&gt;{{cite web|title=1991- The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development|url=http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103112536/http://grawemeyer.org/worldorder/previous-winners/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development.html|archivedate=2013-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization Center for Our Common Future was started in April 1988 to take the place of the Commission.

==History==
Ten years after the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], a number of global environmental challenges had clearly not been adequately addressed.  In several ways, these challenges had grown. Particularly, the underlying problem of how to reduce poverty in low-income countries through more productive and industrialized economy without, in the process, exacerbating the global and local environmental burdens, remained unresolved. Neither high-income countries in the North nor low-income countries in the South were willing to give up an economic development based on growth, but environmental threats, ranging from pollution, acid rain, deforestation and desertification, the destruction of the ozone layer, to early signs of climate change, were impossible to overlook and increasingly unacceptable. There was a tangible need for a developmental concept that would allow reconciling economic development with [[environmental protection]]. Views differed on several questions: were local environmental problems the result of local developments or of a global economic system that forced particularly low-income countries to destroy their environmental basis? Did environmental burdens result mainly from destructive economic growth-based development or from a lack of economic development and modernization? Would reconciling the economy and the environment require mainly technical means by using more resource-efficient technologies or mainly social and structural changes that would include political decision-making as well as changes in private consumption patterns?
The 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]], was the first report that included a very brief chapter on a concept called "sustainable development". It focused on global structural changes and was not widely read. The UN initiated an independent commission, which was asked to provide an analysis of existing problems and ideas for their solution, similar to earlier commissions such as the Independent Commission on International Development Issues (Brandt Commission) and the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues (Palme Commission).&lt;ref&gt;Iris Borowy, Defining Sustainable Development: the World Commission on Environment and Development (Brundtland Commission), Milton Park: earthscan/Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1983, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], asked the Prime Minister of Norway, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], to create an organization independent of the UN to focus on environmental and developmental problems and solutions after an affirmation by the General Assembly resolution in the fall of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|title=History of Sustainability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=epa.gov|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230314/http://yosemite.epa.gov/r10/oi.nsf/8bb15fe43a5fb81788256b58005ff079/398761d6c3c7184988256fc40078499b!OpenDocument|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new organization was the Brundtland Commission, or more formally, the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). The Brundtland Commission was first headed by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] as Chairman and [[Mansour Khalid]] as Vice-Chairman.

The organization aimed to create a united international community with shared sustainability goals by identifying sustainability problems worldwide, raising awareness about them, and suggesting the implementation of solutions. In 1987, the Brundtland Commission published the first volume of “[[Our Common Future]],” the organization’s main report. “[[Our Common Future]]” strongly influenced the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 and the third UN Conference on Environment and Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002. Also, it is credited with crafting the most prevalent definition of sustainability, as seen below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623004236/http://oregonfuture.oregonstate.edu/part1/pf1_03.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 June 2010|title=This Norwegian's past may connect with your future|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events before Brundtland===

During the 1980s it had been revealed that the [[World Bank]] had started to experience an expanded role in intervening with the economic and social policies of the [[Third World]]. This was most notable through the events at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1945. The ideas of [[neoliberalism]] and the institutions promoting [[economic globalization]] dominated the political agenda of the world's then leading trading nations: the United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] and the United Kingdom under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], both classical liberals.

These events led into an era of [[free market]]s built on a distortion of the international order forged in 1945 at Bretton Woods. Bretton Woods was transformed through the 1980s and 1990s, finally ending in 1995 with the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]] ushered in by United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Bretton Woods was formed as an arrangement among the industrialized nation states, but was transformed into a global regime of ostensibly free markets that privileged [[multinational corporations]] and actually undermined the [[sovereignty]] of the very national communities that established Bretton Woods.

The Brundtland Report was intended as a response to the conflict between the nascent order promoting globalized economic growth and the accelerating ecological degradation occurring on a global scale. The challenge posed in the 1980s was to harmonize prosperity with ecology. This postulated finding the means to continue economic growth without undue harm to the environment. To address the urgent needs of developing countries (Third World), the United Nations saw a need to strike a better balance of human and environmental well-being. This was to be achieved by redefining the concepts of "economic development" as the new idea of "sustainable development" - as it was called in the Brundtland Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|title=ProfWork / PreludeToBrundtland|work=pbworks.com|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118221135/http://worldsustainability.pbworks.com/w/page/15443575/PreludeToBrundtland|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand this paradigm shift, we start with the meaning of the key term: development

===Resolution establishing the Commission===

The 1983 [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] passed Resolution 38/161 "Process of preparation of the Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and Beyond", establishing the Commission.&lt;ref name="estabRes"/&gt; In A/RES/38/161, the General Assembly:

:"8. Suggests that the Special Commission, when established, should focus mainly on the following terms of reference for its work:

::(a) To propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development to the year 2000 and beyond;

::(b) To recommend ways in which concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation among developing countries and between countries at different stages of economic and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives which take account of the interrelationships between people, resources, environment and development;

::(c) To consider ways and means by which the international community can deal more effectively with environmental concerns, in the light of the other recommendations in its report;

::(d) To help to define shared perceptions of long-term environmental issues and of the appropriate efforts needed to deal successfully with the problems of protecting and enhancing the environment, a long-term agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspirational goals for the world community, taking into account the relevant resolutions of the session of a special character of the Governing Council in 1982;"&lt;ref name="estabRes"&gt;United Nations. 1983.

==Modern definition of sustainable development==
{{Main|Sustainable development}}
The Brundtland Commission draws upon several notions in its definition of [[sustainable development]], which is the most frequently cited definition of the concept to date.

A key element in the definition is the unity of environment and development. The Brundtland Commission argues against the assertions of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and provides an alternative perspective on sustainable development, unique from that of the 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The Brundtland Commission pushed for the idea that while the "environment" was previously perceived as a sphere separate from human emotion or action, and while "development" was a term habitually used to describe political goals or economic progress, it is more comprehensive to understand the two terms in relation to each other (We can better understand the environment in relation to development and we can better understand development in relation to the environment, because they cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities). Brundtland argues:

"...the "environment" is where we live; and "development" is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable."

The Brundtland Commission insists upon the environment being something beyond physicality, going beyond that traditional school of thought to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances. It also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation, but what the entire world, including developed countries, can do to ameliorate our common situation.

The term sustainable development was coined in the paper ''Our Common Future'', released by the Brundtland Commission.
Sustainable development is the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The two key concepts of sustainable development are:
• the concept of "needs" in particular the essential needs of the world's poorest people, to which they should be given overriding priority; and
• the idea of limitations which is imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet both present and future needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|title=Environment Magazine - What Is Sustainable Development? Goals, Indicators, Values, and Practice|first=Environment Magazine - Taylor and|last=Francis|work=environmentmagazine.org|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118214557/http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Editorials/Kates-apr05-full.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agree that the central idea of the Brundtland Commission's definition of "sustainable development" is that of intergenerational equity. In sum, the "needs" are basic and essential, economic growth will facilitate their fulfillment, and equity is encouraged by citizen participation. Therefore, another characteristic that really sets this definition apart from others is the element of humanity that the Brundtland Commission integrates.

The particular ambiguity and openness-to-interpretation of this definition has allowed for widespread support from diverse efforts, groups and organizations. However, this has also been a criticism; perceived by some notable commentators as "self-defeating and compromised rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;Manns, .J., "Beyond Brudtland's Compromise", Town &amp; Country Planning, August 2010, pp.337-340 {{cite web |url=http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416182659/http://www.tcpa.org.uk/resources.php?action=resource&amp;id=900 |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It nonetheless lays out a core set of guiding principles that can be enriched by an evolving global discourse. As a result of the work of the Brundtland Commission, the issue of sustainable development is on the agenda of numerous international and national institutions, as well as corporations and city efforts. The definition gave light to new perspectives on the sustainability of an ever-changing planet with an ever-changing population.

-Brundtland commission
(Our Common Future)
The Report of the Brundtland Commission, Our Common Future, was published by Oxford University Press in 1987, and was welcomed by the General Assembly Resolution 42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987. One version with links to cited documents Our Common Future, Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987. Published as Annex to General Assembly document A/42/427, Development and International Co-operation is available.

The document was the culmination of a “900-day” international-exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from “senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public” held at public hearings throughout the world.

The Brundtland Commission's mandate was to: “[1] re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concrete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; [2] strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and [3] raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governments” (1987: 347). “The Commission focused its attention on the areas of population, food security, the loss of species and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another” (1987: 27).

The Brundtland Commission Report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction, gender equity, and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation, and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed. As such, the Report offered “the analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development” within such societies (1987:16). However, the Report was unable to identify the mode(s) of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment, and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth, the Report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded; this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development.

The report deals with sustainable development and the change of politics needed for achieving it. The definition of this term in the report is quite well known and often cited:

:"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". It contains two key concepts:
:*the concept of "needs", in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and
:*the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs."

The Brundtland Commission was chaired by former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Politicians, civil servants, and environmental experts make up the majority of the members. Members of the commission represent 21 different nations (both developed and developing countries are included). Many of the members are important political figures in their home country. One example is [[William Ruckelshaus]], former head of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. All members of the commission were appointed by both Gro Harlem Brundtland and [[Mansour Khalid]], the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

The commission focuses on setting up networks to promote environmental stewardship. Most of these networks make connections between governments and non-government entities. One such network is Bill Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development. In this council government and business leaders come together to share ideas on how to encourage sustainable development. The Brundtland Commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations. The 1992 and 2002 [[Earth Summit]]s were the direct result of the Brundtland Commission. The international structure and scope of the Brundtland Commission allow multiple problems (such as [[deforestation]] and [[ozone depletion]]) to be looked at from a holistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=17 April 2012|website=archive.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131934/http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd15/media/backgrounder_brundtland.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability efforts==
The three main pillars of sustainable development include economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. While many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainability, it is difficult to find evidence of equal levels of initiatives for the three pillars in countries' policies worldwide. With the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development, it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffering, especially with the overall well being of the environment in a dangerously unhealthy state. The Brundtland Commission has put forth a conceptual framework that many nations agree with and want to try to make a difference with in their countries, but it has been difficult to change these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs. Implementing sustainable development globally is still a challenge, but because of the Brundtland Commission's efforts, progress has been made. After releasing their report, ''Our Common Future'', the Brundtland Commission called for an international meeting to take place where more concrete initiatives and goals could be mapped out. This meeting was held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. A comprehensive plan of action, known as [[Agenda&amp;nbsp;21]], came out of the meeting. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 entailed actions to be taken globally, nationally, and locally in order to make life on Earth more sustainable going into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405221844/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/index.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=5 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic Growth===
Economic Growth is the pillar that most groups focus on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development. In trying to build their economies, many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction, which leads to unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainability. While the Commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction, the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase in the future. So much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focus cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability. Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 reinforces the importance of finding ways to generate economic growth without hurting the environment. Through various trade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries, Agenda&amp;nbsp;21 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408182141/http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_02.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 April 2012|title=DSD :: Resources - Publications - Core Publications|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Protection===
Environmental Protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20&amp;nbsp;years, leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies. For the second year in a row in 2010, the United States and Europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar. In 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118220031/http://www.awea.org/learnabout/publications/reports/upload/3Q-2011-AWEA-Market-Report-for-Public.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well, including a great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity. Eco-city development occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation, smart grids with renewable energy sources, LED street lights and energy efficient building. The consumption gap remains, consisting of the fact that "roughly 80 percent of the natural resources used each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the world's population". This level is striking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321094820/http://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/gsp/docs/GSP1-6_Background%20on%20Sustainable%20Devt.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Equality===
The Social Equality and Equity as pillars of sustainable development focus on the social well-being of people. The growing gap between incomes of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households.This is attributed partly to the land distribution patterns in rural areas where majority live from land. Global inequality has been declining, but the world is still extremely unequal, with the richest 1% of the world’s population owning 40% of the world’s wealth and the poorest 50% owning around 1%. The Brundtland Commission made a significant impact trying to link environment and development and thus, go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake. The Commission has thus reduced the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be, as many can approach the environment and use it.These achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2893">The '''Canadian Ecology Centre (CEC)''' is an [[outdoor education]] complex located within [[Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park]], near the town of [[Mattawa, Ontario]].

== Basic Description ==
The Canadian Ecology Centre site consists of a main building and several smaller cabins on a tract of land within Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park. The CEC is a non-profit organization and was initially supported by proponents within the [[logging]] and [[wood]] industries, such as [[Tembec]], as well as by various levels of government, [[NGO]]s, and public donors to get the Centre off the ground. The CEC facilities, while contemporary in both age and design, are constructed almost entirely out of wood.

The CEC is primarily an educational and research centre, where courses on a wide variety of subjects ranging from local culture and history to biology and science to forestry management and mining are offered to the public. The site is also equipped with high-speed internet access, and can be rented out as a wedding venue, conference or meeting centre. Cabins can also be rented for a nightly rate as an alternative to "tenting it" in the park.

The centre, like much of the surrounding communities, is almost fully [[bilingual]] and offers most programs in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

The CEC is also the  headquarters  for the [[Canadian Institute of Forestry]].

== High School Credit Courses ==
By far the best-known aspect of the CEC, however, is Eco-Camp, which is a summer program offering academic credit to high school students. Formal two-week courses in subjects such as Science, Biology, Environmental Science and Geography are available. The program is residential, and students live on-site for the duration. The most popular programs, a grade 11 and 12 biology courses, are almost invariably booked solid even with two back-to-back offerings of the course.

== Professional Development and Teacher Tours ==
The CEC offers a variety of Professional Development opportunities throughout the year, including the summer months.  Take part in single or multi-day programs that are designed and developed to provide hands-on, informative and engaging learning opportunities as well as opportunities to network with professionals and receive great resources and experiences that will transform and enhance career goals and personal development.

Training and certifications are available for professionals in a variety of fields and areas of interest.

'''Carl J. Hudecek''' (born December 3, 1934) is an American, internationally known expert on [[glass-to-metal seal|sealing glasses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Techneglas maintains cutting edge in glass technology |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5333/is_199811/ai_n21433307/ |work=Toledo Business Journal |date=November 1, 1998 |accessdate=July 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[expansion joint|metal expansion and contraction]], and [[oxidation state|metal oxidation]] processes for glass sealing. Hudecek holds or co-holds many U.S. and international patents in sealing glasses, television picture [[vacuum tube|tube]] materials and processing, and sealing [[alloy]]s.

Hudecek was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} He is from [[Perrysburg, Ohio]] and graduated from the [[University of Toledo]].&lt;ref name=ACBL&gt;{{cite book |author=[[American Contract Bridge League]]|title=The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge (5th Edition)|page=651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of his working career was spent at [[Owens-Illinois]] Glass Company in Toledo, where he was chief physicist and laboratory manager. Hudecek was one of the U.S. pioneers in designing and installing [[turnkey]] [[manufacturing operations]] for sealing glasses in Russia and Germany. Through his consulting company, [[Perrysburg, Ohio|Perrysburg]], Ohio-based Bridgecon Services, Hudecek consults in the area of sealing glasses. He has also taught courses on sealing and joining at [[Rutgers University]] and [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|Missouri School of Mines]].

In addition, Hudecek is an expert at the game of [[contract bridge]]. He won the national [[American Contract Bridge League]] [[Nail Life Master Open Pairs|Life Master Open Pairs]] championship in 1966, partnered by Ray Zoller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bridge:; Ohio Partnership Wins Life Master Men's Pairs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/11/24/archives/bridge-ohio-partnership-wins-life-master-mens-pairs.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 24, 1966 |accessdate=July 31, 2009 | first=Alan | last=Truscott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudecek has been a member of the panel of experts for ''[[The Bridge World]]'' magazine for more than 45 years and has written many bridge articles and commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d%3Dtbw_extra%26f%3Darchive_edition008.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019001632/http://www.bridgeworld.com/default.asp?d=tbw_extra&amp;f=archive_edition008.html |archivedate=2007-10-19 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;!--served as file archive_edition008.html but appears to be current; e.g. the current bidding contest--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

'''Cryptochromes''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κρυπτός χρώμα, "hidden colour") are a class of [[flavoproteins]] that are sensitive to [[Visible spectrum#Spectral colors|blue light]]. They are found in [[plants]] and [[animal]]s. Cryptochromes are involved in the [[circadian rhythm]]s of plants and animals, and possibly also in the [[magnetoception|sensing of magnetic fields]] in a number of species. The name ''cryptochrome'' was proposed as a ''[[portmanteau]]'' combining the cryptic nature of the photoreceptor, and the [[cryptogam]]ic organisms on which many blue-light studies were carried out.&lt;ref name="Gressel_1979"/&gt;

The two [[gene]]s ''Cry1'' and ''Cry2'' code for the two cryptochrome [[protein]]s [[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]].&lt;ref name="van_der_Spek_1996"/&gt; In [[insects]] and plants, CRY1 regulates the [[circadian clock]] in a light-dependent fashion, whereas, in [[mammals]], CRY1 and CRY2 act as light-independent inhibitors of [[CLOCK]]-[[ARNTL|BMAL1]] components of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name="Griffin_1999"/&gt; In plants, blue-light photoreception can be used to cue developmental signals.&lt;ref name="Brautigam_2004"/&gt; Besides chlorophylls, cryptochromes are the only proteins known to form photoinduced radical-pairs in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hore|first=P.

Although [[Charles Darwin]] first documented plant responses to blue light in the 1880s, it was not until the 1980s that research began to identify the pigment responsible.&lt;ref name="Darwin_1881"/&gt; In 1980, researchers discovered that the HY4 gene of the plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' was necessary for the plant's blue light sensitivity, and, when the gene was sequenced in 1993, it showed high sequence homology with [[photolyase]], a DNA repair protein activated by blue light.&lt;ref name=Ahmad_1993 /&gt; By 1995, it became clear that the products of the HY4 gene and its two human [[homology (biology)|homologs]] did not exhibit photolyase activity and were instead a new class of blue light photoreceptor hypothesized to be circadian [[photopigment]]s.&lt;ref name="Thompson_2004"/&gt; In 1996 and 1998, ''Cry'' homologs were identified in ''[[Drosophila]]'' and [[mouse|mice]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Todo_1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kobayashi_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kobayashi K, Kanno S, Smit B, van der Horst GT, Takao M, Yasui A | title = Characterization of photolyase/blue-light receptor homologs in mouse and human cells | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 26 | issue = 22 | pages = 5086–92 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9801304 | pmc = 147960 | doi = 10.1093/nar/26.22.5086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary history and structure ==

Cryptochromes (CRY1, CRY2) are evolutionarily old and highly conserved proteins that belong to the flavoproteins superfamily that exists in all kingdoms of life.&lt;ref name="Brautigam_2004"/&gt; All members of this superfamily have the characteristics of an [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] [[DNA photolyase (protein domain)|photolyase homology]] (PHR) domain. The PHR domain can bind to the [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD) [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] and a light-harvesting [[chromophore]].&lt;ref name="Brautigam_2004"/&gt; Cryptochromes are derived from and closely related to [[photolyase]]s, which are bacterial enzymes that are activated by light and involved in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. In eukaryotes, cryptochromes no longer retain this original enzymatic activity.&lt;ref name="Weber_2005"/&gt;
The structure of cryptochrome involves a fold very similar to that of photolyase, with a single molecule of FAD noncovalently bound to the protein.&lt;ref name="Brautigam_2004"/&gt; These proteins have variable lengths and surfaces on the C-terminal end, due to the changes in genome and appearance that result from the lack of DNA repair enzymes. The [[Ramachandran plot]]&lt;ref name="urlwww.rcsb.org"/&gt; shows that the [[secondary structure]] of the CRY1 protein is primarily a right-handed [[alpha helix]] with little to no steric overlap.&lt;ref name="Lehninger_2005"/&gt;  The structure of CRY1 is almost entirely made up of alpha helices, with several loops and few [[beta sheets]]. The molecule is arranged as an orthogonal bundle.&lt;ref name="Brautigam_2004"/&gt;

== Function ==

=== Phototropism ===

In plants, cryptochromes mediate [[phototropism]], or directional growth toward a light source, in response to blue light. This response is now known to have its own set of photoreceptors, the [[phototropin]]s.

Unlike [[phytochrome]]s and phototropins, cryptochromes are not [[kinases]]. Their [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|flavin]] chromophore is reduced by light and transported into the [[cell (biology)|cell]] [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it affects the [[turgor pressure]] and causes subsequent stem elongation. To be specific, ''Cry2'' is responsible for blue-light-mediated [[cotyledon]] and leaf expansion. ''Cry2'' overexpression in [[transgenic]] plants increases blue-light-stimulated cotyledon expansion, which results in many broad leaves and no flowers rather than a few primary leaves with a flower.&lt;ref name="Hsu_1996" /&gt; A double loss-of-function mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana Early Flowering 3 (elf3) and Cry2 genes delays flowering under continuous light and was shown to accelerate it during long and short days, which suggests that Arabidopsis CRY2 may play a role in accelerating flowering time during continuous light.&lt;ref name="Nefissi_2011" /&gt;

=== Photomorphogenesis ===

Cryptochromes receptors cause plants to respond to blue light via [[photomorphogenesis]]. Cryptochromes help control seed and seedling development, as well as the switch from the vegetative to the flowering stage of development. In [[Arabidopsis]], it is shown that cryptochromes controls plant growth during sub-optimal blue-light conditions.&lt;ref name = "Pedmale_2016"/&gt;

=== Light capture ===

Despite much research on the topic, cryptochrome [[photoreception]] and [[phototransduction]] in ''[[Drosophila]]'' and ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' is still poorly understood. Cryptochromes are known to possess two chromophores: [[pterin]] (in the form of [[5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid]] (MTHF)) and flavin (in the form of FAD).&lt;ref name="Song_2006"/&gt; Both may absorb a [[photon]], and in ''Arabidopsis'', pterin appears to absorb at a wavelength of 380&amp;nbsp;nm and flavin at 450&amp;nbsp;nm. Past studies have supported a model by which energy captured by pterin is transferred to flavin.&lt;ref name="Hoang_2008a"/&gt; Under this model of phototransduction, FAD would then be [[redox|reduced]] to FADH, which probably mediates the [[phosphorylation]] of a certain domain in cryptochrome. This could then trigger a [[signal transduction]] chain, possibly affecting [[gene regulation]] in the cell nucleus.

A new hypothesis&lt;ref name="Muller_2015a"/&gt; proposes that in plant cryptochromes, the transduction of the light signal into a chemical signal that might be sensed by partner molecules could be triggered by a photo-induced negative charge within the protein - on the FAD cofactor or on the neighbouring aspartic acid.&lt;ref name="Muller_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cailliez_2014"/&gt; This negative charge would electrostatically repel the protein-bound [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecule and thereby also the protein C-terminal domain, which covers the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] binding pocket prior to photon absorption. The resulting change in protein conformation could lead to phosphorylation of previously inaccessible phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus and the given phosphorylated segment could then liberate the transcription factor HY5 by competing for the same binding site at the negative regulator of photomorphogenesis [[COP1]].

A different mechanism may function in ''Drosophila''. The true ground state of the flavin cofactor in ''Drosophila'' CRY is still debated, with some models indicating that the FAD is in an oxidized form,&lt;ref name = "Berndt_2007"/&gt; while others support a model in which the flavin cofactor exists in [[anion]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] form, {{chem|FAD|-}}•. Recently, researchers have observed that oxidized FAD is readily reduced to {{chem|FAD|-}}• by light. Furthermore, mutations that blocked photoreduction had no effect on light-induced degradation of CRY, while mutations that altered the stability of {{chem|FAD|-}}• destroyed CRY photoreceptor function.&lt;ref name="Song_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2008"/&gt; These observations provide support for a ground state of {{chem|FAD|-}}•. Researchers have also recently proposed a model in which {{chem|FAD|-}} is excited to its [[doublet state|doublet]] or quartet state by absorption of a photon, which then leads to a conformational change in the CRY protein.&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2011"/&gt;

In [[sponge]] eyes, blue-light-receptive cryptochrome is also expressed. Most animal eyes utilize photo-sensitive [[opsin]] proteins expressed in neurons to communicate information of the light environment to the nervous system, whereas sponge larvae use pigment ring eyes to mediate phototactic swimming. However, despite possessing many other [[G-protein-coupled receptors]] (GPCRs), the fully sequenced genome of ''Amphimedon queenslandica'', a [[demosponge]] larva, apparently lacks a gene for a light-sensitive opsin pigment, suggesting that the sponge's unique eyes might have evolved a novel light-detection mechanism. Research using RNA probes indicated that one of the two cryptochromes, Aq-Cry2, was produced near the sponge's simple eye cells. Aq-Cry2 lacks photolyase activity and contains a flavin-based co-factor that is responsive to wavelengths of light that also mediate larval photic behavior. Defined as an opsin-clade GPCR, it possesses a conserved Shiff base lysine that is central to opsin function. Like other sponges, ''A. queenslandica'' lacks a nervous system. This indicates that opsin-less sponge eyes utilize cryptochrome, along with other proteins, to direct or act in eye-mediated phototactic behavior.&lt;ref name = "Rivera_2012"/&gt;

=== Circadian rhythm ===

Studies in animals and plants suggest that cryptochromes play a pivotal role in the generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms.&lt;ref name="Klarsfeld_2004"/&gt; Similarly, cryptochromes play an important role in the entrainment of circadian rhythms in plants.&lt;ref name="Somers_1998"/&gt; In ''Drosophila'', cryptochrome (dCRY) acts as a blue-light photoreceptor that directly modulates light input into the circadian clock,&lt;ref name="Emery_2000"/&gt; while in mammals, cryptochromes (CRY1 and CRY2) act as [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] [[repressor]]s within the circadian clockwork.&lt;ref name="Reppert_2002"/&gt; Some insects, including the [[monarch butterfly]], have both a mammal-like and a ''Drosophila''-like version of cryptochrome, providing evidence for an ancestral clock mechanism involving both light-sensing and transcriptional-repression roles for cryptochrome.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2008a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhu_2008b"/&gt;

''Cry'' [[mutant]]s have altered circadian rhythms, showing that ''Cry'' affects the circadian pacemaker. ''Drosophila'' with mutated ''Cry'' exhibit little to no mRNA cycling.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; A point mutation in ''cry&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;,'' which is required for flavin association in CRY protein, results in no PER or TIM protein cycling in either DD or LD.&lt;ref name="Stanewsky_1998"/&gt; In addition, mice lacking ''Cry1'' or ''Cry2'' genes exhibit differentially altered free running periods, but are still capable of [[photoentrainment]]. However, mice that lack both ''Cry1'' and ''Cry2'' are arrhythmic in both LD and DD and always have high [[PER1|Per1]] mRNA levels. These results suggest that cryptochromes play a photoreceptive role, as well as acting as negative regulators of Per gene expression in mice.&lt;ref name="Vitaterna_1999"/&gt;

==== In ''Drosophila'' ====

In ''Drosophila'', cryptochrome functions as a blue light photoreceptor. Exposure to blue light induces a conformation similar to that of the always-active CRY mutant with a C-terminal deletion (CRYΔ).&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2011"/&gt; The half-life of this conformation is 15 minutes in the dark and facilitates the binding of CRY to other clock gene products, PER and [[timeless (gene)|TIM]], in a light-dependent manner.&lt;ref name="Griffin_1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emery_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Busza_2004"/&gt; Once bound by dCRY, dTIM is committed to degradation by the ubiquitin-[[proteasome]] system.&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Busza_2004"/&gt;

Although light pulses do not entrain, full photoperiod LD cycles can still drive cycling in the [[ventral]]-[[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] neurons in the ''Drosophila'' brain. These data along with other results suggest that CRY is the cell-autonomous photoreceptor for body clocks in ''Drosophila'' and may play a role in nonparametric entrainment (entrainment by short discrete light pulses). However, the lateral neurons receive light information through both the blue light CRY pathway and the [[rhodopsin]] pathway. Therefore, CRY is involved in light perception and is an input to the circadian clock, however it is not the only input for light information, as a sustained rhythm has been shown in the absence of the CRY pathway, in which it is believed that the rhodopsin pathway is providing some light input.&lt;ref name="Dunlap_1999"/&gt; Recently, it has also been shown that there is a CRY-mediated light response that is independent of the classical circadian CRY-TIM interaction. This mechanism is believed to require a flavin [[redox]]-based mechanism that is dependent on potassium channel conductance. This CRY-mediated light response has been shown to increase [[action potential]] firing within seconds of a light response in [[opsin]]-knockout ''Drosophila''.&lt;ref name="Fogle_2011"/&gt;

Cryptochrome, like many genes involved in circadian rhythm, shows circadian cycling in [[mRNA]] and protein levels. In ''Drosophila'', ''Cry'' mRNA concentrations cycle under a light-dark cycle (LD), with high levels in light and low levels in the dark.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; This cycling persists in constant darkness (DD), but with decreased amplitude.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; The transcription of the ''Cry'' gene also cycles with a similar trend.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; CRY protein levels, however, cycle in a different manner than ''Cry'' transcription and mRNA levels. In LD, CRY protein has low levels in light and high levels in dark, and, in DD, CRY levels increase continuously throughout the subjective day and night.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; Thus, CRY expression is regulated by the clock at the transcriptional level and by light at the [[Translation (biology)|translational]] and posttranslational level.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt;

Overexpression of ''Cry'' also affects circadian light responses. In ''Drosophila'', ''Cry'' overexpression increases flies' sensitivity to low-intensity light.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; This light regulation of CRY protein levels suggests that CRY has a circadian role upstream of other clock genes and components.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt;

==== In mammals ====

Cryptochrome is one of the four groups of mammalian clock genes/proteins that generate a transcription-translation negative-feedback loop (TTFL), along with [[Period (gene)|Period (PER)]], CLOCK, and BMAL1.&lt;ref name="Sancar_2010"/&gt; In this loop, CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins are [[transcriptional activators]], which together bind to the [[promoter (biology)|promoters]] of the ''Cry'' and ''Per'' genes and activate their transcription.&lt;ref name="Sancar_2010"/&gt; The CRY and PER proteins then bind to each other, enter the nucleus, and inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1-activated transcription.&lt;ref name="Sancar_2010"/&gt;

In mice, ''Cry1'' expression displays circadian rhythms in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]], a brain region involved in the generation of circadian rhythms, with mRNA levels peaking during the light phase and reaching a minimum in the dark.&lt;ref name="Miyamoto_1998"/&gt; These daily oscillations in expression are maintained in constant darkness.&lt;ref name="Miyamoto_1998"/&gt;

While CRY has been well established as a TIM homolog in mammals, the role of CRY as a photoreceptor in mammals has been controversial. Early papers indicated that CRY has both light-independent and -dependent functions. A study in 2000 indicated that mice without rhodopsin but with cryptochrome still respond to light; however, in mice without either rhodopsin or cryptochrome, ''[[c-Fos]]'' transcription, a mediator of light sensitivity, significantly drops.&lt;ref name="Selby_2000"/&gt; In recent years, data have supported [[melanopsin]] as the main circadian photoreceptor, in particular melanopsin cells that mediate entrainment and communication between the [[eye]] and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).&lt;ref name="Hattar_2002"/&gt; One of the main difficulties in confirming or denying CRY as a mammalian photoreceptor is that when the gene is knocked out the animal goes arrhythmic, so it is hard to measure its capacity as purely a photoreceptor. However, some recent studies indicate that human CRY may mediate light response in peripheral tissues.&lt;ref name="Hoang_2008b"/&gt;

Normal mammalian circadian rhythm relies critically on delayed expression of ''Cry1'' following activation of the ''Cry1'' promoter. Whereas rhythms in ''Per2'' promoter activation and ''Per2'' mRNA levels have almost the same phase, ''Cry1'' mRNA production is delayed by approximately four hours relative to ''Cry1'' promoter activation.&lt;ref name="Sato_2006" /&gt; This delay is independent of CRY1 or CRY2 levels and is mediated by a combination of [[E-box|E/E'-box]] and D-box elements in the promoter and [[Rev-ErbA|RevErbA]]/[[RAR-related orphan receptor|ROR]] binding elements (RREs) in the gene's first intron.&lt;ref name="Ukai-Tadenuma_2011" /&gt; [[Transfection]] of arrhythmic ''Cry1''&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; ''Cry2''&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; double-knockout cells with only the ''Cry1'' promoter (causing constitutive ''Cry1'' expression) is not sufficient to rescue rhythmicity. Transfection of these cells with both the promoter and the first intron is required for restoration of circadian rhythms in these cells.&lt;ref name="Ukai-Tadenuma_2011" /&gt;

=== Magnetoreception ===

{{Main|Magnetoreception}}

Experimental data suggests that cryptochromes in the [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor neurons]] of birds' eyes are involved in magnetic orientation during [[bird migration|migration]].&lt;ref name="Heyers_2007"/&gt; Cryptochromes are also thought to be essential for the light-dependent ability of ''[[Drosophila]]'' to sense [[magnetic fields]].&lt;ref name="Gegear_2008"/&gt; Magnetic fields were once reported to affect cryptochromes also in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' plants: growth behavior seemed to be affected by magnetic fields in the presence of blue (but not red) light.&lt;ref name="Ahmad_2007"/&gt; Nevertheless, these results have later turned out to be irreproducible under strictly controlled conditions in another laboratory,&lt;ref name="Harris_2009"/&gt; suggesting that plant cryptochromes do not respond to magnetic fields.

Cryptochrome forms a pair of [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]s with correlated [[spin (physics)|spin]]s when exposed to blue light.&lt;ref name="Rodgers_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biskup_2009"/&gt; Radical pairs can also be generated by the light-independent dark reoxidation of the flavin cofactor by molecular oxygen through the formation of a spin-correlated FADH-superoxide radical pairs.&lt;ref name="Muller_2011"/&gt; Magnetoreception is hypothesized to function through the surrounding magnetic field's effect on the correlation (parallel or anti-parallel) of these radicals, which affects the lifetime of the activated form of cryptochrome. Activation of cryptochrome may affect the light-sensitivity of [[retina]]l neurons, with the overall result that the animal can "see" the magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Chandler_2011"/&gt; Animal cryptochromes and closely related animal (6-4) photolyases contain a longer chain of electron-transferring tryptophans than other proteins of the cryptochrome-photolyase superfamily (a tryptophan tetrad instead of a triad).&lt;ref name="Muller_2015b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cailliez_2016"/&gt; The longer chain leads to a better separation and over 1000× longer lifetimes of the photoinduced flavin-tryptophan radical pairs than in proteins with a mere triad of tryptophans.&lt;ref name="Muller_2015b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cailliez_2016"/&gt; The absence of spin-selective recombination of these radical pairs on the nanosecond to microsecond timescales seems to be incompatible with the suggestion that magnetoreception by cryptochromes is based on the forward light reaction.

The '''Dalle Molle Institute for Semantic and Cognitive Studies''' ({{lang-it|'''Istituto Dalle Molle per gli studi semantici e cognitivi'''|italic=no}}, '''ISSCO''') is a [[research institute]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. It was founded in [[Lugano]] in 1972 by [[Angelo Dalle Molle]] through the [[Fondation Dalle Molle]] to conduct research into the application of [[artificial intelligence]] to [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]] and [[semantics]] with the aim of developing systems for [[automated translation]]. Since 1976 it has been a part of the {{lang|fr|Faculté de traduction et d'interprétation}}, the faculty of translation and interpreting, of the [[University of Geneva]].&lt;ref name=ach&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dallemolle.ch/en/the-foundation/achievements | title = Achievements | publisher = Fondation Dalle Molle | accessdate = 9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=issco&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dallemolle.ch/en/the-foundation/achievements | title = ISSCO - Dalle Molle Institute for Semantic and Cognitive Studies | publisher = Fondation Dalle Molle | accessdate = 9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISSCO is one of four Swiss research organisations founded by the Dalle Molle foundation, of which three are in the field of artificial intelligence.

'''[[Defeminization]] and [[masculinization]]''' are the processes that a fetus goes through to become a male. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

It has often been said by biologists that in [[sexual differentiation]] in [[mammals]], the female is the "default" developmental pathway, in the sense that elimination of any of several gene actions necessary for formation of male genitalia leads to the development of external female genitalia (though development of functional ovaries requires effective action of several less understood sex-specific genes). {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Two processes: [[defeminization]], and [[masculinization]], are involved in producing [[male]] typical morphology and behavior.  Disruption of either of these processes in males produces female-typical development. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The opposite is not true; disruption of normal sexual development in females does not lead to male-typical endpoints. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Defeminization]] involves the suppression of the development of female typical morphology (development of the [[Müllerian ducts]] into the fallopian tubes, uterus and [[vagina]]) and behavioural predispositions.  [[Masculinization]] involves the production of male typical morphology (development of the [[Wolffian ducts]] into male reproductive structures) and behavioural predispositions.  Both defeminization and masculinization are required for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male.

A brief version of the female default paradigm can be stated as follows:

#A set of specific genetic instructions must be present and a series of differentiating events mediated by hormones must occur in order for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male.
##The [[Y chromosome]], [[SRY]], [[SOX9]], and SF1 genes must be present and functional.
##Functional [[Leydig cell]]s must form in the [[gonad]]s.
##The Leydig cells must be able to produce [[testosterone]].
##The target cells must have the [[hormone receptor]]s to respond to the testosterone. The target cells of the [[external genitalia]] must have functional [[5-alpha-reductase]] enzyme to convert some of the testosterone to more active [[dihydrotestosterone]].
##There is some evidence that the brain must be exposed and respond to [[androgen]]s either prenatally or early in life to produce characteristic mating behavior. This is well demonstrated in many animal species but remains mostly speculative with respect to humans.
#To a large extent, each step builds on the previous. If anything goes wrong at any of the first four steps, the subsequent pathway of development results in female anatomy and behavior.
#No [[ovary|ovarian]] organizing gene [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to SRY has been discovered. Both sexes are exposed to maternal estrogen prenatally. No hormones have yet been discovered that are necessary early in life to produce female sexual development. [[Estrogen]] seems not to be necessary until puberty for purposes of differentiation.
##The full development of male characteristics also includes personal experience throughout life, determining [[gender identity]], [[gender roles]] and [[sexual orientation]]. However, there is much debate on the balance between [[nature and nurture]] in the determination.

==History==
This paradigm dates back to the 1950s. Even stronger versions were commonly stated in the 1960s and 1970s. One version, perhaps most associated with [[John Money]], (who termed it the ''Adam principle''), held that additional steps in the cascade to male identity were the recognition by parents and doctor that the external genitalia were male, which resulted in a male [[sex assignment]], which in turn resulted in a male [[sex of rearing]] by parents and society, which in turn (coupled with the reinforcing appearance of male genitalia) resulted in a male gender identity. At least by implication, female gender identity simply required a female sex of rearing and lack of an obvious penis.

In Germany in the 1970s, [[Günter Dörner]] extrapolated the cascade to include direct testosterone effect on the brain as necessary for a male gender identity and [[sexual orientation]], proposing that [[transsexualism]] and or [[homosexuality]] in biological males could result from deficiency of prenatal or early postnatal testosterone effect on the brain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10443">In [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] [[semiconductor]] manufacturing, the process of '''Design Closure''' is a part of the development workflow by which an [[integrated circuit]] design is modified from its initial description to meet a growing list of design constraints and objectives.

Every step in the IC design (such as [[static timing analysis]], [[Placement (EDA)|placement]], [[Routing (EDA)|routing]], and so on) is already complex and often forms its own field of study.  This article, however, looks at the overall design closure process, which takes a chip from its initial design state to the final form in which all of its design constraints are met.

== Introduction ==
Every chip starts off as someone’s idea of a good thing: "If we can make a part that performs function X, we will all be rich!" Once the concept is established, someone from marketing says "To make this chip profitably, it must cost $C and run at frequency F." Someone from manufacturing says "To meet this chip’s targets, it must have a yield of Y%." Someone from packaging says “It must fit in the P package and dissipate no more than W watts.” Eventually, the team generates an extensive list of all the constraints and objectives they must meet to manufacture a product that can be sold profitably. The management then forms a design team, which consists of chip architects, logic designers, functional verification engineers, physical designers, and timing engineers, and assigns them to create a chip to the specifications.

=== Constraints vs Objectives ===
The distinction between constraints and objectives is straightforward: a constraint is a design target that must be met for the design to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a chip may be required to run at a specific frequency so it can interface with other components in a system. In contrast, an objective is a design target where more
(or less) is better. For example, yield is generally an objective, which is maximized to lower manufacturing cost. For the purposes of design closure, the distinction between constraints and objectives is not important; this article uses the words interchangeably.

== Evolution of the Design Closure Flow ==
Designing a chip used to be a much simpler task. In the early days of VLSI, a chip consisted of a few thousand logic circuits that performed a simple function at speeds of a few MHz. Design closure was simple: if all of the necessary circuits and wires "fit", the chip would perform the desired function.

Modern design closure has grown orders of magnitude more complex. Modern logic chips can have tens to hundreds of millions of logic elements switching at speeds of several
GHz. This improvement has been driven by [[Moore’s law]] of scaling of technology, and has introduced many new design considerations. As a result, a modern VLSI designer must consider the performance of a chip against a list of dozens of design constraints and objectives including performance, power, [[signal integrity]], reliability, and yield.  In response to this growing list of constraints, the design closure flow has evolved from a simple linear list of tasks to a very complex, highly iterative flow such as the following simplified ASIC design flow:

== Reference ASIC Design Flow ==
*Concept phase: Functional objectives and architecture of a chip are developed.
*Logic design: Architecture is implemented in a register transfer level (RTL) language, then simulated to verify that it performs the desired functions. This includes [[functional verification]].
*Floorplanning: The RTL of the chip is assigned to gross regions of the chip, input/output (I/O) pins are assigned and large objects (arrays, cores, etc.) are placed.
*[[Logic synthesis]]:  The RTL is mapped into a gate-level netlist in the target technology of the chip.
*[[Design for Testability]]: The test structures like scan chains are inserted.
*[[Placement (EDA)|Placement]]:  The gates in the netlist are assigned to nonoverlapping locations on the chip.
*Logic/placement refinement: Iterative logical and placement transformations to close performance and power constraints.
*[[Clock Distribution Networks|Clock insertion]]: Balanced buffered clock trees are introduced into the design.
*[[Routing (EDA)|Routing]]: The wires that connect the gates in the netlist are added.
*Postwiring optimization:  Remaining performance, noise, and yield violations are removed.
*[[Design for manufacturability (IC)|Design for manufacturability]]: The design is modified, where possible, to make it as easy as possible to produce.
*[[Signoff (EDA)|Signoff checks]]: Since errors are expensive, time consuming and hard to spot, extensive error checking is the rule, [[Formal equivalence checking|making sure the mapping to logic was done correctly]], and [[Design rule checking|checking that the manufacturing rules were followed faithfully]].
*[[Tape-out|Tapeout]] and mask generation: the design data is turned into [[photomask]]s in [[mask data preparation]].

== Evolution of design constraints ==
The purpose of the flow is to take a design from concept phase to working chip. The complexity of the flow is a direct result of the addition and evolution of the list of design closure constraints. To understand this evolution it is important to understand the life cycle of a design constraint. In general, design constraints influence the design flow via the following five-stage evolution:
*Early warnings: Before chip issues begin occurring, academics and industry visionaries make dire predictions about the future impact of some new technology effect.
*Hardware problems: Sporadic hardware failures start showing up in the field due to the new effect. Postmanufacturing redesign and hardware re-spins are required to get the chip to function.
*Trial and error: Constraints on the effect are formulated and used to drive postdesign checking. Violations of the constraint are fixed manually.
*Find and repair: Large number of violations of the constraint drives the creation of automatic postdesign analysis and repair flows.
*Predict and prevent: Constraint checking moves earlier in the flow using predictive estimations of the effect. These drive optimizations to prevent violations of the constraint.

A good example of this evolution can be found in the [[signal integrity]] constraint. In the mid-1990s (180&amp;nbsp;nm
node), industry visionaries were describing the impending dangers of coupling noise long before chips were
failing. By the mid-late 1990s, noise problems were cropping up in advanced microprocessor designs.
By 2000, automated noise analysis tools were available and were used to guide manual fix-up. The total
number of noise problems identified by the analysis tools identified by the flow quickly became too many
to correct manually. In response, CAD companies developed the noise avoidance flows that are currently in
use in the industry.

At any point in time, the constraints in the design flow are at different stages of their life cycle. At the
time of this writing, for example, performance optimization is the most mature and is well into the fifth
phase with the widespread use of timing-driven design flows. Power- and defect-oriented yield optimization
is well into the fourth phase; power supply integrity, a type of noise constraint, is in the third phase;
circuit-limited yield optimization is in the second phase, etc. A list of the first-phase impending constraint
crises can always be found in the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] (ITRS) 15-year-outlook technology roadmaps.

As a constraint matures in the design flow, it tends to work its way from the end of the flow to the beginning.
As it does this, it also tends to increase in complexity and in the degree that it contends with other constraints.
Constraints tend to move up in the flow due to one of the basic paradoxes of design: accuracy vs.
influence. Specifically, the earlier in a design flow a constraint is addressed, the more flexibility there is to
address the constraint. Ironically, the earlier one is in a design flow, the more difficult it is to predict compliance.
For example, an architectural decision to pipeline a logic function can have a far greater impact on
total chip performance than any amount of postrouting fix-up. At the same time, accurately predicting the
performance impact of such a change before the chip logic is synthesized, let alone placed or routed, is very
difficult. This paradox has shaped the evolution of the design closure flow in several ways. First, it requires
that the design flow is no longer composed of a linear set of discrete steps. In the early stages of VLSI it was
sufficient to break the design into discrete stages, i.e., first do logic synthesis, then do placement, then do
routing. As the number and complexity of design closure constraints has increased, the linear design flow
has broken down. In the past if there were too many timing constraint violations left after routing, it was
necessary to loop back, modify the tool settings slightly, and reexecute the previous placement steps. If the
constraints were still not met, it was necessary to reach further back in the flow and modify the chip logic
and repeat the synthesis and placement steps. This type of looping is both time consuming and unable to
guarantee convergence i.e., it is possible to loop back in the flow to correct one constraint violation only to
find that the correction induced another unrelated violation.

In [[NASA]]'s engineering [[Systems Development Life Cycle|design life cycle]], a phase of '''design reviews''' are held for technical and programmatic accountability and to authorize the release of funding to a project.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Procedural Requirements, [http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_7123_001B_&amp;page_name=AppendixG Subject: NASA Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements, Appendix G]
Responsible Office: Office of the Chief Engineer, NPR 7123.1B, Effective Date: April 18, 2013, Expiration Date: April 18, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the major phases of that [[systems engineering]] process.  A design review provides an in-depth assessment, by an independent team of discipline experts and managers, that the design (or concept) is realistic and attainable from a programmatic and technical sense.

Design review is also required of [[medical device]] developers as part of a system of [[design controls]] described in the US [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s governing regulations in 21CFR820.  In 21CFR820.3(h), design review is described as " documented, comprehensive, systematic examination of the design to evaluate the adequacy of the design requirements, to evaluate the capability of the design to meet these requirements, and to identify problems."  The FDA also specifies that a design review should include an [[independent reviewer]].

== Review process ==
The list of reviews done by an effort and the content, nature, process, and objectives any review uses vary enormously by the organization involved and the particular situation of the effort.  For example, even within the U.S. Department of Defense, System Requirements Review cases include such as (1) a 5-day perusal of each individual requirement, or (2) a 2-day discussion of development plan documents allowed only after the system requirements have been approved and the development documents reviewed with formal action items required, or (3) a half-day powerpoint with content determined by the Project Manager with attendance limited to high-level (non-technical) stakeholders with no output other than the PM being able to claim 'SRR done'.

Some of the reviews that may be done on an effort include:

=== Mission Concept Review (MCR) ===
The MCR affirms the mission need and examines the proposed mission's objectives and the concept for meeting those objectives.

=== System Requirements Review (SRR) ===
The SRR examines the [[functional requirements]] and [[non-functional requirements|performance requirements]] defined for the system and the preliminary program or project plan and ensures that the requirements and the selected concept will satisfy the mission.

=== Mission Definition Review (MDR) ===
The MDR examines the proposed requirements, the mission architecture, and the flow down to all functional elements of the mission to ensure that the overall concept is complete, feasible, and consistent with available resources.

=== System Design Review (SDR) ===
The SDR examines the proposed system architecture and design and the flow down to all functional elements of the system.

=== Preliminary Design Review (PDR) ===
The PDR demonstrates that the preliminary design meets all system requirements with acceptable risk and within the cost and schedule constraints and establishes the basis for proceeding with detailed design. It will show that the correct design options have been selected, interfaces have been identified, and verification methods have been described.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hyperthot.com/pm_desreviews.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=518699#10.5.3.1
| title = Defense Acquisition Guidebook 10.5.3 Preliminary Design Review
| accessdate = 14 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are typical objectives of a PDR:
*Ensure that all system requirements have been validated, allocated, the requirements are complete, and the flowdown is adequate to verify system performance
*Show that the proposed design is expected to meet the functional and performance requirements
*Show sufficient maturity in the proposed design approach to proceed to final design
*Show that the design is verifiable and that the risks have been identified, characterized, and mitigated where appropriate

=== Critical Design Review (CDR) ===
The CDR demonstrates that the maturity of the design is appropriate to support proceeding with full-scale fabrication, assembly, integration, and test. CDR determines that the technical effort is on track to complete the flight and ground system development and mission operations, meeting mission performance requirements within the identified cost and schedule constraints.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navair.navy.mil/nawctsd/Resources/Library/Acqguide/cdr.htm "Critical Design Review" Published 2013-4-4 Retrieved 2015-5-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are typical objectives of a CDR:
*Ensure that the "build-to" baseline contains detailed hardware and software specifications that can meet functional and performance requirements
*Ensure that the design has been satisfactorily audited by production, verification, operations, and other specialty engineering organizations
*Ensure that the production processes and controls are sufficient to proceed to the fabrication stage
*Establish that planned Quality Assurance (QA) activities will establish perceptive verification and screening processes for producing a quality product
*Verify that the final design fulfills the specifications established at PDR

=== Production Readiness Review (PRR) ===
A PRR is held for Flight System and Ground Support projects developing or acquiring multiple or similar systems greater than three or as determined by the project. The PRR determines the readiness of the system developers to efficiently produce the required number of systems. It ensures that the production plans; fabrication, assembly, and integration enabling products; and personnel are in place and ready to begin production.

=== Test Readiness Review (TRR) ===
A TRR ensures that the test article (hardware/software), test facility, support personnel, and test procedures are ready for testing and data acquisition, reduction, and control. This is not a prerequisite for Key Decision Point entry.

=== System Acceptance Review (SAR) ===
The SAR verifies the completeness of the specific end products in relation to their expected maturity level and assesses compliance to stakeholder expectations. The SAR examines the system, its end products and documentation, and test data and analyses that support verification. It also ensures that the system has sufficient technical maturity to authorize its shipment to the designated operational facility or launch site.

=== Operational Readiness Review (ORR) ===
The ORR examines the actual system characteristics and the procedures used in the system or end product's operation and ensures that all system and support (flight and ground) hardware, software, personnel, procedures, and user documentation accurately reflect the deployed state of the system.

The following are typical objectives of an ORR:
*Establish that the system is ready to transition into an operational mode through examination of available ground and flight test results, analyses, and operational demonstrations
*Confirm that the system is operationally and logistically supported in a satisfactory manner considering all modes of operation and support (normal, contingency, and unplanned)
*Establish that operational documentation is complete and represents the system configuration and its planned modes of operation
*Establish that the training function is in place and has demonstrated capability to support all aspects of system maintenance, preparation, operation, and recovery.

=== Flight Readiness Review (FRR) ===
The FRR examines tests, demonstrations, analyses, and audits that determine the system's readiness for a safe and successful flight or launch and for subsequent flight operations. It also ensures that all flight and ground hardware, software, personnel, and procedures are operationally ready.

The following are typical objectives of a FRR:
*Receive certification that flight operations can safely proceed with acceptable risk.
*Confirm that the system and support elements are properly configured and ready for launch.
*Establish that all interfaces are compatible and function as expected.
*Establish that the system state supports a launch "go" decision based on go/no-go criteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3961">The '''dynamic method''' is a procedure for the determination of the [[mass]]es of [[asteroid]]s.  The procedure gets its name from its use of the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] laws of the ''dynamics,'' or motion, of asteroids as they move around the Solar System.  The procedure works by taking multiple position measurements to determine the gravitational deflection caused when two or more asteroids move past each other.  The method relies on the fact that the large number of known asteroids means they will occasionally move past one another at very close distances.  If at least one of the two interacting bodies is large enough, its gravitational influence on the other can reveal its mass.  The accuracy of the determined mass is limited by the precision and timing of the appropriate [[astrometry|astrometric]] observations being made to determine the gravitational deflection caused by a given interaction.&lt;ref name=Kochetova-2004&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Determination of Large Asteroid Masses by the Dynamical Method | last = Kochetova | first = O.M. | journal = Solar System Research | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | year = 2004 | pages = 66–75|bibcode = 2004SoSyR..38...66K |doi = 10.1023/B:SOLS.0000015157.65020.84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the method relies on detecting the amount of gravitational deflection induced during an interaction, the procedure works best for objects which will produce a large deflection in their interactions with other objects.  This means that the procedure works best for large objects, but it can also be effectively applied to objects which have repeated close interactions with each other such as when the two objects are in [[orbital resonance]] with one another.  Regardless of the mass of the interacting objects, the amount of deflection will be greater if the objects approach nearer to each other and it will also be greater if the objects pass slowly, allowing more time for gravity to perturb the orbits of the two objects.  For large enough asteroids this distance can be as large as ~0.1 AU, for less massive asteroids the conditions of the interaction would need to be correspondingly better.&lt;ref name=Kochetova-2004/&gt;

== Mathematical analysis ==
The simplest way to describe the deflection of the asteroids is in the case where one object is significantly more massive than the other.  In this case the equations of motion are the same as for that of [[Rutherford scattering]] between oppositely charged objects (so that the force is attractive rather than repulsive).  When rewritten in the more familiar notation used in celestial mechanics deflection angle can be related to the eccentricity of the hyperbolic orbit of the smaller object relative to the larger one by the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Classical Mechanics: A Modern Perspective | edition = 2nd. | last1 = Barger | first1 = Vernon D. | last2 = Olsson | first2 = Martin G. | year = 1995 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | isbn = 0-07-003734-5 | chapter = 5.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \left( \frac{\Theta}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the [[asymptote]]s of the [[hyperbolic orbit]] of the small object relative to the large one, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the eccentricity of this orbit (which must be greater than 1 for a hyperbolic orbit).

A more sophisticated description using [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] can be achieved by separating the observed objects position on the sky as a function of time into the sum of two components: one which is a result of the relative motion of the objects themselves, and the other the motion induced by the gravitational influence of the two bodies.  The relative contributions of the two terms in the best fit of this equation onto the actual observations of the objects yields the objects masses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13071">The '''economics of science''' aims to understand the impact of [[science]] on the advance of 
[[technology]], to explain the behavior of scientists, and to understand the efficiency or 
inefficiency of scientific institutions and markets.

The importance of the [[economics]] as science is substantially due to the importance of science as a driver of technology and technology as a driver of productivity and growth.  Believing that science matters, economists have attempted to understand the behavior of scientists and the 
operation of scientific institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Diamond, Jr. (2008). "science, economics of," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, Basingstoke and New York: [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. Pre-publication [https://archive.is/20120927155248/http://cba.unomaha.edu/faculty/adiamond/web/diamondpdfs/palgraveeconsci07.pdf cached ccpy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science as a Public Good==
Economists consider “science” as the search and production of knowledge using known starting conditions.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audretsch|first1=David|last2=Bozeman|first2=Barry|last3=Combs|first3=Kathryn|last4=Feldman|first4=Maryann|last5=Link|first5=Albert|last6=Siegel|first6=Donald|last7=Stephan|first7=Paula|last8=Tassey|first8=Gregory|last9=Wessner|first9=Charles|title=The Economics of Science and Technology|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|date=April 2002|volume=27|issue=2|pages=155–203|doi=10.1023/A:1014382532639|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014382532639|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge can be considered a [[public good]], due to the fact that its utility to society is not diminished with additional consumption (non-[[rivalry (economics)|rivalry]]), and once the knowledge is shared with the public it becomes very hard to restrict access to it or use of it (non-[[excludable]]). Traditional public economic theory asserts that competitive markets provide poor incentives for production of a public good because the producers cannot reap the benefits of use of their product, and thus costs will be higher than benefits. Economists have identified several possible reasons as to why producers of science might determine that the private costs they incur in the production process are larger than the benefits that they intend to reap, even though the benefits to society are greater than these costs.&lt;ref name="Callon, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callon|first1=Michel|title=Is Science a Public Good?|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=October 1, 1994|volume=19|issue=4|pages=395–424|doi=10.1177/016224399401900401|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/016224399401900401|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the technological barriers to production are extremely high, which makes the market very risky. Technological barriers refer to the cost of [[research and development]] of new scientific knowledge, which becomes increasingly expensive as technology continues to play a more prominent role in this type of development.&lt;ref name="von Zedtwitz et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Von Zedtwitz|first1=Maximilian|last2=Gassmann|first2=Oliver|title=Market versus Technology Drive in R&amp;D Internationalization: Four different patterns of managing research and development|journal=Research Policy|date=2002|volume=31|issue=4|pages=569–588|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00125-1|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0048733301001251/1-s2.0-S0048733301001251-main.pdf?_tid=3d0f6865-63dc-4427-96c7-296d591248cc&amp;acdnat=1520395953_6c5dc57bf27dfd45501ef8493ca719f7|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, due to the non-excludable nature of scientific knowledge, producers worry that they will be unable to enforce property rights on their produced goods. This will result in others being able to benefit from the scientific knowledge without having to bear the cost of the research and development, which would in turn make the potential return on investment too small to incentivize participation in the market.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; Therefore, science can be understood as the production of a public good, and can be studied within the framework of [[public economics]].&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

However, certain economists argue that a non-market mechanism has developed to correct the problem of indefinable property rights, such that scientists are incentivized to produce knowledge in a socially responsible way. Economist Paula Stephen refers to this mechanism as a reward system based primarily on a concept that she calls “priority of discovery.”&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Paula|title=The Economics of Science|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|date=September 1996|volume=34|issue=3|pages=1199–1235|jstor=2729500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Merton argues that to goal of scientists is to establish “priority of discovery” by being the first to report a new discovery, which then results in the reward of recognition. The scientific community only bestows this reward on the person who discovers the new piece of knowledge first, and thus this sets up a winner-takes-all type of system that incentivizes producers to participate in the market of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Merton 1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert|title=Priorities in Scientific Discover: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science|journal=American Sociological Review|date=December 1957|volume=22|issue=6|pages=635–659|doi=10.2307/2089193|jstor=2089193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen particularly notes that “Compensation in science is generally composed of two parts: one portion is paid regardless of the individual's success in races, the other is priority-based and reflects the value of the winner's contribution to science.”&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996" /&gt; The first part that Stephens identifies corresponds to the salary that a professor in academia would expect to make over the course of his or her career; these salaries are notoriously flat, with one study noting that a full professor can expect to make only 70% more than a newly hired assistant professor.&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrenberg|first1=Ronald|title=Academic Labor Supply|journal=Economic Challenges in Higher Education|date=1991|pages=141–258|url=https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1650&amp;context=articles|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stephen argues that the second part of compensation, that which is reaped when a scientist establishes priority of discovery, then the earnings profile becomes much less flat as the scientist gains prestige, journalistic citations, paid speaking invitations, and other such rewards. However, she notes that this theory had yet to be empirically tested at the time of writing.&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996" /&gt; Furthermore, her analysis only applies to the world of academia, whereas industry is also a major source of scientific knowledge production.

==Government Interventions==

The field of [[public economics]] posits that should [[market failures]] occur, the government might be able to intervene to correct these market failures. When speaking about the production of scientific knowledge, the government has several options for intervening in the market to attempt to correct the failure. In the United States, two of the most historically popular and most extensively studied options are the [[patent]] system and [[tax incentives]].&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

===The Patent System===
[[File:Patent System - Economics of Science.png|thumb|Graphical representation of the effect of patents on production of scientific knowledge]]In the United States, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent and Trademark Office]] issues patents that give the holder of the patent exclusive, defined property rights to their product for 20 years. From an economic perspective, the value of the patent is that it increases the marginal benefit of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal benefit]] of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have [[diminishing returns]]. For simplicity’s sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any [[government intervention]], the firm will produce where at RD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where private marginal benefit (MB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&amp;D is at RD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The value of the introduction of the patent system is that it allows the marginal benefit curve for the firm to shift upward to MB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; so that the private benefit to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The additional revenue is collected from society, as society now pays higher prices for the knowledge given the monopoly power of the producing firm.

In practice, patent law has been correlated with increased R&amp;D expenditure, indicating that this form of government intervention is in fact incentivizing production.&lt;ref name="Acs et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acs|first1=Zoltan|last2=Audretsch|first2=David|title=Patents as a Measure of Innovative Activity|journal=Kyklos|date=August 1989|volume=42|issue=2|pages=171–180|doi=10.1111/j.1467-435.1989.tb00186.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6435.1989.tb00186.x/abstract|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this type of government intervention does not allow particularly precise targeting of the optimal level of R&amp;D production, and several economists argue that the benefit of 20 years of monopoly power is too high.&lt;ref name="Acs et al" /&gt; This argument has particular relevance to current debates regarding the production of life-saving pharmaceuticals.

===Tax Incentives===
[[File:Tax Incentive - Economics of Science.png|thumb|Graphical representation of the effect of tax incentives on production of scientific knowledge]]In 1954, the Internal Revenue Service incorporated an exemption for research costs such that firms could have research costs deducted from their yearly taxes.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; From an economic perspective, the value of the tax incentive is that it decreases the marginal cost of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge. To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the marginal cost and benefit of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have diminishing rate of return. For simplicity’s sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any government intervention, the firm will produce where at RD0, where private marginal benefit (PMB0) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD0 is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&amp;D is at RD1, which is where the marginal cost curve intersects the social marginal benefit (not depicted on this graph). The value of the tax incentive is that it allows the marginal cost curve for the firm to shift downward so that the private cost to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The rest of the cost is now borne by society, in the form of the lost tax revenue.

Tax incentives allow slightly more precise targeting than the patent system. However, the concern still remains that tax incentives exacerbate inequality by producing financial windfalls for firms that might already be very prosperous.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; Furthermore, empirical studies have been limited, although a 1996 report from the Congressional Office of Technological Assessment found that for every dollar lost in tax revenue, there was a dollar increasing in private R&amp;D spending.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

'''Erotic furniture''', also known as '''sex furniture''', is any form of [[furniture]] that can act as an aid to [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. While almost anything can be used for this purpose, the most common form of furniture employed for sexual activity is the [[bed (furniture)|bed]], but couches and sofas come a close second. These are not strictly [[Eroticism|erotic]] furniture, as their primary use is not erotic.
[[File:Spanking Bench.png|thumb|250px|A ''spanking bench'']]
Specifically designed furniture for erotic purposes can include
* Devices for [[erotic spanking|spanking]] and [[flagellation]] such as the [[Berkley Horse]]
* [[Sex swing]]s
* Sex Gliders
* Devices for using gravity to aid in lovemaking without the use of complicated slings.
* [[Fisting sling]]s
* Various types of angled foam wedges or specially designed pillows that support various [[sex position]]s.  See [[Liberator shapes]] for example or the ergonomically based Lovebumpers.
* [[Bondage (BDSM)|Bondage]] equipment such as [[stocks]] and [[pillory|pillories]]
* [[Smotherbox]]es and other [[queening stool]]s.
* The Love Chair, a curious chair made of curved [[tubular steel]], articulated in several ways and designed to facilitate otherwise impossible sexual acts. This device was advertised in men's magazines in the mid-1970s, and is seen in at least one of [[Nina Hartley]]'s ''Guide to'' videos, but it is no longer commercially available.
[[File:Spanking on Bondage Furniture.png|thumb|left|A woman is spanked, while kneeling on a specially-made bench for the purpose.]]
* Sawhorses, which are shaped much like the version used for carpentry, but have a sharpened edge and are primarily sat on to achieve a feeling similar to a crotch rope in bondage.

[[King Edward VII of the United Kingdom]], who was heavily overweight, used a specially constructed "love seat" (''siege d'amour'') when he visited the famous [[brothel]], [[Le Chabanais]] in Paris.

[[Edward Gorey]]'s ''[[The Curious Sofa]]'', (1961), a neo-Victorian pseudo-porno send-up consisting of non-illustrations—there's always a potted palm or something in the way. One caption reads "That evening in the library Scylla, one of the guests who had certain anatomical peculiarities, demonstrated the 'Lithuanian Typewriter', assisted by Ronald and Rupert, two remarkably well-set-up young men from the village." The Curious Sofa of the title is approached with some misgivings by the house-party guests at the end.

'''EtherSound''' is one of several [[audio over Ethernet]] technologies for [[audio engineering]] and [[broadcast engineering]] applications. EtherSound is developed and licensed by [[Digigram]].

| title=The EtherSound Tested Programme

| accessdate= 2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
EtherSound is intended by the developer to be compliant with [[IEEE 802.3]] Ethernet standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Tech Focus: Digital Audio Networks, Part 2 — The Major Players |author=Dan Daley |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.sportsvideo.org/2016/05/05/tech-focus-digital-audio-networks-part-2-the-major-players/ |work=SVG News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the IEEE defines rates such as [[Fast Ethernet|100 Megabit]] and [[Gigabit Ethernet]] standards, EtherSound has been developed as both ES-100 (for use on dedicated 100 Megabit Ethernet networks or within a Gigabit network as a VLAN) and ES-Giga (for use on dedicated Gigabit Ethernet networks). The two versions of EtherSound are not compatible.

==Network technology==
While Ethersound is compliant with the IEEE 802.3 [[physical layer]] standards, logically it uses a [[token passing]] scheme of transporting audio data which prevents all of its features from being used on a standard Ethernet network. On a standard network it is only able to distribute audio and control data one way. It is not designed to share Ethernet [[LAN]]s with typical office operations data or Internet traffic such as email. It supports two way communications only when wired in a daisy chain topology.&lt;ref name="AES"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Best Practices in Network Audio |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |year=2009 |url=http://www.aes.org/technical/documents/AESTD1003V1.pdf |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Ethersound is best used in applications suitable to a daisy chain network topology or in live sound applications that benefit from its low point-to-point latency.

==Low latency==
Low latency is important for many users of [[Audio over Ethernet]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Studer, Digigram partner for connectivity |work=Television Broadcast |date=2007|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-167104123.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;One of the most critical applications involves picking up sound from a vocalist's or instrumentalist's microphone on a live performance stage, mixing that signal with those received from other microphones (and performers) and delivering the mix to the performer via [[in-ear monitors]]. Latency in this application is particularly annoying to vocalists. This is because a singer hears his or her own voice through [[bone conduction]] as well as through the outer ear. If the sound from the in-ear monitor lags the bone-conduction sound by more than a few milliseconds, [[phase shifts]] and [[comb filter]]ing will become audible.&lt;/ref&gt; EtherSound can deliver up to 64 channels of 48&amp;nbsp;kHz, 24-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio data with a network latency of 125 [[microseconds]]. Each device in a [[daisy chain (network topology)|daisy-chain]] network adds 1.5 microseconds of latency. EtherSound's network latency is stable and deterministic: the delay between any two devices on an EtherSound network can be calculated.

__NOTOC__
'''Ethnolinguistics''' (sometimes called '''cultural linguistics''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ferraro |first=Gary |title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2006 |isbn=0-495-10008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a field of [[linguistics]] that studies the relationship between language and culture and how different [[ethnic group]]s perceive the world. It is the combination between [[ethnology]] and linguistics. The former refers to the way of life of an entire community: all the characteristics that distinguish one community from the other. Such characteristics make the cultural aspects of a community or a society.

Ethnolinguists study the way perception and conceptualization influences language and show how that is linked to different cultures and societies. An example is how spatial orientation is expressed in various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Heine|Heine, Bernd]] (1997) ''Cognitive Foundations of Grammar''. Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuan, Yi-Fu (1974) ''Topophilia: A study of environmental perception, attitudes, and values.'' Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; In many societies, words for the [[cardinal direction]]s ''east'' and ''west'' are derived from terms for sunrise/sunset. The nomenclature for cardinal directions of [[Inuit languages|Inuit]] speakers of [[Greenland]], however, is based on geographical landmarks such as the river system and one's position on the coast. Similarly, the [[Yurok language|Yurok]] lack the idea of cardinal directions; they orient themselves with respect to their principal geographic feature, the [[Klamath River]].

Cultural Linguistics is a related branch of linguistics that explores the relationship between language and cultural conceptualisations.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"/&gt; Cultural Linguistics draws on and expands the theoretical and analytical advancements in cognitive science (including complexity science and distributed cognition) and anthropology. Cultural linguistics examines how various features of human languages encode cultural conceptualisations, including cultural schemas, cultural categories, and cultural metaphors.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"&gt;Sharifian, Farzad (2011). Cultural Conceptualisations and Language: Theoretical Framework and Applications. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Not a typo|Cultural Linguistics}}, language is viewed as deeply entrenched in the group-level, cultural cognition of communities of speakers. Thus far, the approach of Cultural Linguistics has been adopted in several areas of [[applied linguistic]] research, including [[intercultural communication]], [[second language learning]], Teaching English as an International Language, and [[World Englishes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharifian, Farzad &amp; Palmer, Gary B. (eds.) (2007) Applied cultural linguistics: Implications for second language learning and intercultural communication. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''evolution of biological complexity''' is one important outcome of the process of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Werner |first1=Andreas |last2=Piatek |first2=Monica J. |last3=Mattick |first3=John S. |title=Transpositional shuffling and quality control in male germ cells to enhance evolution of complex organisms |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=April 2015 |volume=1341 |issue=1 |pages=156–163 |doi=10.1111/nyas.12608 |pmid=25557795 |pmc=4390386|bibcode=2015NYASA1341..156W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution has produced some remarkably complex organisms - although the actual level of complexity is very hard to define or measure accurately in biology, with properties such as gene content, the number of [[cell type]]s or [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] all proposed as possible metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adami, C. |title=What is complexity? |journal=BioEssays |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1085–94 |year=2002 |pmid=12447974 |doi=10.1002/bies.10192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Waldrop, M. |title=Language: Disputed definitions |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1023–1028 |year=2008 |doi=10.1038/4551023a |pmid=18948925 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/11720591/Randomness_increases_order_in_biological_evolution |title=Computation, Physics and Beyond |last=Longo |first=Giuseppe |last2=Montévil |first2=Maël |date=2012-01-01 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |year= |isbn=9783642276538 |editor-last=Dinneen |editor-first=Michael J. |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |location= |pages=289–308 |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-27654-5_22 |quote= |editor-last2=Khoussainov |editor-first2=Bakhadyr |editor-last3=Nies |editor-first3=André |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many biologists used to believe that [[Orthogenesis|evolution was progressive (orthogenesis)]] and had a direction that led towards so-called "higher organisms," despite a lack of evidence for this viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McShea, D. |title=Complexity and evolution: What everybody knows |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=303–324 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00132234}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of "progression" and "higher organisms" in evolution is now regarded as misleading, with [[natural selection]] having no intrinsic direction and organisms selected for either increased or decreased complexity in response to local environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Ayala"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayala, F. J. |title=Darwin's greatest discovery: design without designer |journal=PNAS |volume=104 |issue= Suppl 1|pages=8567–73 |year=2007 |pmid=17494753 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/104/suppl_1/8567 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701072104 |pmc=1876431|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.8567A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been an increase in the maximum level of complexity over the [[history of life]], there has always been a large majority of small and simple organisms and the [[mode (statistics)|most common]] level of complexity appears to have remained relatively constant.

==Selection for simplicity and complexity==

Usually organisms that have a higher rate of reproduction than their competitors have an evolutionary advantage. Consequently, organisms can evolve to become simpler and thus multiply faster and produce more offspring, as they require fewer resources to reproduce. A good example are parasites such as Plasmodium - the parasite responsible for [[malaria]] - and [[mycoplasma]]; these organisms often dispense with traits that are made unnecessary through parasitism on a host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sirand-Pugnet, P.; Lartigue, C.; Marenda, M. |title=Being Pathogenic, Plastic, and Sexual while Living with a Nearly Minimal Bacterial Genome |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e75 |year=2007 |pmid=17511520 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030075 |pmc=1868952 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lineage can also dispense with complexity when a particular complex trait merely provides no selective advantage in a particular environment. Loss of this trait need not necessarily confer a selective advantage, but may be lost due to the accumulation of mutations if its loss does not confer an immediate selective disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maughan, H.; Masel, J.; Birky, W. C.; Nicholson, W. L. |title=The roles of mutation accumulation and selection in loss of sporulation in experimental populations of Bacillus subtilis |doi=10.1534/genetics.107.075663 |journal=Genetics |volume=177 |pages=937–948 |year=2007 |pmid=17720926 |pmc=2034656 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a [[parasitic organisms|parasitic organism]] may dispense with the synthetic pathway of a metabolite where it can readily scavenge that metabolite from its host. Discarding this synthesis may not necessarily allow the parasite to conserve significant energy or resources and grow faster, but the loss may be fixed in the population through mutation accumulation if no disadvantage is incurred by loss of that pathway. Mutations causing loss of a complex trait occur more often than mutations causing gain of a complex trait.

With selection, evolution can also produce more complex organisms. Complexity often arises in the co-evolution of hosts and pathogens,&lt;ref name="arms_race"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dawkins, Richard  |author1link=Richard Dawkins |author2=Krebs, J. R. |title=Arms Races between and within Species |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=205 |issue=1161 |pages=489–511 |year=1979 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081 |pmid=42057 |bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt; with each side developing ever more sophisticated adaptations, such as the [[immune system]] and the many techniques pathogens have developed to evade it. For example, the parasite ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'', which causes [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], has evolved so many copies of its major surface [[antigen]] that about 10% of its genome is devoted to different versions of this one gene. This tremendous complexity allows the parasite to constantly change its surface and thus evade the immune system through [[antigenic variation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pays, E. |title=Regulation of antigen gene expression in Trypanosoma brucei |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=517–20 |year=2005 |pmid=16126458 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2005.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the growth of complexity may be driven by the [[co-evolution]] between an organism and the [[ecosystem]] of [[predator]]s, [[prey]] and [[parasite]]s to which it tries to stay adapted: as any of these become more complex in order to cope better with the diversity of threats offered by the ecosystem formed by the others, the others too will have to adapt by becoming more complex, thus triggering an ongoing [[evolutionary arms race]]&lt;ref name="arms_race"/&gt; towards more complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Heylighen|Heylighen, F.]] (1999a) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BQWrppy8ooIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22Heylighen%22+%22The+growth+of+structural+and+functional+complexity+...%22+&amp;ots=p2cUiyexLo&amp;sig=T6Dk_PTHRocBj8Lou81w_mHtJZA "The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution]", in F. Heylighen, J. Bollen &amp; A. Riegler (eds.) The Evolution of Complexity Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, 17-44.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend may be reinforced by the fact that ecosystems themselves tend to become more complex over time, as [[species diversity]] increases, together with the linkages or dependencies between species.

==Types of trends in complexity==
[[File:Evolution of complexity.svg|thumb|left|200px|Passive versus active trends in complexity. Organisms at the beginning are red. Numbers are shown by height with time moving up in a series.]]

If evolution possessed an active trend toward complexity ([[orthogenesis]]), as was widely believed in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pages=526–529 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; then we would expect to see an active trend&lt;!--right hand column in figure--&gt; of increase over time in the most common value [[mode (statistics)|(the mode)]] of complexity among organisms.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carroll SB |title=Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6823 |pages=1102–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11234024 |doi=10.1038/35059227|bibcode=2001Natur.409.1102C }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, an increase in complexity can also be explained through a passive process.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; Assuming unbiased random changes of complexity and the existence of a minimum complexity leads to an increase over time of the average complexity of the biosphere.This involves an increase in [[variance]], but the mode does not change. The trend towards the creation of some organisms with higher complexity over time exists, but it involves increasingly small percentages of living things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In this hypothesis, any appearance of evolution acting with an intrinsic direction towards increasingly complex organisms is a result of people concentrating on the small number of large, complex organisms that inhabit the [[Skewness|right-hand tail]] of the complexity distribution and ignoring simpler and much more common organisms. This passive model predicts that the majority of species are [[microorganism|microscopic]] [[prokaryote]]s, which is supported by estimates of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; extant prokaryotes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oren, A. |title=Prokaryote diversity and taxonomy: current status and future challenges |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

==Constructive neutral evolution==

Recently work in evolution theory has proposed that by relaxing [[selection pressure]], which typically acts to streamline [[genome]]s, the complexity of an organism increases by a process called constructive neutral evolution.&lt;ref name="Stoltzfus1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Arlin |title=On the Possibility of Constructive Neutral Evolution |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=49 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=169–181 |doi=10.1007/PL00006540|issn=0022-2844|bibcode=1999JMolE..49..169S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[effective population size]] in eukaryotes (especially multi-cellular organisms) is much smaller than in prokaryotes,&lt;ref name="SungAckerman2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=W. |last2=Ackerman |first2=M. S. |last3=Miller |first3=S. F. |last4=Doak |first4=T. G. |last5=Lynch |first5=M. |title=Drift-barrier hypothesis and mutation-rate evolution |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=109 |issue=45 |year=2012 |pages=18488–18492 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1216223109|pmc=3494944 |bibcode=2012PNAS..10918488S |pmid=23077252}}&lt;/ref&gt; they experience [[nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution|lower selection constraints]].

According to this model, new genes are created by non-[[adaptation (biology)|adaptive]] processes, such as by random [[gene duplication]]. These novel entities, although not required for viability, do give the organism excess capacity that can facilitate the mutational decay of functional subunits. If this decay results in a situation where all of the genes are now required, the organism has been trapped in a new state where the number of genes has increased. This process has been sometimes described as a complexifying ratchet.&lt;ref name="LukešArchibald2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukeš |first1=Julius |last2=Archibald |first2=John M. |last3=Keeling |first3=Patrick J. |last4=Doolittle |first4=W. Ford |last5=Gray |first5=Michael W. |title=How a neutral evolutionary ratchet can build cellular complexity |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=63 |issue=7 |year=2011 |pages=528–537 |doi=10.1002/iub.489}}&lt;/ref&gt; These supplemental genes can then be co-opted by natural selection by a process called [[neofunctionalization]]. In other instances constructive neutral evolution does not promote the creation of new parts, but rather promotes novel interactions between existing players, which then take on new moonlighting roles.&lt;ref name="LukešArchibald2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukeš |first1=Julius |last2=Archibald |first2=John M. |last3=Keeling |first3=Patrick J. |last4=Doolittle |first4=W. Ford |last5=Gray |first5=Michael W. |title=How a neutral evolutionary ratchet can build cellular complexity |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=63 |issue=7 |year=2011 |pages=528–537 |doi=10.1002/iub.489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Orthogenesis}}

In the 19th century, some scientists such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829) and [[Ray Lankester]] (1847–1929) believed that nature had an innate striving to become more complex with evolution. This belief may reflect then-current ideas of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) and of [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903) which envisaged the universe gradually evolving to a higher, more perfect state.

This view regarded the evolution of parasites from independent organisms to a parasitic species as "[[Devolution (biology)|devolution]]" or "degeneration", and contrary to nature. Social theorists have sometimes interpreted this approach metaphorically to decry certain categories of people as "degenerate parasites". Later scientists regarded biological devolution as nonsense; rather, lineages become simpler or more complicated according to whatever forms had a selective advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dougherty, Michael J. | title=Is the human race evolving or devolving? | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-human-race-evolvin/ | journal=Scientific American |date=July 1998 | quote=From a biological perspective, there is no such thing as devolution. All changes in the gene frequencies of populations--and quite often in the traits those genes influence--are by definition evolutionary changes. [...] When species do evolve, it is not out of need but rather because their populations contain organisms with variants of traits that offer a reproductive advantage in a changing environment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''expanded granular sludge bed''' ('''EGSB''') reactor  is a variant of the [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] (UASB) concept for [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic wastewater treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uasb.org:80/discover/agsb.htm |title=Anaerobic Granular Sludge Bed Reactor Technology |last1=Field |first1=Jim |last2=Sierra |first2=Reyes |date=2003-04-27 |publisher=University of Arizona |archive-date=2006-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706215607/http://www.uasb.org/discover/agsb.htm |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguishing feature is that a faster rate of upward-flow velocity is designed for the wastewater passing through the sludge bed. The increased flux permits partial expansion (fluidisation) of the granular sludge bed, improving wastewater-sludge contact as well as enhancing segregation of small inactive suspended particle from the sludge bed. The increased flow velocity is either accomplished by utilizing tall reactors, or by incorporating an effluent recycle (or both). A scheme depicting the EGSB design concept is shown in this [https://web.archive.org/web/20060706215607/http://www.uasb.org/discover/agsb.htm#figure%201 EGSB diagram].

The EGSB design is appropriate for low strength soluble wastewaters (less than 1 to 2 g soluble [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]]/l) or for wastewaters that contain inert or poorly biodegradable suspended particles which should not be allowed to accumulate in the sludge bed.

{{annotated image/Extinction}}
An '''extinction''' '''event''' (also known as a '''mass extinction''' or '''biotic crisis''') is a widespread and rapid decrease in the [[biodiversity]] on [[Earth]]. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of [[multicellular organism]]s. It occurs when the rate of [[extinction]] increases with respect to the rate of [[speciation]]. Because most diversity and [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] on Earth is [[microbial]], and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the [[biosphere]] rather than the total diversity and abundance of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020272| pmid = 15314670| year = 2004| last1 = Nee | first1 = S.| title = Extinction, slime, and bottoms| volume = 2| issue = 8| pages = E272| pmc = 509315| journal = PLoS Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Extinction]] occurs at an uneven rate. Based on the [[fossil record]], the [[background extinction rate|background rate of extinctions]] on Earth is about two to five [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] [[family (biology)|families]] of [[marine animal]]s every million years. Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to [[land animal]]s.

The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] was probably the first major extinction event.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Since the [[Cambrian explosion]] five further major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate. The most recent and arguably best-known, the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], which occurred approximately {{period start|Paleogene}} million years ago (Ma), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time.&lt;ref name="Ward 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Impact from the Deep|last = Ward|first = Peter D|date = 2006|journal = Scientific American|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the five major mass extinctions, there are numerous minor ones as well, and the ongoing mass extinction caused by human activity is sometimes called the [[sixth extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;

Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as "major", and the data chosen to measure past diversity.

In a landmark paper published in 1982, [[Jack Sepkoski]] and [[David M. Raup]] identified five mass extinctions. They were originally identified as outliers to a general trend of decreasing extinction rates during the Phanerozoic,&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt; but as more stringent statistical tests have been applied to the accumulating data, it has been established that multicellular animal life has experienced five major and many minor mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gould, S. J. (2004). The Evolution of Life on Earth,  SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, INC|url = |access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Big Five" cannot be so clearly defined, but rather appear to represent the largest (or some of the largest) of a relatively smooth continuum of extinction events.&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt;

# '''[[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]]''' (End Ordovician or O–S): 450–440&amp;nbsp;Ma (million years ago) at the [[Ordovician]]–[[Silurian]] transition. Two events occurred that killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species.&lt;ref name="ucr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/extinction |title=extinction |publisher=Math.ucr.edu |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they are ranked by many scientists as the second largest of the five major extinctions in Earth's history in terms of percentage of [[genus|genera]] that became extinct.
# '''[[Late Devonian extinction]]''': 375–360&amp;nbsp;Ma near the [[Devonian]]–[[Carboniferous]] transition. At the end of the [[Frasnian|Frasnian Age]] in the later part(s) of the [[Devonian Period]], a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all [[genera]]&lt;ref name="ucr" /&gt; and at least 70% of all species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Palaeobiology II|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lBH2BM7uZL8C|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2008-04-15|isbn = 978-0-470-99928-8|language = en|first = Derek|last = Briggs|first2 = Peter R.|last2 = Crowther|page = 223}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extinction event lasted perhaps as long as 20 million years, and there is evidence for a series of extinction pulses within this period.

Older fossil records are more difficult to interpret. This is because:
* Older fossils are harder to find as they are usually buried at a considerable depth.
* Dating older fossils is more difficult.
* Productive fossil beds are researched more than unproductive ones, therefore leaving certain periods unresearched.
* Prehistoric environmental events can disturb the [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] process.
* The preservation of fossils varies on land, but marine fossils tend to be better preserved than their sought after land-based counterparts.&lt;ref name="sole"&gt;Sole, R.V., and Newman, M., 2002.

More recent research has indicated that the '''[[End-Capitanian extinction event]]''' likely constitutes a separate extinction event from the Permian–Triassic extinction event; if so, it would be larger than many of the "Big Five" extinction events.

==Evolutionary importance==
{{Life timeline}}
Mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the [[evolution]] of [[life|life on Earth]]. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Benton | first =M.J. |authorlink = Michael Benton| title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | publisher=Blackwell | year=2004 | chapter=6. Reptiles Of The Triassic | url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=0632056371 | isbn=0-04-566002-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Van Valkenburgh | first= B.| year=1999 | title=Major patterns in the history of carnivorous mammals | journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences| volume= 27| pages= 463–493 | doi= 10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463|bibcode = 1999AREPS..27..463V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[mammaliformes]] ("almost mammals") and then [[mammal]]s existed throughout the reign of the [[dinosaur]]s, but could not compete for the large terrestrial vertebrate niches which dinosaurs monopolized. The [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|end-Cretaceous]] mass extinction removed the non-avian dinosaurs and made it possible for mammals to expand into the large terrestrial vertebrate niches. Ironically, the dinosaurs themselves had been beneficiaries of a previous mass extinction, the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|end-Triassic]], which eliminated most of their chief rivals, the [[crurotarsans]].

Another point of view put forward in the [[Escalation hypothesis]] predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism conflict will be less likely to survive extinctions. This is because the very traits that keep a species numerous and viable under fairly static conditions become a burden once population levels fall among competing organisms during the dynamics of an extinction event.

Furthermore, many groups which survive mass extinctions do not recover in numbers or diversity, and many of these go into long-term decline, and these are often referred to as "[[Dead Clade Walking|Dead Clades Walking]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jablonski| first= D.| year=2002| doi= 10.1073/pnas.102163299| title=Survival without recovery after mass extinctions| journal=PNAS| volume= 99| issue=12| pages= 8139–8144| pmid=12060760| pmc=123034|bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.8139J }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, clades that survive for a considerable period of time after a mass extinction, and which were reduced to only a few species, are likely to have experienced a rebound effect called the "[[push of the past]]"&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G.

Darwin was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions, such as competition for food and space—the ‘struggle for existence’—were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment. He expressed this in ''The Origin of Species'': "Species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes…and the most import of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered…physical conditions, namely the mutual relation of organism to organism-the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of others".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hallam, Anthony]], &amp; Wignall, P. B. (2002). Mass Extinctions and Their Aftermath. New York: Oxford University Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even after accounting for sampling bias, there does appear to be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the Phanerozoic.&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt; This may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are more likely to become extinct by chance; or it may be an artefact of taxonomy: families tend to become more speciose, therefore less prone to extinction, over time;&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt; and larger taxonomic groups (by definition) appear earlier in geological time.&lt;ref name="Budd2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Budd | first1 = G.

It has also been suggested that the oceans have gradually become more hospitable to life over the last 500 million years, and thus less vulnerable to mass extinctions,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Dissolved oxygen]] became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and [[anoxic event]]s; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that [[food chain]]s were less likely to be disrupted.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Martin| first= R.E.| year=1995| title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans| journal=Global and Planetary Change| volume =11| issue= 1| doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2| pages=1–23|bibcode = 1995GPC....11....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Martin| first1 = R.E.| year = 1996| title = Secular increase in nutrient levels through the Phanerozoic: Implications for productivity, biomass, and diversity of the marine biosphere| journal = PALAIOS| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 209–219| doi = 10.2307/3515230| jstor = 3515230}}&lt;/ref&gt; but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level does not appear to make mass extinctions more or less probable.&lt;ref name=Wang2008/&gt;

==Causes==
There is still debate about the causes of all mass extinctions. In general, large extinctions may result when a biosphere under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock.&lt;ref name="Arens2008"/&gt; An underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates to diversity. High diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate; low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate. These presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations (asteroid impacts, etc.) to produce the global effects observed.&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt;

===Identifying causes of particular mass extinctions===
A good theory for a particular mass extinction should: (i) explain all of the losses, not just focus on a few groups (such as dinosaurs); (ii) explain why particular groups of organisms died out and why others survived; (iii) provide mechanisms which are strong enough to cause a mass extinction but not a total extinction; (iv) be based on events or processes that can be shown to have happened, not just inferred from the extinction.

It may be necessary to consider combinations of causes. For example, the marine aspect of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|end-Cretaceous]] extinction appears to have been caused by several processes which partially overlapped in time and may have had different levels of significance in different parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marshall | first=C.R. | last2=Ward | first2=P.D. | title=Sudden and Gradual Molluscan Extinctions in the Latest Cretaceous of Western European Tethys | journal=Science | volume=274 | pages=1360–1363 | year=1996 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/274/5291/1360?ijkey=ea611116afd7f95233c7b9b1451b6f16702ed11e | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5291.1360 | pmid=8910273 | issue=5291|bibcode = 1996Sci...274.1360M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arens and West (2006) proposed a "press / pulse" model in which mass extinctions generally require two types of cause: long-term pressure on the eco-system ("press") and a sudden catastrophe ("pulse") towards the end of the period of pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Arens, N.C. and West, I.D. (2006). "Press/Pulse: A General Theory of Mass Extinction?" 'GSA Conference paper' [http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2006AM/finalprogram/abstract_111772.htm Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;
Their statistical analysis of marine extinction rates throughout the [[Phanerozoic]] suggested that neither long-term pressure alone nor a catastrophe alone was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the extinction rate.

The most commonly suggested causes of mass extinctions are listed below.

====Flood basalt events====
The formation of [[large igneous province]]s by flood basalt events could have:
* produced dust and [[particulates|particulate]] aerosols which inhibited photosynthesis and thus caused [[food chain]]s to collapse both on land and at sea&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v263/n4/pdf/scientificamerican1090-85.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* emitted sulfur oxides which were precipitated as [[acid rain]] and poisoned many organisms, contributing further to the collapse of food chains
* emitted [[carbon dioxide]] and thus possibly causing [[greenhouse effect|sustained global warming]] once the dust and particulate aerosols dissipated.
Flood basalt events occur as pulses of activity punctuated by dormant periods. As a result, they are likely to cause the climate to oscillate between cooling and warming, but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

It is speculated that massive volcanism caused or contributed to the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]], [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|End-Triassic]] and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|End-Cretaceous]] extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/cretcause.html|title=Causes of the Cretaceous Extinction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between gigantic volcanic events expressed in the large igneous provinces and mass extinctions was shown for the last 260 Myr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtillot | first1 = V. | year = 1994 | title = Mass extinctions in the last 300 million years: one impact and seven flood basalts? | url = | journal = Israel Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 255–266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtillot, V. E., Renne, P. R., 2003. On the ages of flood basalt events.

====Sea-level falls====
These are often clearly marked by worldwide sequences of contemporaneous sediments which show all or part of a transition from sea-bed to tidal zone to beach to dry land – and where there is no evidence that the rocks in the relevant areas were raised by geological processes such as [[orogeny]]. Sea-level falls could reduce the continental shelf area (the most productive part of the oceans) sufficiently to cause a marine mass extinction, and could disrupt weather patterns enough to cause extinctions on land. But sea-level falls are very probably the result of other events, such as sustained global cooling or the sinking of the [[plate tectonics|mid-ocean ridges]].

Sea-level falls are associated with most of the mass extinctions, including all of the "Big Five"—[[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]], [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]], [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]], [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|End-Triassic]], and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|End-Cretaceous]].

A study, published in the journal Nature (online June 15, 2008) established a relationship between the speed of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment.&lt;ref name=Peters2008&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The study suggests changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction, and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541743/ Newswise: Ebb and Flow of the Sea Drives World's Big Extinction Events] Retrieved on June 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact events====
The impact of a sufficiently large asteroid or comet could have caused [[food chain]]s to collapse both on land and at sea by producing dust and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] aerosols and thus inhibiting photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Impact theory of mass extinctions and the invertebrate fossil record|first = Walter|date = Mar 16, 1984|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.223.4641.1135|pmid = 17742919|last = Alvarez|last2 = Kauffman|first2 = Erle|issue = 4641|volume = 223|pages = 1135–1141|last3 = Surlyk|first3 = Finn|last4 = Alvarez|first4 = Luis|last5 = Asaro|first5 = Frank|last6 = Michel|first6 = Helen|jstor=1692570|bibcode = 1984Sci...223.1135A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impacts on [[sulfur]]-rich rocks could have emitted sulfur oxides precipitating as poisonous [[acid rain]], contributing further to the collapse of food chains. Such impacts could also have caused [[megatsunami]]s and/or global [[forest fire]]s.

Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth about 66&amp;nbsp;Ma ago, but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name="Keller_2009"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keller G, Abramovich S, Berner Z, Adatte T | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| volume=271| issue=1–2| date=1 January 2009| pages=52–68| title=Biotic effects of the Chicxulub impact, K–T catastrophe and sea level change in Texas| doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Analyses of shocked quartz at the global K-P boundary indicate an origin from a single, high-angle, oblique impact at Chicxulub |vauthors=Morgan J, Lana C, Kersley A, Coles B, Belcher C, Montanari S, Diaz-Martinez E, Barbosa A, Neumann V |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=251 |issue=3–4 |year=2006 |pages=264–279 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.009 |bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.251..264M|url=http://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/1208/1/EPSL-D-05-00905%5b1%5d.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global cooling====
Sustained and significant global cooling could kill many [[Polar circle|polar]] and [[temperate]] species and force others to migrate towards the [[equator]]; reduce the area available for [[Tropics|tropical]] species; often make the Earth's climate more arid on average, mainly by locking up more of the planet's water in ice and snow. The [[glaciation]] cycles of the [[current ice age]] are believed to have had only a very mild impact on biodiversity, so the mere existence of a significant cooling is not sufficient on its own to explain a mass extinction.

It has been suggested that global cooling caused or contributed to the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]], [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]], [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]] extinctions, and possibly others. Sustained global cooling is distinguished from the temporary climatic effects of flood basalt events or impacts.

====Global warming====
This would have the opposite effects: expand the area available for [[Tropics|tropical]] species; kill [[temperate]] species or force them to migrate towards the [[Polar circle|poles]]; possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species; often make the Earth's climate wetter on average, mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing the volume of the [[water cycle]]. It might also cause anoxic events in the oceans (see below).

Global warming as a cause of mass extinction is supported by several recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayhew|first=Peter J. |author2=Gareth B. Jenkins|author3=Timothy G. Benton|date=January 7, 2008|title=A long-term association between global temperature and biodiversity, origination and extinction in the fossil record|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=275|issue=1630|pages=47–53|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1630/47.full|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1302|pmid=17956842|pmc=2562410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most dramatic example of sustained warming is the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions. It has also been suggested to have caused the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]], during which 20% of all marine families became extinct. Furthermore, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] has been suggested to have been caused by warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knoll|first1=A. H.|last2=Bambach|first2=R.

====Clathrate gun hypothesis====
{{Main|Clathrate gun hypothesis}}
[[Clathrates]] are composites in which a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another. [[Methane clathrate]]s (in which water molecules are the cage) form on [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]. These clathrates are likely to break up rapidly and release the methane if the temperature rises quickly or the pressure on them drops quickly—for example in response to sudden [[global warming]] or a sudden drop in sea level or even [[earthquake]]s. Methane is a much more powerful [[greenhouse effect|greenhouse]] gas than carbon dioxide, so a methane eruption ("clathrate gun") could cause rapid global warming or make it much more severe if the eruption was itself caused by global warming.

The most likely signature of such a methane eruption would be a sudden decrease in the [[Isotope analysis|ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12]] in sediments, since methane clathrates are low in carbon-13; but the change would have to be very large, as other events can also reduce the percentage of carbon-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Hecht | first=J | title=Methane prime suspect for greatest mass extinction | publisher=New Scientist | date=2002-03-26 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that "clathrate gun" methane eruptions were involved in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|end-Permian extinction]] ("the Great Dying") and in the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions.

====Anoxic events====
[[Anoxic event]]s are situations in which the middle and even the upper layers of the ocean become deficient or totally lacking in oxygen. Their causes are complex and controversial, but all known instances are associated with severe and sustained global warming, mostly caused by sustained massive volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geochemistry of oceanic anoxic events|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009GC002788/abstract|journal = Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|date = 2010-03-01|issn = 1525-2027|pages = Q03004|volume = 11|issue = 3|doi = 10.1029/2009GC002788|language = en|first = Hugh C.|last = Jenkyns|bibcode=2010GGG....11.3004J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that anoxic events caused or contributed to the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|Ordovician–Silurian]], [[Late Devonian extinction|late Devonian]], [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] and [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|Triassic–Jurassic]] extinctions, as well as a number of lesser extinctions (such as the [[Ireviken event|Ireviken]], [[Mulde event|Mulde]], [[Lau event|Lau]], [[Toarcian turnover|Toarcian]] and Cenomanian–Turonian events). On the other hand, there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-Cretaceous which indicate anoxic events but are not associated with mass extinctions.

The [[bio-availability]] of [[Essential (biology)|essential]] [[trace element]]s (in particular [[selenium]]) to potentially lethal lows has been shown to coincide with, and likely have contributed to, at least three mass extinction events in the oceans, i.e. at the end of the Ordovician, during the Middle and Late Devonian, and at the end of the Triassic. During periods of low oxygen concentrations very soluble [[selenate]] (Se&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;) is converted into much less soluble [[selenide]] (Se&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), elemental Se and organo-selenium complexes. Bio-availability of selenium during these extinction events dropped to about 1% of the current oceanic concentration, a level that has been proven lethal to many [[Extant taxon|extant]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Long|first1= J.|last2= Large|first2= R.R.|last3= Lee|first3= M.S.Y.|last4= Benton|first4= M.

====Hydrogen sulfide emissions from the seas====
Kump, Pavlov and Arthur (2005) have proposed that during the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] the warming also upset the oceanic balance between [[photosynthesis]]ing plankton and deep-water [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]], causing massive emissions of [[hydrogen sulfide]] which poisoned life on both land and sea and severely weakened the [[ozone layer]], exposing much of the life that still remained to fatal levels of [[UV radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Berner, R. A., and Ward, P. D. (2004).

====Oceanic overturn====
Oceanic overturn is a disruption of [[thermo-haline circulation]] which lets surface water (which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation) sink straight down, bringing anoxic deep water to the surface and therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms which inhabit the surface and middle depths. It may occur either at the beginning or the end of a [[glaciation]], although an overturn at the start of a glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Wilde | first=P | last2=Berry | first2=W.B.N. | title=Destabilization of the oceanic density structure and its significance to marine "extinction" events | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume=48 | issue=2–4 | pages=143–162 | year=1984 | url=http://www.marscigrp.org/ppp84.html | doi=10.1016/0031-0182(84)90041-5 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| bibcode=1984PPP....48..143W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other oceanic catastrophes such as regressions (sea-level falls) and anoxic events, overturns do not leave easily identified "signatures" in rocks and are theoretical consequences of researchers' conclusions about other climatic and marine events.

It has been suggested that oceanic overturn caused or contributed to the [[Late Devonian extinction|late Devonian]] and [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] extinctions.

====A nearby nova, supernova or gamma ray burst====
A nearby [[gamma-ray burst]] (less than 6000 [[light-year]]s away) would be powerful enough to destroy the Earth's [[ozone layer]], leaving organisms vulnerable to [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] from the Sun.&lt;ref name="20 ways"&gt;{{cite web| title=20 Ways the World Could End| publisher=Discover Magazine| author=[[Corey S.

It has been suggested that a supernova or gamma ray burst caused the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]] extinction.&lt;ref name="Melott &amp; Thomas 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Melott, A.

====Geomagnetic reversal====
One theory is that periods of increased [[geomagnetic reversal]]s will weaken [[Earth's magnetic field]] long enough to expose the atmosphere to the [[solar wind]]s, causing oxygen ions to escape the atmosphere in a rate increased by 3–4 orders, resulting in a disastrous decrease in oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Oxygen escape from the Earth during geomagnetic reversals: Implications to mass extinction|first1=Yong|last1=Wei|first2=Zuyin|last2=Pu|first3=Qiugang|last3=Zong|first4=Weixing|last4=Wan|first5=Zhipeng|last5=Ren|first6=Markus|last6=Fraenz|first7=Eduard|last7=Dubinin|first8=Feng|last8=Tian|first9=Quanqi|last9=Shi|first10=Suiyan|last10=Fu|first11=Minghua|last11=Hong|date=1 May 2014|publisher=|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=394|pages=94–98|via=NASA ADS|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2014.03.018|bibcode=2014E&amp;PSL.394...94W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plate tectonics====
Movement of the continents into some configurations can cause or contribute to extinctions in several ways: by initiating or ending [[ice age]]s; by changing ocean and wind currents and thus altering climate; by opening seaways or land bridges which expose previously isolated species to competition for which they are poorly adapted (for example, the extinction of most of South America's [[Meridiungulata|native ungulates]] and all of its [[Sparassodonta|large metatherians]] after the [[Great American Interchange|creation of a land bridge between North and South America]]). Occasionally continental drift creates a super-continent which includes the vast majority of Earth's land area, which in addition to the effects listed above is likely to reduce the total area of [[continental shelf]] (the most species-rich part of the ocean) and produce a vast, arid continental interior which may have extreme seasonal variations.

Another theory is that the creation of the super-continent [[Pangaea]] contributed to the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]] mass extinction. Pangaea was almost fully formed at the transition from mid-Permian to late-Permian, and the "Marine genus diversity" diagram at the top of this article shows a level of extinction starting at that time which might have qualified for inclusion in the "Big Five" if it were not overshadowed by the "Great Dying" at the end of the Permian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Speculated Causes of the Permian Extinction |publisher=Hooper Virtual Paleontological Museum |url=http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/permcause.html |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other hypotheses====
Many other hypotheses have been proposed, such as the spread of a new disease, or simple out-competition following an especially successful biological innovation. But all have been rejected, usually for one of the following reasons: they require events or processes for which there is no evidence; they assume mechanisms which are contrary to the available evidence; they are based on other theories which have been rejected or superseded.

Scientists have been concerned that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past. Along with human-made changes in climate (see above), some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting, overfishing, invasive species, or habitat loss. A study published in May 2017 in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' argued that a “biological annihilation” akin to a sixth mass extinction event is underway as a result of anthropogenic causes, such as [[Human overpopulation|over-population]] and [[Overconsumption|over-consumption]]. The study suggested that as much as 50% of the number of animal individuals that once lived on Earth were already extinct, threatening the basis for human existence too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ceballos|first=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R.|last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=2017-07-10|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|pages=E6089–E6096|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704949114|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5544311|pmid=28696295|volume=114|issue=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutter"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sutter|first=John D.|date=July 11, 2017|title=Sixth mass extinction: The era of 'biological annihilation'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/world/sutter-mass-extinction-ceballos-study/index.html|work=[[CNN]]|location= |access-date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future biosphere extinction/sterilization====
{{See also|Future of Earth| Medea hypothesis|Fermi paradox}}
The eventual warming and expanding of the Sun, combined with the eventual decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide could actually cause an even greater mass extinction, having the potential to wipe out even microbes (in other words, the Earth is completely sterilized), where rising global temperatures caused by the expanding Sun will gradually increase the rate of weathering, which in turn removes more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When carbon dioxide levels get too low (perhaps at 50 ppm), all plant life will die out, although simpler plants like grasses and mosses can survive much longer, until {{CO2}} levels drop to 10 ppm.&lt;ref name= Franck2005&gt;{{cite journal

With all photosynthetic organisms gone, atmospheric oxygen can no longer be replenished, and is eventually removed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, perhaps from volcanic eruptions. Eventually the loss of oxygen will cause all remaining aerobic life to die out via asphyxiation, leaving behind only simple anaerobic prokaryotes. When the Sun becomes 10% brighter in about a billion years,&lt;ref name= Franck2005/&gt; Earth will suffer a moist greenhouse effect resulting in its oceans boiling away, while the Earth's liquid outer core cools due to the inner core's expansion and causes the Earth's magnetic field to shut down. In the absence of a magnetic field, charged particles from the Sun will deplete the atmosphere and further increase the Earth's temperature to an average of ~420 K (147&amp;nbsp;°C, 296&amp;nbsp;°F) in 2.8 billion years, causing the last remaining life on Earth to die out. This is the most extreme instance of a climate-caused extinction event. Since this will only happen late in the Sun's life, such will cause the final mass extinction in Earth's history (albeit a very long extinction event).&lt;ref name= Franck2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward2003/&gt;

==Effects and recovery==
The impact of mass extinction events varied widely. After a major extinction event, usually only [[weed#Weeds as adaptable species|weedy species]] survive due to their ability to live in diverse habitats.&lt;ref name=Quammen&gt;{{Cite web |title=Planet of Weeds |author=David Quammen |work=Harper's Magazine |date=October 1998 |url= http://sep.csumb.edu/class/ESSP645/readings/Quammen%201998.pdf |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, species diversify and occupy empty niches. Generally, [[biodiversity]] recovers 5 to 10 million years after the extinction event. In the most severe mass extinctions it may take 15 to 30 million years.&lt;ref name="Quammen" /&gt;

The worst event, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic extinction]], devastated life on earth, killing over 90% of species. Life seemed to recover quickly after the P-T extinction, but this was mostly in the form of [[pioneer organism|disaster taxa]], such as the hardy ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The most recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems, with high biodiversity, complex food webs and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. It is thought that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction which inhibited recovery, as well as prolonged environmental stress which continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction;&lt;ref name="LehrmannRamezanBowring2006TimingOfRecovery"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Timing of recovery from the end-Permian extinction: Geochronologic and biostratigraphic constraints from south China | author=Lehrmann | journal=Geology |date=December 2006 | volume=34 | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/12/1053 | pages=1053–1056 | doi=10.1130/G22827A.1 | issue=12 |bibcode = 2006Geo....34.1053L | author2=D.J. | author3=Ramezan | author4=J. | author5=Bowring | author6=S.A. | display-authors=6 | last7=Payne | first7=Jonathan L. | last8=Orchard | first8=Michael J. | last9=Hongmei | first9=Wang }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30M years after the P-T extinction, i.e. in the late Triassic.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759 | author1=Sahney, S.|author2= Benton, M.J. |authorlink2= Michael Benton| year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65 | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent to the P-T extinction, there was an increase in provincialization, with species occupying smaller ranges – perhaps removing incumbents from niches and setting the stage for an eventual rediversification.&lt;ref name="Sidor2013"&gt;{{cite journal  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1302323110  | title = Provincialization of terrestrial faunas following the end-Permian mass extinction  | year = 2013  | last1 = Sidor | first1 = C.

The effects of mass extinctions on plants are somewhat harder to quantify, given the biases inherent in the plant fossil record. Some mass extinctions (such as the end-Permian) were equally catastrophic for plants, whereas others, such as the end-Devonian, did not affect the flora.&lt;ref name="Cascales-Miñana2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cascales-Miñana | first1 = B. | last2 = Cleal | first2 = C.

'''Fluorescence recovery after [[photobleaching]]''' (FRAP) is a method for determining the kinetics of diffusion through tissue or cells. It is capable of quantifying the two dimensional lateral diffusion of a molecularly thin film containing fluorescently labeled probes, or to examine single cells. This technique is very useful in biological studies of [[cell membrane]] diffusion and protein binding. In addition, surface deposition of a fluorescing [[phospholipid]] bilayer (or monolayer) allows the characterization of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (or [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]) surfaces in terms of surface structure and free energy.

Similar, though less well known, techniques have been developed to investigate the 3-dimensional [[diffusion]] and [[binding (molecular)|binding]] of molecules inside the cell; they are also referred to as FRAP.

==Experimental Setup==

The basic apparatus comprises an [[optical microscope]], a [[List of light sources|light source]] and some [[fluorescent]] probe. [[Fluorescence|Fluorescent emission]] is contingent upon absorption of a specific optical wavelength or color which restricts the choice of lamps. Most commonly, a broad [[spectrum]] [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[xenon]] source is used in conjunction with a color filter. The technique begins by saving a background image of the sample before photobleaching. Next, the light source is focused onto a small patch of the viewable area either by switching to a higher magnification microscope objective or with [[laser]] light of the appropriate wavelength. The fluorophores in this region receive high intensity illumination which causes their fluorescence lifetime to quickly elapse (limited to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; photons before extinction). Now the image in the microscope is that of a uniformly fluorescent field with a noticeable dark spot. As Brownian motion proceeds, the still-fluorescing probes will diffuse throughout the sample and replace the non-fluorescent probes in the bleached region. This diffusion proceeds in an ordered fashion, analytically determinable from the [[diffusion equation]]. Assuming a [[Gaussian beam|Gaussian]] profile for the bleaching beam, the diffusion constant ''D'' can be simply calculated from:

:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{w^{2}}{4t_{D}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w'' is the radius of the beam and ''t&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the "Characteristic" diffusion time.&lt;ref name="Axelrod"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(76)85755-4 |journal=Biophysical Journal |title=Mobility measurement by analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery kinetics |date=1976 |last1=Axelrod |first1=D |last2=Koppel |first2=D |last3=Schlessinger |first3=J |last4=Elson |first4=E |last5=Webb |first5=W |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=1055–69 |pmid=786399 |pmc=1334945|bibcode=1976BpJ....16.1055A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sprague1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1529/biophysj.103.026765 |title=Analysis of Binding Reactions by Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching |date=2004 |last1=Sprague |first1=Brian L. |last2=Pego |first2=Robert L. |last3=Stavreva |first3=Diana A. |last4=McNally |first4=James G. |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=3473–95 |pmid=15189848 |pmc=1304253|bibcode=2004BpJ....86.3473S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Supported Lipid Bilayers===

Originally, the FRAP  technique was intended for use as a means to characterize the mobility of individual lipid molecules within a cell membrane.&lt;ref name="Axelrod" /&gt; While providing great utility in this role, current research leans more toward investigation of artificial lipid membranes. Supported by hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates (to produce lipid bilayers or monolayers respectively) and incorporating [[membrane proteins]], these biomimetic structures are potentially useful as analytical devices for determining the identity of unknown substances, understanding cellular transduction, and identifying ligand binding sites.

===Protein Binding===
This technique is commonly used in conjunction with [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) [[fusion protein]]s, where the studied protein is fused to a GFP.  When excited by a specific wavelength of light, the protein will fluoresce.&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Kou Qin |author2=Chunmin Dong |author3=Guangyu Wu |author4=Nevin A Lambert |date=August 2011      | title = Inactive-state preassembly of Gq-coupled receptors and Gq heterotrimers| journal = Nature Chemical Biology  | volume =  7 | issue = 11  | pages =740–747  | doi=10.1038/nchembio.642 | pmid=21873996 | pmc=3177959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the protein that is being studied is produced with the GFP, then the fluorescence can be tracked.  Photodestroying the GFP, and then watching the repopulation into the bleached area can reveal information about protein interaction partners, organelle continuity and protein trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23042527 |date=2012|last1=Day|first1=CA |last2=Kraft|first2=LJ |last3=Kang|first3=M|last4=Kenworthy|first4=AK|title=Analysis of protein and lipid dynamics using confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)|pages=2–19|journal=Current Protocols in Cytometry|doi=10.1002/0471142956.cy0219s62 |volume=Chapter 2 |pmc=3538152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If after some time the fluorescence doesn't reach the initial level anymore, then some part of the fluorescence is caused by an immobile fraction (that cannot be replenished by diffusion).  Similarly, if the fluorescent proteins bind to static cell receptors, the rate of recovery will be retarded by a factor related to the association and disassociation coefficients of binding.  This observation has most recently been exploited to investigate protein binding.&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23900248 |date=2013|last1=Mazza|first1=D|last2=Mueller|first2=F|last3=Stasevich|first3=TJ|last4=McNally|first4=JG|title=Convergence of chromatin binding estimates in live cells|pages=691–2|volume=10|issue=8|journal=Nat Methods|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" pmid=18434433"&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Kou Qin |author2=Pooja R.

==Applications Outside the Membrane==
FRAP can also be used to monitor proteins outside the membrane.  After the protein of interest is made fluorescent, generally by expression as a GFP fusion protein, a [[confocal microscope]] is used to photobleach and monitor a region of the [[cytoplasm]],&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"/&gt; [[mitotic spindle]], [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], or another cellular structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19005234 |date=2008 |last1=Tripathi |first1=K |last2=Parnaik |first2=VK |title=Differential dynamics of splicing factor SC35 during the cell cycle |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=345–54 |journal=Journal of Biosciences |doi=10.1007/s12038-008-0054-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean fluorescence in the region can then be plotted versus time since the photobleaching, and the resulting curve can yield kinetic coefficients, such as those for the protein's binding reactions and/or the protein's diffusion coefficient in the medium where it is being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16080269 |date=2005 |last1=Houtsmuller |first1=AB |title=Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching: Application to nuclear proteins |volume=95 |pages=177–99 |journal=Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology |doi=10.1007/b102214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the only dynamics considered are diffusion and binding/unbinding interactions, however, in principle proteins can also move via flow, i.e., undergo directed motion, and this was recognized very early by Axelrod et al.&lt;ref name="Axelrod"/&gt; This could be due to flow of the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm, or transport along filaments in the cell such as [[microtubules]] by [[molecular motors]].

The analysis is most simple when the fluorescence recovery is limited by either the rate of diffusion into the bleached area or by rate at which bleached proteins unbind from their binding sites within the bleached area, and are replaced by fluorescent protein. Let us look at these two limits, for the common case of bleaching a GFP fusion protein in a living cell.

===Diffusion-limited fluorescence recovery===
For a circular bleach spot of radius &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and diffusion-dominated recovery, the fluorescence is described by an equation derived by Soumpasis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(83)84410-5 |title=Theoretical analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery experiments |date=1983 |last1=Soumpasis |first1=D |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=41 |pages=95–7 |pmid=6824758 |issue=1 |pmc=1329018|bibcode=1983BpJ....41...95S }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which involves [[modified Bessel function]]s &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=e^{-2\tau_D/t}\left(I_{0}(2\tau_D/t)+I_{1}(2\tau_D/t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt; the characteristic timescale for diffusion, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time. &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized fluorescence (goes to 1 as &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity). The diffusion timescale for a bleached spot of radius &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tau_D=w^2/(4D)&lt;/math&gt;, with ''D'' the diffusion coefficient.

Note that this is for an instantaneous bleach with a step function profile, i.e., the fraction &lt;math&gt;f_b&lt;/math&gt; of protein assumed to be bleached instantaneously at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f_b(r)=b, ~~r&lt;w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f_b(r)=0, ~~r&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the distance from the centre of the bleached area. It is also assumes that the recovery can be modelled by diffusion in two dimensions, that is also both uniform and isotropic. In other words, that diffusion is occurring in a uniform medium so the effective diffusion constant ''D'' is the same everywhere, and that the diffusion is isotropic, i.e., occurs at the same rate along all axes in the plane.

In practice, in a cell none of these assumptions will be strictly true.

#Bleaching will not be instantaneous. Particularly if strong bleaching of a large area is required, bleaching may take a significant fraction of the diffusion timescale &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;. Then a significant fraction of the bleached protein will diffuse out of the bleached region actually during bleaching. Failing to take account of this will introduce a significant error into ''D''.&lt;ref name="yang10"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03347.x |title=An improved strip FRAP method for estimating diffusion coefficients: Correcting for the degree of photobleaching |date=2009 |last1=Yang |first1=J. |last2=Köhler |first2=K. |last3=Davis |first3=D.

#The bleached profile will not be a radial step function. If the bleached spot is effectively a single pixel then the bleaching as a function of position will typically be diffraction limited and determined by the optics of the [[confocal laser scanning microscope]] used. This is not a radial step function and also varies along the axis perpendicular to the plane.
#Cells are of course three-dimensional not two-dimensional, as is the bleached volume. Neglecting diffusion out of the plane (we take this to be the ''xy'' plane) will be a reasonable approximation only if the fluorescence recovers predominantly via diffusion in this plane. This will be true, for example, if a cylindrical volume is bleached with the axis of the cylinder along the ''z'' axis and with this cylindrical volume going through the entire height of the cell. Then diffusion along the ''z'' axis does not cause fluorescence recovery as all protein is bleached uniformly along the ''z'' axis, and so neglecting it, as Soumpasis' equation does, is harmless. However, if diffusion along the ''z'' axis does contribute to fluorescence recovery then it must be accounted for.
#There is no reason to expect the cell cytoplasm or nucleoplasm to be completely spatially uniform or isotropic.

Thus, the equation of Soumpasis is just a useful approximation, that can be used when the assumptions listed above are good approximations to the true situation, and when the recovery of fluorescence is indeed limited by the timescale of diffusion &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;. Note that just because the Soumpasis can be fitted adequately to data does not necessarily imply that the assumptions are true and that diffusion dominates recovery.

===Reaction-limited recovery===
The equation describing the fluorescence as a function of time is particularly simple in another limit. If a large number of proteins bind to sites in a small volume such that there the fluorescence signal is dominated by the signal from bound proteins, and if this binding is all in a single state with an off rate k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;, then the fluorescence as a function of time is given by&lt;ref name = "bulinski01"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11719555 |date=2001 |last1=Bulinski |first1=JC |last2=Odde |first2=DJ |last3=Howell |first3=BJ |last4=Salmon |first4=TD |last5=Waterman-Storer |first5=CM |title=Rapid dynamics of the microtubule binding of ensconsin in vivo |volume=114 |issue=Pt 21 |pages=3885–97 |journal=Journal of Cell Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=1-e^{-k_{\text{off}}t}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the recovery depends on the rate constant for unbinding, ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;'', only. It does not depend on the on rate for binding. Although it does depend on a number of assumptions&lt;ref name ="bulinski01" /&gt;
#The on rate must be sufficiently large in order for the local concentration of bound protein to greatly exceed the local concentration of free protein, and so allow us to neglect the contribution to ''f'' of the free protein.
#The reaction is a simple bimolecular reaction, where the protein binds to localised sites that do not move significantly during recovery
#Exchange is much slower than diffusion (or whatever transport mechanism is responsible for mobility), as only then does the diffusing fraction recovery rapidly and then acts as the source of fluorescent protein that binds and replaces the bound bleached protein and so increases the fluorescence. With '' r '' the radius of the bleached spot, this means that the equation is only valid if the bound lifetime &lt;math&gt;1/k_{\text{off}} &gt;&gt; r^2/D&lt;/math&gt;.
If all these assumptions are satisfied, then fitting an exponential to the recovery curve will give the off rate constant, ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;''. However, other dynamics can give recovery curves similar to exponentials, so fitting an exponential does not necessarily imply that recovery is dominated by a simple bimolecular reaction. One way to distinguish between recovery with a rate determined by unbinding  and recovery that is limited by diffusion, is to note that the recovery rate for unbinding-limited recovery is independent of the size of the bleached area ''r'', while it scales as &lt;math&gt;r^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, for diffusion-limited recovery. Thus if a small and a large area are bleached, if recovery is limited by unbinding then the recovery rates will be the same for the two sizes of bleached area, whereas if recovery is limited by diffusion then it will be much slower for the larger bleached area.

===Diffusion and reaction===

In general, the recovery of fluorescence will not be dominated by either simple isotropic diffusion, or by a single simple unbinding rate. There will be both diffusion and binding, and indeed the diffusion constant may not be uniform in space, and there may be more than one type of binding sites, and these sites may also have a non-uniform distribution in space. Flow processes may also be important. This more complex behavior implies that a model with several parameters is required to describe the data; models with only either a single diffusion constant ''D'' or a single off rate constant, ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;'', are inadequate.

There are models with both diffusion and reaction.&lt;ref name="sprague1"/&gt; Unfortunately, a single FRAP curve may provide insufficient evidence to reliably and uniquely fit (possibly noisy) experimental data. Sadegh Zadeh '' et al.'' &lt;ref name="zadeh06"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1742-4682-3-36 |date=2006 |last1=Sadegh Zadeh |first1=Kouroush |last2=Montas |first2=Hubert J |last3=Shirmohammadi |first3=Adel |journal=Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling |volume=3 |pages=36 |pmid=17034642 |title=Identification of biomolecule mass transport and binding rate parameters in living cells by inverse modeling |pmc=1635038}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that FRAP curves can be fitted by ''different'' pairs of values of the diffusion constant and the on-rate constant, or, in other words, that fits to the FRAP are not unique. This is in three-parameter (on-rate constant, off-rate constant and diffusion constant) fits. Fits that are not unique, are not generally useful.

Thus for models with a number of parameters, a single FRAP experiment may be insufficient to estimate all the model parameters. Then more data is required, e.g., by bleaching areas of different sizes,&lt;ref name="gonzalez11"/&gt; determining some model parameters independently, etc.

A '''geopark''' is a unified area that advances the protection and use of geological heritage in a sustainable way, and promotes the economic well-being of the people who live there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas_Zouros/publication/258100065_Geoparks_Celebrating_earth_heritage_sustaining_local_communities/links/0deec5272cb8fee05e000000.pdf Patrick J. Mc Keever and Nickolas Zouros (2005). Geoparks: Celebrating earth heritage, sustaining local communities. EPISODES, December 2005, pp. 274–278.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are global geoparks and national geoparks.

==Concepts==
A UNESCO definition of ''global geopark'' is a unified area with a geological heritage of international significance.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/earth-sciences/global-geoparks/some-questions-about-geoparks/what-is-a-global-geopark/ |title=What is a Global Geopark? &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoparks use that heritage to promote awareness of key issues facing society in the context of our dynamic planet. Many geoparks promote awareness of geological [[hazard]]s, including [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s and many help prepare [[disaster]] mitigation strategies with [[Local community|local communities]]. Geoparks embody records of past climate changes and are indicators of current [[climate change]]s as well as demonstrating a "best practise" approach to using renewable energy and employing the best standards of "[[green tourism]]". [[Tourism]] industry promotion in geoparks, as a geographically sustainable and applicable tourism model, aims to sustain, and even enhance, the geographical character of a place.

Geoparks also inform about the sustainable use and need for [[natural resource]]s, whether they are mined, quarried or harnessed from the surrounding [[Natural environment|environment]] while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the [[landscape]]. Geoparks are not a legislative designation though the key heritage sites within a geopark are often protected under local, regional or national legislation.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark" /&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of the concept of geopark and tourism promotion in geoparks differentiates itself from other models of [[sustainable tourism]]. In fact, sustainable tourism promotion within geoparks encompasses many of the features of sustainable tourism including geo-tourism (geo-site tourism: as a basic factor), community-based tourism and integrated rural tourism (as a vital need), [[ecotourism]], and [[cultural heritage]] tourism.

==Global Network and UNESCO==
The [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) is supported by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). Many national geoparks and other local geoparks projects also exist which are not included in the Global Geoparks Network.

The geoparks initiative was launched by UNESCO in response to the perceived need for an international initiative that recognizes sites representing an [[earth science]] interest.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About—UNESCO's role in geopark initiative |url=http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |publisher=Geopark Iskar Panega |year=2007 |work=Geopark Iskar Panega website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025602/http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |archivedate=2014-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Geoparks Network  aims at enhancing the value of such sites while at the same time creating [[employment]] and promoting regional [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt; The Global Geoparks Network works in synergy with UNESCO's [[World Heritage]] Centre and [[Man and the Biosphere]] (MAB) World Network of Biosphere Reserves.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt;

===Qualification===
The Global Geoparks Network (GGN) is a UNESCO activity established in 1998. According to UNESCO, for a geopark to apply to be included in the GGN, it needs to:

* have a management plan designed to foster socio-economic development that is [[sustainable]] based on [[geotourism]]
* demonstrate methods for conserving and enhancing geological heritage and provide means for teaching geoscientific disciplines and broader environmental issues
* have joint proposals submitted by public authorities, local communities and private interests acting together, which demonstrate the best practices with respect to Earth heritage conservation and its integration into [[sustainable development]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;'April 2010 GEO4B/PM Advanced Level Examination - Advanced Information Booklet'&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}

A '''hypothesis''' (plural '''hypotheses''') is a proposed [[explanation]] for a [[phenomenon]]. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the [[scientific method]] requires that one can [[testable|test]] it. [[Scientist]]s generally base scientific hypotheses on previous [[observation]]s that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words "hypothesis" and "[[theory]]" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a [[scientific theory]]. A [[working hypothesis]] is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further [[research]],&lt;ref name="HilbornMangel1997"/&gt; in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought.&lt;ref name=Feynman /&gt; 

A different meaning of the term ''hypothesis'' is used in [[formal logic]], to denote the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of a [[proposition]]; thus in the proposition "If ''P'', then ''Q''", ''P'' denotes the hypothesis (or antecedent); ''Q'' can be called a [[consequent]]. ''P'' is the [[:wikt:assumption|assumption]] in a (possibly [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]]) ''[[wikt:what if|What If]]'' question.

The adjective ''hypothetical'', meaning "having the nature of a hypothesis", or "being assumed to exist as an immediate consequence of a hypothesis", can refer to any of these meanings of the term "hypothesis".

==Uses==

In its ancient usage, ''[[Hypothesis (drama)|hypothesis]]'' referred to a summary of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical drama]]. The English word ''hypothesis'' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ὑπόθεσις|ὑπόθεσις]] word ''hupothesis'', meaning "to put under" or "to suppose".&lt;ref name="HilbornMangel1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hilborn |first1=Ray |last2=Mangel |first2=Marc |title=The ecological detective: confronting models with data |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=katmvQDi8PMC&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=22 August 2011 |year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03497-3 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno]]'' (86e–87b), [[Socrates]] dissects [[virtue]] with a method used by mathematicians,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wilbur Knorr|Wilbur R. Knorr]], "Construction as existence proof in ancient geometry", p. 125, as selected by Jean Christianidis (ed.), ''Classics in the history of Greek mathematics'', Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt; that of "investigating from a hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt; [[Gregory Vlastos]], Myles Burnyeat (1994) ''Socratic studies'', Cambridge {{ISBN|0-521-44735-6}}, p. 1 &lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, 'hypothesis' refers to a clever idea or to a convenient mathematical approach that simplifies cumbersome [[calculation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Neutral hypotheses, those of which the subject matter can never be directly proved or disproved, are very numerous in all sciences." — [[Morris Raphael Cohen|Morris Cohen]] and  [[Ernest Nagel]] (1934) ''An introduction to logic and scientific method'' p. 375. New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmine]] gave a famous example of this usage in the warning issued to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] in the early 17th century: that he must not treat the motion of the Earth as a reality, but merely as a hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"Bellarmine (Ital. ''Bellarmino''), Roberto Francesco Romolo", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition.: 'Bellarmine did not proscribe the Copernican system ... all he claimed was that it should be presented as a hypothesis until it should receive scientific demonstration.' {{EB1911|wstitle=Hypothesis|volume=14|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage in the 21st century, a ''hypothesis'' refers to a provisional idea whose merit requires evaluation. For proper evaluation, the framer of a hypothesis needs to define specifics in operational terms. A hypothesis requires more work by the researcher in order to either confirm or disprove it. In due course, a confirmed hypothesis may become part of a theory or occasionally may grow to become a theory itself. Normally, scientific hypotheses have the form of a [[mathematical model]].&lt;ref&gt;Crease, Robert P.  (2008) ''The Great Equations'' {{ISBN|978-0-393-06204-5}},  p.112 lists the [[conservation of energy]] as an example of accounting a [[constant of motion]]. Hypothesized by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], truth demonstrated by [[James Prescott Joule]], proven by [[Emmy Noether]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, but not always, one can also formulate them as [[existential quantification|existential statements]], stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon under examination has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of [[Universal quantification|universal statements]], stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

In entrepreneurial science, a hypothesis is used to formulate provisional ideas within a business setting. The formulated hypothesis is then evaluated where either the hypothesis is proven to be "true" or "false" through a [[Authentication|verifiability]]- or [[falsifiability]]-oriented [[experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything Harvard Business Review (2013) "Why Lean Startup Changes Everything"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grasshopperherder.com/success-metric-vs-fail-condition-to-the-pain/ Tristan Kromer 2014 "Success Metric vs. Fail Condition"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanstartup.pbworks.com/w/page/65946049/Intro%20to%20Lean%20Startup Lean Startup Circle "What is Lean Startup?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any useful hypothesis will enable [[prediction]]s by [[reasoning]] (including [[deductive reasoning]]). It might predict the outcome of an [[experiment]] in a [[laboratory]] setting or the observation of a phenomenon in [[nature]]. The prediction may also invoke statistics and only talk about probabilities. [[Karl Popper]], following others, has argued that a hypothesis must be [[falsificationism|falsifiable]], and that one cannot regard a proposition or theory as scientific if it does not admit the possibility of being shown false. Other philosophers of science have rejected the criterion of falsifiability or supplemented it with other criteria, such as verifiability (e.g., [[verificationism]]) or coherence (e.g., [[confirmation holism]]). The [[scientific method]] involves experimentation, to test the ability of some hypothesis to adequately answer the question under investigation. In contrast, unfettered observation is not as likely to raise unexplained issues or open questions in science, as would the formulation of a [[crucial experiment]] to test the hypothesis. A [[thought experiment]] might also be used to test the hypothesis as well.

In framing a hypothesis, the investigator must not currently know the outcome of a test or that it remains reasonably under continuing investigation. Only in such cases does the experiment, test or study potentially increase the probability of showing the truth of a hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp17,49–50}} If the researcher already knows the outcome, it counts as a "consequence" — and the researcher should have already considered this while formulating the hypothesis. If one cannot assess the predictions by observation or by [[experience]], the hypothesis needs to be tested by others providing observations. For example, a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible.

==Scientific hypothesis==
People refer to a trial solution to a problem as a hypothesis, often called an "[[educated guess]]"&lt;ref&gt;
"When it is not clear under which law of nature an effect or class of effect belongs, we try to fill this gap by means of a guess. Such guesses have been given the name ''conjectures'' or ''hypotheses''.", [[Hans Christian Ørsted]](1811) "First Introduction to General Physics" ¶18. ''Selected Scientific Works of Hans Christian Ørsted'', {{ISBN|0-691-04334-5}} p.297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman &gt;"In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. ...", —[[Richard Feynman]] (1965) ''[[The Character of Physical Law]]'' p.156&lt;/ref&gt; because it provides a suggested outcome based on the evidence. However, some scientists reject the term "educated guess" as incorrect. Experimenters may test and reject several hypotheses before solving the problem.

According to Schick and Vaughn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schick, Theodore |authorlink1=Theodore Schick |author2=Vaughn, Lewis |title=How to think about weird things: critical thinking for a New Age |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |location=Boston |year=2002 |isbn=0-7674-2048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers weighing up alternative hypotheses may take into consideration:
* [[Testability]] (compare [[falsifiability]] as discussed above)
* Parsimony (as in the application of "[[Occam's razor]]", discouraging the postulation of excessive numbers of [[entity|entities]])
* Scope – the apparent application of the hypothesis to multiple cases of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]
* Fruitfulness – the prospect that a hypothesis may explain further phenomena in the future
* Conservatism – the degree of "fit" with existing recognized knowledge-systems.

==Working hypothesis==
{{main|Working hypothesis}}
A [[working hypothesis]] is a hypothesis that is provisionally accepted as a basis for further research&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science &amp; Medicine''. [http://www.answers.com/topic/working-hypothesis Eprint] via Answers.com.&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that a tenable theory will be produced, even if the hypothesis ultimately fails.&lt;ref name=Century&gt;See in "hypothesis", ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'', v. 1, 1909, New York: [[The Century Company]]. Reprinted, [https://archive.org/stream/centurydictionar11whituoft#page/616/mode/1up v. 11, p. 616] (via ''Internet Archive'') of the ''Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia'', 1911. {{quote|'''hypothesis''' [...]—'''Working hypothesis''', a hypothesis suggested or supported in some measure by features of observed facts, from which consequences may be deduced which can be tested by experiment and special observations, and which it is proposed to subject to an extended course of such investigation, with the hope that, even should the hypothesis thus be overthrown, such research may lead to a tenable theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like all hypotheses, a working hypothesis is constructed as a statement of expectations, which can be linked to the [[exploratory research]] purpose in empirical investigation. Working hypotheses are often used as a [[conceptual framework]] in qualitative research.&lt;ref&gt;

The provisional nature of working hypotheses make them useful as an organizing device in applied research. Here they act like a useful guide to address problems that are still in a formative phase.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]] and Nandhini Rangarajan. 2013. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false.  ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. pp. 109–157&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, philosophers of science have tried to integrate the various approaches to evaluating hypotheses, and the scientific method in general, to form a more complete system that integrates the individual concerns of each approach. Notably, [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], Karl Popper's colleague and student, respectively, have produced novel attempts at such a synthesis.

==Hypotheses, concepts and measurement==
[[Concept]]s in Hempel's [[deductive-nomological model]] play a key role in the development and testing of hypotheses. Most formal hypotheses connect concepts by specifying the expected relationships between [[proposition]]s. When a set of hypotheses are grouped together they become a type of [[conceptual framework]]. When a [[conceptual framework]] is complex and incorporates causality or explanation it is generally referred to as a theory. According to noted philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] "An adequate empirical interpretation turns a theoretical system into a testable theory: The hypothesis whose constituent terms have been interpreted become capable of test by reference to observable phenomena. Frequently the interpreted hypothesis will be derivative hypotheses of the theory; but their confirmation or disconfirmation by empirical data will then immediately strengthen or weaken also the primitive hypotheses from which they were derived."&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Hempel provides a useful metaphor that describes the relationship between a [[conceptual framework]] and the framework as it is observed and perhaps tested (interpreted framework).  "The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of those interpretative connections, the network can function as a scientific theory."&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheses with concepts anchored in the plane of observation are ready to be tested. In "actual scientific practice the process of framing a theoretical structure and of interpreting it are not always sharply separated, since the intended interpretation usually guides the construction of the theoretician."&lt;ref name="Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33"&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, "possible and indeed desirable, for the purposes of logical clarification, to separate the two steps conceptually."&lt;ref name="Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33"/&gt;

===Statistical hypothesis testing===
{{Main|Statistical hypothesis testing}}
When a possible [[correlation]] or similar relation between phenomena is investigated, such as whether a proposed remedy is effective in treating a disease, the hypothesis that a relation exists cannot be examined the same way one might examine a proposed new law of nature. In such an investigation, if the tested remedy shows no effect in a few cases, these do not necessarily falsify the hypothesis. Instead, [[statistical test]]s are used to determine how likely it is that the overall effect would be observed if the hypothesized relation does not exist. If that likelihood is sufficiently small (e.g., less than 1%), the existence of a relation may be assumed. Otherwise, any observed effect may be due to pure chance.

In statistical hypothesis testing, two hypotheses are compared. These are called the [[null hypothesis]] and the [[alternative hypothesis]]. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that states that there is no relation between the phenomena whose relation is under investigation, or at least not of the form given by the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis, as the name suggests, is the alternative to the null hypothesis: it states that there ''is'' some kind of relation. The alternative hypothesis may take several forms, depending on the nature of the hypothesized relation; in particular, it can be two-sided (for example: there is ''some'' effect, in a yet unknown direction) or one-sided (the direction of the hypothesized relation, positive or negative, is fixed in advance).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&amp;f=false Altman. DG., ''Practical Statistics for Medical Research'', CRC Press, 1990, Section 8.5,]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional significance levels for testing hypotheses (acceptable probabilities of wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis) are .10, .05, and .01. The significance level for deciding whether the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted must be determined in advance, before the observations are collected or inspected. If these criteria are determined later, when the data to be tested are already known, the test is invalid.&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, 2008"&gt;Mellenbergh, G.J.(2008). Chapter 8: Research designs: Testing of research hypotheses. In [[H.J. Adèr]] &amp; [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|G.J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.) (with contributions by D.J. Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183-209). Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The above procedure is actually dependent on the number of the participants (units or [[sample size]]) that are included in the study. For instance, to avoid having the sample size be too small to reject a null hypothesis, it is recommended that one specify a sufficient sample size from the beginning. It is advisable to define a small, medium and large effect size for each of a number of important statistical tests which are used to test the hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&amp;f=false Altman.

[[File:St John the Baptist, Great East Window of York Minster, by John Thornton.jpg|thumb|right|Thornton's depiction of [[St John the Baptist]], from the Great East Window of [[York Minster]], showing his characteristic treatment of faces]]
'''John Thornton''' of [[Coventry]] ([[floruit|fl]]. 1405-1433) was a master [[glazier]] and [[stained glass]] artist active in England during the 15th century. The output of his workshop includes some of the finest English medieval glass.

==Biography==
The first certain record of Thornton, apart from a possible 1371 reference in Coventry, is his 1405 contract with the Dean of [[York Minster]] to glaze the choir east window.&lt;ref name=sge180&gt;Marks, R. ''Stained Glass in England during the Middle Ages'', Routledge, 1993, p.180&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of York]] at the time was [[Richard le Scrope]], a former [[Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry]], and the window was funded by [[Walter Skirlaw]], also previously Bishop of Coventry, so it seems possible both men would have recommended Thornton based on their knowledge of his work in his home town.

Thornton was made a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] of York in 1410, but was known to be back living in the St John's Bridges area of Coventry (now known as Burges&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=16006&lt;/ref&gt;) by 1413. He appears again in 1433, when he received further payment from the dean and chapter of York, and was recorded as holding property there.&lt;ref name="sge180"/&gt;

It has been suggested, though without any strong evidence, that Thornton was the son of a "John Coventre", a glazier in the royal glass-painting workshops at Westminster in 1351 and 1352, who later assisted in setting up windows at [[Windsor Castle]] for [[Edward III of England]]. Thornton could have worked as an assistant to his father before rising to the position of designer and draughtsman.&lt;ref name=nq&gt;Knowles, J. 'John Thornton of Coventry', ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 140, 481&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Thornton was instrumental in disseminating the [[International Gothic]] style in the north and Midlands of England. The products of his workshop can be recognised by their favouring of white glass and [[silver nitrate|yellow stain]] set against blue and ruby "seaweed"-patterned backgrounds, and by the very distinctive modelling of faces.&lt;ref name=sge183&gt;Marks, p.183. Thornton's treatment of faces was expressive, using relatively heavy shading, and generally features small mouths and rather elongated noses with a bulbous tip.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thornton's masterpiece is the Great East Window of York Minster, the largest in the building and containing about {{convert|1680|sqft|m2}} of glass. According to the contract, much of the work was to be executed by his own hand, though specifically only to "pourtray [...] the histories, images, and other things to be painted on the [window]"; evidently some of the glazing would be carried out by apprentices or workmen.&lt;ref name=blair280&gt;Blair, J and Ramsay, N. ''English Medieval Industries'', CIP, 1991, p.280&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton is likely to have recruited glaziers locally in York: he seems to have been an enthusiastic teacher, and his style quickly became dominant in the area.&lt;ref name=marks182&gt;Marks, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

Work thought to be by Thornton can also be found in several smaller churches, as well as in [[St Mary's Guildhall|St Mary's Hall]] in Coventry. His surviving windows for [[Coventry Cathedral]] were removed before it was destroyed in the [[Coventry Blitz]] and have been preserved.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2002/08/cathedral-stained-glass.shtml A rare glimpse of unseen cathedral stained glass]'', [[BBC]], 23-08-02&lt;/ref&gt; He is also thought to have produced the windows from the chapel at [[Hampton Court, Herefordshire]], which are now dispersed in various collections, and seven panels in the [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent]].

The Thornton 'tradition' continued in York even after the middle of the 15th century, though many of the works produced show a coarsening or loss of quality compared with Thornton's authentic creations.&lt;ref name=sge185186&gt;Marks, pp.185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jérôme Lefèvre''' is an independent art curator and art critic.

In the late 1990s Lefèvre curated a series of cinema programs with films by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Marie Menken]], [[Tony Conrad]], [[Robert Whitaker (photographer)|Robert Whitaker]], [[Richard Kern]] and Henry Hills. At the same time he curated the exhibition "Sound Games" &lt;ref&gt;(Centre Noroit, Arras, France)&lt;/ref&gt; with artists [[Frédéric Le Junter]], [[Pierre Bastien]] and Arnaud Labelle-Rojoux as well as contemporary music composers. 
In 2004, Lefèvre co-organized "Meanwhile in the real world" at the Sorbonne Chapell where he curated works by [[Franz West]], [[Olaf Breuning]], [[Jean-Michel Othoniel]], Fabrice Gygi and Alex McQuilkin. 
He curated two successive exhibitions at the Palais d'Iéna in Paris : "Pearls Of The North" (with artists [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Atelier Van Lieshout]], Joris van de Moortel, Kelly Schacht, The Plug, Anne Wenzel and Scarlett Hooft Graafland) and "Unlimited Bodies" (with [[Marnie Weber]], [[Tony Oursler]], [[Steven Claydon]], Don Brown, Edward Lipski, Stephan Balkenhol, Damien Deroubaix as well as [[Lucy+Jorge Orta]].

== Contemporary art and heavy metal ==

Lefèvre's work as a curator and a writer focuses on the links between contemporary art and music cultures.  A [[grindcore]] musician himself, he is particularly interested in the imbrications between contemporary art and heavy metal music and culture.

He founded [[C.S. (Conservative Shithead) Journal]] with artist [[Damien Deroubaix]] ([[Marcel Duchamp Prize]] 2009 nominee). C.S. Journal is a monographic publication each time dedicated to a visual artist in regards with its musical references in extreme metal music. The first C.S. Journal issue (with Damien Deroubaix) sorted out for the FIAC, Contemporary Art Fair in Paris in 2009 and contained contributions by legendary [[Mick Harris]] ([[Napalm Death]], Scorn) and [[Jeffrey Walker]] (Carcass).
The second issue  had been conceived by artist Elodie Lesourd and feature contributions by [[Fenriz]] ([[Darkthrone]]) and Hunter Hunt-Hendrix (Liturgy). The third issue is the work of [[Steven Shearer]] with Dieter Roelstraete (MCA Chicago) and Marky Marquis (Coroner) had been published for the 54th [[Venice Biennale]] where Steven Shearer represented Canada.

Lefèvre regularly contributes to magazines and books on the topic. He is the author of an essay on this generation of artists in the book "Black-Metal : Beyond the Darkness" together with Nick Richardson and Brandon Stosuy.

He also exhibited in 2009 the work of photographer [[Seldon Hunt]] (artist and author of art covers for [[Sunn O)))]], [[Earth (American band)]] and [[The Melvins]]) at Galerie du Jour - agnès b. in Paris.

'''Józef Tadeusz Milik''' (Seroczyn, [[Poland]], March 24, 1922 – [[Paris]], January 6, 2006) was a Polish [[biblical scholar]] and a Catholic priest, well-known researcher of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (DSS) through the deserts of Judea/Jordana, and translator and editor of Enoch book in Aramaic (fragments).&lt;ref&gt;Martinez/Tigchelaar (1999). [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7xcvitgyGmgU0sxOVV3SXVBZTQ/view?usp=sharing The Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was fluent in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[English language|English]] besides his native [[Polish language|Polish]], plus many ancient and dead languages including Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Aramaic, Syriac, old ''church'' Slavonic, Arabic, Georgian, Ugaritic, Akkadian, Sumerian, Egyptian, and Hittite.

==Biography==
He was born into a peasant family in a small village in central [[Poland]]. His father, despite being a farmer, was interested in science, educated himself and gathered a rich library. He influenced his son, who finished the gymnasium in [[Siedlce]] and later entered the theological college in [[Płock]] in 1939. When the college was closed by Germans after they invaded Poland, he moved to Warsaw. After the [[World War II]], he studied at [[Catholic University of Lublin]] and in 1946 was ordained a priest.

Józef Milik deciphered hundreds of the texts of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] as a member of the publication team. He started translating and publishing them in the early 1950s while a student at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-artifacts/dead-sea-scrolls/cast-of-characters/&lt;/ref&gt;

Then he joined [[Roland de Vaux]]’s team and helped to discover Cave 3, excavated and unearthed hundreds of fragments from Cave 4, and took part in the discovery and excavations of Caves 5 and 6. He later became one of the most essential participants of the translation and publication team.

== Research ==
Folta's laboratory has two primary research areas: [[photomorphogenesis|controlling plant traits using light]], and using genomics to identify molecular markers for key fruit-plant traits.

=== Plants and light ===
Folta's work with light began in 1987, while working with genes associated with the [[phytochrome]] response in plants. This research resulted in the discovery that exposure to blue light mediates specific gene responses and physiology in the plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' through [[cryptochrome]] and [[phototropin]] receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=The Plant Journal | volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=471–478 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01038.x | last1=Folta | first1=Kevin M. | last2=Spalding | first2=Edgar P. | title=Unexpected roles for cryptochrome 2 and phototropin revealed by high-resolution analysis of blue light-mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition. | date=2001 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.01038.x/full | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Folta has continued this work to explore new findings in how plants grow and move in green-enriched environments, which are the challenging conditions in which plants have to grow while under the shade of other plants, and the unusual effects this produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=EurekAlert! | url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-01/ajob-sjf010213.php | title=Scientists join forces to bring plant movement to light | author=American Journal of Botany | date=2 January 2013 | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in plant biology would later extend to using [[light emitting diodes]] (LEDs) to control specific attributes of plants, such as quality, flavor, aroma, nutrition, and texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.futurity.org/fruit-could-taste-better-with-far-red-light/ | work=Futurity | title=Fruit Could Taste Better With Far-Red Light | last=Anderson-Florida | first=Mickie | date=24 July 2013 | accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decoded" /&gt; On this, Folta says that each plant's genetic makeup gives it a certain genetic potential that can be altered by selection or genetic modification, but how this potential is reached depends on environmental conditions that can be manipulated through [[photomorphogenesis]]. He says this depends entirely on how genes that are responsible for controlling the plant's growth are activated or deactivated in response to light.&lt;ref name="Decoded"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.decodedscience.org/controlling-plants-light-leds-change-plant-growth/39190 | title=Controlling Plants with Light: LEDs to Change Plant Growth | work=Decoded Science | last=Latchman | first=David | date=19 November 2013 | accessdate=2 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folta believes this research would be of interest to farmers wanting to get the most genetic potential out of their crops without the need for chemicals or genetic modification,&lt;ref name="Decoded" /&gt; and he believes his research involving red and far-red light could be used on postharvest fruits to improve their flavor while stored in grocery stores and home refrigerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news/2013-07-flavor-scent-volatiles-fruits.html | title=Light can change flavor, scent volatiles in plants and fruits, study finds | author=[[University of Florida]] | work=[[Phys.org]] | date=23 July 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strawberry genomics and flavors ===
Folta's work in [[strawberry]] genomics began in 2002.&lt;ref name="ufgi"&gt;{{cite web | title=Sharing science: Kevin Folta’s career in horticulture, research advocacy | url=http://ufgi.ufl.edu/sharing-science-kevin-foltas-career-in-horticulture-research-advocacy/ | first=Ellison | last=Langford |  work=University of Florida Genetics Institute | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=28 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta was the contributing author in sequencing the strawberry genome in 2011.&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShulaevSargent2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shulaev|first1=Vladimir|display-authors=et al. |title=The genome of woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca)|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=43|issue=2|year=2011|pages=109–116|issn=1061-4036|doi=10.1038/ng.740|pmid=21186353|pmc=3326587}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the project, they discovered molecular markers that speed traditional breeding for enhanced flavors.&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;

Folta's more recent work with strawberries has involved identifying the compounds responsible for taste that are present in different varieties of the fruit in order to breed these characteristics back into commercial varieties; characteristics which have been lost over time due to strawberries having been bred, traditionally, to select for disease resistance, firmness, size, and yield instead of flavor.&lt;ref name="LS 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/10932-future-flavor-strawberry-genetic-code-sequenced.html | title=The Future of Flavor: Strawberry's Genetic Code Sequenced | work=[[LiveScience]] | last=Parry | first=Wynne | date=26 December 2010 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/bland-strawberries-genetic-tweak-flavor-204757153.html | title=Bland Strawberries Get a Genetic Tweak for Flavor | work=[[Yahoo! News]] | last=Perry | first=Wynne | date=4 February 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this research, his team has identified 30 compounds present in strawberries that affect its flavor, including some that resemble other fruits such as [[grape]]s and [[pineapple]]s, and 6 associated with a human's perception of sweetness.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UF 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2014/03/healthier-processed-food-essence-of-strawberry-could-be-the-key.html | title=Healthier processed food? Essence of strawberry could be the key | work=[[University of Florida]] | last=Anderson | first=Mickie | date=3 March 2014 | accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings can also be used for other staple plants in the [[Rosaceae|rose family]] such as [[peach]]es, [[almond]]s, [[apple]]s, [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[blackberry|blackberries]],&lt;ref name="LS 2010" /&gt; and contribute to a growing list of compounds that can be used in the future to produce more flavorful foods without using as much sugar.&lt;ref name="UF 2014" /&gt; Folta's research can be used to produce more flavorful and aromatic strawberries using [[selective breeding|conventional breeding techniques]], without the use of genetic modification.&lt;ref name="Yahoo 2013" /&gt;

== Science communication ==
[[File:Kevin Folta.jpg|thumb|[[The Amaz!ng Meeting]] 8 in 2010]]
Folta has formal training in communication and has been recognized for his skill by scholarly institutions.&lt;ref name="TB bio" /&gt; He uses his experience to provide workshops to teach scientists and farmers how to communicate science effectively, and engages with the public through outreach programs, the internet, and other means.&lt;ref name="TB bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.talkingbiotech.com/instructor/ | work=Talking Biotech (blog) | title=Instructor — Talking Biotech | accessdate=28 October 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220233020/http://www.talkingbiotech.com/instructor/ | archivedate=20 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;

''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' described Folta as "a gifted communicator—one of the rare scientists who has engaged the public, with over 12 years experience behind him. Not someone who merely discusses public engagement; but someone who actually communicates directly with non-expert audiences—at science fairs, in schools, at retirement homes, in blogs and podcasts."&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;

In 2016, Folta was awarded the [[Borlaug CAST Communication Award]] by the [[Council for Agricultural Science and Technology]] (CAST), named after fellow agricultural biologist and 1970 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Norman Borlaug]]. CAST cited Folta's ability to focus on "clear, credible information" and his use of multiple venues to engage the public, in addition to his communication workshops for scientists and farmers. Julie Borlaug, daughter of Norman Borlaug, added, "[Folta] has not shied away from controversial subjects and has often been the number one target of the anti-science movement on behalf of all of us who support biotechnology."&lt;ref name=CAST/&gt; Writing about the award in ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'', Jack Payne, University of Florida's senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources and leader of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, praised Folta for his dedication to science communication and willingness to speak to all audiences about food biotechnology. Payne wrote that Folta "wants to replace fear with fact" to counteract misinformation about biotechnology and its use in food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Payne|first1=Jack|title=Good science conquers greatest fear: the unknown|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/10/11/good-science-conquers-greatest-fear-unknown/91911900/|website=The DesMoines Register|publisher=USA Today Network|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folta has considered his outreach efforts among his proudest achievements, and stated that his most important contributions to science "won't come out of my lab. They'll come out of my mouth."&lt;ref name="ufgi"/&gt;

{{quote|When you see what it takes to produce a tomato—the number of people involved from breeding all the way to post-harvest, people who pick it, out in the hot sun, really doing really tough work, the huge amounts of fuel and labor that are involved—that I can buy this thing for 50 cents?

From being able to manipulate viruses to attack cancer, to precision-change genetic information in a cell, to tweaking a gene and making a crop immune to a disease—breakthroughs like this are real and gaining momentum."&lt;ref name=Gerbic2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|title=This is Genetic Engineering 2.0|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/this_is_genetic_engineering_2.0|accessdate=17 November 2017|work=Skeptical Inquirer|issue=July/August 2017|publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has compared the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the safety of [[genetically modified organisms|genetically modified foods]] to those regarding [[global warming]] and [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/anti-gmo-activist-seeks-expose-emails-food-scientists/ | title=Anti-GMO Activist Seeks to Expose Scientists' Emails With Big Ag | work=Wired | date=23 February 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | last=Levinovitz |  first=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an outspoken critic of food blogger [[Vani Hari]]'s claims about the alleged dangers of certain food additives that regulators generally recognize as safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/the-food-babe-enemy-of-chemicals/385301/ | title=The Food Babe: Enemy of Chemicals | work=The Atlantic | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Hamblin, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta advocates for a "soft and effective" approach in handling anti-GMO activists, believing overly inflammatory responses from the scientific community will alienate the public audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title="Fear mongers" make good living by misrepresenting science, says GMO expert | url=http://publications.mcgill.ca/reporter/2015/09/fear-mongers-make-a-good-living-off-of-misrepresenting-science-says-gmo-expert/ | accessdate=23 September 2015 | work=[[McGill Reporter]] | date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folta regards the term "GMO" as imprecise and not as descriptive as the term "genetic engineering".&lt;ref name="GerbicCSICOP2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|authorlink=Susan Gerbic|title=The Challenges of Science Communication: An Interview with Kevin Folta|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_challenges_of_science_communication_an_interview_with_kevin_folta|website=CSICOP.org|accessdate=26 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042104/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_challenges_of_science_communication_an_interview_with_kevin_folta|archivedate=8 November 2016|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His supportive view is also expressed in an interview at CSICon made by Jonathan Jarry, recalling Kevin Folta's  recent visit to Uganda where he saw Ugandan scientists using genetic engineering to solve a food crisis, although initially being denied the use of this technology. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jonathan|first1=Jarry|title=An interview with Kevin Folta at CSICon|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_interview_with_kevin_folta_at_csicon|website=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP)|publisher=CSICOP, an independent nonprofit organization|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the importance of public education, Folta says of the changes in crop technology: "Gene editing is this method of changing a single base (or maybe a few bases) of targeted DNA in an amazingly precise way. And unlike the old methods of genetic engineering that left some of the hardware of the process in the cell, the new methods can yield tiny alterations that solve a problem with a precision change. While scientists celebrate the technology and see it as a way to precision-breed new plants and animals, activists call it the most 'dangerous and insidious form of screwing with nature known to man'."&lt;ref name=Gerbic2017 /&gt;

===Podcasting===
Folta operates the ''Talking Biotech'' [[podcast]] which is billed as "A science-based assessment of new technology and the future of food",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genome Center Director features in ‘Talking Biotech’ podcast | website=UC Davis Genome Center | url=http://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/2015/07/29/genome-center-director-features-in-talking-biotech-podcast/ | accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he interviews agriculture scientists and experts in the fields of science and communication to discuss the genetic improvement of plants, animals, and microbes and other issues in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=Talking Biotech Podcast | url=http://www.talkingbiotechpodcast.com | title=Talking Biotech Podcast - Evidence-Based Discussion with Dr. Kevin Folta | accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also created the ''Science Power Hour'' podcast, which is a [[parody]] of an [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] [[talk radio]] show hosted by Folta's alter ego "Vern Blazek". Folta describes the show as an attempt to deliver science communication in an entertaining way that would appeal to a more general audience, and as a way to convey serious topics using humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is VB?|url=http://www.sciencepowerhour.com/?page_id=124|website=sciencepowerhour.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seed Money|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/brookeborel/when-scientists-email-monsanto|accessdate=1 February 2016|publisher=buzzfeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflict of interest allegations ==
In February 2015, US Right to Know (USRTK), an [[Oakland, California]]-based group whose sole major funder is the [[Organic Consumers Association]],&lt;ref name="Kloor"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Keith Kloor | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/02/agricultural-researchers-rattled-demands-documents-group-opposed-gm | title=Updated: Agricultural researchers rattled by demands for documents from group opposed to GM foods | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | date=11 February 2015 | accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a [[Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request to the University of Florida as part of a campaign targeting the emails of public scientists who have spoken out in favor of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; USRTK was concerned that scientists such as Folta may have been pressured by food and agricultural companies into claiming that GMOs are safe.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The university released documents which indicated that Folta had not committed any [[scientific misconduct]].&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; Folta told ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that he was willing to comply, but was concerned with how USRTK would use the information and how his emails could be taken out of context and used to "smear" him.&lt;ref name="Kloor"/&gt;

In a ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' article from August 2015 [[Keith Kloor]] wrote that Folta had "close ties to [[Monsanto]] and other biotechnology interests".&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Folta denied these claims,&lt;ref name=ihe&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/14/researcher-finds-himself-center-battle-over-gmos-and-corporate-support | title=Casualty of GMO Wars | work=Inside Higher Education | date=14 August 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Flaherty, Colleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that the accusation was based on a few dozen emails, three professional direct interactions over thirteen years, and a reimbursement of customary travel expenses by Monsanto for $719.76, covering airfare, a rental car, 2 hotel nights, and parking for one event to speak to farmers in Colorado in September 2014.&lt;ref name=kfolta&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kfolta.blogspot.com/2015/09/what-are-deep-ties-to-monsanto.html| title= What are "Deep Ties" to Monsanto? | work=Illumination (blog)| date=13 September 2015 | accessdate=13 September 2015 | author=Folta, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=s20&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.science20.com/kevin_folta/setting_a_new_standard_for_science_transparency-157244 | title= Setting A New Standard For Science Transparency | work=Science 2.0 | date=22 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015 | author=Folta, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt; Folta has maintained that he has always communicated information consistently according to his research and understanding as a scientist working for a public institution.&lt;ref name=ihe/&gt;

In September 2015, [[Eric Lipton]] writing for the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the agriculture industry had enlisted academics, including Folta, to use their "independent voices" to advocate for public perception and policy, which appeared favorable to the industry.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/us/food-industry-enlisted-academics-in-gmo-lobbying-war-emails-show.html | title=Food Industry Enlisted Academics in G.M.O. Lobbying War, Emails Show | work=[[New York Times]] | date=5 September 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Lipton, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that the University of Florida had received a $25,000 grant from Monsanto to be used at the university's discretion which was earmarked for an established biotechnology communication program. Folta submitted expense reports to use the biotechnology communication fund to pay for travel expenses, a small projector, coffee and food.&lt;ref name=kfolta/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20150828/articles/150829661 |title= UF to donate Monsanto funds to food pantry | work=Gainesville Sun | date=28 August 2015 | accessdate=10 September 2015 | author=Schweers, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these expenses had since been reimbursed to the fund with honoraria from his talks and private donations from individuals and small businesses, while none of the donation from Monsanto was used.&lt;ref name=s20/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt; In response to the controversy and personal threats against Folta and his family, the university offered to return the donation, which Monsanto refused; instead, funds were redirected to a university food pantry.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref name=gainesville/&gt;&lt;ref name=tampa/&gt; Folta has promised a complete accounting for his research and extension activities, which he says "defines a new standard of transparency and a new tool to cultivate trust" he hopes other scientists and advocates will adopt.&lt;ref name=s20/&gt;

In October 2015, ''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' wrote that scientists like Folta have been "targeted because they speak inconvenient truths about GM technology" and stated that the funds "were tied neither to [Folta] directly nor to his research. His conflict of interest disclosures were wholly compliant with his university's rules. He never used industry funds for personal gain." The journal criticized the journalists for "[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picking]]" and creating "hostile environments [for scientists] that threaten vibrant rare species with extinction."&lt;ref name="Nat Biotech 33 (10)"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Nature Biotechnology]]| department=Editorial| title=Standing up for science | year=2015| issue=10| volume=33| pages=1009| publisher=Nature Publishing Group| url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3384| accessdate=10 October 2015| doi=10.1038/nbt.3384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experts were highly critical of the move by USRTK. Jack Payne, head of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, characterized this as an example of activist groups attempting to silence scientists who wish to engage in public discussion of politically controversial topics, describing it as a "[[spiral of silence]]".&lt;ref name=tampa&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/perspective/perspective-records-requests-hijack-scientists-time/2245131 | title=Perspective: Records requests hijack scientists' time| work= Tampa Bay Times | date=12 September 2015 | accessdate=12 September 2015 | author=Payne, Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gretchen Goldman, writing for the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS), a nonprofit science advocacy organization, criticized the FOIA requests for being "overly wide", saying it would create "chilling effects on researchers and confuse the public about the state of the science."&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/gretchen-goldman/no-scientist-should-face-harassment-period-637| title=No Scientist Should Face Harassment.

Professor and science communicator [[Steven Novella]] wrote that "The shill witch hunt is just getting started, and now they are emboldened by the PR bonanza they have found in FOIA requests for e-mails. All of this is likely to have a chilling effect on scientists speaking out in the public square on controversial issues."&lt;ref name="neurologica"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/how-to-attack-a-public-scientist/ | title=How To Attack a Public Scientist| work=Neurologica (blog) | date=11 September 2015 | accessdate=11 September 2015 | author=Novella,Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
During college Folta was a member of many bands. The oddest was named "Red Lobster Cult", but the one he played with the longest was "Insane War Tomatoes", according to Folta, "One of the greatest bands to ever miss the mark&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;it was a unique show at a time when uniqueness wasn't wanted."&lt;ref name="Enthusiast interview"&gt;{{cite podcast | title=tSE 015 – Kevin Folta, Chairman of Horticultural Sciences at University of Florida | url=http://ascienceenthusiast.com/ep015/ | website=A Science Enthusiast | time=35:15–45:50 | date=August 31, 2016 | accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He trained and competed in [[karate]] for many years, and he won a bronze metal in [[kumite]] (sparring) at the 2012 [[USA National Karate-do Federation]] national tournament (over 45 Masters division).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tournament Results: 2012 USA Karate Nationals|url=http://www.teamusa.org/~/media/USA_Karate/Documents/Event-Results/2012-Nationals.pdf?la=en|publisher=[[USA National Karate-do Federation]]|accessdate=5 November 2016|page=50|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kondura''' or '''Condura''' ({{lang-el|Condoira}}{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) was a type of ship used on the eastern shores of the Adriatic. It is first mentioned and described in the 10th century as part of the medieval [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Croatia]]n navy. It is also mentioned in the 14th century as a type of ship used by the [[Republic of Ragusa]].&lt;ref name="KahaneKahane1979"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Romanos Kahane|author2=Renée Kahane|title=Graeca Et Romanica Scripta Selecta: Romance and Mediterranean lexicology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miskAAAAMAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Hakkert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condura was {{convert|7|to|8|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw4rAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Academia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condura croatica==
In 1966, remains of two ships were accidentally found by the port of [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], which, in 1974, were taken out and transferred to [[Zadar]] to restore and conserve the remains. Through [[radiocarbon dating]], it was established that these ships sailed from the end of 11th century to the start of 12th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28696">'''Lithotrophs''' are a diverse group of organisms using [[inorganic]] substrate (usually of mineral origin) to obtain [[reducing equivalent]]s for use in [[biosynthesis]] (e.g., [[carbon fixation|carbon dioxide fixation]]) or energy conservation (i.e., [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production) via [[Cellular respiration|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic respiration]].&lt;ref&gt;Zwolinski, Michele D. "[http://faculty.weber.edu/mzwolinski/Lithotrophs.pdf Lithotroph] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824121042/http://faculty.weber.edu/mzwolinski/Lithotrophs.pdf |date=2013-08-24 }}."  ''Weber State University''. p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Known chemolithotrophs are exclusively [[microorganism]]s; no known [[fauna#Macrofauna|macrofauna]] possesses the ability to use inorganic compounds as energy sources.  Macrofauna and lithotrophs can form symbiotic relationships, in which case the lithotrophs are called "prokaryotic symbionts".  An example of this is chemolithotrophic bacteria in [[giant tube worm]]s or [[plastid]]s, which are organelles within plant cells that may have evolved from photolithotrophic cyanobacteria-like organisms. Lithotrophs belong to either the domain [[Bacteria]] or the domain [[Archaea]]. The term "lithotroph" was created from the Greek terms 'lithos' (rock) and 'troph' (consumer), meaning "eaters of rock". Many lithoautotrophs are [[extremophiles]], but this is not universally so.

Different from a lithotroph is an [[organotroph]], an organism which obtains its reducing agents from the [[catabolism]] of organic compounds.

==History==
The term was suggested in 1946 by [[André Lwoff|Lwoff]] and collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Lwoff, A., C.B. van Niel, P.J. Ryan, and E.L. Tatum (1946). Nomenclature of nutritional types of microorganisms. ''Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology'' (5th edn.), Vol. XI, The Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, pp. 302–303, [http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/11/local/back-matter.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biochemistry==
Lithotrophs consume [[Redox|reduced]] [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] [[Chemical compounds|compounds]] (rich in [[electron]]s).

===Chemolithotrophs===
A chemolithotroph (named after the process of chemolithotropy) is able to use inorganic reduced compounds as a source of energy.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912" /&gt; This process is accomplished through oxidation and ATP synthesis. The majority of chemolithotrophs are able to fix [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through the [[Calvin cycle]], a metabolic pathway in which carbon enters as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and leaves as [[glucose]].&lt;ref name="kuenen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuenen |first=G.|editor-first1=J.|editor-last1=Lengeler|editor-first2=G.|editor-last2=Drews|editor-first3=H.|editor-last3=Schlegel|title=Biology of the Prokaryotes|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| page= 242| chapter=Oxidation of Inorganic Compounds by Chemolithotrophs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vXbJa4X5oHsC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=%22the+majority+of+the+chemolithoautotrophs+employ+the+Calvin+cycle%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20majority%20of%20the%20chemolithoautotrophs%20employ%20the%20Calvin%20cycle%22&amp;f=false| isbn=9781444313307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This group of [[organisms]] includes sulfur oxidizers, [[nitrifying bacteria]], iron oxidizers, and hydrogen oxidizers.

The term "chemolithotrophy" refers to a cell’s acquisition of energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, also known as electron donors.  This form of metabolism is believed to occur only in [[prokaryotes]] and was first characterized by microbiologist [[Sergei Winogradsky]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/324421.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Habitat of chemolithotrophs====

The survival of these bacteria is dependent on the physiochemical conditions of their environment. Although they are sensitive to certain factors such as quality of inorganic substrate, they are able to thrive under some of the most inhospitable conditions in the world, such as temperatures above 110 degrees Celsius and below 2 pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuenen |first=G.|editor-first1=J.|editor-last1=Lengeler|editor-first2=G.|editor-last2=Drews|editor-first3=H.|editor-last3=Schlegel|title=Biology of the Prokaryotes|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| page= 243| chapter=Oxidation of Inorganic Compounds by Chemolithotrophs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vXbJa4X5oHsC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=types+of+chemolithotrophs#v=onepage&amp;q=types%20of%20chemolithotrophs&amp;f=false| isbn=9781444313307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important requirement for chemolithotropic life is an abundant source of rich inorganic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uta.edu/biology/chrzanowski/classnotes/microbial_diversity/Chemolithotrophs2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826202827/http://www.uta.edu/biology/chrzanowski/classnotes/microbial_diversity/Chemolithotrophs2.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These compounds are crucial for chemolithotrophs because they provide a suitable energy source/electron donor from which the [[microorganisms]] can fix CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and produce the energy they need to survive. Since [[chemosynthesis]] can take place in the absence of sunlight, these organisms are found mostly around hydrothermal vents and other locations rich in inorganic substrate.

The energy obtained from inorganic oxidation varies depending on the substrate and the reaction.  For example, the oxidation of [[hydrogen sulfide]] to elemental [[sulfur]] produces far less energy (50.1 [[calorie|kcal]]/[[mole (unit)|mol]] or 210.4 [[joule|kJ]]/mol) than the oxidation of elemental sulfur to [[sulfate]] (149.8 kcal/mol or 629.2 kJ/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogunseitan|first=Oladele|title=Microbial Diversity: Form and Function in Prokaryotes|page=169|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoeqrrxuYN4C&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=hydrogen+sulfide+kcal/mol#v=onepage&amp;q=hydrogen%20sulfide%20kcal%2Fmol&amp;f=false|isbn=9781405144483}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of lithotrophs fix carbon dioxide through the Calvin cycle, an energetically expensive process.&lt;ref name="kuenen" /&gt;  For some substrates, such as ferrous iron, the cells must cull through large amounts of inorganic substrate to secure just a small amount of energy.  This makes their metabolic process inefficient in many places and hinders them from thriving.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=vXbJa4X5oHsC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=types+of+chemolithotrophs#v=onepage&amp;q=types%20of%20chemolithotrophs&amp;f=false | title=Biology of the Prokaryotes| isbn=9781444313307| last1=Lengeler| first1=Joseph W| last2=Drews| first2=Gerhart| last3=Schlegel| first3=Hans G| date=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overview of the Metabolic Process====

There is a fairly large variation in the types of inorganic substrates that these [[microorganisms]] can use to produce energy. Sulfur is one of many inorganic substrates that can be utilized in different reduced forms depending on the specific biochemical process that a lithotroph uses.&lt;ref name="U.S. National Library of Medicine"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghosh|first1=W|last2=Dam|first2=B|title=Biochemistry and molecular biology of lithotrophic sulfur oxidation by taxonomically and ecologically diverse bacteria and archaea|pmid=19645821|journal=National Centre for Biotechnology Information|volume=33|issue=6|pages=999–1043|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemolithotrophs that are best documented are aerobic respirers, meaning that they use oxygen in their metabolic process. The high electronegativity of oxygen and resulting large energy gains makes it ideal for use as a Terminal Electron Acceptor (TEA).&lt;ref name="University of Wisconsin-Madison"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paustian|first1=Timothy|title=Lithotrophic Bacteria - Rock Eaters|url=http://lecturer.ukdw.ac.id/dhira/Metabolism/lithotrophs.html|website=Lecturer|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of these [[microorganisms]] that employ anaerobic respiration though is growing. At the heart of this metabolic process is an electron transport system that is similar to that of chemoorganotrophs. The major difference between these two [[microorganism]]s is that chemolithotrophs directly provide electrons to the electron transport chain, while chemoorganotrophs must generate their own cellular reducing power by oxidizing reduced organic compounds. Chemolithotrophs bypass this by obtaining their reducing power directly from the inorganic substrate or by the reverse electron transport reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/calvin.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504143043/http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/calvin.html |archivedate=2013-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain specialized chemolithotrophic bacteria utilize different derivatives of the Sox system; a central pathway specific to sulfur oxidation.&lt;ref name="U.S. National Library of Medicine"/&gt; This ancient and unique pathway illustrates the power that chemolithotrophs have evolved to utilize from inorganic substrates, such as sulfur.

In chemolithotrophs, the compounds - the [[electron donor]]s - are oxidized in the [[cell (biology)|cell]], and the electrons are channeled into respiratory chains, ultimately producing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. The electron acceptor can be [[oxygen]] (in [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] bacteria), but a variety of other electron acceptors, [[organic compound|organic]] and inorganic, are also used by various [[species]]. Aerobic bacteria such as the nitrifying bacteria, ''Nitrobacter'', utilize oxygen to oxidize nitrite to nitrate.&lt;ref name="University of Wisconsin-Madison"/&gt; Some lithotrophs produce organic compounds from carbon dioxide in a process called [[chemosynthesis]], much as plants do in [[photosynthesis]].  Plants use energy from sunlight to drive carbon dioxide fixation, since both water and carbon dioxide are low in energy.  By contrast, the hydrogen compounds used in chemosynthesis are high in energy, so chemosynthesis can take place in the absence of sunlight (e.g., around a [[hydrothermal vent]]). Ecosystems establish in and around hydrothermal vents as the abundance of inorganic substances, namely hydrogen, are constantly being supplied via magma in pockets below the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Morgan|first4=David|last5=Raff|first5=Martin|last6=Roberts|first6=Keith|last7=Walter|first7=Peter|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|date=Nov 20, 2014|publisher=Garland Science|pages=11–12|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other lithotrophs are able to directly utilize inorganic substances, e.g., iron, hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, or thiosulfate, for some or all of their energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Jorge G.

===Photolithotrophs===
Photolithotrophs obtain energy from light and therefore use inorganic electron donors only to fuel biosynthetic reactions (e. g., carbon dioxide fixation in lithoautotrophs).

=== Lithoheterotrophs versus lithoautotrophs ===

Lithotrophic bacteria cannot use, of course, their inorganic energy source as a [[carbon]] source for the synthesis of their cells. They choose one of three options:

* Lithoheterotrophs do not have the possibility to fix [[carbon dioxide]] and must consume additional organic compounds in order to break them apart and use their carbon. Only a few bacteria are fully heterolithotrophic.
* [[Lithoautotroph]]s are able to use [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[air]] as carbon source, the same way [[plant]]s do.
* [[Mixotroph]]s will take up and use organic material to complement their carbon dioxide fixation source (mix between autotrophy and heterotrophy). Many lithotrophs are recognised as mixotrophic in regard of their C-metabolism.

===Chemolithotrophs versus photolithotrophs===

In addition to this division, lithotrophs differ in the initial energy source which initiates ATP production:

* Chemolithotrophs use the above-mentioned inorganic compounds for aerobic or anaerobic respiration. The energy produced by the oxidation of these compounds is enough for ATP production. Some of the electrons derived from the inorganic donors also need to be channeled into biosynthesis. Mostly, additional energy has to be invested to transform these reducing equivalents to the forms and redox potentials needed (mostly NADH or NADPH), which occurs by reverse electron transfer reactions.
* Photolithotrophs use [[light]] as energy source. These bacteria are [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]]; [[photolithotrophic bacteria]] are found in the [[purple bacteria]] (e. g., [[Chromatiaceae]]), green bacteria ([[Chlorobiaceae]] and [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]]) and [[Cyanobacteria]]. Purple and green bacteria oxidize sulfide, sulfur, sulfite, iron or hydrogen. Cyanobacteria extract reducing equivalents from water, i.e., they oxidise water to oxygen. The electrons obtained from the electron donors are not used for ATP production (as long as there is light); they are used in biosynthetic reactions. Some photolithotrophs shift over to chemolithotrophic metabolism in the dark.

==Geological significance==

Lithotrophs participate in many geological processes, such as the formation of soil and the [[biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical cycling]] of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and other [[chemical element|elements]]. Lithotrophs also associate with the modern-day issue of [[acid mine drainage]]. Lithotrophs may be present in a variety of environments, including deep terrestrial subsurfaces, soils, mines, and in [[endolith]] communities.&lt;ref name=soil /&gt;

===Soil Formation===
A primary example of lithotrophs that contribute to soil formation is [[Cyanobacteria]]. This group of bacteria are nitrogen-fixing photolithotrophs that are capable of using energy from sunlight and inorganic nutrients from rocks as [[reducing agent|reductants]].&lt;ref name="soil"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=J. Heritage; E. G. V.|last2=Killington|first2=R. A.|title=Microbiology in action |date=1999|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n9x6zLqdjOYC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=microbiology+in+action+heritage#v=onepage&amp;q=microbiology%20in%20action%20heritage&amp;f=false|isbn=9780521621113|edition=Repr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capability allows for their growth and development on native, oligotrophic rocks and aids in the subsequent deposition of their organic matter (nutrients) for other organisms to colonize.&lt;ref name="soils"&gt;{{cite book|last1=eds|first1=François Buscot, Ajit Varma,|title=Microorganisms in soils roles in genesis and functions|volume=3|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-26609-9|doi=10.1007/b137872|series=Soil Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonization can initiate the process of organic compound [[decomposition]]: a primary factor for soil genesis. Such a mechanism has been attributed as part of the early evolutionary processes that helped shape the biological Earth.

===Biogeochemical Cycling===
[[Biogeochemical cycle|Biogeochemical cycling]] of elements is an essential component of lithotrophs within microbial environments. For example, in the [[carbon cycle]], there are certain bacteria classified as [[Microbial Metabolism|photolithoautotrophs]] that generate organic carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide. Certain [[Microbial Metabolism|chemolithoautotrophic]] bacteria can also produce organic carbon, some even in the absence of light.&lt;ref name=soils /&gt; Similar to plants, these microbes provide a usable form of energy for organisms to consume. On the contrary, there are lithotrophs that have the ability to [[fermentation|ferment]], implying their ability to convert organic carbon into another usable form.&lt;ref name="acid"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paul|first1=Eldor A.|title=Soil Microbiology, Ecology and Biochemistry|publisher=Academic Press, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gDnLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Soil+Microbiology,+Ecology+and+Biochemistry#v=onepage&amp;q=acid%20mine%20drainage&amp;f=false|isbn=9780123914118|pages=598|date=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[nitrogen cycle|cycling of nitrogen]]. Many lithotrophic bacteria play a role in reducing inorganic nitrogen ([[nitrogen|nitrogen gas]]) to organic nitrogen ([[ammonium]]) in a process called [[nitrogen fixation]].&lt;ref name=soils /&gt; Likewise, there are many lithotrophic bacteria that also convert ammonium into nitrogen gas in a process called [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name="soil" /&gt; Carbon and nitrogen are important nutrients, essential for metabolic processes, and can sometimes be the limiting factor that affects organismal growth and development. Thus, lithotrophs are key players in both providing and removing these important resource.

===Acid Mine Drainage===
Lithotrophic microbes are responsible for the phenomenon known as [[acid mine drainage]]. Typically occurring in mining areas, this process concerns the active metabolism of energy-rich [[pyrite]]s and other reduced sulfur components to [[sulfate]]. One example is the acidophilic bacterial genus, [[Acidithiobacillus|''A. ferrooxidans'']], that utilize [[iron(II) sulfide]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[oxygen]]  (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to generate [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name="acid" /&gt; The acidic product of these specific lithotrophs has the potential to drain from the mining area via water run-off and enter the environment.

Acid mine drainage drastically alters the acidity (pH values of 2 - 3) and chemistry of groundwater and streams, and may endanger plant and animal populations downstream of mining areas.&lt;ref name="acid" /&gt; Activities similar to acid mine drainage, but on a much lower scale, are also found in natural conditions such as the rocky beds of glaciers, in soil and talus, on stone monuments and buildings and in the deep subsurface.

It has been suggested that [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] could be important indicators of [[extraterrestrial life]] and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on the planet [[Mars]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth’s Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=September 12, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, [[Organic compounds (minerals)|organic components]] ([[biosignature]]s) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and [[Biotic material|biotic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=SSG &gt;{{Cite book |editor2-first=David |editor2-last= Beaty |contribution=Final report of the MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group (AFL-SSG)| title=The Astrobiology Field Laboratory |editor1-first=Andrew |editor1-last=Steele |publisher=[[Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group]] (MEPAG) - NASA |place=U.S.A. |pages=72 |date=September 26, 2006 |id= |url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/AFL_SSG_WHITE_PAPER_v3.doc |format=.doc |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (NAPSS)''', often known as the '''Social Science Association''', was a British reformist group founded in 1857 by [[Lord Brougham]]. It pursued issues in [[public health]], [[industrial relations]], [[penal reform]], and [[female education]]. It was dissolved in 1886.&lt;ref name="Hastings"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=39463|title=Hastings, George Woodyatt|first=Lawrence|last=Goldman|authorlink=Lawrence Goldman|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Social Science Congress 1879.jpg|thumb|The Social Science Congress 1879, illustration from ''[[The Graphic]]'']]
The efforts of [[George Hastings (MP for East Worcestershire)|George Hastings]] brought together three groups of the 1850s to form the NAPSS: the Society for Promoting the Amendment of the Law, the National Reformatory Union, and the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]] (the Langham Place Group).&lt;ref name="Hastings"/&gt; It took as model the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], holding an itinerant annual meeting, which provided a forum for social reformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Martineau|author2=Fanny Wedgewood|title=Harriet Martineau's Letters to Fanny Wedgewood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR2rAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1146-3|page=171 note 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the Association was defined as "to coordinate the efforts of the experts and the politicians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Griffin|title=The Politics of Gender in Victorian Britain: Masculinity, Political Culture and the Struggle for Women's Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsnnyrckKqQC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-01507-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor in the eventual decline of the NSPSS was that the objectives of medical reformers changed. Legislation and the efforts of central government to improve public health became less important to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Goldman|title=Science, Reform, and Politics in Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=io2nB6RcaIwC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=23 June 2013|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43301-3|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trades Societies and Strikes===
A committee of the Association produced ''Report on Trade Societies and Strikes'' (1860).

The '''North Pacific Marine Science Organization''', also called '''PICES''' (referring to the organization's status as a Pacific version of the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]]), is an intergovernmental organization that promotes and coordinates [[Oceanography|marine scientific research]] in the North [[Pacific Ocean]] and provides a mechanism for information and data exchange among scientists in its member countries.

==Legal framework==
PICES is an international [[intergovernmental organization]] established under a Convention for a North Pacific Marine Science Organization.&lt;ref&gt;PICES Convention (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Convention entered into force on 1992-03-24 with an initial membership that included the governments of [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and the [[United States|United States of America]]. The Convention was ratified by the [[China|People's Republic of China]] on 1992-08-31 to increase membership to four countries. Although the [[Soviet Union]] had participated in the development of the Convention, it was not ratified there until 1994-12-16, by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]]. The [[Republic of Korea]] acceded to the Convention on 1995-7-30. The [[Mexico|Republic of Mexico]] and the [[Democratic People’s Republic of Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] are located within the Convention Area (generally north of 30°N) but are not members.

==Oversight==
A Governing Council consisting of up to two delegates appointed by each member country is the primary decision-making body.&lt;ref&gt;PICES Convention&lt;/ref&gt; Day-to-day operations of the organization are managed by the staff of the PICES Secretariat, located in Canada at the [[Institute of Ocean Sciences]] (located on [[Patricia Bay]] in [[British Columbia]]).

The idea to create a Pacific version of ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea)&lt;ref&gt;ICES, http://www.ices.dk&lt;/ref&gt; was first discussed by scientists from Canada, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States who were attending a conference, sponsored by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]], in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada in February 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Tjossem 2005, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; ICES had provided a forum since 1902 for scientists bordering the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and its marginal seas to exchange information, conduct joint research, publish their results, and provide scientific advice about fisheries, primarily in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;ICES Convention (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of its Atlantic heritage, the nickname PICES (Pacific ICES) was adopted for the North Pacific Marine Science Organization. Informal meetings of proponents occurred sporadically through the 1980s, eventually entraining government officials into the discussion in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Tjossem 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The final text of a convention for a new marine science organization was endorsed in [[Ottawa]], Canada on 1990-12-12. A scientific planning meeting was held in [[Seattle]], USA in December 1991 to prepare for decisions made at the first annual meeting in October 1992 in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;1992 PICES Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandate==
The primary mandate of the organization is to promote and to coordinate marine scientific research in the North Pacific Ocean and to provide a mechanism for information and data exchange among scientists in its member country. This has been achieved through various means, but primarily by establishing major integrative scientific programs such as the PICES/GLOBEC Scientific Program on Carrying Capacity and Climate Change. The alignment of PICES with a global research program ([[GLOBEC]]) in the mid 1990s was fundamental to building the reputation of the organization in the international scientific community. Research on [[Climate change|climate]] and [[marine ecosystem]] variability, [[global warming]], [[ocean acidification]] and related topics was about to explode in the 1990s, and PICES was strategically in a position to take a significant role in exploring how oceans, atmospheres, and their biota were affected by the changes.

A fundamental difference between PICES and ICES was a much lower priority on developing assessments of [[Fishery|fisheries]] and [[fish stock]]s. International borders are much farther apart in the North Pacific compared to the northeastern Atlantic, so coastal fisheries that might compete are separated by large distances involving fewer countries. As a result, transboundary and straddling stock issues generally tend to be managed bilaterally, rather than multilaterally in the North Pacific. Research on fish stocks in PICES has generally been directed toward environmental influences on species. This has produced a naturally synergy with ICES as the expertise on different topics of fisheries science has developed.

==Committees==
Since its creation, the primary scientific directions of the organization have stemmed from its scientific committees (biological oceanography, fishery science, physical oceanography and climate, and marine environmental quality) supported by two technical committees (data exchange and monitoring). Each committee has authority to create subsidiary expert groups, with the approval of the Governing Council, to undertake the scientific work of the committees. National membership of all committees and other expert groups is determined by the delegates of each member country. Committee chairmen serve on the PICES Science Board, which is responsible for authorizing and overseeing all scientific activities of the organization.

==Scientific programs==
To facilitate cooperative research on important topics by marine scientists in member countries, PICES established two major integrative scientific programs during its first two decades. From 1995 to 2006, the PICES/GLOBEC regional programme on Climate Change and Carrying Capacity sought to improve understanding of climate variation in the North Pacific, its effect on marine ecosystems, and the productive capacity of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelder and Kim 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An important outcome of the work was learning that decadal-scale variation is dominant in the North Pacific, to the point where long-term changes are difficult to detect &lt;ref&gt;Bindoff et al. 2007, Section 5.3.3&lt;/ref&gt;  The second program on Forecasting and Understanding Trends, Uncertainty and Responses of North Pacific Marine Ecosystems (FUTURE) began in October 2009. Its primary goals are to understand how marine ecosystems in the North Pacific respond to climate change and human activities, to provide forecasts of ecosystem status, and to communicate the results of the program broadly.&lt;ref&gt;FUTURE 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special projects==
From time to time, member countries have asked PICES to undertake scientific studies on a particular topic of special interest to them. These differ from the regular work of the expert groups because incremental funding is typically provided to the organization to conduct the work. Recent examples, funding sources, and links to their products are listed here:
* climate regime shifts (U.S.A.)&lt;ref&gt;King 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* harmful [[algal bloom]]s (Japan)
* [[Invasive species|invasive]] marine species (Japan)&lt;ref&gt;Kestrup, Åsa M. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* survival of [[Fraser River]] sockeye [[Sockeye salmon|salmon]] (Canada)&lt;ref&gt;McKinnell et al. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* human dimension of marine ecosystem variability (Japan)
* tsunami debris (Japan)

==Ecosystem status reporting==
Recognizing the need to understand and to communicate information on variability in marine ecosystems among member countries, PICES initiated a pilot project in 2002 that would result in the publication of its first ecosystem status report.&lt;ref&gt;PICES 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, ocean climate and marine ecosystem reporting was seen as an important function of the organization so it continued with an extensive update.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnell and Dagg 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This version placed greater emphasis on basin-scale comparisons, the primary scale of interest of the organization, but the cost and effort that was required to create such a document led to simplifications. Future versions{{When|date=March 2018}} will feature greater use of automation and technology, with printed versions appearing less frequently.

==Global collaboration==
During its first decade, PICES became a major international forum for exchanging results and discussing climatic-oceanic-biotic research in the North Pacific. Awareness of the benefits of working cooperatively on scientific problems led to increasing collaboration with like-minded organizations in the North Pacific. The first occasion where PICES had a leadership role was the Beyond El Niño Conference ([[La Jolla]], USA – 2000). The results of the conference appeared in the largest special issue of ''Progress in Oceanography'' ever published &lt;ref&gt;McKinnell, S.M. et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, PICES partnered with ICES, IOC, SCOR, and others to build its scientific and organizational reputations.

==Capacity building==
[[Capacity building]] is a high priority activity in PICES&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pices.int/capacity/capacity_main.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in many other organizations. Initially, PICES focused on the need to develop capacity in those member countries with [[developing economies]], or economies in transition. The primary goals are now focused on developing young scientific talents in all member countries . This is achieved through an intern program at the Secretariat, early career scientist conferences, summer schools, travel grants to allow participation in the PICES Annual Meeting, sponsoring speakers at international conferences, and awards and recognition of deserving early career scientists.

The '''Office for Budget Responsibility''' ('''OBR''') is an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] that the UK government established to provide independent [[economic forecast]]s and independent analysis of the public finances as background to the preparation of the [[United Kingdom budget|UK budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685989.stm |title=Osborne to give details of £6bn spending cuts next week |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally created in May 2010 following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election]] (although it had previously been constituted in shadow form by the Conservative party opposition in December 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8401517.stm |title=Conservatives launch Office for Budget Responsibility |date=8 December 2009 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was placed on a statutory footing by the [[Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011]].&lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/892/made/data.pdf |title=The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a growing number of official independent fiscal watchdogs around the world.&lt;ref name="What we do"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/about-the-obr/what-we-do/ |title=What we do |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Chote]], formerly a director at the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11246225 | work=BBC News | title=Robert Chote to head Office for Budget Responsibility | date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the current head.

==Functions==

The UK government created the OBR in 2010 with the purported goal of offering independent and authoritative analysis of the UK's public finances. To that end it produces two 5-year-ahead forecasts for the economy and the public finances each year, alongside the [[Budget Day|Budget]] and [[Autumn Statement]]s.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

In its role in providing independent analysis the OBR has four main duties:&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Forecasts of the economy and public finances===
The OBR produces five-year forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year. The forecasts accompany the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor’s]] [[Budget Day - United Kingdom|Budget Statement]] and his [[Autumn Statement]] and they incorporate the impact of any tax and spending measures announced by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]]. Details of the forecasts are set out in the Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) publications.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/economic-fiscal-outlook-march-2014/ |title=Economic and fiscal outlook - March 2014 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual Forecast evaluation report (FER) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/publications/forecast-evaluation-report/ |title=Forecast evaluation report - October 2013 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published each autumn, examines how the EFO forecasts compare to subsequent outturns. The OBR has published briefing papers describing its approach to forecasting the economy &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Forecasting-the-economy.pdf |title=Briefing paper No. 3: Forecasting the Economy |publisher=OBR |date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public finances,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/briefing-paper-no-1-forecasting-the-public-finances/ |title=Briefing paper No. 1: Forecasting the public finances |publisher=OBR |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the macroeconomic model it uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Final_Model_Documentation.pdf |title=Briefing paper No. 5: The macroeconomic model |publisher=OBR |date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of the Government’s performance against its fiscal targets===
The OBR uses its public finance forecasts to assess the Government’s performance against its fiscal targets. The Government has set itself two medium-term fiscal targets: first, a fiscal mandate to balance the cyclically-adjusted current budget five years ahead, and second, a supplementary target to have public sector net debt falling in 2015-16.&lt;ref name="Budget Forecast: June 2010"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf |title=Budget Forecast: June 2010 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]] |date=June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Economic and fiscal outlook, the OBR assesses whether the Government has a greater than 50 per cent probability of hitting these targets under current policy. Given the uncertainty inherent in all fiscal forecasts, the OBR also tests how robust this judgement is by using historical evidence, sensitivity analysis and alternative scenarios.

===Scrutiny of the Government’s policy costings===
The OBR conducts scrutiny and analysis of [[HM Treasury]]’s costing of tax and welfare spending measures. During the run-up to the Budget and the Autumn Statement, the OBR subjects the Government’s draft costings of tax and spending measures to detailed challenge and scrutiny. These are then stated in the EFO and the Treasury’s policy costing documents with the OBR stating whether it endorses the costings that the Government finally publishes as reasonable central estimates. The OBR has published a briefing paper describing its role in policy costings and how they fit into the forecast process.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/27814-BriefingPaperNo_6.pdf |title=Briefing Paper No. 6: Policy costings and our forecasts |publisher=OBR |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assess the long-term sustainability of the public finances===
The OBR also assesses the long-term sustainability of the public finances. Its annual [[Fiscal sustainability]] report 
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/fiscal-sustainability-report-july-2013/ |title=Fiscal sustainability report - July 2013 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out long-term projections for different categories of spending, revenue and financial transactions and assesses whether they imply a sustainable path for public sector debt. The [[Fiscal sustainability]] report also analyses the health of the public sector’s balance sheet using both conventional National Accounts measures and the Whole of Government Accounts as prepared using commercial accounting principles.

===Other functions===
In addition to these core responsibilities, the Government has asked the OBR to forecast the Scottish receipts for the four taxes that it plans to devolve to the [[Scottish Government]] from 2015 onwards; the Scottish rate of income tax, stamp duty land tax, landfill tax and the aggregates levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/11/pdfs/ukpga_20120011_en.pdf |title=Scotland Act 2012|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OBR has published these forecasts since March 2012 alongside UK revenue forecasts. From autumn 2014, the OBR will publish similar forecasts for Welsh taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/294470/Wales_Bill_Command_Paper_-_English.pdf |title=Wales Bill: Financial Empowerment and Accountability |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the Charter for Budget Responsibility was modified to include a new cap on welfare expenditure alongside the Government’s fiscal mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/293048/PU1643_Charter_budget_responsibility_update_web.pdf |title=Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The welfare cap puts a limit on the amount that government can spend on certain social security benefits in the years 2015/16 to 2018/19. The OBR is charged with assessing the Government’s performance against the cap at each [[Autumn Statement]]. As part of this assessment, the OBR is required to produce a forecast for welfare spending in scope of the cap in its Economic and fiscal outlook. The welfare cap means that if spending exceeds a certain limit, then policy action must be taken, or the cap level must change, and Parliamentary approval must be obtained. The cap features a two per cent forecast margin above the level of the cap that allows for small fluctuations in the forecast without corrective action being required. The OBR is required to assess whether welfare spending above the cap is caused by movements in the forecast or by discretionary policy changes. The OBR has also been tasked with producing an annual report on trends in welfare spending.

The OBR undertakes a variety of research projects through the year. It publishes briefing material &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/category/publications/briefing-papers/ |title=Briefing Papers |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to inform the public about its work, and provides a same-day briefing on the public finances statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/category/topics/monthly-public-finance-data/ |title=Monthly public finance data |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Budget Responsibility Committee &lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt; members and OBR staff also give talks and presentations at external events. Robert Chote has discussed the role of the OBR, and the difference that it made after its first three years in existence, in a lecture entitled Britain’s fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel on 9 May 2013.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Lecture_May-2013.pdf |title=Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel |author=Chote |date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities are summarised each year in its Annual Reports.

==History==
[[George Osborne]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]] formed after the  [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], announced the body in his first official speech.  He criticised the economic and fiscal forecasts of the [[Premiership of Gordon Brown|previous Labour government]], and announced that the OBR would be responsible for publishing these independently of government in future.&lt;ref name=bbc-cutplan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685989.stm |title=George Osborne promises spending cuts plan next week  |date=2010-05-17|work=BBC News|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective underpinning its creation was to provide an independent assessment of national public finances before the coalition Government's emergency budget in June 2010, which outlined the size and pace of the fiscal consolidation plan inherited from the outgoing administration.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt; The role of the Office is to advise whether the declared policy of the Government is likely to meet its targets &lt;ref name="mixedreactions"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2010/05/mixed-reaction-to-office-for-budget-responsibility/ | title= Mixed reaction to Office for Budget Responsibility | publisher= ''Public Finance'' | date= 17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OBR was initially chaired by [[Sir Alan Budd]] who, along with Geoffrey Dicks and Graham Parker, formed the Budget Responsibility Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rt-hon-george-osborne-mp-on-the-obr-and-spending-announcements |title=Speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, on the OBR and spending announcements |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budd had been a founding member of the [[Monetary Policy Committee|MPC]]; Dicks was chief economist at Novus Capital and former chief economist of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]; and Parker headed up the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]’s public sector finances team. The remainder of the initial team comprised eight staff seconded from the Treasury.&lt;ref name="mixedreactions"/&gt; The initial team provided recommendations to the Chancellor on the role of the permanent OBR.&lt;ref name="Budget Forecast: June 2010"/&gt;

The OBR produced its first forecast for public finances shortly before the June 2010 budget with the second at the June budget incorporating the impact of newly announced measures. [[Colin Talbot]], Chair of Public Policy and Management at [[Manchester Business School]] and Treasury adviser on public spending, questioned the credibility of the new organisation. He said that the body could not be set up in time to judge the forecasts in the [[June 2010 United Kingdom Budget]]. In his opinion, the OBR would not be sufficiently independent of politicians or the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] to remove the politics from economic decision-making.&lt;ref name=mixedreactions/&gt;   The office made adjustments to its forecasts in the week before the June 2010 budget.  These were thought to be politically favourable to the coalition government and so cast doubt on its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c3e077ca-8adf-11df-bead-00144feab49a.html |title=Late OBR changes shrank job loss figure |author=Chris Giles |journal=Financial Times |date=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 it was announced that Budd would not continue in the role after his initial 3-month contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7873605/Sir-Alan-Budd-to-leave-the-Office-for-Budget-Responsibility.html Sir Alan Budd to leave the Office for Budget Responsibility], ''Daily Telegraph'', 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/06/alan-budd-quits-government-spending-watchdog Alan Budd quits as government spending watchdog], ''Guardian'', 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported "His departure was expected and Sir Alan had let it be known privately that he had never intended to serve as chairman of the OBR for anything other than a short period.

In September 2010, Chancellor George Osborne announced that [[Robert Chote]] had been appointed as the new Chairman of the Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC). The two other members of the BRC were Stephen Nickell, a former member of the [[Monetary Policy Committee|Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee]] and Graham Parker, who formerly  headed up the [[HM Treasury|Treasury's]] public sector finances team.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt; An Oversight Board was also created comprising the three BRC members plus two external members acting as non-Executive Directors.

==Governance==

===Budget Responsibility Committee===

The three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC) who are appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer following an appointment hearing at the Treasury Select Committee, lead the OBR. They have executive responsibility for carrying out the core functions of the OBR, including responsibility for the judgements reached in its forecasts. They are: [[Robert Chote]] (Chairman), [[Charlie Bean|Professor Sir Charles Bean]], Graham Parker CBE.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Oversight Board===

The OBR's Oversight Board ensures that effective arrangements are in place to provide assurance on risk management, governance and internal control. It consists of the three members of the BRC plus two non-executive members, [[Terence Burns, Baron Burns|Lord Burns]] and [[Christopher Kelly (civil servant)|Sir Christopher Kelly]].&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Advisory Panel===

The OBR’s Advisory Panel of economic and fiscal experts meets regularly to advise the OBR on its work programme and analytical methods. Currently members come from the [[Bank of England]], the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], academia, and other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_expert_advisory_panel_pn_23032011.pdf |title=OBR names expert advisory panel |publisher=OBR |date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and related material==
The OBR’s formal rights and responsibilities are outlined in four documents:

•	The [[Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011]] &lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"/&gt;

•	The Charter for Budget Responsibility &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_expert_advisory_panel_pn_23032011.pdf |title=Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update |publisher=HM Treasury |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•	The OBR/HM Treasury Framework document &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_framework040411.pdf |title=Office for Budget Responsibility and HM Treasury Framework Document |publisher=OBR |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•	A Memorandum of Understanding between the OBR and government departments with which it interacts most frequently and closely: HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_memorandum040411.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between Office for Budget Responsibility, HM Treasury, Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue &amp; Customs |publisher=OBR |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act &lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"/&gt; sets out the overarching duty of the OBR to examine and report on the sustainability of the public finances.  It also gives complete discretion to the OBR in the performance of its duties, as long as those duties are performed objectively, transparently and independently and takes into account the sitting government’s policies and not alternative policies. 
The Charter &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"/&gt; outlines the OBR’s independence which includes complete discretion to decide:

•	The methodology underpinning the OBR’s forecasts, assessment and analyses;

•	The judgements made by the OBR in producing these outputs;

•	The content of the OBR’s publications; and

•	The OBR’s work programme of research and additional analysis.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt;

The Charter &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"/&gt; also specifies material that the OBR have to include in its forecasts and gives the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] the right to determine the length of the forecast horizon – subject to a minimum of five years. The Charter states that the Government remains responsible for policy decisions and costings and the OBR “should fnot provide normative commentary on the particular merits of Government policies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/293048/PU1643_Charter_budget_responsibility_update_web.pdf |title=Charter for Budget Responsibility March 2014 update, page 12, para 4.12 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also gives the OBR right of access to all Government information which it may reasonably require for the performance of its duties. Under the Memorandum of Understanding where it is not possible to reach agreement, issues may be escalated to the Chair of the OBR and the Permanent Secretaries as appropriate.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt; The Framework document sets out the OBR’s governance and management arrangements.
As a non-departmental body under the aegis of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], the OBR is formally accountable to the [[Treasury Select Committee]] of the House of Commons. This accountability to parliament takes a number of elements:

First the four core publications the OBR is required to publish each year have to be laid formally before parliament;

Second, the [[Treasury Select Committee]] can call on the OBR to give evidence on its work at any time;

Third, the Treasury Select Committee has a role in determining the membership of the Budget Responsibility Committee. When a new member has to be appointed, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] names his preferred candidate following a formal application and interview process run by the civil service. The [[Treasury Select Committee]] holds confirmation hearings with the candidate and can veto the Chancellor’s choice.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt;

== International coordination ==
The OBR is a member of the [[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network]] set up by the EU in September 2015.

An '''output signal switching device''' (or '''OSSD''') is the interface of a sensor designed for reliably signalling a safety-related event, usually the crossing of an immaterial barrier.

The technology relies on two independent channels carrying the same information output by the device:

* Idle signal is 24 V, periodically shortly pulsed to 0 V (pulses are not synchronous) in order for the receiver to ensure no shortcut to either 0 V or 24 V.
* Active signal is issued when both lines present 0 V; a single line presenting 0 V for a duration longer than the test pulses is sufficient to signal an event.

The '''photosphere''' is a star's outer shell from which light is radiated. The term itself is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] roots, φῶς, φωτός/''phos, photos'' meaning "light" and σφαῖρα/''sphaira'' meaning "sphere", in reference to it being a spherical surface that is perceived to emit light. It extends into a star's surface until the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] becomes opaque, equivalent to an [[optical depth]] of approximately 2/3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In other words, a photosphere is the deepest region of a luminous object, usually a star, that is transparent to photons of certain [[wavelength]]s.

== Temperature ==

The surface of a star is defined to have a temperature given by the effective temperature in the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]. Stars, except [[neutron star]]s, have no solid surface.&lt;ref&gt;As of 2004, although white dwarfs are believed to crystallize from the middle out, none have fully solidified yet [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411199v1]; and only neutron stars are believed to have a solid, albeit unstable [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210207], crust [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/mnr/2004/00000351/00000003/art00021]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the photosphere is typically used to describe the [[Sun]]'s or another [[star]]'s visual surface .

== Composition of the Sun ==
The [[Sun]] is composed primarily of the chemical elements [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]; they account for 74.9% and 23.8% of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere, respectively. All heavier elements, called [[Metallicity|metals]] in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.

== Sun ==
[[Image:Sun Atmosphere Temperature and Density SkyLab.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Solar atmosphere]]: temperature and density. See [[File talk:Sun Atmosphere Temperature and Density SkyLab.jpg|here]] for meanings of extra lines in the graph.]]

The [[Sun]]'s photosphere has a temperature between {{convert|4500|and|6000|K|°C|lk=in}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/sun.html The Sun – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; (with an effective temperature of {{convert|5777|K|°C|lk=in}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050217044235/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/sun_worldbook.html World Book at NASA – Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[density]] somewhere around 1{{e|-3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://history.nasa.gov/SP-402/p2.htm | title = SP-402 A New Sun: The Solar Results From Skylab | author = John A.

The Sun's photosphere is around 100 [[kilometer]]s thick, and is composed of [[convection cell]]s called [[Granule (solar physics)|granules]]—cells of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] each approximately 1000 [[kilometer]]s in diameter with hot rising plasma in the center and cooler plasma falling in the narrow spaces between them, flowing at velocities of 7 kilometer per second. Each granule has a lifespan of only about twenty minutes, resulting in a continually shifting "boiling" pattern. Grouping the typical granules are super granules up to 30,000 kilometers in diameter with lifespans of up to 24 hours and flow speeds of about 500 meter per second, carrying [[magnetic field]] bundles to the edges of the cells. Other magnetically-related phenomena include [[sunspot]]s and solar [[facula]]e dispersed between the granules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/feature1.shtml| title=NASA/Marshall Solar Physics| publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These details are too fine to be seen when observing other stars from earth.

== Other layers of the Sun ==

The Sun's visible atmosphere has other layers above the photosphere: the 2,000 kilometer-deep [[chromosphere]] (typically observed by filtered light, for example [[H-alpha]]) lies just between the photosphere and the much hotter but more tenuous [[corona]]. Other "surface features" on the photosphere are [[solar flare]]s and [[sunspot]]s.

'''Presumption of guilt''', in Latin, ''ei incumbit probatio qui negat, non qui dicit'' (the burden of proof is on the one who denies, not on one who declares), is the principle that one is considered guilty unless proven innocent. Generally, this is an [[argument from ignorance]], a philosophical concept in which a thing is assumed to be true because not proved false.

==In the law==

Presumption of guilt shifts the [[burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] onto the defendant, who must then [[Burden of proof (philosophy)#Proving a negative|prove a negative]] to achieve [[acquittal]]. The phrase has been in use since at least the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;
T. C. Granger. ''A digest of the law of evidence in criminal cases'' W. Benning &amp; Company, 1846&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Default effect|default position]] based on pessimism and [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] whereas [[presumption of innocence]] is based more on optimism and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]. There is a greater likelihood of obtaining a [[wrongful conviction]]. For example, in the [[murder of Lynette White]] case, a double wrong was committed in that innocent men were convicted, while the real perpetrator remained at large and a danger to the public.

Presumption of guilt is a denial of an international [[human right]] under the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 11. Under the presumption of guilt, the defence must collect and present compelling evidence to the [[trier of fact]] (a judge or a jury). The defence must, in most cases prove that the accused is innocent.

==Widespread prevalence==
Presumption of guilt is pandemic, occasionally erupting into epidemic proportions. Smaller instances include adverse accusatory reactions to unusual costume such as the [[burqa]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Angela Rainey]], 'Here's what happens when you wear a burka in Northern Ireland towns', The Belfast Telegraph, 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; or merely a 'suspicious stare' from the police.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P Crank]], ''Understanding Police Culture'', Routledge, p 146&lt;/ref&gt; More severe is the [[blame culture]] inherent in bureaucratic organisations where those with the least responsibility are blamed the most.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael
|title=Medical regulation, spectacular transparency and the blame business
|journal=Journal of Health Organization and Management
|year=2010|volume=24|issue=6|pages=597–610|doi=10.1108/14777261011088683|pmid=21155435}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Belief in the '[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]' – that Jews and profiteers were collectively guilty of losing the war for Germany in 1918 – is an extreme instance of guilt being presumed.

==Typology==

Presumption of guilt may take many forms: 
* [[Guilt by association]], for example, punishing the families of North Korean defectors.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Laurence and Ju-Min Park, 'Guilty by association: growing up in hell of North Korean gulag', Reuters, may 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Extrajudicial punishment]] such as [[lynching]] or other forms of [[vigilantism]], which seek to bypass legal procedures;
* [[Blaming the victim]]; for example, victims of rape in Saudi Arabia and Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vicky Baker]], 'Rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail', The Guardian, 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neela Debnath]], 'rape victims still blamed for sexual violence in Somalia', The Independent, 6 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collective guilt]], for example the belief that 'all Muslims are terrorists';&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer Case]], 'Islamist Terror and Collective Guilt', [[national Review]], 4 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, the terrorist may believe his victims to be collectively guilty of some perceived injustice, as in the case of [[9/11]]. A belief in [[Jewish deicide]] expresses the view that 'all Jews are Christ-killers',&lt;ref&gt;Peter J Tomson, ''Presumed Guilty: How the Jews were Blamed For the Death of Jesus'', Fortress Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; though in fact only the Romans had the legal authority to crucify someone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giles Fraser]], 'Christians must understand that for Jews the cross is a symbol of oppression', [[The Guardian]], 25 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rushing to [[judgement]], for example equating arrest with conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luke Gittos]], '[[Eric Bellquist]] and the presumption of innocence', ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', 2017-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;
* The obtaining of a [[false confession]] under [[duress]] or [[torture]]; 
* [[Judicial misconduct]] such as [[collusion]] with the prosecution; [[judicial murder]]
* A [[frameup]], usually admissions presumably made, "false statements". All such admissions should be treated with skepticism without actual video or a signed statement.[[miscarriage of justice]]; 
* A [[plea bargain]], which in the worst case may induce a guilty party to give [[false testimony]] against an innocent co-accused;
* A [[fixed penalty notice]] or on-the-spot fine; 
* [[Precrime]] policies such as [[preventive detention]]
* Preemptive action such as [[drone strikes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|title=Drone attacks go against every human rights principle in the book|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/lifestyle/2012/06/drone-attacks-against-human-rights-principle-book|work=New Statesman|date=13 June 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

* [[Racial prejudice]];&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Stevenson, 'A presumption of guilt', [[The New York Review]], 13 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[authority fallacy]], demonstrated by the [[Milgram experiment]], in which persons may be too much inclined to follow orders from a perceived [[authoritarian]] figure; as in the extreme case of [[Hitler]], [[Adolf Eichmann]], and the [[Final solution]].
* Short-term political gain and the destruction of political rivals, as in the [[Stalinist]] [[show trials]] of the 1930s.
* Dissatisfaction or impatience with due [[legal process]] which [[vigilantes]] and others see as 'weak'.
* 'Impatience and fear of jurors, 'media frenzy', a punitive culture, and cognitive bias'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Findley]], 'The presumption of Innocence exists in theory, not reality', [[Washington Post]], 19/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2018}}
* Psychological game-playing; the aggressive accuser is said to play [[mind games]], while the victim is on a [[guilt trip]]. Guilt feelings may be residual from early childhood, in which all of us are powerless and presumption of guilt ('you naughty boy', 'shame on you, wicked child') is often the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne Dyer]], ''[[Your Erroneous Zones]]'', Warner Books, 1976, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Berne]], ''[[Games People Play (book)]]'', Penguin 1964, pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mind-set which favours [[Apocalypticism]]. According to [[Jonathan Schell]], the religiously orthodox may 'take it upon themselves to please a wrathful God' through the 'extinction of 'evil' mankind'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Schell]], ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', Picador, 1982, p133&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypticism attracts 'desperate, humiliated and defeated' people, says [[John Michael Greer]]; it 'offers a free ticket out of the troubles of everyday life'.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Greer, ''Apocalypse'', Quercus, 2012, pp 35, 36, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Presumption of guilt is as old as [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] itself. In ancient Greece, public officials were elected for very limited terms of office and barred from re-election, on the presumption that too long an incumbency would lead to abuse of power. [[Thucydides]] and [[Aristophanes]]&lt;ref&gt;M S Silk, ''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p 372&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the crowd were too easily swayed by [[Eloquence|oratory]]  and emotion. As [[Lord Acton]] wrote in the 19th century, again expressing presumption of guilt, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

[[Adolf Hitler]] was a persistent presumer of guilt in those he disliked. Being allegedly a [[psychopath]] and [[narcissist]]&lt;ref&gt;see Wikipedia article [[psychopathography of Adolf Hitler]]&lt;/ref&gt; he tended to blame others when things went wrong. From 1918 he blamed Germany's defeat on the [[November criminals]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] for negotiating a truce when Germany still had the capacity to fight on; in [[Mein Kampf]] he wrote; 'every third German is a traitor'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, when it was clear that Germany could not win the war, Hitler wished to punish the entire nation for failing to meet his expectations, according to [[Sebastian Haffner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 120, 157, 160, 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1947 and 1956, many US citizens were unfairly accused of being communist agents or sympathisers and had their careers ruined during the era of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare]], or even killed like [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]].

High Court judge Sir [[Richard Henriques]] has criticized UK police training and methods which allegedly assert that 'only 0.1% of rape allegations are false' ('lying with statistics' or straight-out lie to prejudice, this is better than 'accusers never lie', which is obviously false.) and in which all complainants are treated as 'victims' from the start.

'''Sewage treatment''' is the process of removing [[pollutant|contaminants]] from municipal [[wastewater]], containing mainly household [[sewage]] plus some [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]]. Physical, chemical, and biological processes are used to remove contaminants and produce treated wastewater (or treated [[effluent]]) that is safe enough for release into the environment. A by-product of sewage treatment is a semi-solid waste or slurry, called [[sewage sludge]]. The sludge has to undergo further [[sewage sludge treatment|treatment]] before being suitable for disposal or application to land.

Sewage treatment may also be referred to as [[wastewater treatment]]. However, the latter is a broader term which can also refer to industrial wastewater. For most cities, the [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]] will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pre-treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load. If the sewer system is a [[combined sewer]] then it will also carry [[urban runoff]] (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via [[piping]] and in a flow aided by [[gravity]] and [[pump]]s. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a [[bar screen]] to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in [[dumpster]]s and disposed of in landfills. [[Fat]] and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Terminology==
The term "sewage treatment plant" (or "sewage treatment works" in some countries) is nowadays often replaced with the term '''[[wastewater treatment]] plant''' or wastewater treatment station.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_WV6CgAAQBAJ|title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Reuse|last1=Tchobanoglous|first1=George|last2=Burton|first2=Franklin L.|last3=Stensel|first3=H. David|last4=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2003|isbn=0-07-112250-8|edition=4th|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewage can be treated close to where the sewage is created, which may be called a "decentralized" system or even an "on-site" system (in [[septic tank]]s, [[biofilters]] or [[aerobic treatment system]]s). Alternatively, sewage can be collected and transported by a network of pipes and pump stations to a municipal treatment plant. This is called a "centralized" system (see also [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]] and [[Sewage collection and disposal|pipes and infrastructure]]).

==Origins of sewage==
{{Main|Sewage}}
Sewage is generated by residential, institutional, commercial and industrial establishments. It includes [[household waste]] liquid from [[toilet]]s, [[bathing|baths]], [[shower]]s, [[kitchen]]s, and [[sink]]s draining into [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s. In many areas, sewage also includes liquid waste from industry and commerce. The separation and draining of household waste into [[greywater]] and [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] is becoming more common in the developed world, with treated greywater being permitted to be used for watering plants or recycled for flushing toilets.

===Sewage mixing with rainwater===
Sewage may include [[stormwater]] runoff or [[urban runoff]]. [[Sewerage]] systems capable of handling storm water are known as [[combined sewer]] systems. This design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Metcalf &amp; Eddy"&gt;{{cite book | author=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. | title=Wastewater Engineering | year=1972 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York | isbn=0-07-041675-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than [[sanitary sewer]]s. Heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage treatment system, causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers, and they are not designed to transport stormwater. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive [[Infiltration/Inflow|infiltration/inflow]] (dilution by stormwater and/or groundwater) is allowed into a sanitary sewer system. Communities that have [[Urbanization|urbanized]] in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.&lt;ref name="Burrian"&gt;Burrian, Steven J., et al. (1999).[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000E6J7.txt "The Historical Development of Wet-Weather Flow Management."] US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH. Document No. EPA/600/JA-99/275.&lt;/ref&gt;

As rainfall travels over roofs and the ground, it may pick up various contaminants including [[soil]] particles and other [[sediment]], [[heavy metals]], [[organic compound]]s, animal waste, and [[oil]] and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]]. Some [[jurisdiction]]s require stormwater to receive some level of treatment before being discharged directly into waterways. Examples of treatment processes used for stormwater include [[retention basin]]s, [[constructed wetland|wetlands]], buried [[Stormwater detention vault|vaults]] with various kinds of [[media filter]]s, and [[Hydrodynamic separator|vortex separators]] (to remove coarse solids).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burton, Jr. |first1=G.

===Industrial effluent===
{{Main|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
In highly regulated developed countries, [[industrial effluent]] usually receives at least pretreatment if not full treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load, before discharge to the sewer. This process is called [[industrial wastewater treatment]] or pretreatment. The same does not apply to many developing countries where industrial effluent is more likely to enter the sewer if it exists, or even the receiving water body, without pretreatment.

Industrial wastewater may contain pollutants which cannot be removed by conventional sewage treatment. Also, variable flow of industrial waste associated with production cycles may upset the population dynamics of biological treatment units, such as the [[Activated sludge|activated sludge process]].

==Process steps==

=== Overview ===
Sewage collection and treatment is typically subject to local, state and federal regulations and standards.

Treating wastewater has the aim to produce an [[effluent]] that will do as little harm as possible when discharged to the surrounding environment, thereby preventing [[pollution]] compared to releasing untreated wastewater into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Environmental Pollution Monitoring And Control |last= Khopkar |first= S. M.|year= 2004|publisher= New Age International |location=New Delhi |isbn= 81-224-1507-5 |page= 299|url= https://books.google.com/?id=TAk21grzDZgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewage treatment generally involves three stages, called primary, secondary and tertiary treatment.
*''Primary treatment'' consists of temporarily holding the sewage in a quiescent basin where heavy solids can settle to the bottom while oil, grease and lighter solids float to the surface. The settled and floating materials are removed and the remaining liquid may be discharged or subjected to secondary treatment. Some sewage treatment plants that are connected to a combined sewer system have a bypass arrangement after the primary treatment unit. This means that during very heavy rainfall events, the secondary and tertiary treatment systems can be bypassed to protect them from hydraulic overloading, and the mixture of sewage and stormwater only receives primary treatment.
*''[[Secondary treatment]]'' removes dissolved and suspended biological matter. Secondary treatment is typically performed by [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]], water-borne micro-organisms in a managed habitat. Secondary treatment may require a separation process to remove the micro-organisms from the treated water prior to discharge or tertiary treatment.
*''Tertiary treatment'' is sometimes defined as anything more than primary and secondary treatment in order to allow ejection into a highly sensitive or fragile ecosystem (estuaries, low-flow rivers, coral reefs,...). Treated water is sometimes disinfected chemically or physically (for example, by lagoons and [[microfiltration]]) prior to discharge into a [[stream]], [[river]], [[bay]], [[lagoon]] or [[wetland]], or it can be used for the [[irrigation]] of a golf course, green way or park. If it is sufficiently clean, it can also be used for [[groundwater recharge]] or agricultural purposes.

[[File:SchemConstructedWetlandSewage.jpg|upright=3.05|thumb|center|[[Process flow diagram]] for a typical treatment plant via subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SFCW)]]

===Pretreatment===
Pretreatment removes all materials that can be easily collected from the raw sewage before they damage or clog the pumps and sewage lines of primary treatment [[clarifier]]s. Objects commonly removed during pretreatment include trash, tree limbs, leaves, branches, and other large objects.

The influent in sewage water passes through a [[bar screen]] to remove all large objects like cans, rags, sticks, plastic packets etc. carried in the sewage stream.&lt;ref&gt;Water and Environmental Health at London and Loughborough (1999). [http://www.lut.ac.uk/well/resources/technical-briefs/64-wastewater-treatment-options.pdf "Waste water Treatment Options."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210830/http://www.lut.ac.uk/well/resources/technical-briefs/64-wastewater-treatment-options.pdf |date=2011-07-17 }} Technical brief no. 64. London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and Loughborough University.&lt;/ref&gt; This is most commonly done with an automated mechanically raked bar screen in modern plants serving large populations, while in smaller or less modern plants, a manually cleaned screen may be used. The raking action of a mechanical bar screen is typically paced according to the accumulation on the bar screens and/or flow rate. The solids are collected and later disposed in a landfill, or incinerated. Bar screens or mesh screens of varying sizes may be used to optimize solids removal. If gross solids are not removed, they become entrained in pipes and moving parts of the treatment plant, and can cause substantial damage and inefficiency in the process.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer"&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2004). [https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-resources "Primer for Municipal Waste water Treatment Systems."] Document no. EPA 832-R-04-001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

====Grit removal====
&lt;!--[[Grit removal]] redirects to this section; if the section name is changed, please change this redirect accordingly--&gt;
Grit consists of sand, gravel, cinders, and other heavy materials. It also includes organic matter such as eggshells, bone chips, seeds, and coffee grounds. Pretreatment may include a sand or grit channel or chamber, where the velocity of the incoming sewage is adjusted to allow the settlement of sand and grit. Grit removal is necessary to (1) reduce formation of heavy deposits in aeration tanks, aerobic digesters, pipelines, channels, and conduits; (2) reduce the frequency of digester cleaning caused by excessive accumulations of grit; and (3) protect moving mechanical equipment from abrasion and accompanying abnormal wear. The removal of grit is essential for equipment with closely machined metal surfaces such as comminutors, fine screens, centrifuges, heat exchangers, and high pressure diaphram pumps. Grit chambers come in 3 types: horizontal grit chambers, aerated grit chambers and vortex grit chambers. Vortex type grit chambers include mechanically induced vortex, hydraulically induced vortex, and multi-tray vortex separators. Given that traditionally, grit removal systems have been designed to remove clean inorganic particles that are greater than {{convert|0.210|mm}}, most grit passes through the grit removal flows under normal conditions. During periods of high flow deposited grit is resuspended and the quantity of grit reaching the treatment plant increases substantially. It is, therefore important that the grit removal system not only operate efficiently during normal flow conditions but also under sustained peak flows when the greatest volume of grit reaches the plant.&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858915999 |title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Resource Recovery |others=Tchobanoglous, George; Stensel, H.

====Flow equalization====
[[Clarifier]]s and mechanized secondary treatment are more efficient under uniform flow conditions. [[Equalizing basin|Equalization basins]] may be used for temporary storage of diurnal or wet-weather flow peaks. Basins provide a place to temporarily hold incoming sewage during plant maintenance and a means of diluting and distributing batch discharges of toxic or high-strength waste which might otherwise inhibit biological secondary treatment (including portable toilet waste, vehicle holding tanks, and septic tank pumpers). Flow equalization basins require variable discharge control, typically include provisions for bypass and cleaning, and may also include aerators. Cleaning may be easier if the basin is downstream of screening and grit removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=October 1971 |title=Process Design Manual for Upgrading Existing Wastewater Treatment Plants |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100WEPH.txt |publisher=EPA |chapter=Chapter 3.

In some larger plants, [[fat]] and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] are removed by passing the sewage through a small tank where skimmers collect the fat floating on the surface. Air blowers in the base of the tank may also be used to help recover the fat as a froth. Many plants, however, use primary clarifiers with mechanical surface skimmers for fat and grease removal.

===Primary treatment===
&lt;!--[[Primary Treatment]] redirects to this section; if the section name is changed, please change this redirect accordingly--&gt;
[[File:Sewer Plant.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|Primary treatment tanks in Oregon, USA]]
In the primary [[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] stage, sewage flows through large tanks, commonly called "pre-settling basins", "primary sedimentation tanks" or "primary [[clarifier]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Huber Company, Berching, Germany (2012). [http://www.huber.de/products/sedimentation-tanks.html "Sedimentation Tanks."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118005951/http://www.huber.de/products/sedimentation-tanks.html |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tanks are used to settle sludge while grease and oils rise to the surface and are skimmed off. Primary settling tanks are usually equipped with mechanically driven scrapers that continually drive the collected sludge towards a hopper in the base of the tank where it is pumped to sludge treatment facilities.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|9–11}} Grease and oil from the floating material can sometimes be recovered for [[saponification]] (soap making).

===Secondary treatment===
{{main|Secondary treatment}}
[[Secondary treatment]] is designed to substantially degrade the biological content of the sewage which are derived from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent. The majority of municipal plants treat the settled sewage liquor using aerobic biological processes. To be effective, the [[biota (ecology)|biota]] require both [[oxygen]] and food to live. The [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. [[sugar]]s, fats, organic short-chain [[carbon]] molecules, etc.) and bind much of the less soluble fractions into [[flocculation|floc]].

Secondary treatment systems are classified as fixed-film or suspended-growth systems.
*Fixed-film or attached growth systems include [[trickling filter]]s, [[constructed wetlands]], bio-towers, and [[rotating biological contactor]]s, where the biomass grows on media and the sewage passes over its surface.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|11–13}} The fixed-film principle has further developed into [[Moving bed biofilm reactor|Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors]] (MBBR)&lt;ref&gt;

*Suspended-growth systems include [[activated sludge]], where the biomass is mixed with the sewage and can be operated in a smaller space than trickling filters that treat the same amount of water. However, fixed-film systems are more able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|11–13}}
[[File:Secondary sedimentation tank 1 w.JPG|thumb|Secondary [[clarifier]] at a rural treatment plant]]
Some secondary treatment methods include a secondary clarifier to settle out and separate biological floc or filter material grown in the secondary treatment bioreactor.

===Tertiary treatment===
The purpose of tertiary treatment is to provide a final treatment stage to further improve the effluent quality before it is discharged to the receiving environment (sea, river, lake, wet lands, ground, etc.). More than one tertiary treatment process may be used at any treatment plant. If disinfection is practised, it is always the final process. It is also called "effluent polishing."

====Filtration====
[[Sand filter|Sand filtration]] removes much of the residual suspended matter.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|22–23}} Filtration over [[activated carbon]], also called ''carbon adsorption,'' removes residual [[toxin]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

====Lagoons or ponds====
[[File:Everett sewage.jpg|thumb|right|A sewage treatment plant and lagoon in [[Everett, Washington]], USA]]
Lagoons or ponds provide settlement and further biological improvement through storage in large man-made ponds or lagoons. These lagoons are highly aerobic and colonization by native [[macrophyte]]s, especially reeds, is often encouraged. Small filter-feeding [[invertebrate]]s such as ''[[Daphnia]]'' and species of ''[[Rotifera]]'' greatly assist in treatment by removing fine particulates.

====Biological nutrient removal====
Biological nutrient removal (BNR) is regarded by some as a type of secondary treatment process,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and by others as a tertiary (or "advanced") treatment process.

Wastewater may contain high levels of the nutrients [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]. Excessive release to the environment can lead to a buildup of nutrients, called [[eutrophication]], which can in turn encourage the overgrowth of weeds, [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae). This may cause an [[algal bloom]], a rapid growth in the population of algae. The algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of them die. The decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die, which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose. In addition to causing deoxygenation, some algal species produce toxins that contaminate [[drinking water]] supplies. Different treatment processes are required to remove nitrogen and phosphorus.

=====Nitrogen removal=====
Nitrogen is removed through the biological [[redox|oxidation]] of nitrogen from [[ammonia]] to [[nitrate]] ([[nitrification]]), followed by [[denitrification]], the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas is released to the atmosphere and thus removed from the water.

Nitrification itself is a two-step aerobic process, each step facilitated by a different type of bacteria. The oxidation of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) is most often facilitated by ''Nitrosomonas'' spp. ("nitroso" referring to the formation of a [[nitroso]] functional group). Nitrite oxidation to nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), though traditionally believed to be facilitated by ''Nitrobacter'' spp. (nitro referring the formation of a [[nitro functional group]]), is now known to be facilitated in the environment almost exclusively by ''Nitrospira'' spp.

Denitrification requires anoxic conditions to encourage the appropriate biological communities to form. It is facilitated by a wide diversity of bacteria. Sand filters, lagooning and reed beds can all be used to reduce nitrogen, but the activated sludge process (if designed well) can do the job the most easily.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Since denitrification is the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen (molecular nitrogen) gas, an [[electron donor]] is needed. This can be, depending on the waste water, organic matter (from feces), [[sulfide]], or an added donor like [[methanol]]. The sludge in the anoxic tanks (denitrification tanks) must be mixed well (mixture of recirculated mixed liquor, return activated sludge [RAS], and raw influent) e.g. by using [[submersible mixer]]s in order to achieve the desired denitrification.

Sometimes the conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrate alone is referred to as tertiary treatment.

Over time, different treatment configurations have evolved as denitrification has become more sophisticated. An initial scheme, the Ludzack–Ettinger Process, placed an anoxic treatment zone before the aeration tank and clarifier, using the return activated sludge (RAS) from the clarifier as a nitrate source. Influent wastewater (either raw or as effluent from primary clarification) serves as the electron source for the facultative bacteria to metabolize carbon, using the inorganic nitrate as a source of oxygen instead of dissolved molecular oxygen. This denitrification scheme was naturally limited to the amount of soluble nitrate present in the RAS. Nitrate reduction was limited because RAS rate is limited by the performance of the clarifier.

The "Modified Ludzak–Ettinger Process" (MLE) is an improvement on the original concept, for it recycles mixed liquor from the discharge end of the aeration tank to the head of the anoxic tank to provide a consistent source of soluble nitrate for the facultative bacteria. In this instance, raw wastewater continues to provide the electron source, and sub-surface mixing maintains the bacteria in contact with both electron source and soluble nitrate in the absence of dissolved oxygen.

Many sewage treatment plants use [[centrifugal pump]]s to transfer the nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification. These pumps are often referred to as ''Internal Mixed Liquor Recycle'' (IMLR) pumps. IMLR may be 200% to 400% the flow rate of influent wastewater (Q). This is in addition to Return Activated Sludge (RAS) from secondary clarifiers, which may be 100% of Q. (Therefore, the hydraulic capacity of the tanks in such a system should handle at least 400% of annual average design flow (AADF). At times, the raw or primary effluent wastewater must be carbon-supplemented by the addition of methanol, acetate, or simple food waste (molasses, whey, plant starch) to improve the treatment efficiency. These carbon additions should be accounted for in the design of a treatment facility's organic loading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wefnet.org/mopnew/Operation_of_Municipal_Wastewater_Treatment_Plants/Chapter%2022%20Revised_6th%20Edition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210203528/http://www.wefnet.org/MOPNEW/Operation_of_Municipal_Wastewater_Treatment_Plants/Chapter%2022%20Revised_6th%20Edition.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further modifications to the MLE were to come: Bardenpho and Biodenipho processes include additional anoxic and oxidative processes to further polish the conversion of nitrate ion to molecular nitrogen gas. Use of an anaerobic tank following the initial anoxic process allows for luxury uptake of phosphorus by bacteria, thereby biologically reducing orthophosphate ion in the treated wastewater. Even newer improvements, such as [[Anammox]] Process, interrupt the formation of nitrate at the nitrite stage of nitrification, shunting nitrite-rich mixed liquor activated sludge to treatment where nitrite is then converted to molecular nitrogen gas, saving energy, alkalinity, and secondary carbon sourcing. Anammox™ (ANaerobic AMMonia OXidation) works by artificially extending detention time and preserving denitrifiying bacteria through the use of substrate added to the mixed liquor and continuously recycled from it prior to secondary clarification. Many other proprietary schemes are being deployed, including DEMON™, Sharon-ANAMMOX™, ANITA-Mox™, and DeAmmon™.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=March 2013 |title=Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management |chapter=Chapter 3.

=====Phosphorus removal=====
Every adult human excretes between {{convert|200|and|1000|g}} of phosphorus annually. Studies of United States sewage in the late 1960s estimated mean per capita contributions of {{convert|500|g}} in urine and feces, {{convert|1000|g}} in synthetic detergents, and lesser variable amounts used as corrosion and scale control chemicals in water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=1976 |title=Process Design Manual for Phosphorus Removal |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20007TYZ.txt |pages=2–1 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 625/1-76-001a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Source control via alternative detergent formulations has subsequently reduced the largest contribution, but the content of urine and feces will remain unchanged. Phosphorus removal is important as it is a limiting nutrient for algae growth in many fresh water systems. (For a description of the negative effects of algae, ''see'' [[Sewage treatment#Nutrient removal|Nutrient removal]]). It is also particularly important for water reuse systems where high phosphorus concentrations may lead to fouling of downstream equipment such as [[reverse osmosis]].

Phosphorus can be removed biologically in a process called [[enhanced biological phosphorus removal]]. In this process, specific bacteria, called [[polyphosphate-accumulating organisms]] (PAOs), are selectively enriched and accumulate large quantities of phosphorus within their cells (up to 20 percent of their mass). When the biomass enriched in these bacteria is separated from the treated water, these [[biosolids]] have a high [[fertilizer]] value.

Phosphorus removal can also be achieved by chemical [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], usually with [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of [[iron]] (e.g. [[ferric chloride]]), [[aluminum]] (e.g. [[alum]]), or lime.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|18}} This may lead to excessive sludge production as hydroxides precipitate and the added chemicals can be expensive. Chemical phosphorus removal requires significantly smaller equipment footprint than biological removal, is easier to operate and is often more reliable than biological phosphorus removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansmiddendorp.blogspot.com/|title=De toekomst voor de waterschappen|last=|first=|date=|website=Hansmiddendorp|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method for phosphorus removal is to use granular [[Laterite#Waste water treatment|laterite]].

Some systems use both biological phosphorus removal and chemical phosphorus removal.  The chemical phosphorus removal in those systems may be used as a backup system, for use when the biological phosphorus removal is nor removing enough phosphorus, or may be used continuously.  In either case, using both biological and chemical phosphorus removal has the advantage of not increasing sludge production as much as chemical phosphorus removal on its own, with the disadvantage of the increased initial cost associated with installing two different systems.

Once removed, phosphorus, in the form of a phosphate-rich [[sewage sludge]], may be dumped in a landfill or used as fertilizer. In the latter case, the treated sewage sludge is also sometimes referred to as biosolids.

====Disinfection====
{{Further|Advanced oxidation process}}
The purpose of [[disinfection]] in the treatment of waste water is to substantially reduce the number of [[microorganism]]s in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking, bathing, irrigation, etc. The effectiveness of disinfection depends on the quality of the water being treated (e.g., cloudiness, pH, etc.), the type of disinfection being used, the disinfectant dosage (concentration and time), and other environmental variables. Cloudy water will be treated less successfully, since solid matter can shield organisms, especially from [[ultraviolet light]] or if contact times are low. Generally, short contact times, low doses and high flows all militate against effective disinfection. Common methods of disinfection include [[ozone]], [[chlorine]], ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|16}} [[Chloramine]], which is used for drinking water, is not used in the treatment of waste water because of its persistence. After multiple steps of disinfection, the treated water is ready to be released back into the [[water cycle]] by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture. Afterwards, the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses.

[[Water chlorination|Chlorination]] remains the most common form of waste water disinfection in [[North America]] due to its low cost and long-term history of effectiveness. One disadvantage is that chlorination of residual organic material can generate chlorinated-organic compounds that may be [[carcinogenic]] or harmful to the environment. Residual chlorine or chloramines may also be capable of chlorinating organic material in the natural aquatic environment. Further, because residual chlorine is toxic to aquatic species, the treated effluent must also be chemically dechlorinated, adding to the complexity and cost of treatment.

[[Ultraviolet]] (UV) light can be used instead of chlorine, iodine, or other chemicals. Because no chemicals are used, the treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it, as may be the case with other methods. UV radiation causes damage to the [[gene]]tic structure of bacteria, [[virus]]es, and other [[pathogen]]s, making them incapable of reproduction. The key disadvantages of UV disinfection are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the UV radiation (i.e., any solids present in the treated effluent may protect microorganisms from the UV light). In the United Kingdom, UV light is becoming the most common means of disinfection because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water. Some sewage treatment systems in Canada and the US also use UV light for their effluent water disinfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tapas K. |date=August 2001 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection application to a wastewater treatment plant |journal=Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy |publisher=Springer Berlin/Heidelberg |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=69–80 |url= |doi=10.1007/S100980100108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Tallahassee, FL. [http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wastewater/dom/domuv.htm "Ultraviolet Disinfection for Domestic Waste water."] 2010-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ozone]] ({{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is generated by passing oxygen ({{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through a high [[voltage]] potential resulting in a third oxygen [[atom]] becoming attached and forming {{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Ozone is very unstable and reactive and oxidizes most organic material it comes in contact with, thereby destroying many pathogenic microorganisms. Ozone is considered to be safer than chlorine because, unlike chlorine which has to be stored on site (highly poisonous in the event of an accidental release), ozone is generated on-site as needed. Ozonation also produces fewer disinfection by-products than chlorination. A disadvantage of ozone disinfection is the high cost of the ozone generation equipment and the requirements for special operators.

=== Fourth treatment stage ===
{{Further|Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products}}
Micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, ingredients of household chemicals, chemicals used in small businesses or industries, [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]] (EPPP) or pesticides may not be eliminated in the conventional treatment process (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment) and therefore lead to [[water pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;UBA (Umweltbundesamt) (2014): [http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/378/publikationen/texte_85_2014_massnahmen_zur_verminderung_des_eintrages_von_mikroschadstoffen_in_die_gewaesser_0.pdf Maßnahmen zur Verminderung des Eintrages von Mikroschadstoffen in die Gewässer]. Texte 85/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although concentrations of those substances and their decomposition products are quite low, there is still a chance to harm aquatic organisms. For [[pharmaceuticals]], the following substances have been identified as "toxicologically relevant": substances with [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting]] effects, [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] substances and substances that enhance the development of [[Antimicrobial resistance|bacterial resistances]].&lt;ref name="Walz"&gt;Walz, A., Götz, K.

ISOE-Materialien zur Sozialen Ökologie Nr. 36 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; They mainly belong to the group of [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s. Techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are being tested in Germany, Switzerland{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández Leal, L. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1363 Removal of micropollutants from grey water – Combining biological and physical/chemical processes]. PhD thesis, Wageningen University&lt;/ref&gt; However, since those techniques are still costly, they are not yet applied on a regular basis. Such process steps mainly consist of [[activated carbon]] filters that adsorb the micropollutants. Ozone can also be applied as an oxidative method.&lt;ref&gt;Ternes, T. (2009): [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1378 Challenges for the future: emerging micropollutants in urban water cycle]. BFG, Koblenz, Germany (presentation for a seminar at UNESCO-IHE, Delft)&lt;/ref&gt; Also the use of enzymes such as the enzyme laccase is under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Margot | first1 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2013 | title = Bacterial versus fungal laccase: potential for micropollutant degradation| url = | journal = AMB Express | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 63 | doi = 10.1186/2191-0855-3-63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new concept which could provide an energy-efficient treatment of micropollutants could be the use of laccase secreting fungi cultivated at a wastewater treatment plant to degrade micropollutants and at the same time to provide enzymes at a cathode of a microbial biofuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biooekonomie-bw.de/en/articles/news/crude-mushroom-solution-to-degrade-micropollutants-and-increase-the-performance-of-biofuel-cells/|title=Crude mushroom solution to degrade micropollutants and increase the performance of biofuel cells|website=www.biooekonomie-bw.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial biofuel cells are investigated for their property to treat organic matter in wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logan | first1 = B. | last2 = Regan | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Microbial Fuel Cells—Challenges and Applications| doi = 10.1021/es0627592 | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 40| issue = 17| pages = 5172–5180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce pharmaceuticals in water bodies, also "source control" measures are under investigation, such as innovations in drug development or more responsible handling of drugs.&lt;ref name="Walz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lienert | first1 = J. | last2 = Bürki | first2 = T. | last3 = Escher | first3 = B.I. | year = 2007 | title = Reducing micropollutants with source control: Substance flow analysis of 212 pharmaceuticals in faeces and urine | url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1406 | journal = Water Science &amp; Technology | volume = 56 | issue = 5| pages = 87–96 | doi=10.2166/wst.2007.560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Odor control==
[[Odors]] emitted by sewage treatment are typically an indication of an anaerobic or "septic" condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harshman |first1=Vaughan |last2=Barnette |first2=Tony |date=2000-12-28|title=Wastewater Odor Control: An Evaluation of Technologies |journal=Water Engineering &amp; Management |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.wwdmag.com/Wastewater-Odor-Control-An-Evaluation-of-Technologies-article1698 |issn=0273-2238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early stages of processing will tend to produce foul-smelling gases, with [[hydrogen sulfide]] being most common in generating complaints. Large process plants in urban areas will often treat the odors with carbon reactors, a contact media with bio-slimes, small doses of [[chlorine]], or circulating fluids to biologically capture and metabolize the noxious gases.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, James D. and Welles Products Corporation (1976).[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4421534.html "Tower for removing odors from gases."] U.S. Patent No. 4421534.&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of odor control exist, including addition of iron salts, [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[calcium nitrate]], etc. to manage [[hydrogen sulfide]] levels.

[[High-density solids pump]]s are suitable for reducing odors by conveying sludge through hermetic closed pipework.

== Energy requirements ==
For conventional sewage treatment plants, around 30 percent of the annual operating costs is usually required for energy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|1703}} The energy requirements vary with type of treatment process as well as wastewater load. For example, [[constructed wetland]]s have a lower energy requirement than [[activated sludge]] plants, as less energy is required for the aeration step.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, H., Platzer, C., von Münch, E., Winker, M. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/930 Technology review of constructed wetlands – Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment]. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Sewage treatment plants that produce biogas in their [[sewage sludge treatment]] process with [[anaerobic digestion]] can produce enough energy to meet most of the energy needs of the sewage treatment plant itself.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|1505}}

In conventional secondary treatment processes, most of the electricity is used for aeration, pumping systems and equipment for the dewatering and drying of [[sewage sludge]]. Advanced wastewater treatment plants, e.g. for nutrient removal, require more energy than plants that only achieve primary or secondary treatment.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|1704}}

==Sludge treatment and disposal==
{{main|Sewage sludge treatment}}
The sludges accumulated in a wastewater treatment process must be treated and disposed of in a safe and effective manner. The purpose of digestion is to reduce the amount of [[organic matter]] and the number of disease-causing [[microorganism]]s present in the solids. The most common treatment options include [[anaerobic digestion]], [[aerobic digestion]], and [[composting]]. [[Incineration]] is also used, albeit to a much lesser degree.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|19–21}}

Sludge treatment depends on the amount of solids generated and other site-specific conditions. Composting is most often applied to small-scale plants with aerobic digestion for mid-sized operations, and anaerobic digestion for the larger-scale operations.

The sludge is sometimes passed through a so-called pre-thickener which de-waters the sludge. Types of pre-thickeners include centrifugal sludge thickeners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/centrifuge-thickening-and-dewatering|publisher=EPA|access-date=16 October 2017|title=Centrifuge Thickening and Dewatering}}&lt;/ref&gt; rotary drum sludge thickeners and belt filter presses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/belt-filter-press|publisher=EA|access-date=16 October 2017|title=Belt Filter Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewatered sludge may be incinerated or transported offsite for disposal in a landfill or use as an agricultural soil amendment.

==Environment aspects==
[[File:Výpust přečištěné vody z ČOV Boletice.jpg|thumb|Treated water from [[Wastewater treatment|WWTP]] [[Děčín]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
[[File:ČOV Boletice - ústí přečištěné vody do Labe.jpg|thumb|Treated water drained to the Elbe river, [[Děčín]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
[[File:MiRO3.jpg|thumb|The outlet of the [[Karlsruhe]] sewage treatment plant flows into the [[Alb (Northern Black Forest)|Alb]]]]
Many processes in a wastewater treatment plant are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes that occur in the environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall [[ecology]] of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to [[ultraviolet]] radiation. Consequently, in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including [[hormone]]s (from [[animal husbandry]] and residue from human [[hormonal contraception]] methods) and synthetic materials such as [[phthalate]]s that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/444304/1290036/1290100/1290353/1294402/1311542/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |title=Environment Agency (archive) – Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic PBT substances |accessdate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804195610/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/444304/1290036/1290100/1290353/1294402/1311542/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |archivedate=August 4, 2006 |df= }}. environment-agency.gov.uk.

USGS&lt;/ref&gt; In the US and [[European Union|EU]], uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law, and strict water quality requirements are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential. (For requirements in the US, ''see [[Clean Water Act#Point sources|Clean Water Act]].'') A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries.

===Effects on biology===
Sewage treatment plants can have multiple effects on nutrient levels in the water that the treated sewage flows into. These nutrients can have large effects on the biological life in the water in contact with the effluent.
[[Stabilization pond]]s (or sewage treatment ponds) can include any of the following:
* Oxidation ponds, which are aerobic bodies of water usually {{convert|1|–|2|m}} in depth that receive effluent from sedimentation tanks or other forms of primary treatment.
:* Dominated by [[algae]]
* Polishing ponds are similar to oxidation ponds but receive effluent from an oxidation pond or from a plant with an extended mechanical treatment.
:* Dominated by [[zooplankton]]
* [[Facultative lagoon]]s, raw sewage lagoons, or sewage lagoons are ponds where sewage is added with no primary treatment other than coarse screening. These ponds provide effective treatment when the surface remains aerobic; although anaerobic conditions may develop near the layer of settled sludge on the bottom of the pond.&lt;ref name="Metcalf &amp; Eddy" /&gt;{{rp|552–554}}
* Anaerobic lagoons are heavily loaded ponds.
:* Dominated by [[bacteria]]
* Sludge lagoons are aerobic ponds, usually {{convert|2|to|5|m}} in depth, that receive anaerobically digested primary sludge, or activated secondary sludge under water.
:* Upper layers are dominated by algae &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00288330.1968.9515271|author=Haughey, A. |year=1968|title=The Planktonic Algae of Auckland Sewage Treatment Ponds|journal=New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research|volume=2|issue=4|pages=721–766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphorus limitation is a possible result from sewage treatment and results in flagellate-dominated [[plankton]], particularly in summer and fall.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, W.T. (1972). "Nutrients and Phytoplankton in Lake Washington." in ''Nutrients and Eutrophication: The Limiting Nutrient Controversy.'' American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Special Symposia. Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[phytoplankton]] study found high nutrient concentrations linked to sewage effluents. High nutrient concentration leads to high [[chlorophyll a]] concentrations, which is a proxy for primary production in marine environments. High primary production means high [[phytoplankton]] populations and most likely high zooplankton populations, because zooplankton feed on phytoplankton. However, effluent released into marine systems also leads to greater population instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Caperon, J.|author2=Cattell, S. A.|author3=Krasnick, G.|lastauthoramp=yes|url=http://www.nospam.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_16/issue_4/0599.pdf|title=Phytoplankton Kinetics in a Subtropical Estuary: Eutrophication|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=16|issue=4|pages=599–607|year=1971|doi=10.4319/lo.1971.16.4.0599}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planktonic trends of high populations close to input of treated sewage is contrasted by the [[bacterial]] trend. In a study of ''[[Aeromonas]]'' spp. in increasing distance from a wastewater source, greater change in seasonal cycles was found the furthest from the effluent. This trend is so strong that the furthest location studied actually had an inversion of the ''Aeromonas'' spp. cycle in comparison to that of [[fecal coliforms]]. Since there is a main pattern in the cycles that occurred simultaneously at all stations it indicates seasonal factors (temperature, solar radiation, phytoplankton) control of the bacterial population. The effluent dominant species changes from ''Aeromonas caviae'' in winter to ''Aeromonas sobria'' in the spring and fall while the inflow dominant species is ''Aeromonas caviae'', which is constant throughout the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=184551 |pmid=2389929 |year=1990 |last1=Monfort |first1=P |last2=Baleux |first2=B |title=Dynamics of Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria, and Aeromonas caviae in a sewage treatment pond |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=1999–2006 |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reuse ==
{{Main|Reclaimed water}}
With suitable technology, it is possible to reuse sewage effluent for drinking water, although this is usually only done in places with limited water supplies, such as [[Windhoek]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;PUB (Singapore National Water Agency)(2011). [http://www.pub.gov.sg/about/historyfuture/Pages/NEWater.aspx "NEWater: History."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610102220/http://www.pub.gov.sg/about/historyfuture/pages/newater.aspx |date=2013-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[arid]] countries, treated wastewater is often used in [[agriculture]]. For example, in Israel, about 50 percent of agricultural water use (total use was {{convert|1000000000|m3|spell=in}} in 2008) is provided through reclaimed sewer water. Future plans call for increased use of treated sewer water as well as more [[desalination plant]]s as part of [[water supply and sanitation in Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Farming in Israel, without a drop to spare |first=Andrew |last=Martin |newspaper=New York Times |date=2008-08-10 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-10feed.15134930.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constructed wetland]]s fed by wastewater provide both treatment and [[habitats]] for flora and fauna. Another example for reuse combined with treatment of sewage are the [[East Kolkata Wetlands]] in India. These wetlands are used to treat [[Kolkata]]'s sewage, and the nutrients contained in the wastewater sustain fish farms and agriculture.

== Developing countries ==
[[File:Sewage treatment plant in Gobabis, Namibia (2018).jpg|thumb|Sewage treatment plant in [[Gobabis]], [[Namibia]] (2018) {{Coordinate|NS=-22.476398|EW= 18.951620|type=landmark|region=NA-OH|text=ICON2|name=Sewage treatment Gobabis, Namibia}}]]
Few reliable figures exist on the share of the wastewater collected in sewers that is being treated in the world. A global estimate by [[UNDP]] and [[UN-Habitat]] is that 90% of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corcoran, E., C. Nellemann, E.

In Latin America about 15 percent of collected wastewater passes through treatment plants (with varying levels of actual treatment). In [[Venezuela]], a below average country in [[South America]] with respect to wastewater treatment, 97 percent of the country’s [[sewage]] is discharged raw into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Appropriate Technology for Sewage Pollution Control in the Wider Caribbean Region |last = Caribbean Environment Programme |year=1998 |publisher= United Nations Environment Programme |location=Kingston, Jamaica |isbn= |pages= |url=http://www.cep.unep.org/publications-and-resources/technical-reports/tr40en.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-12}} Technical Report No. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iran]], a relatively developed [[Middle East]]ern country, the majority of [[Tehran]]'s population has totally untreated sewage injected to the city’s groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;Massoud Tajrishy and Ahmad Abrishamchi (2005).

Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the construction of major parts of the sewage system, collection and treatment, in Tehran is almost complete, and under development, due to be fully completed by the end of 2012. In Isfahan, Iran's third largest city, sewage treatment was started more than 100 years ago.

Only few cities in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] have sewer-based [[sanitation]] systems, let alone wastewater treatment plants, an exception being South Africa and – until the late 1990s – Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbabwe: [https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/11/19/zimbabwe-water-and-sanitation-crisis Water and Sanitation Crisis], Human Rights Watch, &lt;/ref&gt; Instead, most urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa rely on on-site sanitation systems without sewers, such as [[septic tanks]] and [[pit latrines]], and [[fecal sludge management]] in these cities is an enormous challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhry, S., Koné, D.

==History==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:FaradayFatherThames.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Stink]] of 1858 stimulated research into the problem of sewage treatment. In this caricature in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Michael Faraday]] reports to ''Father [[River Thames|Thames]]'' on the state of the river.]]
Basic sewer systems were used for waste removal in ancient [[Mesopotamia]], where vertical shafts carried the waste away into cesspools. Similar systems existed in the [[Indus Valley]] civilization in modern-day India and in Ancient [[Crete]] and [[Greece]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] the sewer systems built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] fell into disuse and waste was collected into cesspools that were periodically emptied by workers known as 'rakers' who would often sell it as [[fertilizer]] to farmers outside the city.

Modern sewage systems were first built in the mid-nineteenth century as a reaction to the exacerbation of sanitary conditions brought on by heavy [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. Due to the contaminated water supply, [[cholera]] outbreaks occurred in [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics|1832, 1849 and 1855]] in [[London]], killing tens of thousands of people. This, combined with the [[Great Stink]] of 1858, when the smell of untreated human waste in the [[River Thames]] became overpowering, and the report into sanitation reform of the [[Royal Commission]]er [[Edwin Chadwick]],&lt;ref name=Ashton-Ubido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] appointing [[Joseph Bazalgette]] to construct a vast underground sewage system for the safe removal of waste. Contrary to Chadwick's recommendations, Bazalgette's system, and others later built in [[Continental Europe]], did not pump the sewage onto farm land for use as fertilizer; it was simply piped to a natural waterway away from population centres, and pumped back into the environment.

===Early attempts===
One of the first attempts at diverting sewage for use as a fertilizer in the farm was made by the [[cotton mill]] owner [[James Smith (inventor)|James Smith]] in the 1840s. He experimented with a piped distribution system initially proposed by James Vetch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GV1YAAAAYAAJ|title=A short description of the plans of Captain James Vetch for the sewerage of the metropolis|author=Lewis Dunbar B. Gordon|year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; that collected sewage from his factory and pumped it into the outlying farms, and his success was enthusiastically followed by Edwin Chadwick and supported by organic chemist [[Justus von Liebig]].

The idea was officially adopted by the [[Health of Towns Association|Health of Towns Commission]], and various schemes (known as sewage farms) were trialled by different municipalities over the next 50 years. At first, the heavier solids were channeled into ditches on the side of the farm and were covered over when full, but soon flat-bottomed tanks were employed as reservoirs for the sewage; the earliest patent was taken out by William Higgs in 1846 for "tanks or reservoirs in which the contents of sewers and drains from cities, towns and villages are to be collected and the solid animal or vegetable matters therein contained, solidified and dried..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6tvSwAACAAJ|title=History of Sewage Treatment in Britain|author=H. H. Stanbridge|year=1976|publisher=Institute of Water Pollution Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements to the design of the tanks included the introduction of the horizontal-flow tank in the 1850s and the radial-flow tank in 1905. These tanks had to be manually de-sludged periodically, until the introduction of automatic mechanical de-sludgers in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/leeds/cooper.pdf|title=Historical aspects of wastewater treatment|author=P. F. Cooper|accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precursor to the modern [[septic tank]] was the [[cesspool]] in which the water was sealed off to prevent contamination and the solid waste was slowly liquified due to anaerobic action; it was invented by L.H Mouras in France in the 1860s. Donald Cameron, as [[Surveying|City Surveyor]] for [[Exeter]] patented an improved version in 1895, which he called a 'septic tank'; septic having the meaning of 'bacterial'. These are still in worldwide use, especially in rural areas unconnected to large-scale sewage systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXnX4KkV00YC|title=The Sanitary City: Environmental Services in Urban America from Colonial Times to the Present|author=Martin V. Melosi|year=2010|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|page=110|isbn=978-0-8229-7337-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological treatment===
[[File:Frankland Edward 1894.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Frankland]], a distinguished chemist, who demonstrated the possibility of chemically treating sewage in the 1870s]]

It was not until the late 19th century that it became possible to treat the sewage by biologically decomposing the organic components through the use of [[microorganism]]s and removing the pollutants. Land treatment was also steadily becoming less feasible, as cities grew and the volume of sewage produced could no longer be absorbed by the farmland on the outskirts.

[[Edward Frankland]] conducted experiments at the sewage farm in [[Croydon]], England, during the 1870s and was able to demonstrate that filtration of sewage through porous gravel produced a nitrified effluent (the ammonia was converted into nitrate) and that the filter remained unclogged over long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-2rWpwJevEC|title=Edward Frankland: Chemistry, Controversy and Conspiracy in Victorian England|author=Colin A. Russell|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=372–380|isbn=978-0-521-54581-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This established the then revolutionary possibility of biological treatment of sewage using a contact bed to oxidize the waste. This concept was taken up by the chief chemist for the London [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], William Libdin, in 1887:
:...in all probability the true way of purifying sewage...will be first to separate the sludge, and then turn into neutral effluent... retain it for a sufficient period, during which time it should be fully aerated, and finally discharge it into the stream in a purified condition. This is indeed what is aimed at and imperfectly accomplished on a sewage farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=thEigV6yl64C|title=Advances in Water Treatment and Pollution Prevention|author1=Sharma, Sanjay Kumar |author2=Sanghi, Rashmi |year=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-007-4204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1885 to 1891 filters working on this principle were constructed throughout the UK and the idea was also taken up in the US at the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]] in [[Massachusetts]], where Frankland's work was confirmed. In 1890 the LES developed a '[[trickling filter]]' that gave a much more reliable performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ironwood.cpe.uchicago.edu/CPE_Workshop/paper/Cain-Rotella-Sept2005.pdf|title=Epidemics, demonstration effects, and municipal investment in sanitation capital.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904172532/http://ironwood.cpe.uchicago.edu/CPE_Workshop/paper/Cain-Rotella-Sept2005.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact beds were developed in [[City of Salford|Salford]], [[Lancashire]] and by scientists working for the [[London City Council]] in the early 1890s. According to Christopher Hamlin, this was part of a conceptual revolution that replaced the philosophy that saw "sewage purification as the prevention of decomposition with one that tried to facilitate the biological process that destroy sewage naturally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucessjb/Hamlin%201992.pdf|title=Edwin Chadwick and the Engineers, 1842–1854: Systems and Antisystems in the Pipe-and-Brick Sewers War Technology and Culture|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact beds were tanks containing the inert substance, such as stones or slate, that maximized the surface area available for the microbial growth to break down the sewage. The sewage was held in the tank until it was fully decomposed and it was then filtered out into the ground. This method quickly became widespread, especially in the UK, where it was used in [[Leicester]], [[Sheffield]], [[Manchester]] and [[Leeds]]. The bacterial bed was simultaneously developed by Joseph Corbett as Borough Engineer in [[City of Salford|Salford]] and experiments in 1905 showed that his method was superior in that greater volumes of sewage could be purified better for longer periods of time than could be achieved by the contact bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZRY6rrpKFGgC|title=Aerobic Wastewater Treatment Processes: History and Development|author=Tilley, David F.|year=2011|publisher=IWA Publishing|date=2011|isbn=978-1-84339-542-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal published its eighth report in 1912 that set what became the international standard for sewage discharge into rivers; the '20:30 standard', which allowed {{convert|20|mg}} [[Biochemical oxygen demand]] and {{convert|30|mg}} suspended solid per litre ({{convert|1|l|USgal|disp=out}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924003641929 Final report of the commissioners appointed to inquire and report what methods of treating and disposing of sewage (1912)]. us.archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">The '''Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality''' ('''SSSS''', or "'''quad-S'''"), formed in 1957, is a non-profit, international professional membership organization, based in the United States, that says it is "the oldest professional society dedicated to the advancement of knowledge about sexuality."  It reports to have more than 1,000 members and has a quarterly newsletter, ''Sexual Science''.  It produces two other publications:
* ''[[Annual Review of Sex Research]]'',  "''An Integrative and Interdisciplinary Review''"
* ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'', a scholarly journal published quarterly

==History==
According to its website, SSSS was established in 1957 by psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] to encourage the rigorous, systematic study of sexuality.

In 1980, organizer [[Robert Francoeur]] invited Philadelphia biologist [[Timothy Perper]] to join the society. Perper had recently finished charting the mating behavior of five-hundred couples in bars in the U.S. and Canada. That year he presented the early results of his findings to the society. His book, detailing findings, is called ''Sex  Signals – the Biology of Love'' and was published in 1985.

Today, SSSS includes members of the following disciplines:  anthropologists, biologists, educators, historians, nurses, physicians, psychologists, sociologists, theologians, therapists, and many other disciplines.

SSSS boasts a strong commitment to its student members, with a "vigorous" student membership program and student awards, in addition to the other awards for professional members.

The '''Square Kilometre Array''' ('''SKA''') is a large multi [[radio telescope]] project proposed to be built in [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. If built, it would have a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skatelescope.org/about/facts-figures/ |title=Facts and figures |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1117/2.3201407.12| title = Philip Diamond plenary: The Square Kilometre Array: A Physics Machine for the 21st Century| journal = SPIE Newsroom| year = 2014| last1 = Spie}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size would make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument. It would require very high performance central computing engines and long-haul links with a capacity greater than the global [[Internet traffic]] as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SKA-Brochure.pdf], ''The Square Kilometre Array'', p.19&lt;/ref&gt; It should be able to [[Astronomical survey|survey the sky]] more than ten thousand times faster than before.

With receiving stations extending out to a distance of at least 3,000&amp;nbsp;kilometres (1,900&amp;nbsp;mi) from a concentrated central core, it would exploit [[radio astronomy]]'s ability to provide the highest resolution [[image]]s in all [[astronomy]]. The SKA would be built in the [[southern hemisphere]], in sub-Saharan states with cores in South Africa and Australia, where the view of the [[Milky Way]] [[Galaxy]] is the best and [[radio interference]] at its least.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt;

The SKA is projected to cost €1.8 billion, including €650 million for Phase 1. The funding will come from many international funding agencies. The SKA and the [[European Extremely Large Telescope]] (E-ELT) are two flagship facilities for ground-based astronomy in the future.

Construction of the SKA is scheduled to begin in 2019 for initial observations by 2022, but the construction budget is not secured at this stage{{when|date=October 2018}}. The SKA would be built in two phases, with Phase 1 representing about 10% of the capability of the whole telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skatelescope.org/about/project/ |title=The project timeline |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=28 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ajn9v23t?url=http://www.skatelescope.org/about/project/ |archivedate=17 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ska.ac.za/about/bid.php |title=SKA site bid outcome |publisher=SKA Africa |accessdate=28 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626022118/http://ska.ac.za/about/bid.php |archivedate=26 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 1 of the SKA was cost-capped at 650 million euros in 2013, while Phase 2's cost has not yet been established.&lt;ref name="SKA Project"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.skatelescope.org/project/ |title=SKA Project |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the project are located at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]], in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.skatelescope.org/ska-organisation/ |title=The SKA Organisation |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32523768 UK to be giant telescope's HQ].

==Description==
[[File:SKA participants map.svg|thumb|320px|Countries that participated in the preparatory phase of SKA&lt;ref name=SKAorghist&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.skatelescope.org/the-organisation/history-of-the-organisation/participating-countries/ |title=Participating countries |publisher=SKA Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The SKA will combine the signals received from thousands of small [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] spread over a distance of several thousand kilometres to simulate a single giant radio telescope capable of extremely high sensitivity and angular resolution, using a technique called [[aperture synthesis]].&lt;ref name=skalayout&gt;{{cite web|title=The SKA Layout|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/layout/|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sub-arrays of the SKA will also have a very large field-of-view (FOV), making it possible to survey very large areas of sky at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World’s Largest Radio Telescope Takes A Major Step Towards Construction|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/news/worlds-largest-radio-telescope-near-construction/|website=SKA Science|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One innovative development is the use of [[Focal-plane array (radio astronomy)|focal-plane arrays]] using [[phased-array]] technology to provide multiple [[FOV]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SKA Aperture Arrays|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/aperture-arrays/|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will greatly increase the survey speed of the SKA and enable several users to observe different pieces of the sky simultaneously, which is useful for (e.g.) monitoring multiple pulsars. The combination of a very large FOV with high sensitivity means that the SKA will be able to compile extremely large surveys of the sky considerably faster than any other telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How will SKA1 be better than today's best radio telescopes? [image]|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SKA-3-aspects-Infographic_OP-rgb.jpg|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SKA will provide continuous frequency coverage from 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz in the first two phases of its construction. A third phase will then extend the frequency range up to 30&amp;nbsp;GHz.
* Phase 1: Providing ~10% of the total collecting area at low and mid frequencies by 2023 (SKA1).&lt;ref name=ska1&gt;{{cite web|title=SKA1|url=http://astronomers.skatelescope.org/ska1/|website=SKA Science|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 2: Completion of the full array (SKA2) at low and mid frequencies by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SKA2|url=http://astronomers.skatelescope.org/ska2/|website=SKA Science|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency range from 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz, spanning more than two [[Decade (log scale)|decades]], cannot be realised using one design of antenna and so the SKA will comprise separate sub-arrays of different types of antenna elements that will make up the SKA-low, SKA-mid and survey arrays:

[[File:SKA sparse array big.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a Low-Band SKA Sparse Aperture Array Station]]
[[File:SKA dense array big.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a SKA Dense Aperture Array Station]]

# SKA-low array – a phased array of simple [[dipole antenna]]s to cover the frequency range from 50 to 350&amp;nbsp;MHz. These will be grouped in 100&amp;nbsp;m diameter stations each containing about 90 elements.
# SKA-mid array – an array of several thousand [[Parabolic antenna|dish antennas]] (around 200 to be built in Phase 1) to cover the frequency range 350&amp;nbsp;MHz to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz. It is expected that the antenna design will follow that of the [[Allen Telescope Array]] using an offset Gregorian design having a height of 15 metres and a width of 12 metres.&lt;ref name=ska1 /&gt;
# SKA-survey array – a compact array of parabolic dishes of 12–15 meters diameter each for the medium-frequency range, each equipped with a multi-beam, phased array feed with a large field of view and several receiving systems covering about 350&amp;nbsp;MHz – 4&amp;nbsp;GHz. The survey sub-array was removed from the SKA1 specification following a "rebaselining" exercise in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McPherson|first1=A.|title=REPORT AND OPTIONS FOR RE-BASELINING OF SKA-1|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SKA-TEL-SKO-0000229_Report-and-Options-for-Re-Baselining-of-SKA-1-Word_Amm-signed.pdf|website=SKA Telescope|publisher=SKAO|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area covered by the SKA – extending out to ~3000&amp;nbsp;km – will comprise three regions:&lt;ref name=skalayout /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewdney|first1=P. E.|title=SKA Baseline Design|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/SKA-TEL-SKO-DD-001-1_BaselineDesign1.pdf|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A central region containing about 5&amp;nbsp;km diameter cores of SKA-mid antennas (South Africa) and SKA-low dipoles (Western Australia). These central regions will contain approximately half of the total collecting area of the SKA arrays.
# A mid region extending out to 180&amp;nbsp;km. This will contain dishes and pairs of SKA-mid and SKA-low stations. In each case they will be randomly placed within the area with the density of dishes and stations falling off towards the outer part of the region.
# An outer region from 180&amp;nbsp;km to 3000&amp;nbsp;km. This will comprise five spiral arms, along which dishes of SKA-mid, grouped into stations of 20 dishes, will be located. The separation of the stations increases towards the outer ends of the spiral arms.

The capabilities of the SKA will be designed to address a wide range of questions in [[astrophysics]], [[physics#Fundamental physics|fundamental physics]], [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[particle astrophysics]] as well as extending the range of the [[observable universe]]. A number of key science projects that have been selected for implementation via the SKA are listed below.

===Extreme tests of general relativity===
{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}
For almost one hundred years, [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]] has precisely predicted the outcome of every experiment made to test it. Most of these tests, including the most stringent ones, have been carried out using radio astronomical measurements. By using [[pulsars]] as cosmic [[gravitational wave]] detectors, or timing pulsars found orbiting [[black holes]], astronomers will be able to examine the limits of general relativity such as the behaviour of [[spacetime]] in regions of extremely curved space. The goal is to reveal whether Einstein was correct in his description of space, time and gravity, or whether [[alternatives to general relativity]] are needed to account for these phenomena.

===Galaxies, cosmology, dark matter and dark energy===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Dark matter}}
The sensitivity of the SKA in the [[hydrogen line|21 cm hydrogen line]] will map a billion galaxies out to the edge of the observable Universe. The [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] revealed will give constraints to determine the processes resulting in [[galaxy formation and evolution]]. Imaging [[hydrogen]] through the Universe will provide a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] picture of the first ripples of structure that formed individual galaxies and clusters. This may also allow the measurement of effects [[hypothesis|hypothetically]] caused by [[dark energy]] and causing the increasing [[Hubble's law|rate of expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Evolution, Cosmology And Dark Energy – Further Information|url=http://www.skatelescope.org/the-science/ska-key-science-projects/ska-key-science-projects/galaxy-evolution/  |publisher=Skatelescope.org |date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cosmological measurements enabled by SKA galaxy surveys include testing models of dark energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1501.04088|title=Measuring baryon acoustic oscillations with future SKA surveys |journal=PoS AASKA () 024 |volume=14 |issue=2015 |author= Philip Bull |author2= Stefano Camera |author3= Alvise Raccanelli|author4= Chris Blake |author5= Pedro G.

===Epoch of re-ionization===
The SKA is intended to provide observational data from the so-called [[timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|Dark Ages]] (between 300,000 years after the [[Big Bang]] when the universe became cool enough for hydrogen to become neutral and decouple from radiation) and the time of [[First light (astronomy)|First Light]] (a billion years later when young galaxies are seen to form for the first time and hydrogen becomes again ionized). By observing the primordial distribution of gas, the SKA should be able to see how the Universe gradually lit up as its stars and galaxies formed and then evolved. This period between the Dark Ages and First Light is considered the first chapter in the cosmic story of creation and the distance to see this event is the reason for the Square Kilometre Array's design. To see back to First Light requires a telescope 100 times more powerful than the biggest radio telescopes currently in the world, taking up 1 million square metres of collecting area, or one square kilometre.&lt;ref&gt;RiAus 2011, ''Radio Astronomy: Something Kinda Awesome, (SKA), viewed 1st October 2014'', http://vimeo.com/23460933/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic magnetism===
It is still not possible to answer basic questions about the origin and evolution of [[magnetism|cosmic magnetic fields]], but it is clear that they are an important component of interstellar and intergalactic space. By mapping the effects of magnetism on the radiation from very distant galaxies, the SKA will investigate the form of cosmic magnetism and the role it has played in the evolving Universe.

===Search for extraterrestrial life===
This key science program, called "Cradle of Life", will focus on three  objectives: [[protoplanetary disc]]s in [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zones]], search for prebiotic chemistry, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nrao.edu/science/Decadal%20Survey/rfi/SKA.pdf The  Square Kilometre Array Project Description for Astro 2010] -Response to Program Prioritization Panels. James Cordes. 1 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The SKA will be able to probe the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] of Sun-like [[protostar]]s, where [[Earth analog|Earth-like planets]] or moons are most likely to have environments favourable for the [[abiogenesis|development of life]].&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;[https://www.skatelescope.org/cradle-life/ SKA - Cradle Of Life].

Wilner. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The signatures of forming Earth-like planets imprinted on circumstellar dust may be the most conspicuous evidence of their presence and evolution,&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt; and may even detect [[planetary habitability|planets capable of supporting life]].&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://astronomy.curtin.edu.au/research/ska.cfm Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy] - Cradle of Life. April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Astrobiology|Astrobiologists]] will also use the SKA to search for complex [[organic compound]]s (carbon-containing chemicals) in outer space, including [[amino acid]]s, by identifying spectral lines at specific frequencies.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;
*The SKA will be capable of detecting extremely weak radio emissions "leakage" from nearby [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] civilizations, if they exist.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;

==Locations==
The headquarters of the SKA will be located at [[Manchester]]'s [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]], [[Cheshire]], England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skatelescope.org/news/construction-starts-ska-organisation-headquarters/ |title=Construction starts on SKA Organisation headquarters |date=18 April 2012 |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the telescopes will be installed in Australia and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ska.gov.au/About/Pages/CohostingTheSKA.aspx Co-hosting the SKA]. SKA&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:SKA-scanner.jpg|thumb|An automatic wideband radio scanner system was used to survey the radio frequency noise levels at the various candidate sites in South Africa.]]
Suitable sites for the SKA telescope must be in unpopulated areas with guaranteed very low levels of man-made radio interference. Four sites were initially proposed in South Africa, Australia, Argentina and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koenig|first=Robert|date=18 August 2006|title=RADIO ASTRONOMY: Candidate Sites for World's Largest Telescope Face First Big Hurdle|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]]|volume=313|issue=5789|pages=910–912|doi=10.1126/science.313.5789.910|pmid=16917038}}&lt;/ref&gt; After considerable site evaluation surveys, Argentina and China were dropped and the other two sites were shortlisted (with New Zealand joining the Australian bid, and 8 other African countries joining the South African bid):

'''Australia:''' The core site is located at the [[Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory]] (MRO) at [[Mileura Station]] near [[Boolardy]] in [[Western Australia]] 315&amp;nbsp;km north-east of [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]]&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;Amos, J.

'''South Africa:''' The core site is located at {{Coord|30|43|16.068|S|21|24|40.06|E|display=inline}} at an elevation of about 1000 metres in the [[Karoo]] area of the arid [[Northern Cape]] Province, about 75&amp;nbsp;km north-west of [[Carnarvon, South Africa|Carnarvon]], with distant stations in [[Botswana]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]].

On 10 March 2012 it was reported that the SKA Site Advisory Committee had made a confidential report in February that the South African bid was stronger.&lt;ref name="age 20120309"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flitton|first=Daniel|title=Australia on the outer for largest space telescope|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/australia-on-the-outer-for-largest-space-telescope-20120309-1upwr.html|accessdate=9 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final decision on the site by the project's board of directors was expected on 4 April 2012.&lt;ref name="age 20120309"/&gt; However a scientific working group was set up to explore possible implementation options of the two candidate host regions, and its report was expected in mid May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Further delays signalled in super-telescope plan |agency=AFP |work=[[The Australian]]| date =5 April 2012 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/further-delays-signalled-in-super-telescope-plan/story-e6frgakx-1226319328674| accessdate =10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors, pathfinders and design studies==
Many groups are working globally to develop the technology and techniques required for the SKA. Their contributions to the international SKA project are classified as either: Precursors, Pathfinders or Design Studies.
* Precursor facility: A telescope on one of the two SKA candidate sites, carrying out SKA-related activity.
* Pathfinder: A telescope or programme carrying out SKA-related technology, science and operations activity.
* Design Study: A study of one or more major sub-systems of the SKA design, including the construction of prototypes

====Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP)====
{{Main|Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder}}
The Australian SKA Pathfinder, or ASKAP, is an A$100 million project to build a telescope array of thirty-six twelve-metre dishes. It will employ advanced, innovative technologies such as [[Focal-plane array (radio astronomy)|phased array feeds]] to give a wide field of view (30 square degrees).

ASKAP is being built by [[CSIRO]] at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory site, located near [[Boolardy]] in the mid-west region of Western Australia. All 36 antennas and their technical systems were officially opened in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Osborne |first=Darren |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-05/outback-observatory-open-for-business/4298094 |title=Outback observatory open for business - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====MeerKAT====
{{Main|MeerKAT}}
MeerKAT is a South African project consisting of an array of sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter dishes as a world class science instrument, and also to help develop technology for the SKA. [[KAT-7]], a seven-dish engineering and science testbed instrument for MeerKAT, near Carnarvon in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa was commissioned in 2012 and is up and running. As of May 2018, all sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter (44.3 feet) dish antennae have been completed with verification tests underway to ensure the instruments are functioning correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tshangela|first1=Lebo|title=MeerKAT telescope is complete|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/meerkat-telescope-is-complete/|accessdate=25 May 2018|work=SABC News|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dishes will be equipped with a number of high performance single pixel feeds to cover frequencies from 580&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ska.ac.za|title=SKA SA – Square Kilometre Array radio telescope (SKA) South Africa|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data challenges====
The amount of sensory information collected pose a huge storage problem and require real-time [[signal processing]] to reduce the information to relevant data. In mid 2011 it was estimated the array could generate an [[exabyte]] a day of raw data, which could be compressed to around 10 [[petabyte]]s.&lt;ref name="ttgmd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/392735/ska_telescope_generate_more_data_than_entire_internet_2020/ |title=SKA telescope to generate more data than entire Internet in 2020 |date=7 July 2011 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG Communications |accessdate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technology Development Project (TDP)====
The Technology Development Project, or TDP, is a US$12 million project to specifically develop dish and feed technology for the SKA. It is operated by a consortium of universities led by [[Cornell University]] and was completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skatdp.astro.cornell.edu/|title=Welcome to the SKA TDP Website|first=Shami|last=Chatterjee|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline and funding==
The SKA was originally conceived in 1991 with an international working group set up in 1993. This led to the signing of the first Memorandum of Agreement in 2000. Considerable early development work then followed. This culminated in the commencement of PrepSKA in 2008 leading to a full SKA design in 2012. Construction of Phase 1 will take place from 2018 to 2020 providing an operational array capable of carrying out the first science. Phase 2 will then follow for completion in 2025 providing full sensitivity for frequencies up to at least 14&amp;nbsp;GHz.

==Project risks==
Potential risks for priority astronomical sites in South Africa are protected by the [[Astronomy Geographic Advantage Act]] of 2007. Put in place to specifically support the South African SKA bid, it outlaws all activities that could endanger scientific operation of core astronomical instruments. In 2010, concerns were raised over the will to enforce this law when [[Royal Dutch Shell]] applied to explore the [[Karoo]] for [[shale gas]] using [[hydraulic fracturing]], an activity that would have the potential to increase [[radio interference]] at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nordling|first=Linda|title=Mining plans pose threat to South African astronomy site|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110322/full/news.2011.174.html?s=news_rss|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An identified remote station location for the southern African array in [[Mozambique]] was subject to flooding and excluded from the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201206270018.html
|title=Mozambique: Exact Location of SKA Telescope Sought
|date=26 June 2012

despite the SKA Site Selection Committee technical analysis reporting that all African remote stations could implement flood mitigation solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skatelescope.org/uploaded/34228_120216_SSAC.Report_web.pdf|title=Report and Recommendation of the SKA Site Advisory Committee (SSAC)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's first [[radio quiet zone]] was established by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) on 11 April 2005 specifically to protect and maintain the current "radio-quietness" of the main Australian SKA site at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planning for the radio astronomy service |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100628 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909092701/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD//pc=PC_100628 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=3 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, a former Australian SKA Committee chairman raised concerns with South African media about risks at the Australian candidate site, particularly in terms of cost, mining interference and land agreements. SKA Australia stated that all points had been addressed in the site bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

During 2014, South Africa experienced a month-long strike action by the [[National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa|National Union of Metalworkers]] (NUMSA), which added to the delays of the installation of dishes. The plan was to have six dishes operational by November, but only one [[MeerKAT]] dish stands on the [[Karoo]] site in the Northern Cape.&lt;ref name="Strike action"&gt;{{cite news

The largest risk to the overall project is probably its budget, which up until now has not been committed.&lt;ref name="SKA Project"/&gt;

==Opposition to the SKA project==
There has been opposition to the project from farmers and businesses, as well as individuals, since the project's inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronomers and sheep farmers butt heads over the Square Kilometer Array|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21713855-radio-telescope-project-encounters-nimbyism-remote-part-south|website=www.economist.com|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocacy group called Save the Karoo has stated that the radio quiet zone will create further unemployment in the region where unemployment is already above 32%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Karoo|url=http://savethekaroo.com/|website=savethekaroo.com/|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers had stated that the agriculture-based economy in the Karoo would collapse if they were forced to sell their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarah|first1=Wild|title=In South Africa, Opposition Flares against Giant SKA Radio Telescope|date=22 June 2016|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/in-south-africa-opposition-flares-against-giant-ska-radio-telescope/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wild|first1=Sarah|title=Giant SKA telescope rattles South African community|url=http://www.nature.com/news/giant-ska-telescope-rattles-south-african-community-1.20129|website=Nature|accessdate=30 March 2017|pages=444–446|language=en|doi=10.1038/534444a|date=23 June 2016|bibcode = 2016Natur.534..444W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Mars Generation was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old [[Abigail Harrison]], popularly known as "Astronaut Abby" and has the support of high-level advisory board members which includes astronauts, engineers and scientists as well as [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[education]] and [[business]] professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/30544-astronaut-abby-launches-mars-generation.html|title=Launching 'The Mars Generation': Teen on Mission to Get People to Mars|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison started [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] and space advocacy work at the age of 13 by initially setting up a [[Twitter]] account under her childhood nickname "Astronaut Abby."  She used her @AstronautAbby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AstronautAbby|title=Abigail Harrison (@AstronautAbby) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter account to connect with [[NASA]] employees to try and procure a quote for her National History Day project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her account biography stated that she was aspiring to be an astronaut and had a goal to be the first person to set foot on Mars. After she received the NASA quote, she began to share her journey to Mars which included tweets about space events, school and her personal life with the goal of not only exciting people about mars exploration but creating advocates for human space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sirian Experiments''''' is a 1980 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the third book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues the story of [[Earth]]'s [[evolution]], which has been manipulated from the beginning by advanced [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial civilisation]]s.&lt;ref name=BooksOfTheTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E5DE143BF930A25752C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Sirian Experiments |first=John |last=Leonard |authorlink=John Leonard (American critic) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=13 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in the United States in December 1980 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in March 1981 by [[Jonathan Cape]]. The book was shortlisted for the [[List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/1981 |title=The Man Booker Prize 1981 |work=[[Booker Prize]] |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sirian Experiments'' relates directly to the first book in this series, ''[[Shikasta]]'', which is the history of the planet Shikasta (an allegorical Earth) under the influence of three galactic empires, [[Canopus]], [[Sirius]] and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. ''Shikasta'' is told from the Canopean viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/shikastaby.html |title=Shikasta |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sirian Experiments'' (subtitled ''The Report by Ambien II, of the Five'') tells the story of Shikasta from the Sirian point of view and describes the activities of Sirians on the planet and the strained relations of Sirius with Canopus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/theexperiments.html |title=The Sirian Experiments |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessing stated in an [[afterword]] in the [[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8|next book]] in this series that ''The Sirian Experiments'' and ''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' were inspired by her 50-year fascination with the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|1910–13 Antarctic expedition]] of [[Robert Falcon Scott]].{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3DD1F38F93AA15752C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=29 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre and reception==
Because of its focus on characterisation and social/cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of technological details, ''The Sirian Experiments'' is not strictly science fiction but [[soft science fiction]], or "space fiction" as Lessing calls her ''Canopus in Argos'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} Robert Alter of ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre [[literary critic]] [[Northrop Frye]] called the "anatomy", which is "a combination of fantasy and morality" and that "presents us with a vision of the world in terms of a single intellectual pattern."&lt;ref name=NYTreview&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E3D8173BF932A25752C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Doris Lessing in the Visionary Mode |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Robert |last=Alter |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=11 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessing has stated that she has used this series as a vehicle to "put questions, both to myself and to others" and to "explore ideas and sociological possibilities."{{sfn|Lessing|1994b|loc="Preface", p. 11}}

While Lessing's switch to "science fiction" in the late 1970s was not well received by all,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mural.uv.es/vemivein/feminismcommunism.htm |title=Doris Lessing on Feminism, Communism and 'Space Fiction' |work=[[University of Valencia]] Press |first=Lesley |last=Hazelton |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series in general has drawn positive criticism. Two reviews of ''The Sirian Experiments'' in ''The New York Times'' said that Lessing achieves "… a largeness of vision beyond the horizon of the conventional novel."&lt;ref name=NYTreview/&gt; and that it has "… some playful moments and some splendid ones. It is interesting, however, primarily because Doris Lessing wrote it."&lt;ref name=BooksOfTheTimes/&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on the other hand, which had spoken highly of the first two books in this series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947537,00.html |title=Visit to a Small Planet |first=Paul |last=Gray |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=22 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924037,00.html |title=Soul Mates |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Paul |last=Gray |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=21 April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; felt that this one "may be a small misstep on a long journey."&lt;ref name=TIMEreview&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949106,00.html |title=More Lessing |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Paul |last=Gray |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=23 February 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The Sirian Empire, centred in the [[Sirius]] star system, has advanced technology that made their citizens effectively immortal (barring accidents) and sophisticated machines that did almost everything for them. But this technology came at a price: many Sirians became afflicted with "the existentials", a debilitating malady that left them feeling worthless and with no reason to exist. To overcome this problem and give its people "something to do", Sirius embarked on a conquest of space and [[Colonisation|colonised]] many planets. But they also encroached on territory of the superior Canopean Empire that led to a costly war, which [[Canopus]] won. As a gesture of reconciliation, Canopus returned all the captured Sirian territory and invited Sirius to jointly colonise a new and promising planet called Rohanda (an allegorical [[Earth]]). Canopus took the northern continents and gave Sirius the southern continents.

Ambien II, one of the Five who run the Sirian Colonial Service and also govern the Sirian Empire, represents Sirius on Rohanda. She sets in motion a series of [[biology|bio]]-[[Sociology|sociological]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] experiments where large numbers of primitive [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] from Sirian colonised planets are space-lifted to Rohanda and adapted there for work elsewhere in the Empire. In the north, Canopus nurtures Rohanda's bourgeoning [[humanoid]]s and accelerates their [[evolution]]. They also put a Lock on the planet that links it to the harmony and strength of the Canopean Empire. Canopus keeps Ambien II updated with reports of all their work, but she is suspicious of Sirius's former enemy, seeing them as a competitor rather than a partner, and is unable to correctly interpret them.

Then an unforeseen "cosmic re-alignment" breaks the Lock and Shammat of the malicious Puttiora Empire begins exploiting the situation by corrupting Rohanda's Natives. Canopus, seeing Rohanda decline, renames the planet [[Shikasta]] (the stricken). Sirius, unconcerned about Canopus's troubles in the north, continue to refer to the planet as Rohanda.

In an attempt to foster better relations with Sirius, Klorathy, a senior Canopean Colonial administrator, invites Ambien II to observe events in their territory. Ambien II, eager to learn more about Canopus, agrees. As Rohanda evolves and civilisations come and go, Ambien II and Klorathy meet several times to watch Rohanda's degeneration. Canopus does what it can to help communities, but with Shammat's evil and a broken Lock, they make little progress. From time to time Klorathy requests Ambien II's help and while working on the planet, she meets Nasar, another Canopean official. She also encounters Tafta, the Shammat commander on Rohanda, and at one point nearly succumbs to his corruption.

Ambien II eventually abandons the Sirian Experiments in the south when they are overrun by Shammat. The Five want her to abandon Rohanda altogether, but she has become too attached to the planet and is warming to Canopus and seeing the error of her (and Sirius's) ways. The Five question her ties to their former enemy, but when she tries to explain herself, they do not hear what she is saying, just as she initially could not hear what Canopus was saying. The Five then send her to Planet 13 on "corrective exile" to write a report on what has happened (this book). When she later releases the report, the Five issues a statement denying the authenticity of Ambien II's work.

'''Trompenaars' model of national culture differences''' is a framework for [[cross-cultural communication]] applied to general business and management, developed by [[Fons Trompenaars]] and [[Charles Hampden-Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;Trompenaars, F., Hampden-Turner, C. (1997) ''Riding the Waves of Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, G. (1996) "Riding the waves of commerce: a test of Trompenaars' "model" of national culture differences", in: ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations'' 20(2): p. 189-198.&lt;/ref&gt; This involved a large-scale survey of 8,841 managers and organization employees from 43 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Peter B.|last2=Dugan|first2=Shaun|last3=Trompenaars|first3=Fons|title=National culture and the values of organizational employees: A dimensional analysis across 43 nations|url=http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/27/2/231.short|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model of national culture differences has seven dimensions. There are five orientations covering the ways in which human beings deal with each other, one which deals with time, and one which deals with the environment.

*'''Universalism vs. Particularism'''
Universalism is the belief that ideas and practices can be applied everywhere without modification, while particularism is the belief that circumstances dictate how ideas and practices should be applied. It asks the question, ''What is more important, rules or relationships?'' Cultures with high universalism see one reality and focus on formal rules. Business meetings are characterized by rational, professional arguments with a "get down to business" attitude. Trompenaars research found there was high universalism in countries like the United States, Canada, UK, Australia, Germany, and Sweden. Cultures with high particularism see reality as more subjective and place a greater emphasis on relationships.  It is important to get to know the people one is doing business with during meetings in a particularist environment.  Someone from a universalist culture would be wise not to dismiss personal meanderings as irrelevancies or mere small talk during such business meetings.  Countries that have high particularism include Venezuela, Indonesia, China, South Korea, and the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management : culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|pages=123–125|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Individualism vs. Communitarianism'''  
Individualism refers to people regarding themselves as individuals, while communitarianism refers to people regarding themselves as part of a group. Trompenaars research yielded some interesting results and suggested that cultures may change more quickly that many people realize. It may not be surprising to see a country like the United States with high individualism, but Mexico and the former communist countries of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were also found to be individualistic in Trompenaars research. In Mexico, the shift from a previously communitarian culture could be explained with its membership in NAFTA and involvement in the global economy. This contrasts with [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|Hofstede's]] earlier research, which found these countries to be collectivist, and shows the dynamic and complex nature of culture.  Countries with high communitarianism include Germany, China, France, Japan, and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management : culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|pages=125–126|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Neutral vs. Emotional''' 
A neutral culture is a culture in which emotions are held in check whereas an emotional culture is a culture in which emotions are expressed openly and naturally.  Neutral cultures that come rapidly to mind are those of the Japanese and British.  Some examples of high emotional cultures are the Netherlands, Mexico, Italy, Israel and Spain. In emotional cultures, people often smile, talk loudly when excited, and greet each other with enthusiasm. So, when people from neutral culture are doing business in an emotional culture they should be ready for a potentially animated and boisterous meeting and should try to respond warmly.  As for those from an emotional culture doing business in a neutral culture, they should not be put off by a lack of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management: Culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|page=126|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Specific vs. Diffuse'''
A specific culture is one in which individuals have a large public space they readily share with others and small private space guard closely and share with only close friends and associates. A diffuse culture is one in which public space and private space are similar in size and individuals guard their public space carefully, because entry into public space affords entry into private space as well. It looks at how separate a culture keeps their personal and public lives. [[Fred Luthans]] and Jonathan Doh give the following example which explains this:

''An example of these specific and diffuse cultural dimensions is provided by the United States and Germany. A U.S. professor, such as Robert Smith, PhD, generally would be called “Doctor Smith” by students when at his U.S. university. When shopping, however, he might be referred to by the store clerk as “Bob,” and he might even ask the clerk’s advice regarding some of his intended purchases. When golfing, Bob might just be one of the guys, even to a golf partner who happens to be a graduate student in his department. The reason for these changes in status is that, with the specific U.S. cultural values, people have large public spaces and often conduct themselves differently depending on their public role. At the same time, however, Bob has private space that is off-limits to the students who must call him “Doctor Smith” in class. In high-diffuse cultures, on the other hand, a person’s public life and private life often are similar. Therefore, in Germany, Herr Professor Doktor Schmidt would be referred to that way at the university, local market, and bowling alley—and even his wife might address him formally in public. A great deal of formality is maintained, often giving the impression that Germans are stuffy or aloof.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management: culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=/new York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|pages=126–127|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2014/05/one-reason-cross-cultural-small-talk-is-so-tricky|title=One Reason Cross-Cultural Small Talk Is So Tricky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://x-culture.org/peach-vs-coconut-cultures/|title=PEACH VS. COCONUT CULTURES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Achievement vs. Ascription''' 
In an achievement culture, people are accorded status based on how well they perform their functions. In an ascription culture, status is based on who or what a person is. Does one have to prove himself to receive status or is it given to him? Achievement cultures include the US, Austria, Israel, Switzerland and the UK. Some ascription cultures are Venezuela, Indonesia, and China. When people from an achievement culture do business in an ascription culture it is important to have older, senior members with formal titles and respect should be shown to their counterparts. However, for an ascription culture doing business in an achievement culture, it is important to bring knowledgeable members who can prove to be proficient to other group, and respect should be shown for the knowledge and information of their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan P.|title=International management: culture, strategy, and behavior|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811257-7|page=127|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
* '''Sequential vs. Synchronic'''
A sequential time culture is the one in which the people like events to happen in a chronological order. The punctuality is very appreciated and they base their lives in schedules, plannification and specific and clear deadlines; in this kind of cultures time is very important and they do not tolerate the waste of time. Instead in synchronic cultures, they see specific time periods as interwoven periods, the use to highlight the importance of punctuality and deadlines if these are key to meeting objectives and they often work in several things at a time, they are also more flexible with the distribution of time and commitments. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/convergence-divergence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Internal vs. External control''' 
Do we control our environment or are we controlled by it?

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

==Ethnomusicologists==
[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1957) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]]  known for her studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[music]] and [[culture]].]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Notable ethnomusicologists include:

*[[Judith Becker]]
*[[Frances Densmore]]
*[[Ida Halpern]]
*[[Maud Karpeles]]
