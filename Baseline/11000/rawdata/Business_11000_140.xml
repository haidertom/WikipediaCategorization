'''''A Most Violent Year''''' is a 2014 American [[Crime film|crime]] [[Drama (genre)|drama film]] written and directed by [[J. C. Chandor]]. The film stars [[Oscar Isaac]] and [[Jessica Chastain]] with [[Alessandro Nivola]], [[David Oyelowo]], [[Albert Brooks]], and [[Catalina Sandino Moreno]]. The protagonist is Abel Morales (Isaac), the owner of a small heating-oil company who is stressed by the competitiveness in the oil trade and his having to secure costly loans to expand his business. When his truck drivers start getting hijacked, there is increased pressure for his drivers to arm themselves.

The film premiered as the opening film of [[AFI Fest]] on November 6, 2014, and it was released theatrically on December 31, 2014. It garnered positive reviews, and [[J. C. Chandor]], [[Neal Dodson]], and Anna Gerb won the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Film]].

==Plot==
In 1981 [[New York City|New York]], Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is the owner of an up-and-coming company that has suffered the [[Truck hijacking|hijacking]] of several trucks, each carrying [[heating oil]] worth thousands of dollars. One driver, Julian ([[Elyes Gabel]]), is severely beaten when his oil truck is hijacked by two unknown assailants. Abel's wife, Anna Morales (Jessica Chastain), beseeches Abel to fight violence with violence, but Abel refuses. Morales and his company are under investigation by Assistant District Attorney Lawrence ([[David Oyelowo]]), who seems determined to expose [[price fixing]], [[tax evasion]], and various other illegalities committed by Morales and his competitors in the heating oil business.

As a way to secure financial independence for himself and trump his competitors, Abel, with the help of his attorney, Andrew Walsh ([[Albert Brooks]]), brokers a deal with a group of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]], led by Josef Mendellsohn ([[Jerry Adler]]), to purchase a fuel oil terminal on the [[East River]]. This will allow Morales' company to directly import fuel oil from barges and to store far more oil in the summertime when fuel oil prices are lower. He places a large [[down payment]] of 40% on the property with the agreement that he will close in 30 days—if he fails to do so, the Chassidim will sell the terminal to one of Morales' competitors and keep the down payment.

After moving into a new home, Morales prevents what appears to be an attempted burglary, but the next day one of his daughters finds a loaded handgun dropped in the bushes by the perpetrator. Suspecting this intimidation is coming from his competitors, he begins to confront them one by one; each one denies any intimidation and theft to drive him out of business. The head of the [[Teamsters]] encourages Morales to arm his drivers with handguns and fake permits that he can secure for him. Morales refuses, believing that such a move could bring down even more heat on his operation from the authorities and potentially ruin his legitimate business connections with a bank financing his business.

Returning to work after weeks of rehabilitation, Julian is again accosted by criminals, this time on the [[Queensboro Bridge]] in broad daylight. Carrying a firearm without Abel's knowledge or permission, he engages in a shootout with the hijackers, which results in the police arriving and chasing Julian and the other assailants, who all escape. This incident once again shifts Morales and his company into the spotlight of not only ADA Lawrence, but also the bank, which informs him that due to the impending criminal [[indictment]]s and this unfortunate public incident, it can no longer finance his purchase of the terminal.

Desperate, and needing $1.5 million to close on the property, he approaches his competition, Saul Leftkowitz and his granddaughter, who agree to give him a $500,000 loan for 20% interest and [[equity (finance)|equity]] in the company for the term of the agreement. He manages to scrounge up another $200,000 by taking out a [[mortgage]] loan against an apartment building that he and his younger brother own together. With time winding down quickly, he intercepts a radio call for help from one of his drivers, who states his truck is being hijacked. Being nearby, he pursues the stolen truck. Eventually catching up to and attacking one of the hijackers, Morales demands to know who the mastermind is. The hijacker denies he was hired by anyone but reveals that he sold his last stolen shipment in [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]]. Morales confronts one of his competitors, who has facilities in Far Rockaway, threatening to alert the federal authorities as the stolen fuel is marked. The competitor agrees to pay Morales more than $200,000 for stolen fuel oil.

As Morales is getting closer to his $1.5 million goal, he visits [[Italian-American Mafia|mafia]]-affiliated Peter Forente (Alessandro Nivola) to ask for another $600,000. Forente agrees to give Morales the loan, but on very unfavorable terms. Dismayed by having to leverage his company to such a high degree in order to secure the loan, Morales begins to inform his wife, only to learn she has been "skimming" from the company for years and has been hiding the money, which is sufficient to cover the amount of money that Forente had agreed to lend, in a secret account.

Having the money he now needs, Morales and Walsh pay off his creditors and secure the terminal. As Abel, Anna, and Walsh are looking over the property, they are approached by an angry Julian carrying a gun, who blames Morales for his problems, believing that he should also be entitled to some of Morales' good fortune. Despondent by his being a wanted man, Julian commits suicide in front of Abel, Anna, and Walsh. As the police show up with ADA Lawrence to investigate the suicide, Morales expresses that the broader investigations into his firm are hurting his business, and that they should find a conclusion at some point. Lawrence agrees in general terms and suggests that this new fuel oil terminal will propel Morales' business and give him "political influence." Lawrence then suggests that Morales might be able to help him with his higher aspirations. Morales claims that he has always done "the most right thing".

== The Role of Intermediate Units ==
Pennsylvania’s intermediate units were created in 1971 in an effort to help school districts operate more efficiently and meet the specialized needs of their students.  Since then, these education agencies have evolved into an important resource on which school districts rely.

School districts and intermediate units are separate legal entities.  Intermediate units have no legal jurisdiction over school districts and do not control school districts.  On the contrary, intermediate units exist to serve school districts and provide leadership which will improve local operations.  Although intermediate units are an extension of the Pennsylvania Department of Education, they differ greatly from local school districts in several ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">The '''Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA)''', formerly known as the '''International Crop Improvement Association,''' is a [[trade organization]] based in the United States. Founded in 1919, its function is to develop and promote [[Certification|certified]] varieties of [[seed]] for agricultural use.

==History==
The International Crop Improvement Association evolved from the [[Wisconsin Crop Improvement Association]] (WCIA), initially called the [[Wisconsin Experiment Association]]. This was organized in 1901 by [[Ransom Asa Moore]] at the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison]] College of Agriculture, aided by graduates of that college and farmers, with the objective of improving and disseminating strains of seed.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;University of Wisconsin Agronomy Department, the First 100 Years: A Brief History of Agronomy at the University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison from 1903 to 2002, University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison. Dept. of Agronomy, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System, 2003, {{ISBN|0967958741}}, 9780967958743&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the International Crop Improvement Association followed in December 1919 when Moore presented a proposed constitution for the organization in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It was proposed that the organization be international rather than national to allow Canada to be a member.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Moore was named the first president of the organization in 1920.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Functions==
The Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA) assists clients in the production, identification, distribution and promotion of certified classes of seed and other crop propagation materials. Its membership currently includes seed certifying agencies across the US, and member countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, Chile and Brazil. Its mission is "To promote and facilitate the movement of seed or plant products in local, national, and international markets through the coordinated efforts of official seed certification agencies acting to evaluate, document, and verify that a seed or plant product meets certain accepted standards."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aosca.org/Page/About_AOSCA.aspx?nt=85 About AOSCA]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beyond the Core: Expand Your Market Without Abandoning Your Roots'''''  is a non-fiction book by American business consultant [[Chris Zook]]. This is the second book in his ''Profit from the Core'' trilogy, followed by ''[[Unstoppable (book)|Unstoppable]]'' released in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1578519519|publisher=[[amazon.com]]|title = Beyond the Core: Expand Your Market Without Abandoning Your Roots by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/895023.Beyond_the_Core|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=Beyond the Core: Expand Your Market Without Abandoning Your Roots by Chris Zook|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''Beyond the Core'' argues that businesses must grow to survive—but only one in five strategies for growth succeeds. In the previous book, ''Profit from the Core'', Zook explains how to grow profitably by concentrating on and harvesting the full potential in the core business. But if the core business fails to provide new growth, managers should stick to an expansion strategy based on various combinations of adjacency moves into areas away from, but related to, the core business, such as new product lines or new channels of distribution. This strategy is less risky than diversification; however, it can still create a substantial competitive advantage because the growth is based on or relates to the pack of skills that the business already does best. Zook bases his research on studying thousands of companies worldwide and interviewing CEOs of 25 top performers that have succeeded growing beyond theie core businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/product/beyond-the-core-expand-your-market-without-abandoning-your-roots/9519-HBK-ENG|publisher=[[hbr.org]]|title=Beyond the Core: Expand Your Market Without Abandoning Your Roots|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{quote|Chris Zook's Beyond the Core is the follow-up to his 2001 Profit from the Core, which argued that the source of many failed growth strategies is wrong-headed diversification away from the company's core business. There he examined three strategies for leveraging the core business: (1) strengthen and defend the core; (2) grow through adjacencies; and (3) redefine your core business for new growth opportunities. The current book focuses on the second strategy and considers questions that arise when the core has been fully exploited and growth-hungry companies must look beyond their cores for success. Zook states that companies that successfully push beyond their core businesses into adjacent areas can find this growth. ... Perhaps the biggest limitation of the book is its lack of attention to the potential for disruptive innovation, competitors' strategy, and changing consumer tastes for negating core and adjacent strategies. The bias is toward internal development rather than growing through external means, such as partnerships and acquisitions. Strategists must integrate both of these growth options in order to pursue advantageous opportunities.}}

A '''Contributor License Agreement''' ('''CLA''') defines the terms under which [[intellectual property]] has been contributed to a company/project, typically [[software]] under an [[open source license]].

== Rationale ==

CLAs can be used to enable vendors to easily pursue legal resolution in the case of copyright disputes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apache.org/licenses/|title=Licenses|author=|date=|website=www.apache.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to relicense products to which contributions have been received from third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/ContributingFAQ|title=Contributing FAQ|author=|date=|website=mysql.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a CLA is to ensure that the guardian of a project's outputs has the necessary ownership or grants of rights over all contributions to allow them to distribute under the chosen license. In some cases this will mean that the contributor will assign the copyright in all contributions to the project owner; in other cases, they will grant an irrevocable licence to allow the project maintainer to use the contribution. CLAs also have roles in raising awareness of [[Intellectual property rights|IPR]] issues within a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cla.xml |title=Contributor Licence Agreements |publisher=Oss-watch.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canonical ===

The Canonical contributor agreement was a Contributor License Agreement required by [[Canonical Ltd]] for all contributions to many projects established by Canonical.

In it, the contributor assigned copyright to Canonical and at the same time Canonical gave the contributor "a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and perpetual right to use, copy, modify, communicate and make available to the public (including without limitation via the Internet) and distribute, in each case in an original or modified form, the Assigned Contributions as (they) wish."&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canonical.com/contributors | accessdate = 2010-12-31 | title = Canonical's contributor agreement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agreement"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.canonical.com/static/files/Canonical_Contributor_Agreement_ver_2.5.pdf|title = Contributor Agreement V2.5 |accessdate = 31 December 2010|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canonical started Project Harmony "...to assist organisations which use contribution agreements by providing standardised variable templates with clear and concise explanations...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://opensource.com/law/10/6/project-harmony-looks-improve-contribution-agreements-0 | title = Project Harmony looks to improve contribution agreements | date = 2010-06-24 | author = Amanda Brock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2011, Canonical is requesting contributions be licensed under a Harmony Contribution Licence Agreement, rather than the copyright being assigned to Canonical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canonical.com/contributors | title = Canonical's contributor agreement | date = 2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Harmony CLA, "the contributor gives Canonical a licence to use their contributions. The contributor continues to own the copyright in the contribution, with full rights to re-use, re-distribute, and continue modifying the contributed code, allowing them to also share that contribution with other projects."&lt;ref name="canonical.com"/&gt;

Projects requiring contributors to sign this agreement include:&lt;ref name="main" /&gt;

* [[XSplash]]
* [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]]

=== KDE ===
[[KDE]] uses [[Free Software Foundation Europe]]'s [[Fiduciary Licence Agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ev.kde.org/announcements/2008-08-22-fsfe-welcomes-fla.php | date = 2008-08-22 | title = FSFE welcomes KDE's adoption of the Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which (FLA-1.2) states in section 3.3:
{{quotation|
FSFE shall only exercise the granted rights and licences in accordance with the principles of Free Software as defined by the Free Software Foundations. FSFE guarantees to use the rights and licences transferred in strict accordance with the regulations imposed by Free Software licences, including, but not limited to, the GNU General Public Licence (GPL) or the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL) respectively. In the event FSFE violates the principles of Free Software, all granted rights and licences shall automatically return to the Beneficiary and the licences granted hereunder shall be terminated and expire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fsfe.org/projects/ftf/FLA.en.pdf | accessdate = 2010-12-31 | title = Fiduciary Licence Agreement (Version 1.2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is optional and every contributor is allowed not to assign their copyright to KDE e.V.

'''Dioceldo Sy''' (born March 6, 1958&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/03/02/14/will-blackwater-be-11th-team-pba&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Filipino businessman, sportsman, and team owner of [[Blackwater Elite]] in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. He is the sole proprietor of Ever Bilena Cosmetics, Inc. which he established in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;http://everbilena.com.ph/index.php/publicsite/about_us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Sy started out as a messenger and clerk for his grandfather's pomade business. Through his grandfather, who was a Chinese immigrant, he learned about trading and dealing with people.

He studied, and at the same time played basketball, at UNO High School during his secondary years and at [[Philippine School of Business Administration|PSBA]] for his college education.  After two years in college, he dropped out to work full-time for his grandfather. However, when his grandfather's business went bankrupt in 1980, he found himself in the streets and with no job. During this time, he became a freelance trader, buying and selling anything.

In 1983, with his savings from buying and selling, he put up his own cosmetic company, which is now known as Ever Bilena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nepomuceno|first1=Rod|title=To Sy is to believe|url=http://www.philstar.com/business-life/373255/sy-believe|publisher=Philippine Star|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a single-line company selling nail polish, Ever Bilena has grown into a major player in the cosmetics industry with over 1,000 products in the market. He has branched out into commercial ventures in food, health drinks, fragrances, soap and detergents.

==Sports and charity work==

}}'''Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik''' is a German company  providing tire and car services. Since 1994, the company has been part of the Italian tire manufacturer [[Pirelli]] and is a 100% subsidiary of ''Deutsche Pirelli Reifen Holding GmbH''. The company has more than 80 stores in Germany operating under several brand names including ''Pneumobil, Driver,'' and ''Reifen-Wagner''. It employs approximately 500 people and had revenues of approx. €100 million in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Echo Zeitungen GmbH|Title=Pneumobil kauft zu|language=German|URL=http://www.echo-online.de/wirtschaft/wirtschaft-suedhessen/pneumobil-kauft-zu_17976272.htm|AccessDate=2017-09-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company’s service offering includes tires, rims, high-quality car services and car accessories for almost all types of vehicles. The company is headquartered in Breuberg in the Odenwald region, on the factory premises of Pirelli Deutschland GmbH.

== History ==
The company was established in 1979 and acquired by the Pirelli Group in 1994. After taking over, among others, the branches of Reifen Laupichler in the metropolitan area of Hamburg and Hanover the company, then named Pneumobil GmbH, acquired the tire retailers Junginger of Metzingen and Reifen Herl of [[Nürtingen]] with a total of 15 stores on 1 November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Reifenpresse|Title=Jetzt auch offiziell: Herl und Junginger zu Pneumobil|Date=2003-10-31|language=German|URL=http://reifenpresse.de/2003/10/31/jetzt-auch-offiziell-herl-und-junginger-zu-pneumobil/|AccessDate=2017-09-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective 1 January 2012, Christian F. Mühlhäuser took the helm of Pneumobil succeeding Hans-Ulrich Röske who had gone into early retirement after working more than 40 years for Pirelli Deutschland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Vogel Business Media GmbH &amp; Co. KG|Title=Pneumobil hat neuen Geschäftsführer|language=German|URL=http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/pneumobil-hat-neuen-geschaeftsfuehrer-a-346887/|AccessDate=2017-09-27

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mühlhäuser joined Pirelli as a working student in 1993. Later, after studying engineering and obtaining an MBA degree at US universities, he assumed management functions in the areas of logistics and planning, quality and technology, and in Pirelli‘s headquarters in Milan. In 2009, he took the helm of the Pirelli motorcycle tire factory in Breuberg. 
[[File:Pneumobil_Niederlassung_Stuttgart-Weilimdorf.jpg|thumb|Pneumobil branch Stuttgart-Weilimdorf]]
Pneumobil went on to acquire more companies such as Reifen Blank of [[Düren]] on 1 August 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Reifenpresse|Title=Pneumobil weiter auf Einkaufstour|Date=2013-08-06|language=German|URL=http://reifenpresse.de/2013/08/06/pneumobil-weiter-auf-einkaufstour/|AccessDate=2017-09-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PneuCenter RRT GmbH of [[Sindelfingen]] on 1 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=klautke|Periodical=Gummibereifung|Title=Pneumobil übernimmt PneuCenter in Sindelfingen|Date=2013-08-27|language=German|URL=http://gummibereifung.de/nachrichten/pneumobil-uebernimmt-pneucenter|AccessDate=2017-09-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Pneumobil obtained possession of Reifen-Wagner R.W. Auto-Technik, a [[Landshut]]-based company offering specialized tire retail and car services. The 100 employees of Reifen-Wagner were kept on the payroll and the service network with a total of ten workshops exclusively based in the state of Bavaria was also taken over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pneumobil kauft Reifen Wagner - autohaus.de|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.autohaus.de/nachrichten/reifenhandel-kfz-service-pneumobil-kauft-reifen-wagner-1279454.html|deadurl=|accessdate=2017-09-27|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Vogel Business Media GmbH &amp; Co.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2013, Pneumobil opened its first ''Driver Center'' in [[Frankfurt]]. A combination of show room, design lounge, consultation room, sales and service area, these flagship stores are designed to turn “purchasing tires and car services into an experience.”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Reifenpresse|Title=In Frankfurt errichtet Pirelli ein „Driver Center“|Date=2013-08-02|language=German|URL=http://reifenpresse.de/2013/08/02/in-frankfurt-errichtet-pirelli-ein-driver-center/|AccessDate=2017-09-27

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The layout of the store’s workshop area is inspired by the [[Pit stop|pit lanes]] in motor sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Top Magazin Frankfurt|Title=Driver Center Frankfurt - Revolution Reifen &amp; Service|Date=2013-12-12|language=German|URL=http://www.top-magazin-frankfurt.de/redaktion/business-finance/driver-center-frankfurt-revolution-reifen-service/|AccessDate=2017-09-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective 1 October 2013, Pneumobil acquired Reifen-Wagner I.S. Auto-Service GmbH &amp; Co. KG, also based in Landshut, with its 15 stores and 140 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=klautke|Periodical=Gummibereifung|Title=Pneumobil übernimmt nun auch Reifen-Wagner I.S.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; September 2014 saw the opening of more Driver Centers in [[Bonn]], [[Aachen]], and [[Trier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Reifenpresse|Title=Netzwerk der „Driver Center“ um drei Standorte erweitert|Date=2014-09-11|language=German|URL=http://www.reifenpresse.de/2014/09/11/netzwerk-der-driver-center-um-drei-standorte-erweitert/|AccessDate=2017-09-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2017, Pneumobil GmbH changed its name to Pneumobil Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH by registering the new name in trade register B of the local court of [[Darmstadt]]. Shortly afterwards, on 1 July 2017, the Cologne-based tire retailer Reifen Schäfer e.K. was taken over by Pneumobil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Reifenpresse|Title=Reifen Schäfer aus Köln geht an Pneumobil|Date=2017-06-19|language=German|URL=http://www.reifenpresse.de/2017/06/19/reifen-schaefer-aus-koeln-geht-an-pneumobil/|AccessDate=2017-09-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Reifen-Wagner_Ingolstadt.jpg|thumb|Pneumobil branch Ingolstadt]]
After a redesign of six Pneumobil stores in the area of Frankfurt and two Reifen-Wagner stores in Munich, there are 21 Driver Centers (as of October 2017) which are all 100% property of Pneumobil Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH. In addition, there are other Driver Centers in the network of Pneumobil’s sister company ''Driver Handelssysteme GmbH'' which is also a subsidiary of ''Deutsche Pirelli Reifen Holding GmbH''. 

At the end of September 2017, the former Reifen Wagner branch in Hanauerstr. 42, Munich was reopened as the Driver Center Munich. The first European P-Zero World of the Pirelli Group was also formed within this Driver Center. Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH have also been operating it since it opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik|date=2018-10-17|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Driver_Reifen_und_KFZ-Technik&amp;oldid=181891627|work=Wikipedia|language=de|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik|date=2018-10-17|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Driver_Reifen_und_KFZ-Technik&amp;oldid=181891627|work=Wikipedia|language=de|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 29 December 2017, ''Pneumobil Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH'' changed it name to ''Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH'' with legal effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik|date=2018-10-17|url=https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Driver_Reifen_und_KFZ-Technik&amp;oldid=181891627|work=Wikipedia|language=de|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian F.

'''Ennio Doris''' (born 3 July 1940), is an Italian [[billionaire]] businessman, the founder of Mediolanum SpA, and chairman of [[Banca Mediolanum]], part of [[Gruppo Mediolanum]], a large Italian banking, funds management and insurance group.&lt;ref name="Ibpus.comUSA2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=Italy Country Study Guide: Strategic Information and Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XAs34Terl8C&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=5 October 2014|year=2012|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9781438774664|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
He was born in Tombolo, a small village near [[Padova]], Italy on 3 July 1940.{{fact|date=September 2018}} 

==Career==
Doris entered the retail asset management field in 1969 when he became a salesman for Fideuram.  In 1971 he joined Dival, where he rose to be the head of a 700-person sales force.  In 1982 he started his own company "Programma Italia" and convinced [[Silvio Berlusconi]] to invest 250,000 Euro in return for a half share of the company.  His strategy was to focus on retail client relationships, while subcontracting the management of invested funds to other firms.  Under his charismatic leadership his network of salesmen grew rapidly as did the funds under management.  He added insurance and banking and renamed the firm Mediolanum.  In June 1996 the company was floated on the Italian stock market.  Berlusconi described it as the best investment he had ever made.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

'''Nils Wilhelm Erik Penser''' (born August 22, 1942) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[financier]] and [[businessman]].

Penser was born in [[Eslöv]], Sweden, the son Wilhelm Penser, a lawyer, and Elisabeth (née Herrmann).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Uddling |editor1-first=Hans |editor2-last=Paabo |editor2-first=Katrin |date=1994 |title=Vem är det: svensk biografisk handbok. 1995 |trans-title=Who is it: Swedish biographical handbook. 1995 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Norstedt |isbn=91-1-943202-X |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|8261514}} |url=http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1995/0882.html |page=882}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having studied law at [[Lund University]], Erik Penser commenced a career as a [[stockbroker]] at ''Bankirfirman Langenskiöld'', which later became [[Carnegie Investment Bank]]. Together with Thomas Fischer he worked intensively to develop the firm’s business, laying the foundation for his private wealth. Penser's strategy was risky; he bought shares, used them as collateral and borrowed even more money to leverage his holdings. Eventually he gained the controlling interest of several large companies on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]].

During the 1980s Penser was one of Sweden's most influential businessmen. Through his holding company, [[Yggdrasil]], he controlled both [[Nobel Industrier]] and [[Finans AB Gamlestaden]]. His massive [[leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] and the harsh business environment experienced during the [[Swedish banking rescue|Swedish banking crisis in 1990-1994]] forced Penser to cease control of his holdings, which were sold to Nordbanken (which became [[Nordea]]) for the symbolic sum of SEK 1 each. At a press conference [[Björn Wahlström]], the chairman of Nordbanken, said that Erik Penser was 'destitute and finished as a businessman'. The transaction resulted in a prolonged legal dispute between Penser and Nordbanken.

In 1992 Penser regained control of Yggdrasil, the consideration was once again SEK 1. The vice Chairman of Nordbanken, [[Jacob Palmstierna]], admitted that Penser had been under extreme pressure when he was forced to sign the agreement with Nordbanken. Since then Penser has rebuilt an estimated net worth of SEK 1 billion, with interests in both Sweden and abroad. In Sweden, his main holdings includes [[Erik Penser Bankaktiebolag]], with activities in corporate finance, trading, research and private wealth management and [[Pensum]], an insurance and pension advisory firm. Erik Penser resides, since 1976, in [[Compton Beauchamp]], England.

Erik Penser is known as a distinguished [[collecting|collector]], collecting - amongst many objects - old share certificates, film posters, magazines and bank notes.

'''Francis George Burton''' (1840 – 19 September 1915)&lt;ref name="IAJ 1915"&gt;''Incorporated Accountants' Journal.'' Vol. 26. 1915. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; was a British engineer, incorporated accountant and general manager of the Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in [[Pembroke Dock]], Wales, known for his early works in the [[management accounting]].&lt;ref name="HD 1910"&gt;[[Hugo Diemer]] (1910) ''[https://archive.org/stream/factoryorganizat00diemrich#page/296/mode/1up Factory organization and administration]''. p. 296-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Boyns, Trevor]]. "[http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/p/2005/wustl/0503006.pdf Illuminating the darkness: the impact of the First World War on cost calculation practices in British firms]." ''L'entreprise, le chiffre et le droit.'' Bordeaux: Universite Montesquieu (2005): 111–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Burton was born in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancashire]], in the first half of 1840&lt;ref name="birth"&gt;''England &amp; Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-1915''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''1881 Wales Census''&lt;/ref&gt; and baptised 12 June 1840.&lt;ref&gt;''Lancashire, England, Church of England Births and Baptisms, 1813-1911''&lt;/ref&gt; He was secretary and general manager of the Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co.. This iron shipbuilding company, located in [[Pembroke Dock]], Wales, was founded by Naval architect [[Edward James Reed]] in 1874. The company was noted for building the [[Japanese ironclad Hiei]], which was launched June 1877. On the ship yard several merchant ships were built, and also the HMS ''Acorn'', a Mariner-class composite [[screw sloop]] launched in 1884. While the Royal dockyards revived, the Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. declined,&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Davies. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=urs7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR80 Britannia's Dragon: A Naval History of Wales].'' 2013. p. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; and was resolved in 1890. Burton started working as incorporated accountant settled in Manchester&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28663/page/1 The London Gazette],'' 15 November 1912. p. 4802-3, mentioned Burton as liquidator of a company.&lt;/ref&gt; with he founded the accountancy firm Burton &amp; Disley.&lt;ref name="IAJ 1915"/&gt;

Late 19th century Burton came into prominence as author of several books on cost accounting. His ''Commercial Management of Engineering Works'' (1899) and works such as [[Emile Garcke|Garcke]] and [[John Manger Fells|Fells]]' ''Factory accounts, their principles and practice'' (1887/89), and [[J. Slater Lewis]]' ''Commercial Organization of Factories'' (1896) are considered the seminal works, which helped establish the new discipline of [[cost accounting]] in Britain.&lt;ref name="KL 1972"&gt;[[Allen Kent]], Harold Lancour (1972). ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 7.'' p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KL 1972"/&gt;

== Work ==
=== ''The Commercial Management of Engineering Works,'' (1899) ===
[[File:The Commercial Management of Engineering Works, 1899.jpg|thumb|''The Commercial Management of Engineering Works,'' 1899]]
In the preface of ''The Commercial Management of Engineering Works,'' Burton stated that "this work is intended primarily for young engineers. Its object is to present to these young men the problems that are likely to confront them, when commercial duties are thrust upon them, and to offer suggestions that may be of assistance. The work does not claim to represent the results of any scientific research in any special field of factory organization or administration."&lt;ref name="HD 1910B"&gt;[[Hugo Diemer]] (1910) ''[https://archive.org/stream/factoryorganizat00diemrich#page/290/mode/1up Factory organization and administration]''. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton foresaw a special role for the professional accountant in the process of [[bookkeeping]] and formation of [[cost accounting|cost accounts]]:
:''The best method of financial bookkeeping, one that admits of perfect balancing, should always be adopted ; but this does not debar such variations as will fit it for the business to which it relates, or the special requirements of the proprietor or manager. There is no insuperable difficulty in making these variations if the staff be properly trained. The great difference between the professional accountant and his clerks, and ordinary commercial bookkeepers is that the former are trained to think, whereas the latter are taught, and often only permitted, to slavishly follow example. Yet alike in methods of bookkeeping, in formation of cost accounts, in details of office arrangements, in management of men, and in distribution of profits, there must be such variations as will fit those methods to the peculiar circumstances of the individual firm.  There must, on the one hand, be no want of system, no imperfect recording of accounts or statistics ; and on the other there must be no sacrifice of the substance to the shadow : no abandonment of necessary particulars to the fanciful exigency of interlocking them with a balance-sheet.''&lt;ref name="Burton (1899, p. iv)" &gt;Burton (1899, p. iv)&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton summarised that he had "sought to indicate the manner in which the clerical staff may be made to render valuable services to their employers, without encroaching upon the work of the technical officers, or assuming duties and authority for which they are not qualified."&lt;ref name="Burton (1899, p. iv)"/&gt;

=== Brains of the firm ===
A 1899 review of the book in ''[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]]'' magazine commented, that "Mr. Burton's knowledge on certain branches of the commercial management of engineering works is undoubtedly considerable ; and when he deals with book-keeping, auditing, and general office system, its remarks are to the point, and of some value. He tries, however, to do too much; and he deals with many phases of engineering business with which he is apparently but slightly conversant."&lt;ref name="TE 1899"&gt;[http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/1/19/Er18990317.pdf Review of ''The Commercial Management of Engineering Works''] in ''The Engineer,'' 17 March 1899. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1899 review gave one example of the its inconsistency:  
:''A strange argument adopted in a book professedly dealing with an engineering subject is that to be an engineer is not at all necessary to the satisfactory conducting of an engineering business. According to Mr. Burton, "the directors and secretary, the auditor, and the general manager form the brains of the firm." It is not necessary, however, that a single one of the above should be an engineer in the proper sense of the word; and while brains are undoubtedly a useful commodity in persons holding these positions, we fail to see why the officials just named should be accredited with a larger amount of brain power than, let us say, the works manager, or the chief of the drawing-office; nor can we see bow it would be possible to carry on satisfactorily engineering works under brainless shop management, and from designs emanating from brainless draughtsmen.''&lt;ref name="TE 1899"/&gt;

The more interesting parts of this work, according to the review, are the chapters on: 'The Directors and Secretary,' 'The Auditor,' 'The Purchases and Inspection of Machinery,' 'Receipt of Materials and Passing of Invoices,' 'Cost Accounts,' 'The Preparation of Estimates,' 'Drawing office Orders for Work,' 'Alternative Plans for Registering and Filing Drawings,' 'Wages Accounts,' 'Cost Accounts,' 'Profit and Loss,' and 'Stocktaking.'&lt;ref name="TE 1899"/&gt;

The review eventually concluded that "Mr. Burton has, in short, worked out very carefully in his book a system of his own for what he considers to be the best means of conducting an engineering business; and as far as the purely clerical side of the question is concerned, he has done it well enough."&lt;ref name="TE 1899"/&gt;

=== Scientific management ===
Burton's work is noted as "perhaps the first detailed account of the Taylor system in Britain. Among other things, Burton discussed functional foremanship, scientific rate-fixing and the differential piece-rate system."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Cunningham Wood]], Michael C. Wood eds. (2002). ''F. W. Taylor: Critical Evaluations in Business and Management.'' p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Edward Francis Leopold Brech|Brech]] (2003) summarised the raise of British approaches to management and the role of Burton:
:''In the two decades prior to World War I, a number of British writers and consultants had begun to address the problems of management in the modern world. Although they were aware of similar developments in America, where [[scientific management]] was becoming the latest business fashion, these writers sought to develop distinctly British approaches to management. Writers such as the engineers [[Joseph Slater Lewis]], [[A.J. Liversedge]] and F.G. Burton, the consultants Edward Elbourne and J.W. Stannard, and the accountant Lawrence Dicksee laid stress on the need for a methodical approach to business management, the need to be inclusive and to motivate workers to see the company's goals as their own, and above all the need for more and better training for would-be managers... [Their work shows] the directions in which British management thinking might have gone had not World War I and the subsequent "Americanization" of British industry intervened. Today, they remain an important example of an alternative way of thinking about and practising management, and demonstrate the plurality and diversity of management thought.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward F.L. Brech]] (2003) ''British Management Writings Before the First World War.''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12187">'''Grievance Redressal''' is a management- and governance-related process used commonly in [[India]].  While the term "Grievance Redressal" primarily covers the receipt and processing of complaints from citizens and consumers, a wider definition includes actions taken on any issue raised by them to avail services more effectively.

The traditional approach to Grievance Redressal, which is handled through letters and complaint forms, has very little appeal and its usage rarely reflects the actual state of [[customer satisfaction]] or lack thereof.  However, new Internet-based approaches used by the government and more by private organizations, such as [[Public grievance redressal (pgportal)- India]], [[TripAdvisor]], and ActPlease.com.

==Overview==
Grievance Redressal mechanism is mandated in Government agencies and departments that are directly involved with serving citizens and organizations.  Usually a [[Chief communications officer|Public Relations Officer (PRO)]] is designated with the role of receiving complaints and initiating corrective action, but this mechanism often fails on account of lack of authority vested in the PRO over officers of various capacities.  The Government of India has made effort to systematize the nature of grievance redressal through legislation,&lt;ref name="Citizens Charter Bill 2011"&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/newsite/efeatures.aspx?relid=79138 "The Right of Citizens for Time Bound Delivery of Goods and Services and Redressal of their Grievances Bill, 2011"] - pplPress Information Bureau, Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; being driven by civil society agitations under leadership of [[Anna Hazare]] and [[Arvind Kejriwal]] for enactment of the [[Jan Lokpal Bill]] into law.&lt;ref name="Jan Lokpal"&gt;[http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/janlokpal Jan Lokpal Bill] - as proposed by Aam Aadmi Party&lt;/ref&gt;  

Private businesses and [[Nonprofit organization|Non-Profits]] engaged in service delivery, such as hotels, restaurants, colleges, etc. often tend to set up their own mechanisms, such as [[Feedback]] forms and '''Contact Us''' pages.  Such means to get direct feedback enable businesses to take corrective action in time.  Governments also often accept the responsibility of [[Consumer protection]] from private organizations through '''Legislation'''&lt;ref name="Consumer Protection Act of 1986"&gt;[http://www.ncdrc.nic.in/1_1.html Consumer Protection Act, 1986] - Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; as well as setting up Consumer Courts and Organizations for Dispute Resolution.&lt;ref name="NCDRC"&gt;[http://ncdrc.nic.in/ National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission] - Government of India&lt;/ref&gt;  Such consumer courts pursue quick action for redress, while maintaining affordability and ease to the consumer.

==Coverage==
Grievance Redressal typically covers the following types of complaints:
* Service Unavailability
* Non-Delivery against Commitment
* Excessive Delays
* Injustice concerns (such as over race, caste, sex)
* Staff Misbehaviour
* Malpractice

Wider definition of grievance redressal covers:
* Malfunctions under Warranty coverage
* Product Support issues
* Citizen Vigilance reports
* Employee Disputes

==Process==
[[File:Grievance Redressal Workflow.png|frame|Workflow for Grievance Redressal as handled by sites such as ActPlease.com]]
Organizations define their own process flows for grievance redressal.  These are rarely made known to the public in case of private businesses; governments and non-profits usually share voluntarily or by mandate the hierarchy of officers responsible for taking corrective action.  Some organizations maintain a custom-developed ticketing software, while others count on [[Software as a service|SaaS]] [[Web portal|Portals]] such as ActPlease.com.  Feedback Portals such as TripAdvisor and [[Yelp]] are driven by consumers, and organizations / businesses have the option to join and participate.  Depending on the desire to correct as well as level of transparency of the organization, grievance redressal flow can include the following steps:

===Input acceptance===
Customers convey their grievance to the organization through feedback forms, letters, registered communications, emails, etc.  These inputs may be submitted by mail, over the Internet, or in person.

====Anonymity====
Customers are often reluctant to report grievances that target individual executives of the organization, especially those who may influence their future interactions or have the potential to take vengeance.  Under such conditions, the organization needs to assure the customer that her identity will be hidden from executives, and preferably from everyone.  This, however, opens the potential problem of deceitful negative inputs purposefully targeted against specific executives, as the people reporting are kept anonymous.

====Spam Prevention====
Feedback forms on website are prone to spam submissions.  There are cases when employees themselves submit feedback - positive for their professional gain, and negative if targeting colleagues.  Some service centers make employees sign blank feedback forms to create positive statistics.  Such situations can be prevented by seeking verification of identity of customers.  This is especially possible on online setups, such as ActPlease.com, which uses [[Short Message Service|SMS]] to verify the authenticity of the mobile number of reporter.  Basic tools such as [[Captcha]] can prevent automatic spammers.  Mass submission of false feedback becomes less likely and easy to detect in case of paper-based submission.

===Acknowledgement &amp; Status Tracking===
Customers tend to develop much greater confidence in the grievance and feedback mechanism if they are given a formal acknowledgement.  The acknowledgement could be by SMS and Email, as used by ActPlease.com, or skimply by publicly posting their message on the appropriate forum, such as [[TripAdvisor]].  [[Issue tracking system|Ticketing Systems]] such as osTicket and Fresh Desk, as well as SaaS systems such as ActPlease respond with acknowledgements with unique tracking numbers.  These may be used by customers to check status of action taken on their complaint.

===Forwarding===
Paper-based feedback as well as standard feedback forms on websites usually forward inputs to a single officer or email address.  This naturally causes scope for delay or failure to reach the right persons.  However, smarter ticketing systems sort grievances based on their classification, and then redirect each to their relevant executive(s) instantly.

====Escalation====
Smart Grievance Portals such as ActPlease expect organizations to configure typical action time for each type of complaint, as well as set up the hierarchy for escalation.  When an executive fails to take corrective action in time, the matter is promoted to the officer next in line in seniority.

===Action===
Computerized and web-based systems have an advantage over paper-based systems as they can alert the reporter immediately upon completion of action, as marked by the executive in charge.

====Verification====
Customer may certify, if applicable and asked, whether the corrective action taken on their grievance satisfies them or is not substantial enough.  Should it not be, the complaint may be marked as pending again, or be forwarded to a more senior officer in escalated form.

==Measurements==
The effectiveness of implementation of a grievance redressal mechanism can be calculated with the following parameters:
* Count of cases received
* Nature of cases received
* Acceptance of anonymous feedback
* Ratio of false inputs
* Time taken for corrective action
* Escalations required
* Confirmations &amp; rejections after completion
* Repeat nature of grievances

==Challenges==
Traditional Grievance Redressal mechanisms tend to fail, or are very ineffective, on account of some of these causes:
* '''Unavailability''' or '''Difficulty to access''' means to report grievances, at times done so purposefully, or due to lack of priority
* '''Lack of authority''' of PRO over relevant departments and executives in Government organizations
* '''Disconnect''' of senior decision-maker executives with end customers
* '''Non-motivation''' of front-end managers to forward negative feedback to higher-ups
* '''Fear''' of citizens / consumers to report malpractice about officers with substantial authority
* '''Inability''' of smaller private organizations to set up computerized mechanisms
* '''Inaccuracy''' and '''spamming''' of feedback forms, driving false impressions
* '''Delayed feedback acceptance''', as feedback is taken after service has been provided, while corrective action may be taken typically during the delivery of service

==Grievance Redressal Options available to Organizations==

===Paper-based Feedback Forms===
These are most popular and usually used by consumer service businesses, such as hotels and restaurants.  They are less likely to be effective, as there is reduced assurance of their reaching the decision-making authorities.  These also usually do not give any formal confirmation or tracking number to the complainant.  Possibility of fake submissions also remains.  Customers therefore have less confidence on such forms.  Confidence can be strengthened if a central call center sends an acknowledgement of receipt of such feedback.  Another possible reinforcement may be done by taking digitized input, which can be processed using scantron machines.

===Contact Us Links===
Websites of organizations generally carry the '''Contact Us''' page, which lists the email and phone numbers to use to submit any concerns.  Many websites also provide a form to fill that automatically gets sent by email, with confirmation to the reporter.

===Customer-driven Feedback Websites===
Websites such as Yelp and TripAdvisor allow customers to post grievances and recommendations about organizations from personal experience.  Designated representatives of these organizations have the option to respond to such communications, though these responses are often just standard text.  The feedback also tends to be subjective and unlikely to be auto-sorted and forwarded for action.

===Organization-oriented Portals===
Organizations can subscribe to grievance redressal portals such as ActPlease.com to invite their customers to report their grievances and request action.  As such portals are configured by the organizations themselves, they can ensure that complaints are directed properly.  ActPlease, being a third party site, handles anonymity of the reporter from the organization when necessary, while ensuring the genuine nature of the person, through [[SMS]] verification.  Such [[Software as a service|SaaS]] Portals are easy to use and easily affordable for all organizations including SMEs, while empowering them with the latest tools such as [[Mobile Apps]] and Customized Websites.

===Custom-developed Ticketing Systems===
Large organizations involved in customer service set up their own ticketing systems with similar features as the SaaS portals, but with greater customization in the processing of grievances.  Examples of such organizations are [[Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited]] and [[Torrent Power]].  Large-scale ERP software, such as SAP and Genie also provide facility for setting up ticketed grievance redressal and customer support systems.

'''Hamilton Central''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Hamilton, New Zealand]]. It is located on the western banks of the [[Waikato River]].
&lt;!-- ==History== --&gt;
==Features of Hamilton Central==
[[Image:VictoriaBridgeHamilton2.jpg|thumb|Victoria Bridge across the [[Waikato River]].]]

===Victoria Street===
''Victoria Street'', named after [[Queen Victoria]], is the main street of Hamilton running adjacent to the Waikato River. It stretches from [[Victoria Bridge, Hamilton|Victoria Bridge]] to beyond the [[Fairfield Bridge]], but the commercial section ends before [[Whitiora Bridge]]. 33 of the city's 105 heritage sites are located on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145832767|title=Hamilton's heritage sites|work=Hamilton City Council|accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lonely Planet]] guide states that Hamilton's "main street has sprouted a sophisticated and vibrant stretch of bars and eateries that on the weekend at least leave Auckland's [[Viaduct Harbour]] for dead in the boozy fun stakes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/new-zealand/waikato-and-the-king-country/hamilton|title=Hamilton Travel Information and Travel Guide|work=Lonely Planet|accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garden Place===
Further along Victoria Street is the pedestrian mall Garden Place. It was carved, after much debate, out of a hill in the late 1930s. The cutting was made through the ridge to allow the formation of Angelsea Street. Later the ridge on the river side of Angelsea Street was bulldozed away, thereby flattening the area for the development of Garden Place and the central CBD around the Hamilton City Council buildings.

The area was initially used as a car park, which was very popular with retailers and shoppers. In 1967, the car park was closed and Garden Place was laid out with grass and trees. A ring road encircled the beautified area, but it was removed in August 1974. The name ''Garden Place'' actually refers to the former road, not the grass park area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamiltonlibraries.co.nz/page/pageid/2145865652/Garden_Place_history |title=Garden Place history |work=Hamilton City Libraries |accessdate=29 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120903233105/http://www.hamiltonlibraries.co.nz/page/pageid/2145865652/Garden_Place_history |archivedate=3 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:StPetersHamilton.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Cathedral, Hamilton, New Zealand|St Peter's Cathedral]].]]

===St Peter's Cathedral===
{{main|St. Peter's Cathedral, Hamilton, New Zealand}}
Modelled on a 15th-century [[Norfolk]] church, [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Hamilton, New Zealand|St Peter's Cathedral]] was constructed with ferro-concrete by Warren and Blechynden of Hamilton. The present St Peter's was completed in 1916 . It is the fourth [[Anglican]] church on the site and it serves as the cathedral church for the Bishop and [[Diocese of Waikato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stpeterscathedral.nzl.org/history.php|title=History of St Peter's Cathedral|work=St Peter's Cathedral|accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church was built on the hill site of the western redoubt built by  Australian  troops to defend Hamilton from attacks by Kingite Maori during the 1863-4 war.

[[Image:HoodStHamilton.jpg|thumb|Hood Street — Left: Former Bank of New Zealand Building, Right: Former Post Office Building.]]

===ArtsPost / Hamilton Post Office Building===
Hamilton’s ''Post and Telegraph Office'' was built in 1901. The building was designed by architect John Campbell, in an [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian Baroque]] style. The building was extended by half in 1916 to meet the demand for more facilities, and remained the central post office until 1940 when its replacement opposite Garden Place opened.  For the next 40 years, the building was used for Social Welfare purposes.  Various other tenants include the Maori Land Court, local Members of Parliament and a Youth Resource Centre. Hamilton City Council purchased the building in 1992 and restored the building as much as possible to original condition. The renovated building was opened as ''ArtsPost'' on 27 June 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waikatomuseum.co.nz/page/pageid/2145845800/About_ArtsPost|title=About ArtsPost|work=Waikato Museum|accessdate=25 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104205437/http://www.waikatomuseum.co.nz/page/pageid/2145845800/About_ArtsPost|archivedate=4 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bank of New Zealand Building===
The former ''Bank of New Zealand'' building was the largest building of its kind in Hamilton when it was constructed in 1875. The two-storeyed building was designed by Edward Mahoney. A single storey was added to the rear extension in 1908 and a single storey extension was added between the original building and the neighbouring premises in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145832745|title=Former Bank of New Zealand Building|work=Hamilton City Council|accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bank of New Zealand left the building in 1986 and it was vacant until it was refurbished in 1994 as The Bank Bar and Brasserie. Its restoration signaled the beginning of a multimillion-dollar redevelopment at the south end of Victoria St.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebank.co.nz/index.asp?pageID=2145874159|title=History of The Bank|work=The Bank|accessdate=25 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524045155/http://thebank.co.nz/index.asp?pageID=2145874159|archivedate=24 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wesley Chambers===
''Wesley Chambers'' was the first multistoreyed building in Hamilton made of reinforced concrete and the first to have a lift. The building was designed in the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]] style by Frederick Daniell. Wesley Chambers feature [[Louis Sullivan|Sullivanesque]]-style windows with central panes flanked by narrower panes, and the unusual wrought iron balconies on two sides of the building.

For most of its history, Wesley Chambers' upper floors were tenanted by some of the city's most prominent professional people including opticians, solicitors, accountants and dentists. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the building was vacant and but in 1993, it was transformed into a boutique hotel, the Le Grand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145832754|title=Wesley Chambers|work=Hamilton City Council|accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamilton Courthouse===
The ''Hamilton Courthouse'', a concrete building on a hill above Anglesea Street, was built in 1931. It had two courtrooms - the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Court. In 1974, arsonists set fire to the building. The Magistrates Court was destroyed and the Supreme Court badly damaged. In 1993, a new court complex was built next to the old building. The old courthouse was unoccupied for a decade but in 2004, a refurbishment project was approved to restore the building as a working courthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamilton.co.nz/page/pageid/2145832750|title=Hamilton Courthouse|work=Hamilton City Council|accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public art and statues==
[[File:Same-sex marriage rally in Hamilton, New Zealand.JPG|thumb|right|Riff Raff Statue dressed up at a [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|same-sex marriage rally]]]]

===Riff Raff Statue===
The Riff Raff Statue commemorates [[Rocky Horror Picture Show]] creator [[Richard O'Brien]], who lived in Hamilton. [[Weta Workshop]] was commissioned to create a statue of [[Riff Raff (hunchback)|Riff Raff]] - one of the show's iconic characters played by O'Brien. The statue was unveiled on Victoria Street on 26 November 2004. The statue has a website and webcam at [http://www.riffraffstatue.org www.riffraffstatue.org].

===Te Tiaho o Matariki===
Located in Garden Place, Te Tiaho o Matariki was created by Neil Miller. The sculpture represents [[Pleiades]] in the form of a growing vine, with the stars of Matariki forming the fruit on the vine. It honours the city’s first inhabitants (Garden Place was first used by Maori as a garden and observatory); and celebrates the horticultural heritage of the name of the city’s civic plaza: Garden Place. The curving vine-like form of the sculpture also references the nearby Waikato River which snakes through the city.

===Ripples===
The Ripples sculpture was commissioned in 1987 for the opening of the Waikato Museum. It is a suspended sculpture, consisting of a six-metre span of carbon fibre reinforced polyester resin, which represents the ripple effects of a falling stone hitting the water. It hangs between the canopy of trees, approximately 20 metres in the air, above the Waikato Museum riverbank. It was created by [[Christchurch]] artist [[Neil Dawson]].

===Millennium "Koru Family" Sculpture===
Located on the bank of the Waikato River, the Koru Family sculpture was given to Hamilton City by the Year 2000 Millennium Committee to commemorate the family in 2000.  The sculpture was created by Carla Van de Veen of [[Te Aroha]], made of [[Hinuera]] Stone.

===The Farming Family===
''The Farming Family'' was donated to the city by businessman Sir Robert Jones in 1990 to commemorate the ordinary farming family as being the unsung heroes of Hamilton's 150-year history. The statue, a bronze life-sized sculpture created by Margriet Windhausen van den Berg, has sparked much debate about whether it solely celebrates the European history of the Waikato region. The Farming Family consists of a male farmer and his wife, two young children, a dairy cow, a sheep and a dog. The statue is located on a traffic island at the intersection of Victoria Street and Ulster Street.

Tan has served as a board of director at Ren Ci Hospital Limited since November 2010. He is a holder and inventor of numerous patents worldwide.

==Early life==
Tan, the third son in a family of six boys, was born in a kampung in [[Geylang]] Lorong 17 to a pest-control worker father and housewife mother. Tan's family was poor and his parents spent most of their time earning a living. Tan went on to study at the Aljunied Technical High School, the first person in his family to enter secondary school. However, he came under the influence of bad company, and began skipping school. He completed his "O" Levels, but his life only began to take a turn when he entered the National Service, where he straightened out his life.&lt;ref&gt;Au Yong, J. (2006, January 8). The drive to succeed. The Straits Times. Retrieved on February 25, 2011, from NewspaperSG&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After completing his National Service, Tan joined a German multinational firm as a machinist. Tan then joined Sanshin Electronics, an agent for NEC Semiconductors, as a marketing executive from 1980 to 1983. He later joined Shin-Nichi, a member of the [[SANYO]] group of companies, in 1984. In Shin-Nichi, Tan worked his way up to become the director of operations where he oversaw the company's operations in Southeast Asia. In 1995, Tan resigned from the company.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, M. P. (2006, March 8). From caning and joking to trekking. The New Paper. Retrieved January 20, 2009, from Factiva database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishing Trek 2000==
In 1995, Tan bought over Trek, a small family-owned electronic parts trading business in Geylang, for S$1 million. He restructured the company and changed its business focus to providing technology-driven engineering solutions to businesses. In 1998, the company was appointed the design house for [[Toshiba]].&lt;ref&gt;Trek 2000 (2002-2008). Trek. Retrieved January 20, 2009, from http://www.trek2000.com.sg&lt;/ref&gt;

With his engineers, Tan began to explore ways to create a data storage device that utilises the USB interface. Their solution was the ThumbDrive, a plug-and-play memory drive that required no cable or adapters, and that could store more data than a floppy disk. In 2000, Tan presented the ThumbDrive at the CeBIT international technology fair in Germany. In the same year, Tan took his company public on the [[Singapore Exchange]], hence the name Trek 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Long, S. (2001, September 21). Firm hand puts him right on Trek. The Straits Times.

An '''international business company''' or '''international business corporation''' ('''IBC''') is an [[offshore company]] formed under the laws of some [[jurisdiction]]s as a tax neutral company which is usually limited in terms of the activities it may conduct in, but not necessarily from, the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated.  While not taxable in the country of incorporation, an IBC or its owners, if resident in a country having "controlled foreign corporation" rules for instance can be taxable in other jurisdictions.   

==Features==
Characteristics of an IBC vary by jurisdiction, but will usually include:
[[File:Chart of an offshore company structure.jpg|thumb|Chart of an offshore company structure]]
* exemption from local corporate taxation and stamp duty, provided that the company engages in no local business (annual agent's fees and company registration taxes are still payable, which are normally a few hundred U.S. dollars per year) 
* preservation of confidentiality of the beneficial owner of the company 
* wide corporate powers to engage in different businesses and activities
* abrogation or restriction of the requirement to demonstrate [[corporate benefit]]
* the ability to issue [[stock|shares]] in either [[Registered instrument|registered]] or [[Bearer instrument|bearer]] form (although many countries have restricted or eliminated bearer shares now)
* an abrogation of any requirements to appoint local directors or officers
* provision for a local [[registered agent]] or registered office

It must be noted that all of the above characteristics are also attributable to many "onshore" countries which have either a residency or territorial based tax system where setting up a company, LLC or LLP in the jurisdiction along with the use of "nominees" will offer all of the above characteristics.  US LLCs, UK LLPs and Hong Kong companies are all examples which are widely used in similar capacity to IBCs and which meet all of the characteristics above. 

However, under pressure from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF), most offshore jurisdictions have removed or are removing the "ring fencing" of IBCs from local taxation.  In most of the jurisdictions, this has been accompanied by reductions of levels of corporate tax to zero to avoid damaging the offshore finance industry.  

In contrast, Seychelles residents are legally able to own and operate a Seychelles IBC as long as the IBC is not conducting business within Seychelles.  Seychelles also has a "territorial" tax system meaning that Seychelles residents are only taxed on their locally sourced income.  Therefore, there is no advantage to non-residents over residents and claims of "ring fencing" have no merit on the Seychelles IBC.  This has been, and continues to be, used successfully by Seychelles in defense of the Seychelles IBC vs. international bodies such as the OECD and FATF.  Boosting the defense even more is that there are no restrictions on a Seychelles IBC owning shares of a Seychelles domestic company.

Further, most jurisdictions have either eliminated or highly restricted the issuing of bearer shares by IBCs due to international pressures.

==The IBC legal entry==
An IBC is a legal entity incorporated under specific legislation which is free from all local taxes (except small fixed annual fees). Typically the IBC is limited in the activities it may conduct in, but not necessarily from, the country of incorporation. [[Anguilla]], [[Bahamas]], [[Belize]], [[Dominica]], [[Nevis]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St Vincent]] and [[Seychelles]] have special IBC legislation in place.  The [[British Virgin Islands]] and [[Gibraltar]] formerly had popular IBC regimes, but in each case the relevant legislation has been repealed.&lt;ref&gt;For BVI, see [[BVI Business Companies Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical IBC Uses==

IBCs are offshore companies that are most commonly used for [[offshore bank]]ing to conduct international trade, investment activities, as a [[special purpose entity]], by professionals and for asset protection. Offshore companies can be involved in buying and selling goods and services, hold bank accounts and operate businesses. IBCs are also commonly used for the ownership of real property and land; for ownership of intellectual property, licensing and franchising; personal service by individuals working overseas and offshore e-business among other things.

The term [[Offshore company]] seems more commonly used than International Business Company (IBC).  Although all IBCs are necessarily offshore companies, not all offshore companies are IBCs.  Both terms refer broadly to a similar type of corporate structure.  The term 'offshore' is used to refer to a company, or bank account, set up outside the jurisdiction of residence or place of doing business.

John A. Gauci-Maistre was born in Sliema in 1947, the son of the late Judge Agostino Gauci-Maistre and Winnifred Mifsud. He attended the St. Aloysius College in Malta and after completing his studies he swiftly moved into a business career in the U.K. During his employment in London with Southwell &amp; Tyrrel he became acquainted with managerial and accounting aspects of business.  After a few years in the U.K. he moved back to Malta and immediately became a business partner in the management of Penta Hotel in Paceville. This experience further ingrained in him an entrepreneurial spirit that he soon used in the setting up of companies that are not only household names in Malta in their respective industry but are synonymous with Gauci-Maistre.

Gauci-Maistre is a frequent contributor to various publications such as  Lloyd's and Fairplay and recently he has also taken on blogging in particular the [http://maltabusinessblog.com/ Malta Business Blog].

==Economicard Group of Companies==

The Economicard Group of Companies is an umbrella of companies that Gauci-Maistre established. The group of companies consists of GM International Services Limited, Economicard Worldwide Limited, GM Corporate and Fiduciary Services Limited, GM Conferences and Exhibitions, GM and Associates - Advocates, and GM For You, which is the group's Corporate Social Responsibility agency.

== Economicard Worldwide Limited ==

Upon gaining independence in 1964, Malta by and large had to start anew and from then onwards it had to build an economy based on human resources including manufacturing, tourism and services. This evolution of the Maltese economy began during the following decade where the Maltese economy had to become less dependent on the British military services in Malta.

Gauci-Maistre immediately realised the growing spending potential of the Maltese people and 1973 he launched an innovative venture in Malta that would be a trendsetter in the Maltese economy. This innovative move resulted in the establishment of [http://www.gmint.com Economicard Worldwide Limited].  Initially the company introduced the Cash Discount Card through which shoppers would receive discounts across shopping outlets around the island by purchasing the card.  After its initial success, other services were added to the card including travel services which was becoming increasingly popular amongst Maltese especially after the establishment in 1973 of [http://www.airmalta.com Air Malta], the national airline.  The company was at the forefront of travel services and as testimony to its success the company was appointed the General Sales Agent of Olympic Airways in 1981 till 2009 when it was sold off by the Greek Government.

=== Commodore ===
In 1978 Gauci-Maistre obtained representation for Commodore and immediately embarked on promoting this home computer in Malta. In 1985 he introduced Amiga to Malta; the Amiga consequently became a household name in Malta. The company was the general sales agent of these computers on the island. The company also offered computer courses to the general public to acquaint them with this new medium.

== GM International Services Limited ==

In 1973 the Parliament of Malta enacted the [http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8734&amp;l=1 Merchant Shipping Act] that introduced the Malta Ship Register.  In January 1974, he incorporated [http://www.gmint.com GM International Services Limited], more affectionately known as GMI by many in the shipping industry.  This move was intended to capitalise on the introduction of the Malta Ship Register.  Indeed, Gauci-Maistre believed in the benefits Malta had to offer and immediately started working to attract ship operators to Malta. The hardworking nature of his character proved useful and in 1978 he registered his first vessel the MV Elmare.  Gauci-Maistre was described as the one who put Malta on the world shipping map by Shipping International 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Shipping International 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During one of the numerous interviews with shipping news publishers he admitted that the road to making a success out of GMI was not easy as the Greek ship operators in particular were sceptical of the advantages Malta offered at the time.

Gauci-Maistre never wavered and continued his hard work to attract more companies to Malta, making Greece his second home in the process.  Results started flowing in and until 1987 GM International Services Limited commanded 95% of Malta’s tonnage.  Due to the acquired respect both in Malta and abroad, Gauci-Maistre is often consulted on matters relating to the maritime industry and he was instrumental in bringing about policy changes at [http://www.dca.gov.mt/Home.aspx Transport Malta] (formerly Malta Maritime Authority) in particular in relation to the merchant shipping company structure, Flag State Inspections and the introduction of foreign owned vessels under the Malta Maritime Flag. During another interview with Shipping International 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Shipping International 2010&lt;/ref&gt; he explained in detail the issue of flag state inspections.  Whereas previously [http://www.dca.gov.mt/Home.aspx Transport Malta] was being intransigent and these inspections were being carried out where and when they deemed fit, nowadays these inspections are carried out in ports where vessels will have enough time for inspections without hindering schedules.  Despite the ever increasing competition, GM International Services Limited strengthened its leading position in the industry due to its efficiency and quality of services.

[http://www.gmint.com GM International Services Limited] has come to be known as the flagship company of the group and has truly established itself as a company of international repute. Undoubtedly John A. Gauci-Maistre became renowned as the person who put Malta on the shipping map and the surname Gauci-Maistre became associated with Malta’s Maritime flag.  True to motto GMI’s, Gauci-Maistre strives to serve the world from Malta!

== GM Corporate and Fiduciary Services ==

John A. Gauci-Maistre did not limit his entrepreneurial spirit to maritime affairs. Due to his nature in being innovative and always at the forefront, he looked at ways at how he could create synergies between shipping and financial services.  1988 was the year that the financial services industry in Malta became fully regulated and GM Nominee was immediately incorporated in order to bridge the gap between these two sectors.

GM Nominee was managed with the same enthusiasm and drive as its affiliates and similar success was achieved.  However, due to subsequent changes in legislation brought about by the phasing out of the offshore regime rebranding was necessary and this gave rise to [http://www.gmint.com GM Corporate and Fiduciary Services Limited] in 1998. with the aim of promoting the benefits of the relatively new corporate structures known at the time as International Trading Companies. With Malta’s accession to the European Union in 2004 certain amendments had to be made to Maltese legislation concerning corporate and fiscal policy and this resulted in, among other things, of the corporate structures changing to Malta Holding Companies and Malta (trading) Companies.

As the Malta Government’s drive to make Malta a financial services hub continued, new laws had to be enacted to cater for different financial services industries such as those of Remote Gaming, Trusts, Fund Management and Taxation.  These all became sectors in which [http://www.gmint.com GM Corporate &amp; Fiduciary Services Limited] became active and helps promote overseas.  The growth of the company is testament to the emphasise John Gauci-Maistre places on the design and administration of tax-efficient structures under local legislation that suit the requirements of the individual international client in a timely and cost-efficient manner.

== GM International Conferences &amp; Exhibitions Limited ==

This company was established in order to further synergise Malta’s economic pillars into a reputable group of companies.  The most notable event of GM International Conferences &amp; Exhibitions Limited to date is [http://www.streetpianos.com/malta2011/ ‘Play Me I’m Yours’], the brainchild of Luke Jerram.  [http://www.streetpianos.com/malta2011/ ‘Play Me, I’m Yours’] Malta was the first ever to be hosted on a national level and was live throughout September and October 2011. This event was part of group of company’s Corporate Social Responsibility programme, GM For You, that Gauci-Maistre personally supervised.  Despite, being the initiative of his son and Director Dr Jean-Pie Gauci-Maistre, John A. Gauci-Maistre played an active role in this event as he is ultimately committed to supporting the local community through various initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;The Times of Malta September 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honorary Consul General of Panama ==

John A. Gauci-Maistre was appointed the Honorary Consul General of Panama in 1994 with jurisdiction over the Maltese territory.  Immediately after his appointment as Honorary Consul, John A. Gauci-Maistre personally set up the Honorary Consular Corps and was elected Dean in 1995. He served in this capacity till 2011 when he decided to step down in order to focus on philanthropic activities.  Despite, being the Honorary Consul of one of Malta’s main competitors in shipping, he thinks that through Malta he can serve both registers depending on the needs of ship owners.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd’s List April 17th 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other posts ==

John A. Gauci-Maistre served on the boards of the [http://www.maltachamber.org.mt/ Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry] formerly known as the Malta Chamber of Commerce and the Malta Trade Fairs Corporation. John A. Gauci-Maistre K.M. served also as President of the Maltese – Italian Chamber of Commerce and President of the Casino Maltese between 2009 and 2011.

== Sovereign Military Order of St. John Hospitallier ==

In 2000 John A. Gauci-Maistre was also knighted by the Sovereign Military Order of St. John.

== Personal life ==

John A. Gauci-Maistre is married to Ann Marie née Pace and they have four children Rebecca, Sarah, Jean-Pie and Greta and five grandchildren Emma, Jean, Julia, Amy and Mya.

'''Julius Madritsch''' (4 August 1906 – 11 June 1984) was a [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[businessman]] who helped to save the lives of [[Jews]] during the [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]].

== Biography ==
In the spring of 1940 Madritsch came to [[Kraków]] to avoid enlistment in the German [[Wehrmacht]]. Being a trained [[draper]], he was appointed trustee of two Jewish confectionery stores, Hogo and Strassberg. Madritsch soon learned that he could make more money by manufacturing textiles. At the end of 1940 Madritsch was able to open a sewing factory in Kraków that employed about 800 Jews and Poles with 300 sewing machines.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to [[Oskar Schindler]], Madritsch gained a reputation as a good man who treated his Jewish workers well; he was "wonderful to his Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kraków, Madritsch saved the lives of thousands of Jews and also sought to make their lives more bearable.  He employed many workers with no professional experience or training.  Together with his factory manager [[Raimund Titsch]], he provided humane and comfortable working conditions. Every worker received enough bread each day to enable him to sell part of it and buy other foodstuffs.  Jews were allowed to make contact with Poles outside the factory. The factory kitchens fed more than a thousand Jewish workers with food unobtainable elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, pp. 219-20&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Madritsch even set up new workshops including at [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp|Płaszów concentration camp]] (in 1943 after the [[Kraków Ghetto]] was liquidated and closed),&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bochnia]] Ghetto (in 1942)&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tarnów]] Ghetto (in 1942; like Kraków it employed about 800 workers with 300 sewing machines)&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; to help as many Jews as possible. He claimed that he did this due to the "constant begging of the [[Krakow Ghetto Jewish Council (Judenrat)|Jewish council]] [in Kraków]".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the [[Kraków Ghetto]] was liquidated in March 1943, Madritsch worked with [[Oswald Bosko]] to allow many families, particularly those with children, into his nearby factory; thus saving more Jews from death. He arranged to have the children placed in homes of Poles in the city. Several weeks later he obtained permission from the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] to transfer some of these Jews to his factories at Bochnia and Tarnów.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 1943, only twelve days after the liquidation of the Kraków Ghetto, Madritsch and Titsch transferred as many Jews as they could by train to Bochnia and Tarnów.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Madritsch had to intervene constantly with the SS, the police and the Labor Office to obtain work permits for his Jews. For instance, the Labor Office insisted that he hire Poles instead of Jews. [[General Government]] labor officials charged that Madritsch was "a saboteur of the Jewish transfer [into the ghetto] and could encounter difficulties with the [[Gestapo]]".  This apparently did not deter Madritsch, who hired an increasing number of Jews, claiming that they were "important to the war effort".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point Madritsch was arrested but soon released due to his close connections with certain SS officers.

At the end of August 1944 Płaszów commandant [[Amon Göth]] liquidated the [[Tarnów]] ghetto, the largest one remaining in [[West Galicia]].  Madritsch was assured that nothing would happen to "his people". Madritsch's Jews were sent to a slave labor camp in [[Silesia]], attached to a synthetic oil factory. They were put to work building new workshops for the SS.  Madritsch undertook this construction job so that his workers would be kept alive. Further, some of his workers were smuggled out of the ghetto in trucks and made their way to Hungary and Slovakia.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, pp. 221-22&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 1943, Madritsch was authorized to move his factories to Płaszów. He employed two thousand Jews as workers and provided them with food, clothing and shoes.  Madritsch had to pay the SS for the food and other supplies. When [[Amon Göth|Göth]] learned that nearly a quarter of Madritsch's workers were over the maximum age for slave laborers, he tried to reduce the workforce accordingly. However, Madritsch successfully insisted that the older workers "were the most valuable ones".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1944 the [[Red Army]] was approaching Kraków, and Płaszów was being liquidated. The Jews were to be deported to [[Extermination camp|death camps]] like to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]]. Madritsch had no factories further west, and therefore could no longer protect his Jewish workers. However, he and [[Oskar Schindler]] had become friends.  Schindler was about to open a [[Brünnlitz labor camp|munitions factory]] in [[Brněnec]], [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czech Protectorate]] which would employ Jews. When it came time to compile the famous [[Schindlerjuden#List of Schindlerjuden|list]] of ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' in 1944, Schindler agreed to add sixty of Madritsch's Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, pp. 223-24&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, however, their friendship soured because of a dispute over the transfer of some of Madritsch's Jews to Schindler's factory and related matters.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 Madritsch was honoured as "[[Righteous Among the Nations]]" by [[Yad Vashem]]. He was portrayed in the 1993 film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' by [[Hans-Jörg Assmann]].

Julius Madritsch died on 11 June 1984.  He is buried at the [[Zentralfriedhof]] in [[Vienna]].

The '''Lowertown Historic District''' is a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] in the Lowertown neighborhood of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], United States.  This 16-block warehouse and wholesaling district comprises 37 [[contributing properties]] built 1870s–1920. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983 for the significance of its river and rail connections, economic impact, architecture, and urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=Patricia |author2=Susan Granger |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Lowertown Historic District |url=http://nrhp.mnhs.org/nomination/83000935.pdf |publisher=National Park Service |date=1981-11-30 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowertown was originally the lower landing on the [[Mississippi River]]; the first port of access to the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]]. Several warehouse, railroad, banking, and distribution buildings served the entire [[Upper Midwest]] from 1880 to 1920. A significant concentration of these buildings survive, unified by similar architectural styles and construction materials. Many were designed by the city's most prestigious architects, including Cass Gilbert and Clarence Johnston, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowertownlanding.com/lowertown-building-history/|title=Lowertown History |publisher=Lowertown Landing |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Lowertown neighborhood declined after the Depression. The renovation of the Merchant's National Bank Building (now McColl Building) in the late 1960s was the first project to focus attention on revitalization potential. The conversion of the Noyes Brothers and Cutler Building into a complex of offices, shops, and restaurants (now known as Park Square Court) soon followed. The city's Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) became involved in 1973 when Mears Park was redesigned by William Sanders and renamed after Norman B. Mears, a Saint Paul businessman.

In April, 1978 the Lowertown Redevelopment Corporation (LRC) was organized with the goal of creating “a place for people, a highly livable urban village in the midst of the city, which will bring new jobs, housing, commercial development, and year round activities to Lowertown and infuse the city with renewed vitality.”&lt;ref&gt;http://lowertownsaintpaul.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/full-lowertown-master-plan2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Enabled by an unprecedented $10 million grant by the McKnight Foundation, the LRC assumed the role and responsibility of driving the revitalization of Lowertown. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, artists moved to Lowertown, attracted by low rents, raw space and relative quiet. This new population began to bring life to the buildings and the streets of Lowertown. Initiated by the LRC and supported fully by the City of St. Paul, Lowertown was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983;&lt;ref&gt;http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&amp;recordid=54&lt;/ref&gt; the next year, the City of St. Paul designated the Lowertown Historic District as a Heritage Preservation Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stpaul.gov/index.aspx?NID=4338&amp;ART=7988&amp;ADMIN=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127025950/http://www.stpaul.gov/index.aspx?NID=4338&amp;ART=7988&amp;ADMIN=1 |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redevelopment==
Aided by these designations and the associated tax credits, Artspace, the LRC, the City and others partnered to renovate three buildings dedicated to the arts. The Lowertown Artists Lofts Cooperative, the Tilsner and the Northern Warehouse were renovated and became the anchors for the arts community.{{when|date=May 2017}} Throughout the years, there has been a steady commitment to incrementally reinvest in the assets of Lowertown. Instead of demolishing and building new, Lowertown remained committed to a slow, deliberate and steady approach to redevelopment. This approach allowed Lowertown to remain a relatively quiet neighborhood on the edge of downtown. Such an approach was particularly supportive of the artist community, as it respected the financial and environmental needs of working artists. In 1982, the St. Paul Farmers’ Market moved to Lowertown. An institution since the late 1800s, the Farmers’ Market was an anomaly of sorts for Lowertown - it was a destination in the middle of a relatively quiet neighborhood. The market now draws 20,000 people each weekend in the summer. In 2006 the LRC transformed into the Lowertown Future Fund to continue supporting Lowertown redevelopment.

New residences have been built in the neighborhood, attracting new residents paying market rate for condominiums. Restaurants, festivals, weddings and other regional attractions, such as the restored Union Depot, have opened in Lowertown.

In 2015, the [[St. Paul Saints]] professional baseball team opened its season in the new [[CHS Field]]. The stadium stands in the space of the former Gilette/Diamond Products plant at 5th Street and Broadway. Designs for the stadium were presented to the public in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twincities.com/stpaul/ci_24662098/st-paul-saints-ballpark-designs-unveiled&lt;/ref&gt; Art installations from local artists adorn the exterior of the ballpark. Despite its name, the CHS Field sits outside the official 18 blocks that make up the Lowertown Heritage Preservation District, roughly bound by Kellogg Boulevard, Broadway, 7th Street and Jackson Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stpaul.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/20504 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811204331/http://www.stpaul.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/20504 |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mears Park==

[[File:Mears Park, Lowertown St Paul Clock 433125593 o.jpg|thumb|Mears Park, Lowertown St Paul Clock]]
Previously known as Smith Park, Park Square, and Baptist Hill, Mears Park is bounded by 5th, 6th, Sibley and Wacouta streets. The site was originally the home of the First Baptist congregation, who built their church on top of a hill in the middle of a city block. In 1849 the land was donated to the city by a man named Robert Smith after the church expanded to a new location a few blocks north. The hill was leveled and the square was formally created in 1888.&lt;ref name="millet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millet|first1=Larry|title=AIA Guide to Downtown St. Paul|date=2010|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of the next century, the park was a traditional city square with a central fountain and sidewalks radiating about it. In the early 1970s, the park became known as the “Brickyard” after a renovation covered much of the square in bricks. After his death in 1974, the park was officially renamed after Norman Mears, a St. Paul inventor in the printing and etching field; his inventions were used to fight World War II and make color televisions. After retirement, Mears had set his sights on the revitalization of Lowertown.&lt;ref name="millet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norman B. Mears|url=http://www.minnesotainventors.org/inductees/norman-b-mears.html|website=Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day Mears Park was opened in 1992 following a major reconstruction designed by landscape architect Don Ganje and artist Brad Goldberg. The new design received rave reviews for brilliantly mixing natural and manmade elements, from the rocky stream to the metal bandshell, and has proven popular year after year. Today the park sits in the middle of a re-energized Lowertown, hosting handfuls of fairs and festivals throughout the season including [http://musicinmears.com/ Music in Mears] the [[Twin Cities Jazz Festival]] and [[Concrete and Grass Music Festival]]. Volunteers known as the Friends of Mears Park maintain the gardens.&lt;ref name="millet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowertownlanding.com/lowertown-historic-places-mears-park|title=Mears Park |publisher=Lowertown Landing |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crane Ordway Building==
Crane and Ordway manufactured valves, fittings, and supplies for steam engines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saintpaulhistorical.com/items/show/217 “Crane Building,” City of Saint Paul and the Saint Paul Heritage Preservation Commission, Saint Paul Historical, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers and Ordway was the successor company to Wilson &amp; Rogers, the oldest firm in the line of plumbing and steam fittings in the Northwest. At one time, The Crane Company was the largest manufacturer of valves, fittings, and steam supplies in the world, employing over 3,000 men at the factory in Chicago factory. In 1892 Crane bought out the Rugg-Fuller Company in Minneapolis.

On January 1, 1893 [[Richard T. Crane|Richard Teller Crane]] of Chicago, Illinois and [[Lucius Pond Ordway]] of St. Paul, Minnesota incorporated the '''Crane &amp; Ordway Company'''. It consolidated the firms of Rogers and Ordway of St. Paul and Duluth with a branch of the Crane Co. in Minneapolis,&lt;ref name=valve&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gD7OAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=crane+ordway+building+st+paul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1TmIFbJHed&amp;sig=UjAyjFgRK2u4Sx_1Rb7rZpCO1BI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCTgeahUKEwj8gJWEyYvGAhXBjpIKHV8sAIk#v=onepage&amp;q=crane%20ordway%20building%20st%20paul&amp;f=false ''The Valve World'', (Justin W. McEachren), Crane Company, 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; uniting all the large interests in this line of business in the Northwest. Lucius Ordway, became vice president and general manager of Crane &amp; Ordway. Ordway came to St. Paul from Providence, E. I., in 1883 and worked for Wilson &amp; Kogers until 1886, when he became a member of the firm of Rogers &amp; Ordway,

The company dealt in a general line of pipe, fittings, boilers, pumps, pumping machinery, and plumbers' and steam-fitters' supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMEcAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP6&amp;lpg=PP6&amp;dq=crane+ordway+building+st+paul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4ns4SSWC5q&amp;sig=htMMbGEb2eivF1UL_jZmKGg1Q6U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjgoahUKEwiU-YyR0ovGAhWCQpIKHQY_AKA#v=onepage&amp;q=crane%20ordway%20building%20st%20paul&amp;f=false ''Western Magazine'', January, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt; It did an extensive business in well-drilling machinery, windmills, and large irrigating plant outfits of all descriptions, furnishing estimates and designs and complete plans for water works. Crane later became part of [[American Standard Brands|American Standard]]. Mr. Ordway went on to help build the [[3M]] company.

The building, completed in 1904, was designed by [[Reed and Stem]], the architectural firm that designed [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York and the St. Paul Hotel in downtown St. Paul. It had been vacant for 30 years prior to Aeon, a non-profit developer of affordable housing, restoring it in 2006. The historic warehouse now offers 70 units of affordable rental apartments.

'''Navroji Rastomji Mistri''' (3 June 1885 – 29 October 1953) was an Indian entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is best known for his [[soft drink|soda drinks]] business in Singapore.

While working in Singapore, Navroji met [[Phirozshaw Framroz]], a well-known soft drinks producer through the small [[Parsis]] community in Singapore.&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; He started helping out at Framroz's soft-drinks factory by fixing machinery.&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; Upon completion of the graving dock in 1913, Framroz employed Navroji as a manager in his factory.&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; In 1925, Navroji left the company to set up his own soft drinks factory.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; He named his company "Phoenix Aerated Water" as "the phoenix is a big bird rising from the dead and he liked the sound of that".&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; His new business venture negatively affected his relations with Framroz, as Navroji had previously signed an agreement to not start a similar business when he left Framroz's company.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; The dispute was brought before the courts, who eventually ruled in Navroji's favour.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; The pair's relations were not restored until shortly before Navroji's death.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt;

Navroji's soft drinks business grew quickly.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; He was able to convince the British armed forces to permit him to sell his drinks in both Malaya and India.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; As a result, his drinks were sold across Malaya and the South-east Asian region.&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; In 1931,&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; he also opened G. H. Café, which offered the popular curry [[tiffin]] meals together with Phoenix Aerated Water's drinks.&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt;

==Philanthropy==
While being treated at the [[Singapore General Hospital]], Navroji asked his doctor and close friend Professor Gordon Ransome about why sick children had to sleep along the corridors of the hospital.&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; In reply, Professor Ransome jokingly asked that since he was rich, why don't he contribute money to build a [[paediatric]] ward?&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; Having heard this, he presented a [[Singapore dollar|SGD$]]950,000 check to the hospital for the construction of a third-class hospital ward for non-paying patients, saying that "I cannot bear to think of sick children, and their mothers lying on the floors of hospital wards...because of the shortage of space and funds".&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; Using these funds, the government built a $1,500,000 block that housed two 150-bed paediatric wards that were equipped with the latest medical equipment of the day.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; However, Navroji died before the hospital wing was completed in 1955.&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; Thus, the wing, named "Mistri Wing", was opened by his brother Hormusji Mistri.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt;

Prior to this donation, Navroji had already donated SGD$50,000 to the [[University of Malaya]] to provide funds for the purchasing of equipment used in medical research and studies.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt;

In his will, Navroji bequeathed half of his estate, worth SGD$1&amp;nbsp;million, to set up the Mistri Singapore Trust and the Mistri Bombay Trust.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; The beneficiaries of the Mistri Singapore Trust includes poor children, schoolchildren who faced financial difficulties and [[tuberculosis]] sufferers.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; The remainder of his estate was left to his family members, friends and former employees.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt;

==Recognition==
For his role in sheltering homeless people during the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]], the British King awarded Navroji the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; The award was given under the name "Noel R. Mistri".&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; In 1955, the British colonial government named a road "Mistri Road" in his honour.&lt;ref name="infopedia" /&gt; This road, located near [[Shenton Way]],&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt; is one of several roads in the area that were named after a [[Parsis]].&lt;ref name="Toponymics" /&gt; This was because the area used to be a burial ground for the Parsis people in Singapore.&lt;ref name="Toponymics"&gt;*Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2003), ''Toponymics – A Study of Singapore Street Names'', Eastern Universities Press. p. 258. {{ISBN|981-210-205-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistri Wing, the paediatric ward which was built with Navroji's donations, was also named in his honour.&lt;ref name="heritageplaces" /&gt; The hospital wing still exists today at the [[Singapore General Hospital]], though it now houses Singapore's [[National Heart Centre]].&lt;ref name="heritageplaces"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meng Hao |first= Wan |date= 15 April 2011 |title= Heritage Places of Singapore |url= https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=3taIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166 |location= Singapore |publisher= [[Marshall Cavendish|Marshall Cavendish International Asia]]|page=166 |isbn=978-98-1431-295-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will soon be converted into a centre for [[diabetic]] care.&lt;ref name="st20151001" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3448">'''Pablo Carlos Reimers Morales''' (b. July 13, 1946 - d. January 29, 2014) was an entrepreneur from the state of [[Zacatecas]], Mexico. 

He was born July 13, 1946 and raised in Zacatecas until 1961, when he left the state to attend high school at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] in Monterrey in 1961. He continued at the school for university, graduating in 1970 with a degree in business administration, with the aim of returning to his home state to be an entrepreneur. He chose to study at the Tec because of its educational model and the respect held in Zacatecas for the industry in Monterrey. One of his aims in high school was to meet the Tec founder [[Eugenio Garza Sada]] which he was able to do.&lt;ref name=trascender&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.itesm.edu/wps/wcm/connect/snc/portal+informativo/por+tema/educacion/70anostecdemonterrey113_24jul13 |title= Pablo Reimers: trascender a través del compromiso social es su prioridad |date=July 24, 2013 |publisher=Tec de Monterrey |accessdate=July 27, 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fallece&gt; {{cite web |title=Fallece Pablo Reimers |publisher=Zacatecas en Imagen |location=Zacatecas |date=January 29, 2014 |url=http://www.imagenzac.com.mx/nota/fallece-npablo-reimers-n-23-30-06-zl |accessdate=February 3, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In the very early 1980s, Guillermo Jones Pereda, Juan De Santiago Ortega and Reimers founded Cerámica Santo Niño, today known as Cesantoni. The business began by making ceramic tiles but has since branched out into other ceramic products. The traditional means of making tile in Mexico requires two firings, but he decided to work to find a way to create the product in one firing, succeeding by the end of the 1980s. In 1998, the company worked to automate the process as much as possible, which included replacing many of the existing facilities. Much of the work is now done by robots. The plant works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is an important source of employment in the state, not only in the plants but also through its demand for raw materials from mines in the state of Zacatecas.&lt;ref name=elmundo&gt; {{cite news |url= http://ntrzacatecas.com/2009/04/19/el-mundo-cesantoni/|title= El mundo Cesantoni |date=April 19, 2009 |publisher=NTR Noticias |location=Zacatecas |accessdate=July 27, 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

He has been quoted as saying that making more money is not the purpose of life, but rather go beyond what already exists. In 1985, Reimers was approached by his alma mater to organize and find resources to found a campus of Tec de Monterrey in Zacatecas. A short time later, he became an advisor to the new institution. Today, he is also the president of the Consejo de Enseñanza e Investigación Superior in Zacatecas.&lt;ref name=trascender/&gt;

Reimers was married to Gabriela Campos de Reimers and has three sons, Pablo Yaco Reimers Campos, Bernardo Reimers Campos and Hermann Reimers Campos, who work in the company.&lt;ref name=formalizan&gt; {{cite news |url= http://www.elporvenir.com.mx/notas.asp?nota_id=434705|title= Formalizan su amor Adriana y Bernardo   |date=October 3, 2010 |publisher=El Porvenir |location=Mexico City |accessdate=July 27, 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elmundo/&gt;

Mr. Reimers died in Zacatecas on January 29th 2014.&lt;ref name=fallece/&gt;

'''Paulo Salim Maluf''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈpawlu saˈlĩ maˈlufi}}; born September 3, 1931) is a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] politician with a career spanning over four decades and many functions, including those of State Governor of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Mayor of the [[São Paulo|City of São Paulo]], [[National Congress of Brazil|Congressman]] and [[President of Brazil|Presidential candidate]]. As of 2011, Maluf is on a second consecutive term as [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Federal Deputy]]. His political base is founded on [[populism]] and the provision of major [[public work]]s.

His career has been plagued with substantial allegations of [[political corruption|corruption]], although he was only convicted by Brazilian Courts in 2017. He spent a few months in jail and is now under house arrest due to his poor health and advanced age.

He is the president of the local branch, in the [[state of São Paulo]], of the right-wing [[Progressive Party of Brazil]] (PP), heir to the old [[National Renewal Alliance Party]] (ARENA). [[Interpol]] has issued a [[Interpol notice|Red Notice]] to arrest Maluf, extradite him and try him in the United States on charges of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and criminal possession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpol.int/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2009-13608 Interpol Red Notice for Paulo Maluf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/10-brasileiros-procurados-pela-interpol-no-mundo-inteiro The 10 Interpol Most-Wanted Brazilians in the World].  Retrieved May 17, 2013 (in Portuguese).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Paulo Salim [[Maalouf|Maluf]], the son of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Christian immigrants Salim Farah Maluf and Maria Stephan Maluf, was born in [[São Paulo]], and graduated 1954 in engineering at the [[University of São Paulo]] (USP), where coincidentally he was a colleague of the late [[Mário Covas]], another important Brazilian politician who would later become one of his biggest political rivals.

At the time a self-acknowledged playboy with a taste for fast-racing [[sportscar]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the self-congratulatory long interview to Tão Gomes Pinto, ''Ele : Maluf, trajetória da audácia '', São Paulo: Ediouro, 2008, {{ISBN|978-85-00-02401-6}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Maluf entered professional politics thanks to his family's friendship with the then [[Military dictatorship|military president]] [[Artur da Costa e Silva]], with whom he shared a common interest in [[Horse racing]] bets.&lt;ref&gt;John Tofik Karam, ''Another arabesque: Syrian-Lebanese ethnicity in neoliberal Brazil'', Philadelphia: Temple Unioversity Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59213-540-4}}, page 50&lt;/ref&gt; Banking on this friendship, he was to be appointed mayor of [[São Paulo]] in 1969, replacing the very popular [[José Vicente Faria Lima|Faria Lima]]. In a manner very similar to [[New York City|New York]]’s [[Robert Moses]], he suspended the construction of the [[São Paulo Metro]] and built one of the most controversial constructions of Brazil: [[Costa e Silva]] elevated [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]], also known as ''Minhocão'' (“Big [[Earthworm]]” in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). This expressway is seen as responsible for the degradation of a great area of [[Downtown São Paulo|São Paulo’s downtown]] by placing a high-traffic elevated road in the middle of a residential area and is considered as the hallmark of the [[Military dictatorship (Brazil)|military dictatorship]]'s – and Maluf's – authoritarian, road enhancement&lt;ref&gt;Ivani Vassoler, ''Urban Brazil: visions, afflictions, and governance lessons''. Youngstown, Cambria Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-934043-94-3}}, page 140&lt;/ref&gt; and private-car-friendly urban policies in São Paulo – its building being made possible only by the impossibility of a public reaction to it on the surrounding community's side.&lt;ref&gt;Heitor Frúgoli Jr., ''Centralidade em São Paulo: trajetórias, conflitos e negociações na metrópole ''. São Paulo: Edusp, 2000, {{ISBN|85-314-0966-7}}, page 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsuccessful Contender for the Presidency==
[[File:Figueiredo e Maluf.jpg|thumb|Maluf with President [[João Figueiredo]] in the 1980s.]] 
In 1972, following his mayorship, he served as secretary of transport of the state of São Paulo. He would then dispute a convention of the dictatorship's ruling party, [[Aliança Renovadora Nacional|ARENA]] – which was supposed to be a rubber-stamping caucus aimed at choosing as official "candidate" to the state government the former governor Laudo Natel. Maluf, however, succeed in being appointed official candidate&lt;ref&gt;José Nêumanne Pinto, ''A República na Lama''. São Paulo: 1992, pages 37/38&lt;/ref&gt; for the following indirect elections by the State Legislative – something he did by means of abundant personal (and generous) promises to the convention's members&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Skidmore]], ''Brasil: De Castelo a Tancredo''. Portuguese trans. of ''The Politics of Military Rule in Brazil, 1964–1985''. São Paulo: Paz e Terra, 1988, pages 475/476&lt;/ref&gt; – being afterwards elected governor for the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in 1978.

During his ensuing term (1979–1983), Maluf used his position for advertising his prospective candidacy to the Presidency in the forthcoming 1985 indirect elections, by means mostly of schemes such as donation of ambulances to impoverished municipalities in Northeastern Brazil, as well as decorating influential people with the State's chief decoration – having them flown to São Paulo free of charge and lodged in luxury hotels before the official decoration ceremony. He also spent wildly in public works, including in some schemes of doubtful validity, such as in an eventually failed plan to move the state's capital city.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, ''Brazil de Castelo a Tancredo'', 476&lt;/ref&gt; It was because of such schemes that one of the most notable accusations of corruption against him emerged, concerning the [[oil company]] [[Paulipetro]]. This was a state company founded by Maluf during his tenure as governor with the purpose of digging the state for [[Petroleum|oil]] and which consumed around US$500 million whilst drilling 21 holes and finding nothing but a few pockets of [[natural gas]] and water. By then, Maluf had already fostered a reputation "for engaging in corrupt machine politics".&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, ''Brazil de Castelo a Tancredo'', 476; Ted George Goertzel, ''Fernando Henrique Cardoso: reinventing democracy in Brazil ''. Boulder: Lynne Riener, 1999, {{ISBN|1-55587-831-8}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he was elected federal deputy with a then national record 672&amp;nbsp;629 votes and came to stand as the military's preferred presidential candidate for the 1985 presidential elections – the last to be held by means of an Electoral College – where he stood a good chance of winning. His overweening strategy, however, estranged him from most of the party bosses – the civilian caucus which had provided political support to the military dictatorship in the last twenty years. That caused his PDS party (as the current PP was known at the time) to splinter into the [[Democrats (Brazil)|PFL]], a move that made good the mutual alienation between the ruling military scheme and its civilian base,&lt;ref&gt;When the Minister of the Air Force called former PDS bigwig and former governor of [[Bahia]] [[Antônio Carlos Magalhães]], a "traitor", for supporting Tancredo, Magalhães replied in an angry note stating that "a traitor is someone who supports a corrupt": cf. Skidmore, ''Brasil de Castelo a Tancredo'', 485/486&lt;/ref&gt; something which resulted in the election of opposition candidate [[Tancredo Neves]].

==Post-dictatorship career and political resilience==
[[File:Maluf Sessim.jpg|thumb|Maluf and fellow Progressive Party Federal Deputy [[Simão Sessim]] in 2007.]]
Since then, Maluf only managed to get himself elected to the Executive once, in 1992, again as mayor of [[São Paulo]], despite his participation in nearly every gubernatorial and mayoral election for [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]] and [[São Paulo|São Paulo city]], with the exception of 1989 when he was a presidential candidate in the first direct presidential elections since 1960 – in what was a disastrous campaign, remembered in Brazilian political lore only because of Maluf's "antic", said at a speech made to Medical Faculty students in [[Belo Horizonte]]: declaring himself favourable to [[capital punishment]] in cases of rape followed by murder, he said jokingly that "if one has sexual urges, that's okay; rape, but do not kill!" (''estupra mas não mata'').&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Maurício Lara, ''Campanha de rua: a cobertura jornalística de uma eleição presidencial''.São Paulo: Geração Editorial, 1994 pg.61. Available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIeV0kHMGG0C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=maluf+estupra&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xS_pS8PTKZCOuAeHhMSpCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=maluf%20estupra&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Maluf remained a regional political force in São Paulo, the election of [[Celso Pitta]] as [[São Paulo|São Paulo city]] mayor being directly attributed to his endorsement. When he ended his last mayoral term in 1996, he was considered the best mayor São Paulo had ever had up until then, receiving an 80% approval rate. In 2011, a survey by the Datafolha research firm, after asking, again, a sample of São Paulo locals about who would be the best mayor the city had ever had, obtained the result that Maluf stood first with 47% of the sample's preferences.

Such high rates of local approval stand as a reflection of the fact that Maluf was able to forge himself a successful career in post-dictatorship Brazil, despite his perennial reputation for shady deals and for an unsavory personality&lt;ref&gt;Cf., among others, Emir Sader &amp; Ken Silverstein,''Without fear of being happy: Lula, the Workers Party and Brazil ''. London: Verso,1991, page 114; Ignacy Sachs, Jorge Wilheim &amp; Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, eds., ''Brazil: A Century of Change ''.

Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-42422-4}}, page 262, available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=mkfEamELMFAC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=paulo+maluf+unsavory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aDfpS_qzDYuGuAe_nZG2Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=paulo%20maluf%20unsavory&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; This has led various scholars to try to explain his political resilience. To some, this resilience is of an ideological nature: having his career nurtured in a right-wing military dictatorship, Maluf came to stand for a kind of reactionary activism, especially strong among small businesspeople and the self-employed,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Maurício Puls, ''O Malufismo'', São Paulo, Publifolha, 2000, as abridged in Lawrence Boudon &amp; Katherine D. McCann, ''Handbook of Latin American Studies: Social Sciences'',59, Austin: University of Texas Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-292-70535-2}}, page 582&lt;/ref&gt; whose hallmark consisted "in the refusal to admit the social character of social problems", proposing instead a heavy-handed approach to them.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Renato Janine Ribeiro, ''O afeto autoritário: televisão, ética e democracia ''. Cotia: Ateliê Editorial, 2004, {{ISBN|85-7480-230-1}}, page 37. Available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=oUIoW_wfO3kC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=malufismo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LGrQS636EoS8lQeJtPDIDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=malufismo&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the philosopher [[Marilena Chaui]], writing in the mid-1980s, ''malufismo'' stood for the privatization of political power: "a fringe form of the [military] dictatorship as it turned from raw force into mob rule".&lt;ref&gt;Marilena Chaui, "Maluf ou o Novo Corpo do Rei", ''Lua Nova'', October–December 1984, available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=oV5h_Q7EtDkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=malufismo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NP3fS_PAOYKRuAfh7JHjBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=malufismo&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and money laundering indictments==

However, one of the consequences of Pitta's disastrous administration in São Paulo, was that it left the São Paulo municipality mired in debt, as such drawing attention to Maluf's and his former protégé's management practices: in the words of a Brazilian professor at the end of Pitta's term, "Sao Paulo's corruption has been transformed into a public horror from the whispered-about horror it always was". That called eventually for judicial scrutiny of Maluf's policies, especially his public works, his relentless extension of "the city's [São Paulo's] unmitigating concrete sprawl".&lt;ref&gt;Both quotes taken from Simon Romero, "Sao Paulo Creaks Under Debt Crisis", ''The New York Times'', April 15, 2000, [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/15/business/international-business-sao-paulo-creaks-under-debt-crisis.html?fta=y&amp;incamp=archive:article_related]&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example of the allegations of corruption that surfaced  around Maluf was the [[Ayrton Senna]] tunnel, which passes underneath [[Parque Ibirapuera|Ibirapuera Park]] and cost more, per kilometer, than the [[Channel Tunnel]] (it is alleged that the tunnel cost over US$400 million more than it should). Under dispute is Maluf's personal wealth, which critics attribute to his involvement in corruption scandals; supporters, conversely, point to a legitimate origin of such wealth in his family's companies – namely the mamoooth [[plywood]] trust [[Eucatex]].

Maluf was also part of an extensive investigation, by a Parliamentary Inquiry Committee set up in 2003, regarding [[money laundering]] involving bank accounts held by him and his family in [[Jersey]] (one of the [[Channel Islands]]). He has been convicted of corruption multiple times, but only in 2001 was the sentence final, with no possibility of appeal. At the time, he was forced to pay approximately R$500.000 to the state. Many of his alleged crimes cannot be prosecuted, due to the nature of the Brazilian [[statute of limitations]]. Even if he were to be convicted, there would be serious questions about whether he would serve jail time, as he is over 70 years of age.

In early September 2005, Paulo Maluf and his son [[Flávio Maluf]] were temporarily arrested by the Brazilian Federal police, under the charge of intimidating witnesses of an ongoing investigation. They were only incarcerated for a few weeks. So notorious is Maluf's reputation that in Brazil the verb ''malufar'' was created, meaning "to steal public money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The lives of those whom Brazil made rich|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21700363-lives-those-whom-brazil-made-rich-rich-upon-rich|accessdate=10 June 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This verb is also sometimes used outside Brazil, with one example being the French newspaper "Le Monde". [http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0,36-688092,0.html]

In the [[Brazilian general elections, 2006|2006 elections]], Maluf ran for a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Brazilian Chamber of Deputies]], being elected as the candidate for the federal legislature with a national record in terms of ballots cast personally for a candidate to the federal legislature in this particular election (739,837).&lt;ref&gt;The Brazilian proportional voting system for parliamentary elections admits ballots cast for a party as well as for a particular candidate to the legislature. Be it said that, although spectacular, Maluf's 2006 voting was roughly half of the greatest ever number of ballots received for a Brazilian congressional election, this record belonging so far to the 1,5 million votes received, in the preceding 2002 elections, by the late congressman - also for São Paulo - [[Enéas Carneiro]]. In relative terms, however, the greatest ever voting for a congressional candidacy still stands with the 269,000 ballots cast for [[Leonel Brizola]] by the defunct [[Guanabara State]]'s electorate in the 1962 election, which comprised a third of all valid ballots.&lt;/ref&gt; He was reelected again in 2010, with something around 497,000 ballots cast for him.&lt;ref&gt;"Ficha suja, Maluf tem 497 mil votos, mas não sabe se assumirá". UOL newssite, October 4, 2010, available at [http://eleicoes.uol.com.br/2010/sao-paulo/ultimas-noticias/2010/10/04/ficha-suja-maluf-tem-495-mil-votos-mas-nao-sabe-se-assumira-o-cargo.jhtm] Retrieved May 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His 2010 bid for reelection was fraught with legal doubts, as a recent federal statute (Complementary Law 135/2010, commonly known as ''Lei [[Ficha Limpa]]'' or "Clean Record Act") allowed electoral courts to refuse to register the candidacies of people already found guilty by a higher, collegiate court (possibility of further appeals notwithstanding);  however, as the Brazilian [[Supremo Tribunal Federal|STF]] decided in March 2011 that the "Clean Record Act" did not apply to the 2010 elections, according to the principle of anteriority (no offence being punished when defined by a non-previously existing law, and a Brazilian electoral law must be in force at least a year before the election is held),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=175082 Cf. STF newssite]&lt;/ref&gt; all charges against Maluf's registration and subsequent office-taking were eventually dropped. During the 2014 elections, Maluf stood again as a congressional candidate, but his candidacy was this time denied acceptance by a 4-to-3 decision of the [[Superior Electoral Court|TSE]].&lt;ref&gt;TSE site, [http://www.tse.jus.br/noticias-tse/2014/Setembro/tse-mantem-indeferimento-do-registro-de-candidatura-de-paulo-maluf]. Retrieved October 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Pending a recourse to the STF, Maluf was allowed to campaign and to receive ballots cast for him in October 5, 2014, but such votes are legally regarded as null until - and if - his candidacy is declared as lawful. Were this to happen, his 2014 voting would make him the eighth most voted candidate for the Federal Legislature in the State of São Paulo, with 246,446 ballots.&lt;ref&gt;"Barrado Pela Ficha Limpa, Paulo Maluf Tem Mais De 240 Mil Votos".

On March 9, 2007, [[Robert M. Morgenthau]] of the Manhattan's District Attorney's office issued an &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/world/americas/09indict.html?em&amp;ex=1173589200&amp;en=0097af41dc0be82b&amp;ei=5087%0A www.nytimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; indictment against Paulo Maluf for money laundering in relation to a kickback and inflated invoice scheme that allegedly stole $11.6m from a Brazilian road contract project totaling $140 million. From November 1997 to May 1999 the money passed through an account at the [[Safra National Bank of New York]] and was secretly controlled by Maluf. This indictment was maintained by a New York judge on April 25, 2012, who dismissed a petition from the Malufs, Paulo and Flávio, who sought a court order to toss out the indictment.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Freifeld (Reuters), "New York judge refuses to dismiss Brazilian kickback case".''Chicago Tribune'', April 25, 2012, available at [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-maluf-nychargesbre83o1is-20120425,0,6793939.story]. Retrieved April 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Also refused by the same judge was the Malufs' bid for having lifted their March 2010 inclusion in the [[Interpol notice|Red notice]] of [[Interpol]],&lt;ref&gt;Maluf's red notice is available on [http://www.interpol.int/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2009-13608].

As this [[arrest warrant]] is not valid in Brazil because the [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution]] does not allow for the extradition of Brazilian citizens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/mat/2010/03/19/paulo-maluf-entra-para-lista-de-procurados-da-interpol-916123917.asp Inclusion in the Red Notice of Interpol (in Portuguese)]&lt;/ref&gt; its practical meaning is that the Malufs are to be arrested if they travel outside Brazil.

In addition, Maluf and his son Flávio were sentenced to three years in prison (along with a two-year sentence for his wife Sylvia) in France in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramirez|first1=Sughey|title=French Court Sentences Former Brazilian Mayor to Three Years in Prison|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2016/03/1745821-french-court-sentences-former-brazilian-mayor-to-three-years-in-prison.shtml|accessdate=18 March 2016|publisher=Folha de S.Paulo|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2017, after being convicted of corruption by the Supreme Court of Brazil and after a few attempts to challenge that conviction by means of internal appeals within the Supreme Court, Maluf surrendered to Brazilian police, to begin his prison sentence as ordered. On 30 March 2018 he was released from prison under house arrest on humanitarian grounds, due to his advanced age and poor health. He currently remains under house arrest and, as ordered by the Brazilian Supreme Court, in August 2018 the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil officially declared that, as a result of his conviction, Maluf lost his Federal Deputy seat.

'''Qubo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|j|uː|b|oʊ}} {{respell|KEW|boh}}; stylized as '''qubo''') is an [[United States|American]] multi-platform children's entertainment programming service. Qubo consists of a 24-hour [[television network]], alternately known as Qubo Channel (which is available as a [[digital terrestrial television|digital multicast service]] on [[owned-and-operated station]]s and some [[network affiliate|affiliates]] of corporate sister [[Ion Television]], and on some [[multichannel video programming distributor|pay television providers]]), a [[video on demand]] service, and the branding of a weekly [[block programming|programming block]] on [[Ion Television]] under the name "Qubo Kids Corner".

==History==
===Formation===
In May 2006, [[Ion Media Networks]], [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]] (which owned a 32% interest in Ion Media at the time),&lt;ref name="reuters-ionnbcsale"&gt;{{cite news|title=ION Media Networks, Citadel, and NBC Universal Reach Agreement to recapitalize ION -- ION expected to become privately held following transaction |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/04/idUSIN20070504124800ION20070504|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=May 4, 2007|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corus Entertainment]], [[Scholastic Corporation]] and [[DreamWorks Classics|Classic Media]] (which is now owned by the aforementioned NBCUniversal through [[DreamWorks Animation]]) announced plans to launch a new, multi-platform children's entertainment brand known as Qubo, oriented towards providing "educational, values-oriented programming" targeted towards children between 4 and 18 years of age. The brand would encompass programming blocks on NBC Universal and Ion's respective flagship broadcast television networks ([[NBC]], [[Telemundo]] and [[Ion Television]]), a [[video on demand]] service, a website, and a standalone 24-hour network to be carried as a [[digital subchannel]] on television stations owned by Ion Media Networks and by cable and satellite providers.&lt;ref name=mcn-qubo&gt;{{cite web|title=Qubo’s Rodriguez: Offering a 'Building Block’ to Kids|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/qubo-s-rodriguez-offering-building-block-kids/367423|author=Luis Clemens|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=February 16, 2008|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qubo president Rick Rodriquez (who formerly served as a programming executive at [[Discovery Communications]]) explained in a 2008 interview with ''[[Multichannel News]]'' that Qubo was designed as a bilingual brand, offering programming in both [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. While Qubo would initially carry Spanish-language dubs of its programming for its Telemundo block, Rodriquez did not rule out the possibility of developing original children's programming tailored to [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] audiences through Qubo in the future. He felt that the market for Spanish-language children's programming had been underserved by existing outlets (such as Telemundo and [[Univision]]), and envisioned the possibility of programming which could "bridge the gap" and educate Spanish-speaking children on the English language, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=mcn-qubo/&gt;

The Qubo brand was intended to represent a "building block for kids," as reflected by its logo. The name "Qubo" was chosen because it had a "fun" sound, and was usable in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref name=mcn-qubo/&gt;

===Launch===
Qubo launched on September 9, 2006, with the premiere of weekend morning blocks on NBC (which aired exclusively on Saturday mornings, replacing ''[[Discovery Kids on NBC]]'', a weekly block programmed by the [[Discovery Kids]] cable network) and Telemundo (which aired on both Saturday and Sunday mornings). That was followed on September 15 by the introduction of a daytime block on i: Independent Television (now Ion Television), which initially aired on Friday afternoons. At launch, its programming included the first-run animated series ''[[Dragon (TV series)|Dragon]]'' (produced by Scholastic) and ''[[Jane and the Dragon (TV series)|Jane and the Dragon]]'' (produced by Corus subsidiary [[Nelvana]]), along with ''[[VeggieTales]]'' and its spinoffs ''[[3-2-1 Penguins!]]'' and ''[[Larryboy: The Cartoon Adventures]]'' (produced by Classic Media subsidiary [[Big Idea Entertainment|Big Idea]]) – marking the first time that ''VeggieTales'' had ever been broadcast as a television program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qubo, for English- and Spanish-speaking youngsters|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/qubo-for-english-and-spanish-speaking-youngsters/|author=Ed Robertson|periodical=MediaLife Magazine|date=August 24, 2006|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Debuts Kids Programming Brand Qubo|url=http://adage.com/article/media/nbc-debuts-kids-programming-brand-qubo/111473/|author=Andrew Hampp|periodical=[[Advertising Age]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=August 24, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qnbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=QUBO TO LAUNCH ON NBC, TELEMUNDO AND THE I NETWORK THIS SEPTEMBER|url=http://www.ionmedia.tv/press/press.cfm?id=14|website=Ion Media Networks|date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''VeggieTales'' and its spin-offs incorporated lessons related to [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings; initially, this religious content was edited out of the original ''VeggieTales'' broadcasts on Qubo at the request of NBC's [[standards and practices]] department. The move, however, drew criticism from the [[conservatism|conservative]] [[watchdog group]] [[Parents Television Council]], which filed a complaint against NBC. A representative for NBC replied in a statement that the editing conformed to guidelines within the network's broadcast standards "not to advocate any one religious point of view". ''VeggieTales'' creator [[Phil Vischer]] also expressed discontent with the edits, stating that he was not informed that religious content would be removed from the series, and that he would have refused to sign a contract with Qubo if he had known of the decision beforehand. Vischer said, "I would have declined partly because I knew a lot of fans would feel like it was a [[sellout]] or it was done for money." Still, Vischer added that he understood NBC's wish to remain religiously neutral, and said, "''VeggieTales'' is religious, NBC is not. I want to focus people more on 'Isn't it cool that Bob and Larry are on television?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talking Veggies Stir Controversy at NBC |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215266,00.html |author=Sandy Cohen |agency=[[Associated Press]] |website=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |publisher=Fox News Network, LLC |date=September 22, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629071019/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,215266,00.html |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, a Spanish-language version of the Qubo website was launched.&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{cite news|title=Hola!: Qubo Launches 24/7 Kids Channel|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/53538/hola-qubo-launches-247-kids-channel.html|author=David Goetzl|periodical=MediaPost|publisher=MediaPost Communications|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A companion digital subchannel network, Qubo Channel, launched on Ion Media Networks' stations on January 8, 2007, initially featuring a schedule of children's programming in rolling four-hour blocks; Ion intended to seek carriage of the channel on cable, satellite and telco providers.&lt;ref name=mp/&gt; In May of that year, NBC Universal sold its minority stake in Ion Media Networks to [[Citadel LLC]].&lt;ref name="reuters-ionnbcsale"/&gt; On December 3, 2007, Qubo Channel expanded its programming offerings to include shows from other producers, as well as some programs that were already airing on Ion Television's Qubo block. In addition, the rolling schedule was expanded to a six-hour block, which repeated four times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=qubo Launches as 24-Hour Digital Broadcast Channel on ION Media Networks Station Group|url=http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070108005950&amp;newsLang=en|agency=[[BusinessWire]]|publisher=Ion Media Networks|date=January 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Ion Media Networks and [[Comcast]] reached an agreement to continue carrying Ion's digital channels, including Qubo and [[Ion Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ION Media Networks and Comcast Announce Affiliation Agreement for Channel Suite|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080114/20080114005909.html|website=[[Yahoo!

Qubo also began to air a series of [[public service announcement]]s featuring characters from its programs in collaboration with the [[Ad Council]], the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], advocating exercise and healthy living.&lt;ref name=mcn-qubohealth&gt;{{cite web|title=Qubo Sets Health Guidelines For Advertisers|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/orphan-articles/qubo-sets-health-guidelines-advertisers/130484|author=Larry Barrett|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Ion Media Networks filed an inquiry with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to seek [[must-carry]] cable and satellite carriage to expand Qubo's distribution to other providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ion Uses FCC Inquiry on Content Control to Push for Qubo Carriage|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/fcc/ion-uses-fcc-inquiry-content-control-push-qubo-carriage/296408|author=John Eggerton|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in May 2010, Ion signed carriage agreements with [[Advanced Cable Communications]] and [[Blue Ridge Communications]], as well as deal with Comcast's [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] system to add Qubo on the providers' digital tiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ION Media Networks Inks Multi-Affiliate Deals for Diginets|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-226922906.html|periodical=Telecommunications Weekly|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=May 26, 2010|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012–present===


With the acquisition of NBCUniversal by [[Comcast]], it was announced on March 28, 2012, that NBC and Telemundo would discontinue their Qubo blocks and replace them with [[NBC Kids|NBC Kids and MiTelemundo]]. Both blocks would be programmed by [[Universal Kids|PBS Kids Sprout]], a preschool-oriented television network that came under NBC ownership as part of the merger – on July 7;&lt;ref name="Weisman"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC to launch Saturday kids block|url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/news/nbc-to-launch-saturday-kids-block-1118052022/|author=Jon Weisman|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubino"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC, With Assist From Sprout, to Launch Saturday Morning Preschool Block|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/nbc-assist-sprout-launch-saturday-morning-preschool-block/360743|author=Lindsay Rubino|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andreev"&gt;{{cite news|title=NBC Launches Preschool Saturday Block Programmed By Sprout|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/03/nbc-launches-preschool-saturday-block-programmed-by-sprout|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 28, 2012|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Ion Television as the only remaining network with a Qubo-branded programming block (with Ion Media acquiring NBCUniversal's interest in the venture). At the time, PBS Kids Sprout was a competing joint venture between Comcast, [[HIT Entertainment]], [[PBS]] and [[Sesame Workshop]]; NBCUniversal acquired full ownership of the cable network in November 2013, and PBS Kids Sprout suddenly became simply '''Sprout''' as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBCUniversal Acquires Ownership of Kids' Channel Sprout|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nbcuniversal-acquires-full-ownership-kids-655690|author=Kimberly Nordyke|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=November 13, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBCUniversal Buys Remainder of Sprout Network|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nbcuniversal-buys-remainder-of-sprout-network-1384382409 |author=Keach Hagey|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[News Corp.]]|date=November 13, 2013|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ion Media Networks acquired the stakes in Qubo held by Classic Media (which became DreamWorks Classics in 2012, after its acquisition by [[DreamWorks Animation]]), Scholastic and Corus Entertainment in 2013, with all three companies retaining program distribution partnerships with the network. The Qubo block on Ion Television was renamed as the "Qubo Kids Corner" on January 4, 2015, concurrent with the block's move from Friday to Sunday mornings.&lt;ref&gt;http://kidscreen.com/2014/12/09/ion-television-launches-sunday-morning-qubo-kids-block/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{main|List of programs broadcast by Qubo}}
Qubo Channel features archived content from the programming libraries of Corus Entertainment, DreamWorks Classics and Scholastic Corporation, with its programs targeted at children ages 2 to 15. Though there was an early promise of the three companies - NBC, Universal and Ion Media - to produce a new series for the network and program block each year, Qubo only produced one original series, ''[[Turbo Dogs]]'', which aired from 2007 to 2008. Qubo Channel regularly broadcasts series aimed at preschoolers during the morning and afternoon hours, while series aimed at older children are featured as part of the network's evening and midnight schedule.

Programming on Qubo Channel and its companion Ion Television block account for all educational programming content on Ion Television's owned-and-operated stations and certain Ion affiliates that carry the 24-hour channel, relieving the network from the responsibility of carrying programs compliant with guidelines dictated by the [[Children's Television Act]] on its other subchannel services (especially those that simulcast the [[Home Shopping Network]] and [[QVC]], two networks that by virtue of their primary distribution via cable and satellite television, are exempt from the guidelines).

On September 28, 2010, Qubo Channel launched "Qubo Night Owl", (running from 12:00 to 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]) featuring classic animated series, many of which came from the [[Filmation]] library owned by [[DreamWorks Animation]] (currently owned by [[NBCUniversal]]).&lt;ref name=ion-nightowl&gt;{{cite press release|title=QUBO CHANNEL KICKS OFF FALL 2010 LINEUP STARTING MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27|url=http://www.ionmedianetworks.com/press/qubo-channel-kicks-off-fall-2010-lineup-starting-m?id=237|website=Ion Media Networks|date=|accessdate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The block was restructured in August 2013 to feature a mix of animated and live-action series sourced solely from Qubo's distribution partners.

==Affiliates==
{{main|List of Qubo affiliates|List of stations owned and operated by Ion Media Networks}}
&lt;!--- Please update station count in below paragraph whenever the accompanying list referenced is updated. ---&gt;
{{As of|November 2015}}, Qubo has current and pending affiliation agreements with 67 television stations encompassing 34 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name=re&gt;{{cite web|title=Stations for Network - Ion|url=http://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&amp;network=Qubo|website=[[RabbitEars]]|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network has an estimated national reach of 58.83% of all households in the United States (or 183,832,858 Americans with at least one television set). Like parent network Ion Television, the network's stations almost exclusively consist of network-owned stations (with the exception of [[Louisville, Kentucky]] affiliate [[WBNA]]). Qubo's programming is available by default via a national feed that is distributed directly to cable and satellite providers in markets without a local Ion Television station that carries the network.

Qubo does not have any over-the-air stations in several major [[media market|markets]], most notably [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]; [[Toledo, Ohio]]; [[San Diego|San Diego, California]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]; and [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]. A key factor in the network's limited national broadcast coverage is the fact that Ion Media Networks does not actively seek over-the-air distribution for the network on the [[digital subchannel]]s of other network-affiliated stations (in contrast, its parent network Ion Television – which had similarly limited national coverage following the [[digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]] – has begun subchannel-only affiliation arrangements through agreements with [[NBC Owned Television Stations]]' [[Telemundo|Telemundo Station Group]] subsidiary and [[Media General]] during 2014 and 2015&lt;ref name="aas-ionkxan"&gt;{{cite news|title=New broadcast TV network hits Austin’s airwaves|url=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/entertainment/dinges-new-broadcast-tv-network-hits-austins-airwa/npMDg/|author=Gary Dinges|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|publisher=[[Cox Enterprises]]|date=November 14, 2015|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with very few stations that [[network affiliate|contractually carry]] the network's programming (with limited exceptions in markets such as Louisville, Kentucky and [[Anchorage, Alaska]]). As a result, Ion Media Networks owns the vast majority of the stations within Qubo's affiliate body.

'''Reinout Oerlemans''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈrɛinʌut ˈuːrləmɑns}}; born 10 June 1971) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[soap opera]] [[actor]], [[film director]], [[television presenter]] and [[television producer]]. He is the founder of the TV [[production company]] [[Eyeworks]].

In 1989, while studying law at the [[University of Amsterdam]], Oerlemans was "plucked off the street" and cast as a lead in the first Dutch daily, prime time drama ''Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden''. After six years with the hit series, he became one of Holland's most successful TV personalities, hosting a variety of entertainment shows including the first cycles of ''American Idol'' in Holland. He also hosted the hit series ''Strictly Come Dancing'', as well as many seasons of his own talk show, ''Pulse'', for the largest commercial network [[RTL Television]].

In 2001, Oerlemans founded his own production company, Eyeworks. With a vision to turn the company into a major player in the global TV industry, Eyeworks grew to encompass 16 companies across continental Europe, Scandinavia, South America, New Zealand, Australia and the United States &amp;mdash; making it one of the top five largest independent production companies in the world.

He has been active in the entertainment industry for 24 years in a variety of roles, starting out as an actor. Currently, he is the CEO of television production company 3Ball Entertainment (formerly called Eyeworks USA), based in Los Angeles. This company was part of the Eyeworks Group until February 2014, when the Group was sold to Warner Bros. At the time of the sale, Eyeworks Group had produced television programs in 16 countries for over 100 different channels and employed over 1,500 people. 3 Ball Entertainment is one of the largest reality producers in the USA. Its credits include the hit series ''[[Extreme Weight Loss]]'' (the show also airs as ''Obese'' in 150 countries worldwide) and ''[[Bar Rescue]]'', (100 episodes for [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]]) among many other programs.

==Career==

===Television===
While studying law at the University of Amsterdam in 1989, Oerlemans was cast as the leading actor in the Dutch soap ''[[Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden]]''. After six years of acting he quit to become a television host. He presented a wide variety of entertainment shows including the first season of ''American Idol'', which achieved the highest ratings on a commercial channel ever. His later work includes the presentation of ''Strictly Come Dancing'' and his own talk show ''Pulse''.

In 2001, Oerlemans founded his own production company, Eyeworks, with partners Robert van den Bogaard and Ronald van Wechem. He became one of the industry's most successful producers and directors of global unscripted and scripted content. Titles produced by the Eyeworks Group include: ''[[Test The Nation]]'', ''CQC'', ''Who Wants to Marry my Son?'', ''[[Beat The Blondes]]'', ''Reality Queens of the Jungle'', ''I Know What You Did Last Friday'', ''Obese'' (aka ''Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition''), and ''Celebrity Splash''.

Oerlemans’ creation of the format ''Test The Nation'', broadcast in over 50 countries, greatly contributed to the company's acclaim.

In 2004, Oerlemans won the Zilveren Televizierster, a national prize for the male television personality of the year. In September 2005, Oerlemans moved from the commercial broadcasting company [[RTL Group|RTL]], where he had worked for fifteen years, to the public broadcasting association [[TROS]], to present the ''TROS TV Show'' for a short while, replacing TV show-legend [[Ivo Niehe]]. In December 2006, Niehe took over again.

In 2012 Oerlemans was involved in a scandal over the "big brother-style" medical TV show ''24 uur: tussen leven en dood'' (based on ''24 Hours in A&amp;E''). A total of 35 high grade security cameras and 35 microphones were installed in the emergency department of the VU medical center hospital. In the parking garage stood a container with monitors for every camera, and production company staff. This lasted for a period of 16 days in January and February 2012. After broadcasting the first episode the show was cancelled at the request of the VUmc. The hospital, the producers, and the network agreed to share in the production cost of the program, totaling almost €600.000. This was criticized in both the press and parliament for the alleged misuse of funds supposedly earmarked for healthcare.

Initially three patients made charges against the hospital, the production company, and individuals involved for the breaking doctor-patient confidentiality, illegal wire tapping, and breach of Dutch privacy laws. The public attorney's office is currently investigating the matter but has yet to file charges. Over 1500 patients were treated at the time of the filming, 215 of them were of interest to the program, and only they were asked to give permission to be included &amp;mdash; 65 of them refused.

===Film===

In 2009, Oerlemans made his debut as a feature film director with Academy Award winning producer [[Hans de Weers]], delivering the highest-grossing Dutch movie of the decade, ''Striken'' (''Komt Een Vrouw Bij De Dokter'', starring Carice Van Houten). In 2011 he brought the Dutch 3D movie to theatres: ''Nova Zembla'' (starring supermodel Doutzen Kroes in her first on screen appearance), which sold close to a million tickets in the [[Benelux]].

His love for drama turned him into an active, award-winning producer in the scripted space &amp;mdash; producing numerous feature films, including: ''The Dinner'' (with director [[Menno Meyjes]], writer of ''[[The Color Purple]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''), ''[[New Kids Turbo]]'' (over 1.5 million tickets sold in Holland, Germany and Belgium), and ''[[Jackie (2012 film)|Jackie]]'' (featuring Oscar-winning actress [[Holly Hunter]]).

Family problems, such as marital discord, [[divorce]], financial difficulties, [[child abuse]] and neglect, life-threatening illness, sibling in a [[gang]], and poor [[parenting skills]] are associated with a wide variety of children's problems, e.g. [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicide]] attempts, and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henderson|first1=A.|last2=Sager|first2=T.|last3=Horne|first3=A.|title=Mothers and sons: A look at the relationship between child behavior problems, marital satisfaction, maternal depression, and family cohesion|journal=The Family Journal|date=2003|volume=11|issue=1|pages=33–41|doi=10.1177/1066480702238469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=E.|last2=Hawton|first2=K.|last3=Rodham|first3=K.|title=In what ways are adolescents who engage in self-harm or experience thoughts of self-harm different in terms of help-seeking, communication and coping strategies?|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=2005|volume=28|issue=4|pages=573–587|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=S.|last2=Davis-Kean|first2=P.|last3=Eccles|first3=J.|title=Parents, peers and problem behavior: A longitudinal investigation of the impact of relationship perceptions and characteristics on the development of adolescent problem behavior|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2005|volume=41|issue=2|pages=401–413|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.2.401|pmid=15769195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=C.|last2=Robinson|first2=L.|last3=Wilson|first3=S.|title=Adolescent perceptions of their family system, parents' behavior, self-esteem, and family life|journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Substance Abuse|date=2004|volume=13|issue=2|pages=29–59|doi=10.1300/j029v13n02_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hacker |first1=K.|last2=Suglia |first2=S. |last3=Fried |first3=L. |last4=Rappaport |first4=N. |last5=Cabal |first5=H. |title=Developmental differences in risk factors for suicide attempts between ninth and eleventh graders|journal=Suicide and Life-threatening Behavior|date=2006|volume=36|issue=2|pages=154–166 |doi=10.1521/suli.2006.36.2.154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally trained school counselors and school psychologists may lack the family counseling training necessary to help students who are experiencing problems at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wendt|first1=R.|last2=Zake|first2=J.|title=Family systems therapy and school psychology: Implications for training and practice|journal=Psychology in the Schools|date=1984|volume=21|issue=2|pages=204–210|doi=10.1002/1520-6807(198404)21:2&lt;204::aid-pits2310210212&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; If school personnel recommend that a parent seek counseling from a community agency for family problems, the parent and family may not go because of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with therapy or because of restrictions imposed by [[managed care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vogel|first1=D.|last2=Wade|first2=G.|last3=Hackler|first3=H.|title=Perceived public stigma and the willingness to seek counseling:The mediating roles of self-stigma and attitudes toward counseling|journal=[[Journal of Counseling Psychology]]|date=2007|volume=54|issue=1|pages=40–50|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.54.1.40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crespi|first1=T.|last2=Hughes|first2=T.|title=School-based mental health services for adolescents: School psychology in contemporary society|journal=[[Journal of Applied School Psychology]]|date=2004|volume=20|issue=1|pages=67–78|doi=10.1300/j370v20n01_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
SBFC reduces the [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with therapy by emphasizing that counseling for family members has an educational goal: helping the student to succeed at school. [[Parents]], [[Legal guardian|guardians]], and family members are approached as partners with the SBFC professional, all working together to promote school success.The SBFC professional is an [[advocate]] for the [[child]], the [[family]], and the [[school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soriano|first1=M.|last2=Hong|first2=G.|title=School-based family services: Administrative leadership for a caring model of effective education|journal=Journal for a Just and Caring Education|date=1997|volume=3|issue=2|pages=180–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The earliest pioneer of SBFC was [[Alfred Adler]], the Austrian psychiatrist who developed 30 guidance clinics attached to schools in [[Vienna]] in the 1920s. Through these guidance clinics Adler and his colleagues counseled parents and teachers (often both together in large meetings where both groups were present) on how to help children overcome problems at home and school. This Adlerian home-school approach to counseling was strength-based with its emphasis on helping children develop Social Interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler|first1=A.|title=The education of children|date=1930|publisher=Gateway|location=Chicago, Ill.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=A.|title=A doctor remakes education|journal=Survey|date=1927|volume=58|pages=490–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansbacher|first1=H.|last2=Ansbacher|first2=R.|title=The individual psychology of Alfred Adler.|date=1956|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Developments==
With the advent of [[World War II]], the Vienna guidance clinics closed. The psychiatrist [[Rudolf Dreikurs]], who worked with Adler, emigrated to the USA in the 1930s and popularized the Adlerian approach to home-school intervention through books like: Children the Challenge (for parents), Maintaining Sanity in the Classroom (for teachers), and Discipline Without Tears (for parents and teachers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreikurs|first1=R.|title=Children the challenge.|date=1958|publisher=Norton|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreikurs|first1=R.|title=Maintaining sanity in the classroom.|date=1968|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreikurs|first1=R.|last2=Cassel|first2=P.|title=Discipline without tears.|date=1965|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, during the 1950s, 60's, and 70's the [[mental health professions]] developed somewhat independently of each other with the result that children having difficulty at school would typically be seen by a [[school counselor]] or [[school psychologist]]. Children having difficulty at home would typically be seen by a community-based [[mental health professional]]. Beginning in the 1970s the [[mental health]] literature begins to show an increasing emphasis on linking home and school interventions. By 2000 there existed a substantial literature on the integration of family and school counseling approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerrard|first1=B.|title=School-based family counseling: Overview, trends, and recommendations for future research|journal=International Journal for School-Based Family Counseling|date=2008|volume=1|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths of SBFC==

SBFC is a strength-based approach to counseling that emphasizes working with [[parents]] and [[Legal guardian|guardians]] as partners. It emphasizes integrating intervention (remedial) and [[Risk|prevention]] approaches at school and in the family. This emphasis on working collaboratively with parents and guardians in order to help their children succeed in school is appealing to families because of its educational focus. SBFC is a multiculturally sensitive counseling approach because it reduces the stigma associated with the [[mental health professions]]. This approach is practiced by many different [[mental health professionals]] and [[educators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soriano|first1=M.|last2=Hong|first2=G.|title=School-based family services: Administrative leadership for a caring model of effective education|journal=Journal for a Just and Caring Education|date=1997|volume=3|issue=2|pages=180–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=M.|last2=Evans|first2=W.|title=Urban school-based family counseling: Role definition, practice applications, and training implications|journal=[[Journal of Counseling and Development]]|date=1997|volume=75|issue=5|pages=366–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges for SBFC==

Most of the research supporting SBFC is descriptive and correlational. There is a need for rigorous [[randomized controlled trials]] of a variety of SBFC approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerrard|first1=B.|title=School-based family counseling: Overview, trends, and recommendations for future research|journal=[[International Journal for School-Based Family Counseling]]|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[mental health profession]] academic programs tend to emphasize interventions that focus on school intervention or family intervention, but not both. The development of SBFC programs requires both [[cross-disciplinary]] and [[cross-cultural]] thinking and a willingness to set aside mental health professional "turf" issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soriano|first1=M.|last2=Hong|first2=G.|title=School-based family services: Administrative leadership for a caring model of effective education|journal=[[Journal for a Just and Caring Education]]|date=1997|volume=3|issue=2|pages=180–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shark Tank'' is produced by [[Mark Burnett]] and based on the format ''[[Dragons' Den]]'', which originated in 2001 with the Japanese show ''Tigers of Money''.&lt;ref name=Variety&gt;Adalian, Josef (February 13, 2008).

Two of the show's longstanding "sharks," [[Robert Herjavec]] and [[Kevin O'Leary]], are Canadian entrepreneurs who had previously appeared on the [[Dragons' Den (Canadian TV series)|Canadian version]] of ''Dragons' Den''.

The "sharks" often find weaknesses and faults in an entrepreneur's concept, product, or business model.&lt;ref name="Wash Po 2009"/&gt; Some of the investors try to soften the impact of rejection, like panel member Corcoran, while others such as O'Leary can be "brutal" and show "no patience even for tales of hardship".&lt;ref name="Wash Po 2009"/&gt;

Many, and possibly a majority, of the deals made on the show are never enacted, due to the investors' [[vetting]] process following the deal, which includes product testing and the examination of the contestants' personal and business financials.&lt;ref name="NY Post"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/deal_interrupted_cPMIlS95ZcxoPT9UUxVLPP | title=Deal interrupted: On ‘Shark Tank,’ a lot can happen after the handshake | work=New York Post | date=January 29, 2013 | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | author=Daly, Shawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the entrepreneurs themselves have backed out of the deal after admitting that they only wanted to appear on the show for the publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shark Tank Roundtable – Their Best and Worst Deals |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2012/06/04/shark-tank-roundtable-their-best-and-worst-deals/ |first=Dan |last=Schawbel |work=Forbes |date=June 4, 2012 |quote=When we started dealing with these ["Hill Billy"] guys they said "we just wanted to be on TV for the free advertisement, we didn't really want to do a deal with you."}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The show is often responsible for what has become known as the ''Shark Tank'' effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/the-shark-tank-effect-how-even-the-shows-losers-became-winners|title=THE "SHARK TANK" EFFECT: HOW EVEN THE SHOW'S LOSERS BECAME WINNERS|author=Vivian Giang|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply appearing on the show, even without getting an offer, has the potential to significantly boost sales for companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201505/john-brandon/the-shark-tank-effect.html|title=Here's What Happened Next to Shark Tank's 10 Biggest Winners|author=John Brandon|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some entrepreneurs have reported revenue increases of 10-20 times after the show's airing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/278201|title=The Shark Tank Effect: This Entrepreneur 'Felt' the Power of the Show|author=Andrew Medal|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show initially required each contestant to sign an agreement with Finnmax, the producer of ''Shark Tank'', promising Finnmax the option of taking a "2 percent royalty" or "5% equity stake" in the contestant's business venture.&lt;ref name="NY Times 2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/passing-up-the-opportunity-to-appear-on-shark-tank/ | title=Passing Up the Opportunity to Appear on 'Shark Tank' | work=The New York Times | date=September 19, 2012 | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | author=Kassar, Ami}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 2013, this requirement was repealed by the network, retroactively, due to pressure from panel member [[Mark Cuban]].&lt;ref name="Inc.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
During its first season, ''Shark Tank'' saw a mostly positive reception. Josh Wolk of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, "The moneymen ask informed questions and make shrewd decisions, a welcome relief from [[Donald Trump]]'s capricious calls on Burnett's ''[[Celebrity Apprentice]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shark-tank|title=Shark Tank|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heather Havrilesky from [[Salon (website)|Salon]] said that "ABC's ''Shark Tank'' is easily the best new reality TV show to air this summer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2009/08/02/sharks_2/|title=Who wants to be a billionaire?|author=Heather Havrilesky|work=Salon|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Shales of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "It sounds gimmicky and visually tedious, with most of the so-called action taking place in a conference room. It's all those things, but the moments of misery make it memorable."&lt;ref name="Wash Po 2009" /&gt; Shales noted that the series was premiering during an economic recession, and that many of the aspiring entrepreneurs had poured significant amounts of money into their businesses; he praised "how deftly the show personalizes the desperation and pain experienced by victims of a broken down economy."&lt;ref name="Wash Po 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-08-08/opinions/36927095_1_contestants-new-reality-show-judges | title=Shark Tank: ABC Is Out For Blood | work=The Washington Post | date=August 8, 2009 | accessdate=March 21, 2013 | author=Shales, Tom | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054637/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-08-08/opinions/36927095_1_contestants-new-reality-show-judges | archivedate=September 21, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; And David Hinckley of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' said, "Once you get past its somewhat misleading title, Mark Burnett's new Shark Tank is a well-paced hour that offers entertainment without humiliation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/mark-burnett-shark-tank-abc-entertains-humiliating-capitalists-fish-financing-article-1.397721|title=Capitalists fish for financing on Mark Burnett's 'Shark Tank'|work=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratings===
During the first two seasons, the series barely peaked at 5 million viewers, with season 2 only having 9 episodes in its run. But by season 3, the show's viewership went past 5 million and started to crack the top 100 in the ratings. By 2012, the show averaged over 6 million viewers per episode. It is the most watched program on Friday nights in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/shark-tank-grimm-chuck-tv-ratings-283774|title=TV Ratings: 'Shark Tank' Boosts ABC, 'Grimm' Jumps Double Digits|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{CN|date=April 2017}} As a result, ABC added three more episodes to the original season order of 22.

'''''Takahashi v. Fish and Game Comm'n''''', 334 U.S. 410 (1948), was a case before the [[United States Supreme Court]]. The issue at hand was a restrictive law in California requiring American citizenship to get a fishing license. The Court held that this was an unreasonable restriction and was discriminatory to residents of Japanese ancestry.

==Background==

===Facts===
Torao Takahashi came from Japan to the United States and became a resident of [[Terminal Island]] in Los Angeles County, California in 1907.  Prior to 1943 California issued commercial fishing licenses to all qualified persons without regard to alienage or ineligibility to citizenship. From 1915 to 1942 Takahashi, under annual commercial fishing licenses issued by the State, fished in ocean waters off the California coast, apparently both within and without the three-mile coastal belt, and brought his fresh fish ashore for sale.  In 1942, while the United States country was at war with Japan, Takahashi and other California residents of Japanese ancestry were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly interned]] under military orders. The evacuation was legally challenged in ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' but a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the evacuation.

In 1943, during the period of war and evacuation, an amendment to the California Fish and Game Code was adopted prohibiting issuance of a license to any "alien Japanese."&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Stats. 1943, ch. 1100.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the state code was again amended by striking the 1943 provision for fear that it might be "declared unconstitutional" because directed only "against alien Japanese"; the new amendment banned issuance of licenses to any "person ineligible to citizenship," which classification included Japanese. Cal. Stats. 1945, ch. 181. Because of this state provision barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible for citizenship under federal law, Takahashi, who met all other state requirements, was denied a license by the [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife|California Fish and Game Commission]] upon his return to California in 1945.

===Claim===

Takahashi, an alien ineligible for citizenship, brought an action for mandamus in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, to compel the Commission to issue him a commercial fishing license.

===California Superior Court===

The Superior Court first ordered issuance of a commercial fishing license authorizing Takahashi to bring ashore "catches of fish from the waters of the high seas beyond the State's territorial jurisdiction."

After appeal to the State Supreme Court by the State Commission the Superior Court amended its judgment so as to order a commercial license authorizing Takahashi to bring in catches of fish taken from the three-mile ocean belt adjacent to the California coast as well as from the high seas.  It held that lawful alien inhabitants of California, despite their ineligibility to citizenship, were entitled to engage in the vocation of commercial fishing on the high seas beyond the three-mile belt on the same terms as other lawful state inhabitants, and that the California code provision denying them this right violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

===Supreme Court of California===
A judgment granting the writ was reversed by the State Supreme Court, three judges dissenting.

The Court held that California had a proprietary interest in fish in the ocean waters within three miles of the shore, and that this interest justified the State in barring all aliens in general and aliens ineligible to citizenship in particular from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them to California for commercial purposes. 30 Cal. 2d 719, 185 P. 2d 805.

The state court held that this interest justified the state in barring all aliens in general, and aliens ineligible for citizenship in particular, from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them into the state for commercial purposes.

===Certiorari and arguments===
The Supreme Court granted certiorari. 333 U.S. 853, "to review this question of importance in the fields of federal-state relationships and of constitutionally protected individual equality and liberty".

==Opinion of the court==

The Court reversed.  [[Hugo Black|Justice Black]] was joined by six other justices.

It held that the California statute forbidding the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to aliens ineligible to citizenship was held to violate the constitutional right of such aliens to the equal protection of the laws. The contention that the statute might be supported as a conservation measure was rejected.  The state could not, consistent with the United States Constitution, use federally created racial ineligibility for citizenship as a basis for barring petitioner from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean water off the state coast. The refusal to issue petitioner a commercial fishing license violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and there was no special public interest to support the state ban on petitioner's commercial fishing.

A state prohibition of the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible to citizenship makes an unreasonable classification in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (distinguishing ''[[Terrace v. Thompson]]'', 263 US 197; ''[[Porterfield v. Webb]]'', 263 US 225; ''[[Webb v. O'Brien]]'', 263 US 313; and ''[[Frick v. Webb]]'', 263 US 326).

1. A California statute barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons "ineligible to citizenship," which classification included resident alien Japanese and precluded such a one from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean waters off the coast of the State, held invalid under the Federal Constitution and laws. pp.&amp;nbsp;412–422.

2. For purposes of decision by this Court, it may be assumed that the object of the statute was to conserve fish in the coastal waters of the State, or to protect citizens of the State engaged in commercial fishing from the competition of Japanese aliens, or both. P. 418.

3. That the United States regulates immigration and naturalization in part on the basis of race and color classifications does not authorize adoption by a State of such classifications to prevent lawfully admitted aliens within its borders from earning a livelihood by means open to all other inhabitants. pp.&amp;nbsp;418–420.

4. The Fourteenth Amendment and federal laws, 8 U. S. C. § 41, embody a general policy that all persons lawfully in this country shall abide "in any state" on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws. pp.&amp;nbsp;419–420.

5. Whatever may be the interest of the State or its citizens in the fish in the 3-mile belt offshore, that interest does not justify the State in excluding any or all aliens who are lawful residents of the State from making a living by fishing in the ocean off its shores while permitting all other persons to do so. pp.&amp;nbsp;420–421.

6. Assuming their continued validity, cases sustaining state laws barring land ownership by aliens ineligible to citizenship, which rested on grounds peculiar to real property, can not be extended to control the decision in this case. P. 422.

===Concurrence===
[[Frank Murphy|Justice Murphy]], joined by [[Wiley B. Rutledge|Rutledge]], expressed agreement with these views, but thought that the statute should also be condemned as being the direct outgrowth of antagonism toward persons of Japanese ancestry and as having no relation whatever to any constitutionally cognizable interest of California.

===Dissent===
[[Stanley F. Reed|Justice Reed]], joined by [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], dissented on the ground that a state has the power to exclude all aliens from enjoyment of its natural resources, including its fisheries, and that a classification excluding such aliens as are ineligible to citizenship is not unreasonable.

== Plot ==
A fading family-owned [[automobile manufacturer]] and its owners pin their hopes for a return to profitability on a new model named for the great-granddaughter of the firm's founder.

The aging Loren Hardeman Sr. remains the titular head of a Detroit automotive conglomerate. (An obvious parallel exists between this fictional character and that of [[Henry Ford]].) His grandson, Loren Hardeman III, now runs the company as president, but has diversified into other fields and is concerned that the auto division is not as lucrative as it once was and might even need to be eliminated.

A young auto racer, Angelo Perino, has been secretly commissioned to develop a ground-breaking fuel-efficient car. He juggles romantic relationships with a British royal, Lady Bobby Ayres, and the young Betsy, who is about to turn 21 and inherit a fortune, including the new car her great-grandfather is naming in her honor.

Loren Hardeman III bitterly despises Hardeman Sr., who once carried on an affair with Loren's mother. The older Hardeman is not the man he used to be, but neither is he ready to step aside forever.

==Cast==

The titular car is a slightly modified 1974 [[Lancia Beta]] coupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_324856-Lancia-Beta-Coupe-1974.html |title=1974 Lancia Beta Coupe |publisher=Internet Movie Cars Database |year=2010 |accessdate=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Betsy'' features music composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Betsy (1978) |publisher=movies.com |year=2007 |url= http://www.movies.com/betsy/details/m46636 |accessdate=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed at [[Rosecliff]] mansion in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

Review by an automobile industry expert noted that filmmakers have not shown believable characters and realistic dialogue.&lt;ref name="AlexTaylor"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/20/autos/big_three_hollywod.fortune/ |title=The Big Three on the Big Screen |first=Alex |last=Taylor III |journal=Fortune |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=14 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214171809/http://money.cnn.com/2011/09/20/autos/big_three_hollywod.fortune/ |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts by Hollywood to capture the auto industry on film, such as ''The Betsy'', have "aimed at realistic drama but wound up with suds."&lt;ref name="AlexTaylor"/&gt;

In 1978 in United States there was a notable increase in construction of [[racquetball]] courts in the country and the director chose to shoot a scene in a company racquetball court during first meeting between the character played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Robert Duvall]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3696">'''Tlamemeh''' is a word that comes from the [[Nahuatl]] tlamama, meaning load. In [[Honduras]] and [[Mexico]] it means Indian laborer. The porters carried loads on their backs (which could be people, taxes, or items for trade).

In colonial times the tradition implied the servitude of the Indians, who in most cases became [[vassals]] of the Spanish  which became widespread. Today, in [[Mexican Spanish]], the word tameme is usually a derogatory connotation of "subordinate" that denotes the discrimination from the Indian that was consolidated in the new Colony of Spain.

==History==
[[File:Pochtecas con su carga.JPG|230px|thumb|Tlamemeh according to the [[Florentine Codex]]]]
In pre-Hispanic Mexico, and generally throughout [[Mesoamerica]], there was not any animal capable of being used in the loading and transport of goods and so manpower had to be used, this is how the "tameme" emerged. From the arrival of the Spanish in the area (first expeditions starting in 1493), they began to replace porters with animals such as horses carrying the [[conquest (military)|conquerors]], but were not specifically brought to be used for burden but for combat, so the porters were still widely used.

==Job characteristics==

[[Miguel León-Portilla]], described tlamemes as "porters trained from childhood", from the class of commoners [[macehualtin]], devoted exclusively to freight in the [[Aztec]] culture." They began to exercise since childhood, carrying on average 23 kilos and did a daily commute of 21 to 25 kilometers before being relieved .

With the Spanish conquest in 1521 the first domestic species of cargo animals arrived, but they continued to use tlamemes because of a lack of roads. They were considered of lower status in the social scale, only slightly higher than the simple soldiers of the Aztec military. [[Porters]] that were located on the outside of the markets or swap meets, provided services transporting purchases, but the most important were the porters who served in the expeditions of the merchants.

Before leaving in each convoy, merchants carefully calculated the number of porters that would accompany them, taking into account the duration of the trip, the number of casualties possible in the course, etc. . They carried all the goods that the merchants would sell on the trip, which often lasted for months. When the expedition reached a resting place, they were granted special attention to the through the night, so they could recover from their strenuous efforts, recognizing the value of their work. When they returned to base, the expedition porters were engaged in periods of rest, not acting in the tianguis(stores)q, or mingling with the other porters.

In remote areas or for economic reasons, this profession continues even today.

==Applications and tools==

The porters used a "backstrap" in their work, which was a wide, thick leather strap with a mecate(cord) at each end  that served to hold and keep the load stable to the back of the tlameme. In some, mecapales([[textiles]]) and wood structures were used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32753">'''Antoin "Tony" Rezko''' (born 1955) is an American businessman.  He was a fundraiser for Illinois [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians. After becoming a major contributor to [[Rod Blagojevich]]'s successful gubernatorial election, Rezko assisted Blagojevich in setting up the state's first Democratic administration in twenty years and as a result he was able to have business associates appointed onto several state boards. Rezko and several others were indicted on federal charges in October 2006 for using their connections on the state boards to demand [[Political corruption#Kickbacks|kickbacks]] from businesses that wished to engage in dealings with the state. While the others pleaded guilty, Rezko pleaded not guilty and was tried.  He was found guilty of 16 of the 24 charges filed against him and on November 23, 2011, he was sentenced to 10.5 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/politics/9001435-418/tony-rezko-sentenced-to-10-12-years-in-kickback-scheme.html|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2012-01-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129212145/http://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/politics/9001435-418/tony-rezko-sentenced-to-10-12-years-in-kickback-scheme.html|archivedate=2011-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Tony Rezko was born in 1955 in [[Aleppo, Syria]], to a prominent [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] family.&lt;ref name=chicagomag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagomag.com/core/pagetools.php?pageid=7030&amp;url=%2FChicago-Magazine%2FNovember-2007%2FMr-Inside-Out%2F&amp;mode=print|title=Mr. Inside Out|publisher=Chicago Magazine|author=Merriner, James L.|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from college there, Rezko moved to [[Chicago]] and earned an undergraduate and a master's degree in civil engineering from the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in the late 1970s. He joined an engineering company, designing [[nuclear power]] plants, then left to design roads for the state Transportation Department, making $21,590 in his first year there.&lt;ref name=Fund-raising&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jackson|first=David|last2=Chase|first2=John|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0610120112oct12,0,3093652.story|title=Rezko's life a story of pizza and politics|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=2006-10-12|accessdate=2007-02-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227041817/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0610120112oct12,0,3093652.story|archivedate=2007-12-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/355099,cst-nws-rez24a.article|title=Broken promises, broken homes|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Novak, Tim|date=2007-04-24|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324131917/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/355099,cst-nws-rez24a.article|archivedate=2008-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While he was an engineer, Rezko started buying vacant lots and developing single family residences. He also began investing in [[fast-food]] restaurants, including the first [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] in Chicago. Many properties were in lower-income [[African American]] neighborhoods&lt;ref name=chicagomag/&gt;&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; where he met Jabir Herbert (J.H.) Muhammad, former manager of heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]] and son of the late [[Nation of Islam]] leader, [[Elijah Muhammad]]. Rezko was asked in 1983 to support the successful mayoral candidacy of African-American [[Harold Washington]]. J.H. Muhammad's company, Crucial Concessions, hired Rezko in 1984 and won a food contract on Lake Michigan beaches and in many South Side parks. Rezko put together endorsement deals for Ali, became the executive director of the Muhammad Ali Foundation, and traveled the world with Ali for five years.&lt;ref name=chicagomag/&gt;

In 1997, Crucial Concessions opened two [[Panda Express]] Restaurants at O'Hare, under the city's minority set-aside program. It lost those franchises in 2005, on the grounds that J.H. Muhammad was merely a front man for Rezko, who had been appointed trustee of Elijah Muhammad's affairs in the early 1990s. In March 2008 Muhammad sued Rezko, alleging that he had been swindled out of his home and business interests.&lt;ref name=Novak2/&gt;&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/02/01/rezko/print.html|title=How close were Barack Obama and Tony Rezko?|publisher=Salon|author=McClelland, Edward|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2008-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418205340/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/02/01/rezko/print.html|archivedate=2008-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/us/politics/14rezko.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print|title=An Obama Patron and Friend Until an Indictment|work=The New York Times|date=2007-06-14|accessdate=2008-05-10|first1=Christopher|last1=Drew|first2=Mike|last2=McIntire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, Rezko and attorney Daniel Mahru, CEO of a firm that leased ice makers to bars and hotels, founded a real-estate development and restaurant holding corporation called Rezmar Corporation. Between 1989 and 1998, Rezmar rehabilitated 30 buildings, a total of 1,025 apartments, spending more than $100 million from the city, state and federal governments and bank loans. Rezko and Mahru weren't responsible for any government or bank loans or the $50 million in federal tax credits they got to rehab the buildings. Rezmar put just $100 into each project and got a 1% stake as the general partner in charge of hiring the architect, contractor, and the company that would manage the buildings. They selected Chicago Property Management, also owned by Rezko and Mahru, to manage the buildings, including selecting the tenants and making repairs. Rezmar also got upfront development fees of at least $6.9 million in all. Under its deals with the Chicago Equity Fund, Rezmar promised to cover all operating losses in any building for seven years, but had no obligation after that, although the Federal Government could recover the tax credits that Rezmar sold from the holders if the projects did not survive for fifteen years or more.&lt;ref name=Novak2/&gt; By 1998 the company had a net worth of [[United States dollar|US$]]34 million&lt;ref name=Novak&gt;{{cite news|author=Novak, Tim|title=Obama and his Rezko ties|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2007-04-23|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/353829,CST-NWS-rez23.article|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it then turned to purchasing old factories and parcels of land in [[gentrification|gentrifying]] areas of Chicago and turning them into upscale condominium complexes.&lt;ref name=Novak2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87830023|title=Q&amp;A: The Tony Rezko Case|author=David Schaper|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rezko was named "Entrepreneur of the Decade" by the Arab-American Business and Professional Association.&lt;ref name=hanania&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themediaoasis.com/profiles/Rezko06-08-05.htm|title=Arabs in Chicago discover political clout and controversy|author=Ray Hanania|publisher=Arab American Media Services|date=2005-06-08|accessdate=2008-01-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915132137/http://www.themediaoasis.com/profiles/Rezko06-08-05.htm|archivedate=2008-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rezko's investment in restaurant food chains had started with a chain of [[Panda Express]] Chinese restaurants. In 1998, Rezko opened his first chain of [[Papa John's Pizza]] restaurants in Chicago and by 2002, he had twenty-six stores in Chicago, at least fifteen in [[Wisconsin]], and seven in Detroit, part of the financing for these stores was through [[GE Capital]].&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt; By 2001, Rezko began to fall behind on his franchise payments and loans and he transferred the franchises to several business associates. In 2006, during a lawsuit with Papa John's over his franchise fees, Rezko renamed his Papa John's restaurants to Papa Tony's.&lt;ref name=hanania/&gt; Rezko also had a lien filed against his home after losing a civil lawsuit to GE Capital.&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt;

As his business ventures began failing, Rezko entered into several partnership with Iraqi-born business executive [[Nadhmi Auchi]], including a massive 2005 real estate development project on Chicago's [[Chicago Loop|South Loop]] whose value was pegged by an observer familiar with the deal at $130.5 million.&lt;ref name="chibus"&gt;[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=17946 Rezko sells Loop project for $131M]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, Rezko was imprisoned for his  failure to disclose a $3.5m loan from Auchi.

==Legal troubles==
Rezko was later convicted on 16 charges of corruption and fraud and was sentenced to serve 10 1/2 years in prison.

===Public corruption charges===
In October 2006, Rezko was indicted along with businessman Stuart Levine on charges of wire fraud, bribery, money laundering, and attempted extortion as a result of a federal investigation known as "Operation Board Games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/downloads/rezkoindict.pdf|title=Indictment - U.S. vs. Levine and Rezko|format=PDF |publisher=Chicago Business | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,335592,00.html | title=Courtroom Wire: Notes From Tony Rezko's Corruption Trial | publisher=FOXNews | author=Marla Cichowski | date=2008-04-04 | accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine was once a top Republican fund-raiser who had switched loyalty in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=22634&amp;seenIt=1|title=Chicago Business News--Stuart Levine Pleads Guilty}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rezko and Levine were charged with attempting to extort millions of dollars from businesses seeking to do business with the Illinois Teachers  System Board and the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board from 2002 to 2004. Levine pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Rezko and others. While the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, Levine expects to receive about a 5-1/2&amp;nbsp;year sentence in return for his testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko-19mar19,0,5503877.story | title=Levine weaves tawdry tale | work=Chicago Tribune | author=Secter, Bob |author2=Coen, Jeff  | date=2008-03-19 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was prosecuted by [[Patrick Fitzgerald]].

Rezko pleaded not guilty, and the trial related to his charges from Operation Board Games began on March 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0307edit1mar07,1,5412814.story | archive-url=https://archive.is/20081214193252/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-0307edit1mar07,1,5412814.story | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-12-14 | title=One Tony, three trials | work=Chicago Tribune | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2008-05-10 }} &lt;/ref&gt; He was jailed shortly before the trial began when he received a $3.5&amp;nbsp;million wire transfer from Lebanon. Rezko had told the court that he had no access to money from overseas. Ten weeks into the trial, on April 18, Judge Amy St. Eve released Rezko, after friends and relatives put up 30 properties valued at about $8.5&amp;nbsp;million to secure his bond. Prosecutors opposed the motion for release, saying that Rezko was a flight risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko-fridayapr20,1,7431091.story | title=Rezko free on bail |work= Chicago Tribune |author= Coen, Jeff |date= 2008-04-20 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 6, both the prosecution and the defense rested their cases. Government prosecutors spent 8 weeks presenting their case. Rezko’s lawyer, Joseph J. Duffy, chose not to present any witnesses, saying that he did not believe that the prosecution had proven the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/us/06brfs-002.html?ref=us | title=Illinois: No Defense Witnesses for Rezko | work=The New York Times | author=Einhorn Catrin | date=2008-05-06 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors contended that they had shown Rezko's "corrupt use of his power and influence" to gain benefits for himself and his friends. Duffy argued that the prosecution had exaggerated Rezko's influence in state government, and attacked Levine's credibility as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-rezko_for_tuesdaymay13,0,553455.story Corrupt mastermind or victim of frame-up?] Chicago Tribune, May 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The case went to the jury on May 13 and after three weeks of deliberation, the jury found Rezko guilty of six counts of wire fraud, six counts of mail fraud, two counts of corrupt solicitation, and two counts of money laundering, but found him not guilty on three counts of wire and mail fraud, one count of attempted extortion, and four counts of corrupt solicitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/politics&amp;id=6185320 | title=Rezko found guilty on 16 counts | publisher=ABCNews | date=2008-06-04 | accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CBS News the "high-profile federal trial provided an unusually detailed glimpse of the pay-to-play politics that has made Illinois infamous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cbs2chicago.com/local/rezko.trial.verdict.2.740375.html |title=Jury Finds Tony Rezko Guilty On 16 Of 24 Charges |publisher=CBS 2 |author=Parker, Mike |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2008-06-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605063726/http://cbs2chicago.com/local/rezko.trial.verdict.2.740375.html |archivedate=2008-06-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the jury was deliberating on the Board Games trial, an arrest warrant was issued in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] for passing bad checks in two casinos and failing to pay $450,000 in gambling debts that were accrued between March and July 2006.&lt;ref name=Casino_debt&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/rezko/977195,rezkogamble052908.article | title=Las Vegas judge issues arrest warrant for Tony Rezko over alleged gambling debts | work=Chicago Sun-Times | author=Korecki, Natasha |authorlink=Natasha Korecki| date=2008-05-29 | accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another casino had also filed a civil complaint for a total of $331,000 in 2006 and was given a judgment of default in 2007.&lt;ref name=Casino_debt/&gt;

==Ties to politicians==

===Ties to Rod Blagojevich===
Rezko's relationship with Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] and his family were at the root of the federal corruption case which led to Rezko's conviction.&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt; Rezko donated $117,652 to Blagojevich's campaigns,&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; and is credited by the prosecutor in his trial with having delivered [[Bundling (fundraising)|bundled]] contributions totalling almost $1.44 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/hot/us_v_rezko_exhibits/2008_03_07/fob_chart_2.pdf |title=FOB Chart 2 |publisher=United States Department of Justice |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2008-05-10 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625021242/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/hot/us_v_rezko_exhibits/2008_03_07/fob_chart_2.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, Blagojevich's wife, Patricia, has made at least $38,000 acting as Rezko's real-estate agent on several of his company's property acquisitions. When Blagojevich won the Illinois gubernatorial election in 2002, Rezko assisted Blagojevich in setting up the state's first Democratic administration in twenty years.&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt; Rezko recommended many of his business associates and their relatives for positions within state government, three of whom were appointed to the state board that oversees hospital projects. the state's development board was run by another former Rezko business associate.

===Ties to Barack Obama===

====History====
In 1990, after [[Barack Obama]] was elected president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Rezmar Corp. offered him a job, which Obama turned down.  Obama instead took a job with the firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland,&lt;ref&gt;now Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland. {{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obamalegal6apr06,0,26672.story |title=Obama's lawyer days: brief and not all civil rights |work=Los Angeles Times |author=Morain, Dan |date=2008-04-06 |accessdate=2008-05-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410052901/http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-obamalegal6apr06,0,26672.story |archivedate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which primarily worked on civil rights cases. The firm also represented Rezmar and helped the company get more than $43&amp;nbsp;million in government funding. The firm's former senior partner, Allison S.

====Real estate dealings====
In 2005 Obama purchased a new home in the Kenwood District of Chicago for $1.65&amp;nbsp;million (which was $300,000 below the asking price but represented the highest offer on the property) on the same day that Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, purchased the adjoining empty lot from the same sellers for the full asking price.&lt;ref name="Land deal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0611010273nov01,0,1188525.story?page=1|title=Rezko owns vacant lot next to Obama's home|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Ray Gibson|author2=David Jackson |date=2006-11-01|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama acknowledged bringing his interest in the property to Rezko's attention,&lt;ref&gt;"Asked who approached her about the house, Schwan [the seller's broker] told Salon, 'I honestly don't remember.

According to Obama, while the properties had originally been a single property, the previous owners decided to sell the land as two separate lots, but made it a condition of the sales that they be closed on the same date. Obama also stated that the properties had been on the market for months, that his offer was the better of two bids, and that Ms. Rezko's bid was matched by another offer, also of $625,000, so that she could not have purchased the property for less.&lt;ref name=mistake&gt;{{cite news|author=McKinney, Dave|author2=Fusco, Chris |title=Obama on Rezko deal: It was a mistake|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2006-11-05|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/124171,CST-NWS-obama05.article|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After it had been reported in 2006 that Rezko was under federal investigation for influence-peddling, Obama purchased a 10-foot-wide strip of Ms. Rezko's property for $104,500, $60,000 above the assessed value.&lt;ref name=Novak/&gt;&lt;ref name="Land deal"/&gt; According to ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' columnist, Mark Brown, "Rezko definitely did Obama a favor by selling him the 10-foot strip of land, making his own parcel less attractive for development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brown, Mark|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/121104,CST-NWS-brown02.article|title=Obama's dealings with Rezko buy a parcel of questions|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2006-11-02|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama acknowledges that the exchange may have created the appearance of impropriety and stated "I consider this a mistake on my part and I regret it."&lt;ref name=mistake/&gt;

On December 28, 2006, Mrs. Rezko sold the property to a company owned by her husband's former business attorney. That sale of $575,000, combined with the earlier $104,500 sale to the Obamas, amounted to a [[net profit]] of $54,500 over her original purchase, less $14,000 for a fence along the property line and other expenses.&lt;ref&gt;The $54,500 figure is before any property tax and other expenses Ms. Rezko incurred during her ownership&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/obama/chi-0702240237feb24,0,5895873.story|title=Rezko sells lot next to Obama|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Jackson, David|author2=Ray Gibson |date=2007-02-24|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, the new owners put the still vacant land up for sale again, this time for $1.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/595915,CST-NWS-obama10.article|title=Lot next to Obama can be yours for $1.5M|work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=Novak, Tim|date=2007-10-10|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Obama's letters====
In June 2007, the ''Sun-Times'' published a story about letters Obama had written in 1997 to city and state officials in support of a low-income senior citizen development project headed by Rezko and Davis. The project received more than $14&amp;nbsp;million in taxpayer funds, including $885,000 in development fees for Rezko and Davis. Of Obama's letters in support of the Cottage View Terrace apartments development, Obama spokesman Bill Burton said, "This wasn't done as a favor for anyone; it was done in the interests of the people in the community who have benefited from the project. I don't know that anyone specifically asked him to write this letter nine years ago. There was a consensus in the community about the positive impact the project would make and Obama supported it because it was going to help people in his district." Rezko's attorney responded that "Mr. Rezko never spoke with, nor sought a letter from, Senator Obama in connection with that project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Novak, Tim|title=Obama's letters for Rezko|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2007-06-13|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/425305,CST-NWS-obama13.article|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[South Carolina Democratic Party]] presidential debate on January 21, 2008, Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] said that Obama had been associated with Rezko, whom she referred to as a [[slumlord|slum landlord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Healy, Patrick|author2=Zeleny, Jeff |title=Obama and Clinton Tangle at Debate|work=The New York Times|date=2008-01-22|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/us/politics/22dems.html?em&amp;ex=1201150800&amp;en=6ae2b7e80f2fc272&amp;ei=5087%0A|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' indicated that its own review showed Rezko played a deeper role in Obama's political and financial biography than Obama has acknowledged.&lt;ref name=rezoba&gt;{{cite news|author=Morain, Dan|author2=Hamburger, Tom |title=Obama dogged by ties to donor|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2008-01-23|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/23/nation/na-rezko23|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of the debate, a photo of Rezko posing with [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] surfaced. When asked about the photo, Hillary Clinton commented: "I probably have taken hundreds of thousands of pictures. I wouldn't know him if he walked in the door."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://youdecide08.foxnews.com/2008/01/25/photo-surfaces-showing-sen-clinton-posing-with-chicago-landlord-rezko|title=Photo Surfaces Showing Sen.

===Ties to other politicians===
Rezko's first significant political act was hosting a fundraiser for [[Harold Washington]] during Washington's successful campaign to become Chicago's mayor.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; He has since raised funds for many other politicians.&lt;ref name=Sneed&gt;{{cite news|author=Sneed, Michael|title=The Rezko scandal&amp;nbsp;...|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=2006-10-12|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/sneed/93087,CST-NWS-sneed12.article|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Blagojevich and Obama, prominent Democrats that Rezko or his company, Rezmar, have contributed money to, or fund-raised for, are Congressman [[Luis Gutierrez]], a friend for over two decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Novak|title=Luis' deal with Rezko|date=2006-11-14|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/135305,CST-NWS-luis14.article|work =Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comptroller [[Daniel Hynes|Dan Hynes]], Attorney General [[Lisa Madigan]], Lieutenant Governor [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]], former Chicago Mayors Daley and Washington, and former Cook County Board President [[John Stroger]].&lt;ref name=Fund-raising/&gt; Rezko has also raised money for Republicans, including former Illinois Governors [[Jim Edgar]] and [[George Ryan]].&lt;ref name=chicagomag/&gt; The late [[Rosemont, Illinois]], Mayor [[Donald Stephens]] and Rezko co-chaired a multimillion-dollar fund-raiser for President [[George W. Bush]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=Novak2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sneed/&gt;

Rezko headed the 2002 campaign finance committee for Stroger. Stroger appointed Rezko's wife, Rita, to the Cook County Employee Appeals Board, which hears cases brought by fired or disciplined workers. The part-time post pays $37,000 a year.&lt;ref name=chicagomag/&gt; A Rezko company had a contract to maintain pay telephones at the [[Cook County Jail]] under Stroger. The ''Chicago Sun-Times'' puts Rezko's contributions to Stroger at $148,300.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''Trump Winery''' (formerly '''Kluge Estate Winery and Vineyard'''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;) is a Virginia [[winery]] situated on Trump Vineyard Estates in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].

==Acquisition==
Donald Trump purchased the vineyard out of foreclosure from three different banks, not from Patricia Kluge directly like some have suggested. Prior to being foreclosed, Patricia Kluge, former wife of American billionaire [[John Kluge]], did own the property.  After her divorce in 1990, Kluge spent much of her remaining fortune over the following two decades, in 1999 establishing a winery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/23/AR2011022302452.html|title=Va. winemaker's painstakingly built empire crumbled in months amid recession|first=Annie|last=Gowen|date=24 February 2011|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing to expand its production.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; She and her new husband also took out $65 million in loans to fund the expansion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2011/03/10/patricia-kluge-lifestyle-billionaire-bankruptcy-estate.html|title=The Rise And Fall Of Patricia Kluge|last=Brennan|first=Morgan |publisher=Forbes|date=2011-03-10|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the couple defaulted on the loans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2006943/Former-nude-model-richest-divorcee-history-declares-bankrupt.html|title=Where did all the money go?
