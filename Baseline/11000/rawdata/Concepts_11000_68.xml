El-Abnoudy is considered to be one of the pioneer Arab female movie directors as her films have inspired the works of many Arab women in the industry. She has been nicknamed the "poor people's filmmaker" due to the subject matter that inspired her to make films: civil rights issues and the unfortunate living circumstances of impoverished Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valassopoulos|first=Anastasia|date=2013-09-13|title=Arab Cultural Studies|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315873206|journal=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=en|doi=10.4324/9781315873206}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ateyyat El Abnoudy has been the recipient of many awards for her films. Her film, ''Horse of Mud (1971)'' won her three international prizes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1972, Abnoudy also won the French Critics Prize at Grenoble Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; El-Abnoudy was one of the earliest Arab women filmmakers to have been working in Egypt, and led the way for many other film-making Arab women to pursue a career in the industry. 

==Early Life and Education==
Ateyyat El Abnoudy began her early life being raised in a small village by her two parents in a working class family. El-Abnoudy attended the [[Cairo University|University of Cairo]] where she began working at a theatre and as an actress to put herself through school and to attain her law degree. This is where she met her first husband, a journalist and poet named [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi|Abdel-Rahman El Abnoudy]]. Because of Abdel's career, Atteyyat was in the arts circle which meant networking with many writers, poets, and the artistic types of Egypt. She gives thanks to one of the people who helped her in her journey Nasser, his coming into power allowed for the filmmaker to attend post-secondary and take further steps to beginning her career.

While deciding on where she fits in the film world, Ateyyat worked in many different roles in the theater, such as stage manager and assistant. When she found her passion in film-making she decided to continue her education. In 1972 she attended Cairo’s Higher Film Institute to finish her film studies. In the two years she spent there, she created her first two films called ''Horse of Mud'', which she received awards for.  At the time that film was created to filmmaker was still new to the industry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

While Abnoudy was nearing her graduation date she was also in the process of creating her first documentary ''Horse of Mud'' &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van de Peer|first=Stefanie|date=January 2011|title=ThePhysicalities ofDocumentaries byAfricanWomen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19301944.2011.10781405|journal=Critical Interventions|volume=5|issue=1|pages=135–153|doi=10.1080/19301944.2011.10781405|issn=1930-1944|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Abnoudy stated that she wanted to have what she referred to as a style of poetic realism. The ways in which she captured the images of her actresses was a way she states would show that the best. According to Van de Peer, the ''Horse of Mud'' wasn’t only Abnoudy’s first documentary, but it was also Egypt’s first documentary by a woman.

Abnoudy worked on creating original work. Work that circulates are the lives that people in third world countries are living in as Van de peer states in his piece. She likes to focus on the things in our everyday lives that influence us. The impacts that society has on our lives. In terms of a poetic approach, a few of her movies are short films. Like the saying: a little says a lot, that is the way in which Abnoudy’s films speak to her viewers. She wants her audience to understand the message she is using her films to relay. Every time her films are watched she wants the viewer to learn her message and relate to the film in a new way each time&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

At the time that Abnoudy was in the process of sculpting her craft, according to Van de Peer in his articles, Egypt was undermining the freedom of expression, especially of women. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Van de Peer states that the feminist documentary writer expresses her poetic realism, along with that Abnoudy uses her films ''Permissible Dreams'' (1982) and ''Responsible Women'' (1994) to make her viewers feel empathy and appropriation.

&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;The interest that she had in law, her work as an actress, and the circle of people she surrounded herself with inspired her to become a filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=notjDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Permissible+Dissidence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtndWrtf3dAhVRjlkKHUgPADkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ateyyat&amp;f=false|title=Negotiating Dissidence: The Pioneering Women of Arab Documentary|last=Peer|first=Stefanie Van de|date=2017-03-08|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748696079|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ateyyat El Abnoudy started her acting career as a means to financially support herself in school while she studied journalism. When El-Abnoudy's career as a journalist began, she took a particular interest in the poor people of Egypt, specifically [[Cairo]]. This later inspired her to take up production and become a filmmaker who shined a light on some of the unfortunate life circumstances of those in Egypt. El-Abnoudy quickly became known by two titles: the "poor people's filmmaker" and the "mother of documentaries" as she inspired many Arab women filmmakers to follow in her footsteps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peer|first=Stefanie Van de|date=2017-04-01|title=Ateyyat El Abnoudy: Poetic Realism in Egyptian Documentaries|url=http://edinburgh.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.3366/edinburgh/9780748696062.001.0001/upso-9780748696062-chapter-002|language=en-US|doi=10.3366/edinburgh/9780748696062.001.0001/upso-9780748696062-chapter-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

El-Abnoudy started making films since 1971, most of which are known for dealing with political, social, and economic issues in Egypt. During the time she began making films Egypt had just overcome a long and complex colonial history with Britain. The film industry in Egypt was known for being very cultural and state endorsed, specifically to promote Arab filmmakers and censor what was being published in the country. Ateyyat El Abnoudy saw this as a challenge and, as one of the first female filmmakers, she directed her first documentary called ''Horse of Mud'' in ''1971.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19301944.2011.10781405|title=The Physicalities of Documentaries by African Women|last=|first=|date=|website=Taylor &amp; Francis Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; El-Abnoudy further contested the censorship of Egypt filmmakers when she became the first female to establish her own production company, Abnoud Film, supporting small filmmakers similar to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yv1BH5Wz-ekC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Ateyyat+El+Abnoudy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o-swHoo0HB&amp;sig=_mMiXrzGpKQW1ihoeanE0sApHNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjR9oH1t7veAhXzrIMKHZwyAWoQ6AEwBHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ateyyat%20El%20Abnoudy&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers|last=Hillauer|first=Rebecca|date=2005|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=9789774249433|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Her first film, ''Horse of Mud (1971),'' is considered to capture the dignity of Cairo's poorest peoples. This film follows the process of brick-making, a repetitive, painful, yet necessary task. ''Horse of Mud,'' illuminates the struggles of surviving in Cairo as an impoverished person by intertwining brick-makers personal stories to the work they do to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2C2wzBbTzfQC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Horse+of+Mud+El-Abnoudy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqtuiP5rveAhVMqlkKHVyqBCAQ6AEIPjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Horse%20of%20Mud%20El-Abnoudy&amp;f=false|title=French-speaking Women Documentarians: A Guide|last=Pallister|first=Janis L.|last2=Hottell|first2=Ruth A.|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9780820476148|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
[[File:No Smoking.svg|thumb|upright|[[Smoking]] is now [[smoking ban|banned]] in public buildings in many parts of the world.]]
A '''ban''' is a formal or informal [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{OED|ban}}&lt;/ref&gt; of something. Bans are formed for the prohibition of activities within a certain political territory. Some see this as a negative act (equating it to a form of [[censorship]] or [[discrimination]]) and others see it as maintaining the "''[[status quo]]''". Some bans in commerce are referred to as [[embargo]]es. ''Ban'' is also used as a verb similar in meaning to "to prohibit".

==Etymology==
{{see|ban (medieval)}}
In current English usage, ''ban'' is mostly synonymous with ''prohibition''. Historically, Old English ''(ge)bann'' is a derivation from the verb ''bannan'' "to summon, command, proclaim" from an earlier [[Common Germanic]] ''*bannan'' "to command, forbid, banish, curse". The modern sense "to prohibit" is influenced by the cognate [[Old Norse]] ''banna'' "to curse, to prohibit" and also from [[Old French]] ''ban'', ultimately a loan from [[Old Frankish]], meaning "[[outlawry]], banishment".&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The Indo-European etymology of the Germanic term is from a root ''*bha-'' meaning "to speak". Its original meaning was [[magical thinking|magical]], referring to utterances that carried a power to [[curse]].

== Banned political parties ==

In many countries [[political party|political parties]] or groups are banned. Parties may be banned for many reasons, including extremism and anti-democratic ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Issacharoff|first=Samuel|title=Fragile Democracies|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=2007-03-31|volume=120|page=1405}}&lt;/ref&gt; on ethnic or religious grounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogaards|first=Matthijs |author2=Matthias Basedau |author3=Christof Hartmann|title=Ethnic party bans in Africa: an introduction|journal=Democratization|date=2010-07-21|volume=17|issue=4|page=599|doi=10.1080/13510347.2010.491183}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-02-02--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes simply because the group opposes government policies, with the ban sometimes alleging wrongdoing as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/22/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum The Guardian newspaper: Zimbabwe bans political rallies as unrest grows, 22 February 2007]. Example of a ban on political protests declared legal by a court.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]], for instance, has a long history behind its modern practice of banning political parties. The [[Nazi Party]] was banned in 1923; after the Nazi Party came into power in 1933 opposing parties such as the Social Democrats and [[Communist Party]] were banned, the Nazi Party was again banned and the ban on other parties lifted after the Nazi defeat in 1945, and the Communist Party was again banned from 1956 to 1968.

== Banning marriages ==
There have been many bans on marriages, and sometimes other sexual liaisons, between people of different ethnic background or religion, for example between non-Jews and Jews in Nazi Germany, people classified as "white" and non-whites in [[apartheid]] South Africa, etc.

For much of the 1800s and 1900s there were bans on marriage between people of different races ([[interracial marriage]]) in many of the [[United States]]. However, the ban on interracial marriage was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1967 in the landmark [[civil rights]] case ''[[Loving vs. Virginia]]'', in which the Court ruled [[Virginia]]'s [[miscegenation]] law an [[unconstitutional]] violation of the fundamental right to marriage. Historically [[child marriage]] was common, but is now banned in many countries.

== Banned persons ==
{{See also|List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid}}

The [[Imperial ban]] was a form of [[outlaw]]ry in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. At different times, it could be declared by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], by courts including the [[Vehmic court|League of the Holy Court]] ({{lang-de|Vehmgericht}}, {{IPA-de|féːmgəʀɪχt|pron}}) and the {{lang|de|[[Reichskammergericht]]}}, or by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. People under Imperial ban lost all their rights and possessions, and anyone had the right to rob, injure or kill such persons without legal consequences. The Imperial ban automatically followed the [[excommunication]] of a person, and extended to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban.

During the [[apartheid]] régime in [[South Africa]], the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government issued banning orders to individuals seen to be threats to its power — often black politicians or organizations — these banning orders acted as [[suppression order]]s. Individuals banned by the [[Suppression of Communism Act, 1950]] (which effectively defined "Communism" as opposition to the government) could not communicate with more than one person at any time unless at home (thus preventing them from engaging in political activities), travel to areas{{clarify|date=August 2016}} without government approval, or leave the country.

==Censorship==
Existing publications may be banned, and new publications prohibited from discussing certain topics or taking certain viewpoints. [[Censorship]] is the enacting and enforcing of such bans.

==Health and safety==
Bans in various jurisdictions on [[Overview of gun laws by nation|possession of some weapons]], [[Smoking ban|smoking]], and [[Prohibition of drugs|narcotic drugs]] are enacted to exert control over the [[general public]].

{{Tort law}}
In the [[United States]], the '''calculus of negligence''', also known as the '''Hand rule''', '''Hand formula''', or '''BPL formula''', is a term coined by Judge [[Learned Hand]] and describes a process for determining whether a legal duty of care has been breached (see [[negligence]]).  The original description of the calculus was in ''[[United States v. Carroll Towing Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[U.S. v. Carroll Towing]]'', 159 F.2d 169 ([[2d Cir.]] 1947).&lt;/ref&gt; in which an improperly secured [[barge]] had drifted away from a [[pier]] and caused damage to several other boats.

== Articulation of the rule ==
Hand stated:

{{quote|[T]he owner's duty, as in other similar situations, to provide against resulting injuries is a function of three variables: (1) The probability that she will break away; (2) the gravity of the resulting injury, if she does; (3) the burden of adequate precautions.}}

This relationship has been formalized by the [[law and economics]] school as such: an act is in breach of the [[duty of care]] if:

:&lt;math&gt;PL&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B'' is the cost (burden) of taking precautions, and ''P'' is the probability of loss (''L'').  ''L'' is the gravity of loss.  The product of P x L must be a greater amount than B to create a duty of due care for the defendant.

== Rationale ==
The calculus of negligence is based on the [[Coase theorem]].  The tort system acts as if, before the injury or damage, a contract had been made between the parties under the assumption that a [[Rationality|rational]], cost-minimizing individual will not spend money on taking precautions if those precautions are more expensive than the costs of the harm that they prevent.  In other words, rather than spending money on safety, the individual will simply allow harm to occur and pay for the costs of that harm, because that will be more cost-efficient than taking precautions.  This represents cases where B is greater than PL.

If the harm could be avoided for ''less'' than the cost of the harm (B is less than PL), then the individual ''should'' take the precautions, rather than allowing the harm to occur.  If precautions were not taken, we find that a legal duty of care has been breached, and we impose liability on the individual to pay for the harm.

This approach, in theory, leads to an optimal allocation of resources; where harm can be cheaply avoided, the legal system requires precautions.  Where precautions are prohibitively expensive, it does not.  In marginal-cost terms, we require individuals to invest one unit of precautions up until the point that those precautions prevent exactly one unit of harm, and no less.

== Criticism ==
Critics point out that term "gravity of loss (L)" is vague, and could entail a wide variety of damages, from a scratched fender to several dead victims.&lt;ref name="Glannon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glannon |first=Joseph W. |title=The Law of Torts |edition=3rd |year=2005 |publisher=[[Aspen Publishers]] |location=New York, NY |pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even then, on top of that, how exactly a juror should determine a value for such a loss is abstract in itself.  The speculative nature of the rule also seizes upon how a juror should determine the probability of loss (P).&lt;ref name="Glannon"/&gt;

Additionally, the rule fails to account for possible alternatives, whether it be the use of alternate methods to reach the same outcome, or abandoning the risky activity altogether.&lt;ref name="Glannon"/&gt;

Human teams estimating risk need to guard against judgment errors, cf. [[absolute probability judgement]].

== Use in practice ==
In the U.S., juries, with guidance from the court, decide what particular acts or omissions constitute negligence, so a reference to the standard of ordinary care removes the need to discuss this moot "rule". Juries are not told this "rule" but essentially use their common sense to decide what an ordinarily careful person would have done under the circumstances. The "calculus of negligence" has less practical value for the lay researcher seeking to understand how the courts actually determine negligence cases in the United States than the [[jury instructions]] used by the courts in the individual states.

Outside legal proceedings, this rule is the core premise of [[insurance]], [[risk management]], [[quality assurance]], [[information security]] and [[privacy]]{{clarify|date=July 2015}} practices.  It factors into [[due care]] and [[due diligence]] decisions in business risk.  Restrictions exist in the cases where the loss applies to human life or the probability of adverse finding in court cases. One famous case of abuse by industry in recent years related to the [[Ford Pinto]].

Quality assurance techniques extend the use of probability and loss to include uncertainty bounds in each quantity and possible interactions between uncertainty in probability and impact for two purposes.  First, to more accurately model customer acceptance and process reliability to produce wanted outcomes.  Second, to seek cost effective factors either up or down stream of the event that produce better results at sustainably reduced costs.  Example, simply providing a protective rail near a cliff also includes quality manufacture features of the rail as part of the solution.  Reasonable signs warning of the risk before persons reach the cliff may actually be more effective in reducing fatalities than the rail itself.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the calculus of negligence is a normative judgement with no formula or rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|63|2005|litigants=Mulligan v Coffs Harbour City Council |parallelcite=(2005) 223 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 486 |date=21 October 2005 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In NSW, the test is how a reasonable person (or other standard of care) would respond to the risk in the circumstances considering the 'probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken'&lt;ref name="CLA2002"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|5B}}(2)(a).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1998|litigants=Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory |parallelcite=(1998) 192 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 432 |date=2 February 1998 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, 'the likely seriousness of the harm',&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|court=UKHL |year=1950 |num=3 |litigants=[[Paris v Stepney Borough Council]] |parallelcite=[1951] {{abbr|AC|Appeal Cases}} 367 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 'the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm',&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|2002|litigants=Woods v Multi-Sport Holdings Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(2002) [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 460 |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 'social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm'.&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|20|1991|litigants=E v Australian Red Cross Society |parallelcite=(1991) 27 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 310 |date= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; State and Territory legislatures require that the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm be taken into account in determining whether or not a reasonable person would have taken precautions against that risk of harm.&lt;ref name="CLA2002"/&gt; For example, in ''Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited'' &lt;ref name="Haris v Bulldogs"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|53|2006|litigants=Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited |date=17 March 2006 |courtname= auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the court considered the social utility of holding football matches when determining whether a football club took sufficient precautions to protect spectators from the risk of being struck by fireworks set off as part of the entertainment during a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|53|2006|litigants=Haris v Bulldogs Rugby League Club Limited |date=17 March 2006 |courtname= auto}} per Santow JA at [60]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catharsis''' (from Greek {{lang|el|[[wikt:κάθαρσις|κάθαρσις]]}} {{transl|el|''katharsis''}} meaning "purification" or "cleansing") is the purification and purgation of emotions—particularly pity and fear—through art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA217 |title=catharsis |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1995 |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2XgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= | last = Berndtson | first = Arthur | title = Art, Expression, and Beauty | publisher = Krieger | year = 1975 | page = 235|isbn=9780882752174 | quote=The theory of catharsis has a disarming affinity with the expressional theory, since it emphasizes emotion, asserts a change in emotion as a result of aesthetic operations, and concludes on a note of freedom in relation to the emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvZYaJmH6LcC&amp;dq= | title=Looking for an Argument: Critical Encounters with the New Approaches to the Criticism of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries | first=Richard | last=Levin |year=2003 | page=42 | quote=Catharsis in Shakespearean tragedy involves ... some kind of restoration of order and a renewal or enhancement of our positive feelings for the hero.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a metaphor originally used by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]],'' comparing the effects of [[tragedy]] on the mind of a spectator to the effect of a [[cathartic]] on the body.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b 1449b]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99492/catharsis |title=catharsis (criticism) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic uses==
Catharsis is a term in [[drama|dramatic art]] that describes the effect of tragedy (or [[comedy]] and quite possibly other artistic forms)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Catharsis in Healing, Ritual, and Drama | first=Thomas J. | last = Scheff | authorlink=Thomas J. Scheff | isbn=0-595-15237-6|publisher=University of California Press | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally on the audience (although some have speculated on characters in the drama as well). Nowhere does [[Aristotle]] explain the meaning of "catharsis" as he is using that term in the definition of tragedy in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449b21-28). G.&amp;nbsp;F. Else argues that traditional, widely held interpretations of catharsis as "purification" or "purgation" have no basis in the text of the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', but are derived from the use of catharsis in other Aristotelian and non-Aristotelian contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Catharsis | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | first = Leon | last = Golden | volume = 93 | pages = 51–60 | jstor = 283751 | doi = 10.2307/283751}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a number of diverse interpretations of the meaning of this term have arisen. The term is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[anagnorisis]].

D.&amp;nbsp;W. Lucas, in an authoritative edition of the ''Poetics'', comprehensively covers the various nuances inherent in the meaning of the term in an Appendix devoted to "Pity, Fear, and Katharsis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristotle: Poetics|last=Lucas|first=D. W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1977|isbn=978-0198140245|pages=276–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas recognizes the possibility of catharsis bearing some aspect of the meaning of "purification, purgation, and 'intellectual clarification'" although his discussion of these terms is not always, or perhaps often, in the precise form with which other influential scholars have treated them. Lucas himself does not accept any one of these interpretations as his own but adopts a rather different one based on "the Greek doctrine of Humours" which has not received wide subsequent acceptance. Purgation and purification, used in previous centuries, as the common interpretations of catharsis are still in wide use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catharsis in Psychotherapy | first1=Michael P. | last1=Nichols | first2=Melvin | last2=Zax |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, New York|year=1977|isbn=978-0470990643}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the twentieth century, the interpretation of catharsis as "intellectual clarification" has arisen as a rival to the older views in describing the effect of catharsis on members of the audience.

===Purgation and purification===
In his works prior to the ''Poetics,'' Aristotle had used the term ''catharsis'' purely in its medical sense (usually referring to the evacuation of the ''katamenia''—the [[menstrual]] fluid or other reproductive material).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Belifiore | first = Elizabeth S. | title = Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion | page = 300 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, however, he employs it as a medical [[metaphor]].
[[F. L. Lucas]] maintains, therefore, that ''purification'' and ''cleansing'' are not proper translations for ''catharsis''; that it should rather be rendered as ''[[Purgatory|purgation]]''. "It is the human soul that is purged of its excessive passions."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald F. Else made the following argument against the "purgation" theory: "It presupposes that we come to the tragic drama (unconsciously, if you will) as patients to be cured, relieved, restored to psychic health. But there is not a word to support this in the "Poetics", not a hint that the end of drama is to cure or alleviate pathological states. On the contrary it is evident in every line of the work that Aristotle is presupposing 'normal' auditors, normal states of mind and feeling, normal emotional and aesthetic experience."&lt;ref&gt;Else, Gerald F. ''Aristotle's Poetics: The Argument'', p. 440. Cambridge, Massachusetts (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] sidesteps the medical attribution. He translates ''catharsis'' as a purification, an experience that brings pity and fear into their proper balance: "In real life", he explained, "men are sometimes too much addicted to pity or fear, sometimes too little; tragedy brings them back to a virtuous and happy mean."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;23. Hogarth, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;
Tragedy is then a corrective; through watching tragedy, the audience learns how to feel these emotions at proper levels.

===Intellectual clarification===
In the twentieth century a paradigm shift took place in the interpretation of catharsis with a number of scholars contributing to the argument in support of the intellectual clarification concept.&lt;ref&gt;The following works can be usefully consulted in this regard: L. Golden, "Aristotle on Tragic and Comic Mimesis," Atlanta, 1992; S. Halliwell, "Aristotle's Poetics," London, 1986; D. Keesey, "On Some Recent Interpretations of Catharsis, "The Classical World", (1979) 72.4, 193–205.&lt;/ref&gt; The clarification theory of catharsis would be fully consistent, as other interpretations are not, with Aristotle's argument in chapter 4 of the ''Poetics'' (1448b4-17) that the essential pleasure of [[mimesis]] is the intellectual pleasure of "learning and inference".

It is generally understood that Aristotle's theory of mimesis and catharsis are responses to [[Plato]]'s negative view of artistic mimesis on an audience. Plato argued that the most common forms of artistic mimesis were designed to evoke from an audience powerful emotions such as pity, fear, and ridicule which override the rational control that defines the highest level of our humanity and lead us to wallow unacceptably in the overindulgence of emotion and passion. Aristotle's concept of catharsis, in all of the major senses attributed to it, contradicts Plato's view by providing a mechanism that generates the rational control of irrational emotions. All of the commonly held interpretations of catharsis, purgation, purification, and clarification are considered by most scholars to represent a homeopathic process in which pity and fear accomplish the catharsis of emotions like themselves. For an alternate view of catharsis as an [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] process in which pity and fear produce a catharsis of emotions unlike pity and fear, see E. Belfiore, ''Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion.'' Princeton, 1992, 260 ff.

===Literary analysis of catharsis===
The following analysis by [[E. R. Dodds]], directed at the character of [[Oedipus]] in the paradigmatic Aristotelian tragedy, ''[[Oedipus Rex]],'' incorporates all three of the aforementioned interpretations of catharsis: purgation, purification, intellectual clarification:{{quote|...what fascinates us is the spectacle of a man freely choosing, from the highest motives a series of actions which lead to his own ruin. Oedipus might have left the plague to take its course; but pity for the sufferings of his people compelled him to consult Delphi. When Apollo's word came back, he might still have left the murder of Laius uninvestigated; but piety and justice required him to act. He need not have forced the truth from the reluctant Theban herdsman; but because he cannot rest content with a lie, he must tear away the last veil from the illusion in which he has lived so long. Teiresias, Jocasta, the herdsman, each in turn tries to stop him, but in vain; he must read the last riddle, the riddle of his own life. The immediate cause of Oedipus' ruin is not "fate or "the gods"—no oracle said that he must discover the truth—and still less does it lie in his own weakness; what causes his ruin is his own strength and courage, his loyalty to Thebes, and his loyalty to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=E. R. | last=Dodds | authorlink=E. R. Dodds | title=On Misunderstanding the 'Oedipus Rex' | journal=Greece and Rome |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1966 |pages=37–49 |jstor=642354 | doi=10.1017/s0017383500016144}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Attempts to subvert catharsis===
There have been, for political or aesthetic reasons, deliberate attempts made to subvert the effect of catharsis in theatre.
For example, [[Bertolt Brecht]] viewed catharsis as a pap (pabulum) for the [[bourgeois]] theatre audience, and designed dramas which left significant emotions unresolved, intending to force social action upon the audience. Brecht then identified the concept of catharsis with the notion of identification of the spectator, meaning a complete adhesion of the viewer to the dramatic actions and characters. Brecht reasoned that the absence of a cathartic resolution would require the audience to take political action in the real world, in order to fill the emotional gap they had experienced vicariously. This technique can be seen as early as his [[agit-prop]] play ''[[The Measures Taken]],'' and is mostly the source of his invention of an ''epic theatre'', based on a [[distancing effect]] (Verfremdungseffekt) between the viewer and the representation or portrayal of characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht, Bertold]], "La dramaturgie non aristotélicienne", ''Théâtre épique, théâtre dialectique'', éd. Jean-Marie Valentin, Paris, Éditions de L'Arche, 1999, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=="Catharsis" before tragedy==
Catharsis before the sixth-century rise of tragedy is, for the [[Western World]], essentially a historical footnote to the Aristotelian conception. The practice of [[Ritual purification|purification]] had not yet appeared in [[Homer]], as later Greek commentators noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter | last = Burkert | authorlink = Walter Burkert | year = 1992 | title = The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age | page = 56 | publisher = Harvard University Press | ref=harv}} This sub-section depends largely on Burkert.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Aithiopis]]'', an [[epic (poetry)|epic]] set in the [[Epic Cycle|Trojan War cycle]], narrates the purification of [[Achilles]] after his murder of [[Thersites]]. Catharsis describes the result of measures taken to cleanse away blood-guilt—"blood is purified through blood",{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=56}} a process in the development of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] culture in which the [[Delphi|oracle of Delphi]] took a prominent role. The classic example—[[Orestes]]—belongs to tragedy, but the procedure given by [[Aeschylus]] is ancient: the blood of a sacrificed piglet is allowed to wash over the blood-polluted man, and running water washes away the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert notes parallels with a bilingual [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ritual text: "the knowledgeable specialist, the sacrificial piglet, slaughter, contact with blood, and the subsequent cleansing with water" {{harvtxt|Burkert|1992|page=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The identical ritual is represented, Burkert informs us, on a ''[[krater]]'' found at Canicattini, wherein it is shown being employed to cure the daughters of [[Proetus]] from their madness, caused by some ritual transgression.{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}} To the question of whether the ritual obtains [[atonement (penal substitution view)|atonement]] for the subject, or just [[healing]], Burkert answers: "To raise the question is to see the irrelevance of this distinction".{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}}

==Therapeutic uses==&lt;!-- 'Cathartic method' redirects here --&gt;
In [[psychology]], the term was first employed by [[Sigmund Freud]]'s colleague [[Josef Breuer]] (1842–1925), who developed a '''cathartic method'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of treatment using [[hypnosis]] for persons suffering from intensive [[hysteria]]. While under hypnosis, Breuer's patients were able to recall [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] experiences, and through the process of expressing the original emotions that had been repressed and forgotten, they were relieved of their hysteric symptoms. Catharsis was also central to Freud's concept of [[psychoanalysis]], but he replaced hypnosis with [[Free association (psychology)|free association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Strickland | editor-first=Bonnie | editor-link=Bonnie Strickland | title=Catharsis | publisher=Gale | year=2001 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[cathexis|catharsis]]'' has also been adopted by modern [[psychotherapy]], particularly Freudian psychoanalysis, to describe the act of expressing, or more accurately, ''experiencing'' the deep emotions often associated with events in the individual's past which had originally been repressed or ignored, and had never been adequately addressed or experienced.

There has been much debate about the use of catharsis in the reduction of anger. Some scholars believe that "blowing off steam" may reduce physiological stress in the short term, but this reduction may act as a reward mechanism, reinforcing the behavior and promoting future outbursts.&lt;ref name="Bushman1999"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.367 | title = Catharsis, aggression, and persuasive influence: self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecies? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | date = March 1999 | first = B.

== Social catharsis ==
Emotional situations can elicit physiological, behavioral, cognitive, expressive, and subjective changes in individuals. Affected individuals often use social sharing as a cathartic release of emotions. Bernard Rimé studies the patterns of social sharing after emotional experiences. His works suggest that individuals seek social outlets in an attempt to modify the situation and restore personal homeostatic balance.

Rimé found that 80–95% of emotional episodes are shared. The affected individuals talk about the emotional experience recurrently to people around them throughout the following hours, days, or weeks. These results indicate that this response is irrespective of emotional valence, gender, education, and culture. His studies also found that social sharing of emotion increases as the intensity of the emotion increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotion Elicits the Social Sharing of Emotion: Theory and Empirical Review|journal = Emotion Review|year=2009|issn = 1754-0739|pages = 60–85|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1754073908097189|first = Bernard|last = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages ===
[[Émile Durkheim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The elementary forms of the religious life, a study in religious sociology | last = Durkheim | first = Émile |url = https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durk | publisher = George Allen &amp; Unwin | translator-first = Joseph Ward | translator-last = Swain | year = 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed emotional stages of social sharing:
# Directly after emotional effects, the emotions are shared. Through sharing, there is a reciprocal stimulation of emotions and emotional communion.
# This leads to social effects like social integration and strengthening of beliefs.
# Finally, individuals experience a renewed trust in life, strength, and self-confidence.

=== Motives ===
Affect scientists have found differences in motives for social sharing of positive and negative emotions.

'''(1) Positive emotion'''

A study by Langston&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Capitalizing on and coping with daily-life events: Expressive responses to positive events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 1112–1125|volume = 67|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1112|first = Christopher A.|last = Langston}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that individuals share positive events to capitalize on the positive emotions they elicit. Reminiscing the positive experience augments positive affects like temporary mood and longer-term well-being. A study by Gable et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do You Do When Things Go Right? The Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Benefits of Sharing Positive Events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 228–245|volume = 87|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228|first = Shelly L.|last = Gable|first2 = Harry T.|last2 = Reis|first3 = Emily A.|last3 = Impett|first4 = Evan R.|last4 = Asher|pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed Langston's "capitalization" theory by demonstrating that relationship quality is enhanced when partners are responsive to positive recollections. The responsiveness increased levels of intimacy and satisfaction within the relationship. In general, the motives behind social sharing of positive events are to recall the positive emotions, inform others, and gain attention from others. All three motives are representatives of capitalization.

'''(2) Negative emotion'''

Rimé studies suggest that the motives behind social sharing of negative emotions are to vent, understand, bond, and gain social support. Negatively affected individuals often seek life meaning and emotional support to combat feelings of loneliness after a tragic event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The grapevine effect ===
If emotions are shared socially and elicits emotion in the listener then the listener will likely share what they heard with other people. Rimé calls this process "secondary social sharing". If this repeats, it is then called "tertiary social sharing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collective catharsis ===
Collective emotional events share similar responses. When communities are affected by an emotional event, members repetitively share emotional experiences. After the 2001 New York and the 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks, more than 80% of respondents shared their emotional experience with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social sharing of emotion, post-traumatic growth, and emotional climate: Follow-up of Spanish citizen's response to the collective trauma of March 11th terrorist attacks in Madrid| journal = European Journal of Social Psychology| year=2009|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 1029–1045|volume = 40|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.700|first = Bernard|last = Rimé|first2 = Darío|last2 = Páez|first3 = Nekane|last3 = Basabe|first4 = Francisco|last4 = Martínez}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rimé, every sharing round elicits emotional reactivation in the sender and the receiver. This then reactivates the need to share in both. Social sharing throughout the community leads to high amounts of emotional recollection and "emotional overheating".

Pennebaker and Harber&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Social Stage Model of Collective Coping: The Loma Prieta Earthquake and The Persian Gulf War|journal = Journal of Social Issues | year = 1993 |issn = 1540-4560|pages = 125–145|volume = 49|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb01184.x|first = James W.|last = Pennebaker|first2 = Kent D.|last2 = Harber}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined three stages of collective responses to emotional events.

In the first stage, a state of "emergency" takes place in the first month after the emotional event. In this stage, there is an abundance of thoughts, talks, media coverage, and social integration based on the event.

In the second stage, the "plateau" occurs in the second month. Abundant thoughts remain, but the amount of talks, media coverage, and social integration decreases.

In the third stage, the "extinction" occurs after the second month. There is a return to normalcy.

=== Effect on emotional recovery ===
This cathartic release of emotions is often believed to be therapeutic for affected individuals. Many therapeutic mechanisms have been seen to aid in emotional recovery. One example is "interpersonal emotion regulation", in which listeners help to modify the affected individual's affective state by using certain strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Social Regulation of Emotion: An Integrative, Cross-Disciplinary Model|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=20|issue=1|pages=47–63|year=2016|issn = 1879-307X|pmid = 26564248|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2015.09.003|first = Crystal|last = Reeck|first2 = Daniel R.|last2 = Ames|first3 = Kevin N.|last3 = Ochsner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive writing is another common mechanism for catharsis. Joanne Frattaroli&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental disclosure and its moderators: A meta-analysis|journal = Psychological Bulletin|pages = 823–865|volume = 132|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.823|first = Joanne|last = Frattaroli}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a meta-analysis suggesting that written disclosure of information, thoughts, and feelings enhances mental health.

However, other studies question the benefits of social catharsis. Finkenauer and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Flashbulb memories and the underlying mechanisms of their formation: Toward an emotional-integrative model|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1998|issn = 0090-502X|pages = 516–531|volume = 26|issue = 3|doi = 10.3758/BF03201160|first = Catrin|last = Finkenauer|first2 = Olivier|last2 = Luminet|first3 = Lydia|last3 = Gisle|first4 = Abdessadek|last4 = El-Ahmadi|first5 = Martial Van Der|last5 = Linden|first6 = Pierre|last6 = Philippot|pmid=9610122}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that non-shared memories were no more emotionally triggering than shared ones. Other studies have also failed to prove that social catharsis leads to any degree of emotional recovery. Zech and Rimé&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is talking about an emotional experience helpful? effects on emotional recovery and perceived benefits|journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|year = 2005|issn = 1099-0879|pages = 270–287|volume = 12|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/cpp.460|first = Emmanuelle|last = Zech|first2 = Bernard|last2 = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked participants to recall and share a negative experience with an experimenter. When compared with the control group that only discussed unemotional topics, there was no correlation between emotional sharing and emotional recovery.

Some studies even found adverse effects of social catharsis. Contrary to the Frattaroli study, Sbarra and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Expressive Writing Can Impede Emotional Recovery Following Marital Separation|url = http://cpx.sagepub.com/content/1/2/120|journal = Clinical Psychological Science|year = 2013|issn = 2167-7026|pmc = 4297672|pmid = 25606351|pages = 120–134|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/2167702612469801|first = David A.|last = Sbarra|first2 = Adriel|last2 = Boals|first3 = Ashley E.|last3 = Mason|first4 = Grace M.|last4 = Larson|first5 = Matthias R.|last5 = Mehl}}&lt;/ref&gt; found expressive writing to greatly impede emotional recovery following a marital separation. Similar findings have been published regarding trauma recovery. A group intervention technique is often used on disaster victims to prevent trauma-related disorders. However, meta-analysis showed negative effects of this cathartic "therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Single session debriefing after psychological trauma: a meta-analysis|journal = Lancet|year = 2002|issn = 0140-6736|pmid = 12241834|pages = 766–771|volume = 360|issue = 9335|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09897-5|first = Arnold A.

'''Causation in English law''' concerns the legal tests of [[Remoteness (law)|remoteness]], causation and foreseeability in the [[tort]] of negligence. It is also relevant for [[English criminal law]] and [[English contract law]].

In the [[English law]] of [[negligence]], '''causation''' proves a direct link between the [[defendant]]’s [[negligence]] and the [[claimant]]’s loss and damage. For these purposes, liability in [[negligence]] is established when there is a [[breach of duty in English law|breach]] of the [[duty of care in English law|duty of care]] owed by the defendant to the claimant that '''causes''' loss and damage, and it is reasonable that the defendant should compensate the [[claimant]] for that loss and damage. 

==Public policy==
Policy at this level is less than [[public policy (law)|''ordre public'']], but nevertheless significant.  The policy is to give bound to the scope of people who can claim damages, how much they can claim, and within what timeframe.

The claimant must prove that the breach of the duty of care caused actionable damage. The test for these purposes is a balance between proximity and remoteness: 
*that there was a factual link between what the defendant did or failed to do, and the loss and damage sustained by the claimant, and
*that it was reasonably foreseeable at the relevant time that this behaviour would cause loss and damage of that type. 
To clarify the nature of the judicial process, in ''Lamb v Camden LBC'' (1981) QB 625, [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] said:
:"The truth is that all these three – duty, remoteness and causation – are all devices by which the courts limit the range of liability for negligence . . .  All these devices are useful in their way. But ultimately it is a question of policy for the judges to decide." 
In other words, the court's main task is to do [[justice]] as between these [[party (law)|parties]] in their present situation. For this purpose, a weighing evaluative process is required, rather than a clear-cut rule of law. For example, in ''Meah v McCreamer and others (No. 2)'' (1986) 1 AER 943, the claimant suffered head injuries and brain damage as a result of the defendant's negligent driving, which led to a [[personality disorder]]. Four years later, he sexually assaulted and raped three women. The illegal nature of his conduct was not raised at the [[trial (law)|civil trial]], and the claimant was held entitled to [[damages]] to compensate him for being imprisoned following his [[conviction (law)|conviction]]. In separate proceedings, the three women assaulted obtained a judgment for compensation, so he sought indemnification from the negligent driver and his insurers for the amounts he had been ordered to pay. This was not a claim for his own personal injuries nor direct financial loss, but indirect loss. The three women could not have sued the driver directly because they were not foreseeable and so no duty of care was owed to them. The question was whether a person convicted of a crime was entitled to be indemnified against the consequences of that crime. Woolf J. held that the action would be dismissed on two grounds. First, the damages were too remote to be recoverable and, if such actions were to be allowed, it would leave insurers open to indefinite liability for an indefinite duration. Secondly, as a matter of policy, defendants should not have a right to be indemnified against the consequences of their crimes. In ''Clunis v Camden and Islington Health Authority'' (1998) QB 978 the claimant had been discharged from hospital where he had been detained under s3 Mental Health Act 1983. He was to receive aftercare services in the community under s117 Act 1983, but his mental condition deteriorated and, two months later, he fatally stabbed a stranger at a London Underground station. He pleaded guilty to [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] on the ground of [[diminished responsibility in English law|diminished responsibility]] and was ordered to be detained in a secure hospital. Subsequently, he brought an action against his local health authority for negligence. The health authority applied to strike out the claim as disclosing no cause of action on two grounds. First, that the claim arose out of the health authority's statutory obligations under s117 Act 1983 and those obligations did not give rise to a common law duty of care. Secondly, that the claim was based on the plaintiff's own criminal act. In the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the health authority's appeal was allowed on both grounds.

==The factual test of causation==
The basic test for establishing causation is the "but-for" test in which the defendant will be liable only if the claimant’s damage would not have occurred "but for" his negligence. Alternatively, the defendant will not be liable if the damage would, or could on the [[balance of probabilities]], have occurred anyway, regardless of his or her negligence. To understand this, a distinction has to be made between cause and a precondition for the events. Lord Hoffmann in ''[[South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;''(SAAMCO)'' [1997] AC 191, 214&lt;/ref&gt; gave a classic example.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A mountaineer about to undertake a difficult climb is concerned about the fitness of his knee. He goes to a doctor who negligently makes a superficial examination and pronounces the knee fit. The climber goes on the expedition, which he would not have undertaken if the doctor had told him the true state of his knee. He suffers an injury which is an entirely foreseeable consequence of mountaineering but has nothing to do with his knee."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The doctor's negligence does result in the mountaineer running a risk which he otherwise would not have done, but this is insufficient to incur liability. The purpose of the doctor's duty to take care is to protect the mountaineer against injuries caused by the failure of the knee, not rock falls. Even though the injury might be reasonably foreseeable, the doctor is not liable. In ''The Empire Jamaica'' (1955) 1 AER 452, the owners sent their ship to sea without properly licensed officers. The pilot fell asleep, and a collision occurred. Though the pilot was negligent at the time, he was generally competent. Thus the question for the courts was: were the owners liable for the collision because they sent their ship to sea without properly licensed officers? Or was the factual precondition superseded by the question as to the competence of the pilot? There is no question that sending the ship to sea is "a cause" of the collision. The legal question is whether it is "the cause". This is a question that the courts treat as objective, addressed by evidence and argument. [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] and [[Tony Honoré|Honoré]] (1985) describe the process for establishing legal causation as constructing a parallel series of events (counterfactual situation), and comment: "the parallel series is constructed by asking what the course of events would have been had the defendant acted lawfully." Thus, the owners were not liable. Although they sent the ship to sea without licensed officers (what actually transpired) rather than with licensed officers (the lawful course), the cause of collision was failing to navigate a safe passage. As to the pilot, his lack of licence did not bear on his general competence. The significant factor was the pilot's negligence at the time, and the pilot's lack of license made no difference there. Had the pilot been licensed, he would have been no less likely to sleep. The license would not have awoken him. The owners were, therefore, exonerated on grounds that whether or not the pilot held a license made no difference to the real cause, which was not the pilot's general level of competence, but rather his negligence at the time.

Similarly, in ''[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2006/93.html Christopher Andrews v Barnett Waddingham LLP and RAJ Waddingham]'' (2006) EWCA Civ 93, the claimant transferred from a "safe" employer's pension scheme to a commercial scheme on the advice of a firm of financial advisers. The breach of duty alleged was confined to advice about the protection afforded by the Policyholders Protection Act 1975 to "with-profits" annuities, and this duty was found to be breached by the first instance judge. The claimant would not have chosen the Equitable Life with-profits annuity if he had been given correct advice, but that did not entitle him to recover the loss he had sustained as a result of his acquiring the annuity. The 1975 Act would have applied if Equitable Life had become insolvent. That was not the case. The real cause of the loss was that the terminal bonuses were not guaranteed and were adversely affected by the downturn in Equitable Life's fortunes. So the negligence as pleaded and as found by the judge did not relate to the fact that the terminal bonuses were not guaranteed.

In ''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1998/25.html Pickford v Imperial Chemical Industries]''  (1998) 1 WLR 1189 the Lords were asked to determine the cause of [[repetitive strain injury]] in a typist. [[Johan Steyn, Baron Steyn|Lord Steyn]] posed the question, "That immediately raises the point that there must be an explanation for the fact that she contracted PDA4. What was the cause of her PDA4? There really was no alternative on the evidence to concluding that this condition was caused by Miss Pickford's typing work." But alternative explanations are that typing might aggravate an inherent condition or generally be an unsuitable occupation for someone with a predisposition to that condition, and neither proves the legal cause. In all cases, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the claimant to prove the cause as [[pleadings|pleaded]]. There is no burden on the defendant to prove an alternative explanation of the cause of any loss or damage, but a failure to do so may be a factor in deciding whether the claimant's explanation of the cause should be accepted. This test works well in straightforward situations, but it proves less successful in establishing causation in more complex situations where a number of actual or potential causes operate either consecutively or concurrently. For example, in ''[[Robinson v Post Office]]'' (1974) 1 WLR 1176 following an accident at work, the claimant had an anti-tetanus injection. Nine days later, there was an adverse reaction to the serum and brain damage resulted. No matter what tests the doctor might have performed, there would have been no sign of an adverse reaction within a reasonable time (see the [[Bolam Test]]). The doctor's reasonable decision to provide the standard treatment was therefore not the relevant cause of the brain damage because the claimant would not have been injected "but for" the defendant's negligence. Thus, in deciding between sequential contributions to the final result, the court must decide which is the more substantial contribution.

==Breaking the chain of causation==
{{main|Breaking the chain}}

===Acts of a third party===
Whether the acts of a third party break the chain of causation depends on whether the intervention was foreseeable. The general rule is that the original defendant will be held responsible for harm caused by a third party as a direct result of his or her negligence, provided it was a highly likely consequence. So, for example, where the defendant has control over the third party, or where the third party is faced with a dilemma created by the defendant, the chain of causation is unlikely to be broken and the defendant will normally be liable to the claimant for the damage caused: ''[[Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co Ltd.]]'' [1970] AC 1004. The continuity of liability is not imposed merely because the original negligence makes damage by the third party foreseeable, but where the defendant’s negligence makes it very likely that the third party will cause damage to the claimant: ''[[Lamb v. Camden LBC]]'' [1981] QB 625. In practice, however, the requirement that the third party intervention will usually break the chain and, at the very least, the liability to pay compensation representing the totality of the loss or damage will be apportioned between the two or more tortfeasors. So, for example, if A injures V, it is foreseeable that an ambulance will be called, that paramedics will lift and carry V, and that there will be a journey back to the hospital. This cycle of intervention is continued in the hospital. None of this activity affecting V would arise "but for" the original negligence so A will remain liable unless and until either an unforeseeable B intervenes (e.g. negligently drives his car and collides with the ambulance), or a paramedic or member of the hospital staff is so seriously negligent that it becomes a new cause of action.

==Loss of a chance== 
{{main|Loss of chance in English law}}
In loss of chance cases, the court is invited to assess hypothetical outcomes, either affecting the claimant or a third party where the defendant's negligence deprived the claimant of the opportunity to obtain a benefit or avoid a loss. Although it has been relatively unsuccessful in cases of medical negligence, it does provide a remedy in [[professional negligence]] generally.

==Loss of a right==
{{main|Loss of right in English law}}
Recent medical negligence cases suggest tacit recognition of a more rights-based approach to damage.

==Causation: law and science compared==

Science and law have different functions but share striking similarities. Both purport to provide rational, reasoned, independent, unbiased processes concerned with the objective assessment of evidence. There are also striking differences. Scientific assertions compared with determinations of legal causation have the following characteristics:
* they are population-based, not individual; general not particular;
* they are probabilistic, not deterministic;
* they are generally expressed as the refutation of the hypothesis and not a finding of fact or proof of an allegation;
* the evidence is not exhaustive, whereas an adjudication is determined according to the evidence available.
The major distinction between legal determinations and scientific assertions lies in the concept of certainty. The legal concept of causation is deterministic: it is an expression of the fiction of certainty, an absolute concept. The scientific concept of causation is probabilistic: it is an expression of the uncertainty of truth, an asymptotic concept.

Picking the red pill would result in the truth of Neo's world being revealed to him, while picking the blue pill would allow him to continue in [[ignorance]]. Thus, Neo must judge the merits of the possible outcomes of his choice.]]

'''Choice''' involves [[decision making]]. It can include [[judging]] the merits of multiple [[wikt:option|option]]s and [[wikt:select|select]]ing one or more of them. One can make a choice between imagined options ("What would I do if...?") or between real options followed by the corresponding action. For example, a traveller might choose a route for a journey based on the [[preference]] of arriving at a given destination as soon as possible. The preferred (and therefore chosen) route can then follow from information such as the length of each of the possible routes, traffic conditions, etc.  The arrival at a choice can include more complex motivators such as [[cognition]], [[instinct]], and [[feeling]].

Simple choices might include what to eat for dinner or what to wear on a Saturday morning – choices that have relatively low-impact on the chooser's [[personal life|life]] overall.  More complex choices might involve (for example) what candidate to vote for in an election, what profession to pursue, a life partner, etc. – choices based on multiple influences and having larger ramifications.

Freedom of choice is generally cherished, whereas a severely limited or artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing, and possibly an unsatisfactory outcome. In contrast, a choice with excessively numerous options may lead to confusion, regret of the alternatives not taken, and indifference in an unstructured existence;&lt;ref&gt;
Barry Schwartz: ''[[The Paradox of Choice]]'' (2004)
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the illusion that choosing an object or a course, necessarily leads to the control of that object or course, can cause [[psychological]] problems.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Types==
There are four main types of decisions, although they can be expressed in different ways. [[Brian Tracy]] breaks them down into:&lt;ref&gt;''Time Power'', Brian Tracy, 2007, pg. 153 {{ISBN|0-8144-7470-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Command decisions, which can only be made by you, as the "Commander in Chief"; or owner of a company.
# Delegated decisions, which may be made by anyone, such as the [[color of the bike shed]], and should be delegated, as the decision must be made but the choice is inconsequential.
# Avoided decisions, where the outcome could be so severe that the choice should not be made, as the consequences can not be recovered from if the wrong choice is made. This will most likely result in negative actions, such as death.
# "No-brainer" decisions, where the choice is so obvious that only one choice can reasonably be made.
A fifth type, however, or fourth if avoided and "no-brainer" decisions are combined as one type, is the [[collaborative]] decision, which should be made in consultation with, and by agreement of others. Collaborative Decision Making revolutionized air-traffic safety by not deferring to the [[Pilot in command|captain]] when a lesser crew member becomes aware of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm.fly.faa.gov/|title=CDM CDM - Collaborative Decision Making|author=|date=|website=cdm.fly.faa.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of looking at decisions focuses on the thought mechanism used, is the decision:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/types-of-decision-making.html|title=Types of decision making - an overview|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rational
* Intuitive
* Recognition based
* Combination

Recognizing that "type" is an imprecise term, an alternate way to classify types of choices is to look at outcomes and the impacted entity. For example, using this approach three types of choices would be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-solutions.com/types_of_decision_making.html|title=Types of Decision Making|work=decision-making-solutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Business 
* Personal
* Consumer

In this approach, establishing the types of choices makes it possible to identify the related decisions that will influence and constrain a specific choice as well as be influenced and constrained by another choice.

There are many "executive decision maker" products available, such as the decision wheels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decision-making-confidence.com/decision-wheels.html|title=A variety of decision wheels!|work=decision-making-confidence.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Magic 8-Ball]], which randomly produce yes/no or other "decisions" for someone who cannot make up their mind or just wants to delegate.

A [[ouija]] board is also a delegated decision.

As a moral principle, decisions should be made by those most affected by the decision, but this is not normally applied to persons in jail, who might likely make a decision other than to remain in jail.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethical leadership in schools'', Kenneth A. Strike, 2006, pg. 5 {{ISBN|1-4129-1351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Gates]] cited this principle in allowing photographs of returning war dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/02/pentagon_report.html|title=Pentagon ends photo ban on war dead return|author=|date=|website=boston.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluability in economics==
When choosing between options one must make judgments about the quality of each option's attributes. For example, if one is choosing between candidates for a job, the quality of relevant attributes such as previous work experience, college or high school GPA, and letters of recommendation will be judged for each option and the decision will likely be based on these attribute judgments. However, each attribute has a different level of ''evaluability'', that is, the extent to which one can use information from that attribute to make a judgment.

An example of a highly evaluable attribute is the SAT score. It is widely known in the United States that an SAT score below 800 is very bad while an SAT score above 1500 is exceptionally good. Because the distribution of scores on this attribute is relatively well known it is a highly evaluable attribute. Compare the SAT score to a poorly evaluable attribute, such as the number of hours spent doing homework. Most employers would not know what 10,000 hours spent doing homework means because they have no idea of the distribution of scores of potential workers in the population on this attribute.

As a result, evaluability can cause preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations. For example, Hsee, [[George Loewenstein]], Blount &amp; Bazerman (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Hsee, C.K., Loewenstein, G.F., Blount, S., Bazerman, M.H. (1999). Preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations of option: A review and theoretical analysis. Psychological Bulletin 125(5), 576–590.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at how people choose between options when they are directly compared because they are presented at the same time or when they cannot be compared because one is only given a single option. The canonical example is a hiring decision made about two candidates being hired for a programming job. Subjects in an experiment were asked to give a starting salary to two candidates, Candidate J and Candidate S. However, some viewed both candidates at the same time (joint evaluation), whereas others only viewed one candidate (separate evaluation). Candidate J had experience of 70 KY programs, and a GPA of 2.5, whereas Candidate S had experience of 10 KY programs and a GPA of 3.9. The results showed that in joint evaluation both candidates received roughly the same starting salary from subjects, who apparently thought a low GPA but high experience was approximately equal to a high GPA but low experience. However, in the separate evaluation, subjects paid Candidate S, the one with the high GPA, substantially more money. The explanation for this is that KY programs is an attribute that is difficult to evaluate and thus people cannot base their judgment on this attribute in separate evaluation.

Personal factors determine food choice. They are [[preference]], [[association (psychology)|associations]], [[habit (psychology)|habits]], [[ethnic heritage]], [[tradition]], [[value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[social pressure]], [[emotion|emotional comfort]], [[availability]], [[convenience]], [[economy]], [[image]], [[medical conditions]], and [[nutrition]].

==Number of options and paradox==
A number of research studies in economic psychology have focused on how individual behavior differs when the choice set size (the number of choices to choose from) is low versus when it is high. Of particular interest is whether individuals are more likely to purchase a product from a large versus a small choice set. Currently, the effect of choice set size on the probability of a purchase is unclear. In some cases, large choice set sizes discourage individuals from making a choice&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar and Lepper.&lt;/ref&gt; and in other cases it either encourages them or has no effect.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Norwood, Lusk, Arunachalam, and Henneberry.&lt;/ref&gt; One study compared the allure of more choice to the tyranny of too much choice. Individuals went virtual shopping in different stores that had a randomly determined set of choices ranging from 4 to 16, with some being good choices and some being bad. Researchers found a stronger effect for the allure of more choice. However, they speculate that due to random assignment of number of choices and goodness of those choices, many of the shops with fewer choices included zero or only one option that was reasonably good, which may have made it easier to make an acceptable choice when more options were available.&lt;ref&gt;White, C. M., &amp; Hoffrage, U. (2009). Testing the tyranny of too much choice against the allure of more choice. Psychology &amp; Marketing, 26(3), 280-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that while greater choice has the potential to improve a person's welfare, sometimes there is such a thing as too much choice. For example, in one experiment involving a choice of free soda, individuals explicitly requested to choose from six as opposed to 24 sodas, where the only benefit from the smaller choice set would be to reduce the cognitive burden of the choice.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A recent study supports this research, finding that human services workers indicated preferences for scenarios with limited options over extensive-options scenarios. As the number of choices within the extensive-options scenarios increased, the preference for limited options increased as well.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, D. D., DiGennaro Reed, F. D., Chok, J., &amp; Brozyna, G. A. (2011). The 'tyranny of choice': Choice overload as a possible instance of effort discounting. The Psychological Record, 61(4), 547-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to explain why choice can demotivate someone from a purchase have focuses on two factors. One assumes that perusing a larger number of choices imposes a cognitive burden on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood&lt;/ref&gt; The other assumes that individuals can experience [[regret (emotion)|regret]] if they make a suboptimal choice, and sometimes avoid making a choice to avoid experiencing regret.&lt;ref&gt;Irons and Hepburn.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research has expanded on [[choice overload]], suggesting that there is a [[paradox of choice]]. As increasing options are available, three problems emerge. First, there is the issue of gaining adequate information about the choices in order to make a decision. Second, having more choices leads to an escalation of expectation. When there are increased options, people’s standards for what is an acceptable outcome rise; in other words, choice “spoils you.” Third, with many options available, people may come to believe they are to blame for an unacceptable result because with so many choices, they should have been able to pick the best one. If there is one choice available, and it ends up being disappointing, the world can be held accountable. When there are many options and the choice that one makes is disappointing, the individual is responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (2000). Self-determination: The tyranny of freedom. American Psychologist, 55(1), 79-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a recent meta-analysis of the literature on choice overload calls such studies into question (Scheibehenne, Greigeneder, and Todd, 2010). In many cases, researchers have found no effect of choice set size on people's beliefs, feelings, and behavior. Indeed, overall, the effect of "too many options" is minimal at best.

While it might be expected that it is preferable to keep one’s options open, research has shown that having the opportunity to revise one’s decisions leaves people less satisfied with the decision outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Daniel T., Ebert, Jane E. J. (2002). Decisions and revisions: The affective forecasting of changeable outcomes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 82(4). 503-14.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study found that participants experienced higher regret after having made a reversible decision. The results suggest that reversible decisions cause people to continue to think about the still relevant choice options, which might increase dissatisfaction with the decision and regret.&lt;ref&gt;Bullens, L., van Harreveld, F., &amp; Förster, J. (2011). Keeping one's options open: The detrimental consequences of decision reversibility. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 47(4), 800-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual personality plays a significant role in how individuals deal with large choice set sizes. Psychologists have developed a personality test that determines where an individual lies on the satisficer-maximizer spectrum. A maximizer is one who always seeks the very best option from a choice set, and may anguish after the choice is made as to whether it was indeed the best. Satisficers may set high standards but are content with a good choice, and place less priority on making the best choice. Due to this different approach to decision-making, maximizers are more likely to avoid making a choice when the choice set size is large, probably to avoid the anguish associated with not knowing whether their choice was optimal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; One study looked at whether the differences in choice satisfaction between the two are partially due to a difference in willingness to commit to one’s choices. It found that maximizers reported a stronger preference for retaining the ability to revise choices. Additionally, after making a choice to buy a poster, satisficers offered higher ratings of their chosen poster and lower ratings of the rejected alternatives. Maximizers, however, were less likely to change their impressions of the posters after making their choice which left them less satisfied with their decision.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, E. A., Ehrlinger, J., &amp; Eibach, R. P. (2012). Failing to commit: Maximizers avoid commitment in a way that contributes to reduced satisfaction. Personality And Individual Differences, 52(1), 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximizers are less happy in life, perhaps due to their obsession with making optimal choices in a society where people are frequently confronted with choice.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Barry&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that maximizers reported significantly less [[life satisfaction]], happiness, optimism, and self-esteem, and significantly more regret and depression, than did satisficers. In regards to buying products, maximizers were less satisfied with consumer decisions and were more regretful. They were also more likely to engage in social comparison, where they analyze their relative social standing among their peers, and to be more affected by social comparisons in which others appeared to be in higher standing than them. For example, maximizers who saw their peer solve puzzles faster than themselves expressed greater doubt about their own abilities and showed a larger increase in negative mood.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B., Ward, A., Monterosso, J., Lyubomirsky, S., White, K., &amp; Lehman, D. R. (2002). Maximizing versus satisficing: Happiness is a matter of choice. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(5) 1178-97.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, people who refrain from taking better choices through drugs or other forms of escapism tend to be much happier in life.

Others{{Who|date=May 2013}} say that there is never too much choice and that there is a difference between happiness and satisfaction: a person who tries to find better decisions will often be dissatisfied, but not necessarily unhappy since his attempts at finding better choices did improve his lifestyle (even if it wasn't the ''best decision'' he will continually try to ''incrementally improve'' the decisions he takes).

[[Choice architecture]] is the process of encouraging people to make good choices through grouping and ordering the decisions in a way that maximizes successful choices and minimizes the number of people who become so overwhelmed by complexity that they abandon the attempt to choose.  Generally, success is improved by presenting the smaller or simpler choices first, and by choosing and promoting sensible default options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sheena Iyengar |title=The Art of Choosing |publisher=Twelve |location= |year=2010 |pages=208–213 |isbn=0-446-50410-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to identity==
[[File:Headresser.jpg|thumb|Choosing a hairstyle.]]
Certain choices, as personal preferences, can be central to expressing one's concept of [[self-identity]] or values.  In general, the more utilitarian an item, the less the choice says about a person's self-concept.  Purely functional items, such as a [[fire extinguisher]], may be chosen solely for function alone, but non-functional items, such as music, clothing fashions, or home decorations, may instead be chosen to express a person's concept of self-identity or associated values.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''Cornelian dilemma''' (''dilemme cornélien'') (spelled in translation with two "l"'s i.e. "Corneillian") is a [[dilemma]] for someone to oblige and choose from each options, revealing a detrimental effect on anyone. It involves the character experiencing an inner conflict, forcing them to choose between [[love]] with [[honour]] or [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]] with [[duty]]. It is introduced in ''[[Le Cid]]''.

'''Critical Practice''' is a discipline of art that places an equal emphasis on theory and practice, adopting an invigorated methodology that considers and interrogates the processes of art making, its changing contexts and the ways in which it engages an audience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rca.ac.uk/schools/school-of-fine-art/contemporary-art-practice/critical-practice/|title=Critical Practice|website=Royal College of Art|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2017}}. In addition to the various forces that are implicated in the making of art, the research elements pursued under the auspices of Critical Practice engage the increasingly devolved experience of art, made available through art institutions to their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://criticalpracticechelsea.org/wiki/|title=Critical Practice Chelsea|website=criticalpracticechelsea.org|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical Practice work takes a range of forms from traditional wall-based work ([[collage]], [[drawing]], [[photography]]) through [[performance]] and [[video]], from relational and socially engaged practices to [[Site-specific art|site-specific installations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighton.ac.uk/courses/study/fine-art-critical-practice-ba-hons.aspx|title=Fine Art: Critical Practice BA(Hons)|website=www.brighton.ac.uk|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|dating violence in general|teen-specific dating violence|Teen dating violence}}
'''Dating abuse''' or '''dating violence''' is defined as the perpetration or threat of an act of [[violence]] by at least one member of an unmarried couple on the other member within the context of [[dating]] or [[courtship]]. It is also when one partner tries to maintain [[Abusive power and control|power and control over the other through abuse/violence]].  This abuse/violence can take a number of forms: [[sexual assault]], [[sexual harassment]], threats, physical violence, [[verbal abuse|verbal]], mental, or [[emotional abuse]], social sabotage, and [[stalking]].  It can include [[psychological abuse]], [[emotional blackmail]], [[sexual abuse]], [[physical abuse]] and [[psychological manipulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcd.ecitizen.gov.sg/FamilyNCommunitySupport/StopFamilyViolence/DatingViolence/WarningSignsOfAbusiveRelationship/ Family and Community Development @eCitizen. Warning Signs of Abusive Relationship]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating violence crosses all racial, age, economic and social lines.  The Center for Relationship Abuse Awareness describes dating abuse as a "pattern of abusive and coercive behaviors used to maintain power and control over a former or current intimate partner."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoprelationshipabuse.org/signs.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Family &amp; Community Development support group at eCitizen in [[Singapore]] has described what it calls tell-tale signs of an abusive relationship.

==Profiles of abuser and victim==
Individuals of all walks of life can find themselves in an abusive relationship.  Abuse can occur regardless of the couple's age, race, income, or other demographic traits.  There are, however, many traits that abusers and victims share in common.  

The Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence describes abusers as being obsessively [[jealous]] and possessive, overly confident, having mood swings or a history of violence or temper, seeking to isolate their partner from family, friends and colleagues, and having a tendency to blame external stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence http://www.pavecentre.org.sg/&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, victims of relationship abuse share many traits as well, including: physical signs of injury, missing time at work or school, slipping performance at work or school, changes in mood or personality, increased use of drugs or alcohol, and increasing isolation from friends and family.&lt;ref name="Dating Violence, ACADV"&gt;[http://www.acadv.org/dating.html#signs Dating Violence, (ACADV)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Victims may [[Blame#Self-blame|blame]] themselves for any abuse that occurs or may [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the severity of the crime.  This often leads to victims choosing to stay in abusive relationships.

Strauss (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Murray A. (2005) "[http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB33R%20Women%27s%20Violence%20Toward%20Men.pdf Women's Violence Towards Men Is A Serious Social Problem]." In D.R. Loeske, et al., eds. ''Current controversies in family violence.'' Newbery Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that while men inflict the greater share of injuries in domestic violence, researchers and society at large must not overlook the substantial minority of injuries inflicted by women. Additionally, Strauss notes that even relatively minor acts of physical aggression by women are a serious concern:

:'Minor' assaults perpetrated by women are also a major problem, even when they do not result in injury, because they put women in danger of much more severe retaliation by men. [...] It will be argued that in order to end 'wife beating,' it is essential for women also to end what many regard as a 'harmless' pattern of slapping, kicking, or throwing something at a male partner who persists in some outrageous behavior and 'won't listen to reason.'

Similarly, [[Deborah Capaldi]] &lt;ref&gt;"quoted in Sacks, Glenn. (2009) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/glenn-sacks/researcher-says-womens-in_b_222746.html Researcher Says Women's Initiation of Domestic Violence Predicts Risk to Women]." on HuffingtonPost.com, 6 July 2009. URL retrieved 9 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that a 13-year longitudinal study found that a woman's aggression towards a man was equally important as the man's tendency towards violence in predicting the likelihood of overall violence: "Since much IPV [Intimate Partner Violence] is mutual and women as well as men initiate IPV, prevention and treatment approaches should attempt to reduce women's violence as well as men's violence. Such an approach has a much higher chance of increasing women's safety."  However, Capaldi's research only focused on at-risk youth, not women in general, and, therefore, may not apply to the entire population.

M., Michel, M. K., &amp; Teti, L. O. (1994). The development of emotion regulation and dysregulation: A clinical perspective. (Vol. 59, pp. 73-100). Wiley-Blackwell. {{jstor|1166139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as [[extrinsic]] and [[intrinsic]] processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = R.

Emotional regulation is a complex process that involves [[Initiation|initiating]], inhibiting, or modulating one's state or [[Behavior#Psychology|behavior]] in a given situation{{spaced ndash}}for example the subjective experience (feelings), cognitive responses (thoughts), emotion-related physiological responses (for example heart rate or hormonal activity), and emotion-related behavior (bodily actions or expressions). Functionally, emotional regulation can also refer to processes such as the tendency to focus one's attention to a task and the ability to suppress inappropriate behavior under instruction. Emotional regulation is a highly significant function in human life.

Every day, people are continually exposed to a wide variety of potentially arousing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Inappropriate, extreme or unchecked emotional reactions to such stimuli could impede functional fit within society; therefore, people must engage in some form of emotion regulation almost all of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L. (2009). The psychology of emotion regulation: An integrative review. (23 ed., Vol. 1, pp. 4-41). Psychology Press. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930802619031&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, [[emotional dysregulation]] has been defined as difficulties in controlling the influence of emotional [[arousal]] on the organization and quality of thoughts, actions, and interactions. Individuals who are emotionally dysregulated exhibit patterns of responding in which there is a mismatch between their goals, responses, and/or modes of expression, and the demands of the [[social environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a significant association between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[Eating disorder|eating pathology]], and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Aldao, A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., &amp; Schweizer, S.

New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

===Process model===
The process model of emotion regulation is based upon the modal model of emotion. The modal model of emotion suggests that the emotion generation process occurs in a particular sequence over time. This sequence occurs as follows:
#Situation: the sequence begins with a situation (real or imagined) that is emotionally relevant.
#[[Attention]]: attention is directed towards the emotional situation.
#[[Cognitive appraisal|Appraisal]]: the emotional situation is evaluated and interpreted.
#Response: an emotional response is generated, giving rise to loosely coordinated changes in experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.
Because an emotional response (4.) can cause changes to a situation (1.), this model involves a feedback loop from (4.) Response to (1.) Situation. This feedback loop suggests that the emotion generation process can occur recursively, is ongoing, and dynamic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gross, J. J. &amp; Thompson, R. A. (2007). Emotion regulation: Conceptual foundations. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 3-24). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process model contends that each of these four points in the emotion generation process can be subjected to regulation. From this conceptualization, the process model posits five different families of emotion regulation that correspond to the regulation of a particular point in the emotion generation process. They occur in the following order:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 271–299 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Situation selection
#Situation modification
#Attentional deployment
#Cognitive change
#Response modulation
The process model also divides these emotion regulation strategies into two categories: antecedent-focused and response-focused. Antecedent-focused strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, and cognitive change) occur before an emotional response is fully generated. Response-focused strategies (i.e., response modulation) occur after an emotional response is fully generated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = Antecedent- and response-focused emotion regulation: Divergent consequences for experience, expression, and physiology | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

===Situation selection===
Situation selection involves choosing to avoid or approach an emotionally relevant situation. If a person selects to avoid or disengage from an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is decreasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion. Alternatively, if a person selects to approach or engage with an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is increasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Typical examples of situation selection may be seen interpersonally, such as when a parent removes his or her child from an emotionally unpleasant situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = N.

D. | year = 2003 | title = The development of self-control of emotion: Intrinsic and extrinsic influences | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 7–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of situation selection may also be seen in psychopathology. For example, avoidance of social situations to regulate emotions is particularly pronounced for those with [[social anxiety disorder]]&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Papageorgiou | first2 = C. | year = 1998 | title = Social phobia: Effects of external attention on anxiety, negative beliefs, and perspective taking | url = | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 357–370 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(98)80037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[avoidant personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Effective situation selection is not always an easy task. For instance, humans display difficulties [[Affective forecasting|predicting their emotional responses]] to future events. Therefore, they may have trouble making accurate and appropriate decisions about which emotionally relevant situations to approach or to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, G. (2007). Affect regulation and affective forecasting. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation ''(pp.180-203). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation modification===
Situation modification involves efforts to modify a situation so as to change its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Situation modification refers specifically to altering one's external, physical environment. Altering one's "internal" environment to regulate emotion is called cognitive change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Examples of situation modification may include injecting humor into a speech to elicit laughter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Gerlach | first2 = A.

===Attentional deployment===
Attentional deployment involves directing one's attention towards or away from an emotional situation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Distraction====
[[Distraction]], an example of attentional deployment, is an early selection strategy, which involves diverting one's attention away from an emotional stimulus and towards other content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = Is timing everything?

This is because distraction easily filters out high-intensity emotional content, which would otherwise be relatively difficult to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Scheibe | first2 = S. | last3 = Suri | first3 = G. | last4 = Gross | first4 = J.

====Rumination====
[[Rumination (psychology)|Rumination]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; is defined as the passive and repetitive focusing of one's attention on one's symptoms of distress and the causes and consequences of these symptoms. Rumination is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, as it tends to exacerbate emotional distress. It has also been implicated in a host of disorders including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolen-Hoeksema | first1 = S. | last2 = Wisco | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Lyubomirsky | first3 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Rethinking rumination | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 400–424 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00088.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Worry====
[[Worry]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; involves directing attention to thoughts and images concerned with potentially negative events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borkovec | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. | last3 = Pruzinsky | first3 = T. | last4 = DePree | first4 = J. A. | year = 1983 | title = Preliminary exploration of worry: Some characteristics and processes | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 9–16 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(83)90121-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on these events, worrying serves to aid in the downregulation of intense negative emotion and physiological activity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While worry may sometimes involve problem solving, incessant worry is generally considered maladaptive, being a common feature of [[anxiety disorders]], particularly [[generalized anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borkovec | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Inz | first2 = J. | year = 1990 | title = The nature of worry in generalized anxiety disorder: A predominance of thought activity | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(90)90027-g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thought suppression====
[[Thought suppression]], an example of attentional deployment, involves efforts to redirect one's attention from specific thoughts and mental images to other content so as to modify one's emotional state.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Campbell-Sills, L. &amp; Barlow, D. H. (2007). Incorporating emotion regulation into conceptualizations and treatments of anxiety and mood disorders. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 542-559). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although thought suppression may provide temporary relief from undesirable thoughts, it may ironically end up spurring the production of even more unwanted thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Zanakos | first2 = S. | year = 1994 | title = Chronic thought suppression | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 615–640 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00311.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is generally considered maladaptive, being most associated with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Cognitive change===
Cognitive change involves changing how one appraises a situation so as to alter its emotional meaning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Reappraisal====
Reappraisal, an example of cognitive change, is a late selection strategy, which involves reinterpreting the meaning of an event so as to alter its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, this might involve reinterpreting an event by broadening one's perspective to see "the bigger picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schartau | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Dalgleish | first2 = T. | last3 = Dunn | first3 = B.

As opposed to distraction, individuals show a relative preference to engage in reappraisal when facing stimuli of low negative emotional intensity because these stimuli are relatively easy to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Reappraisal is generally considered to be an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to suppression, which is correlated negatively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; reappraisal can be associated with better interpersonal outcomes, and can be positively related to wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gross, James |author2=John, Oliver |title=Individual differences in two emotion regulation processes: Implications for affect, relationships, and well-being|pmid=12916575|url=http://doi.apa.org/journals/psp/85/2/348.pdf|year=2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=348–62|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.348}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts reappraisal may be maladaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tamir | first1 = M | year = 2009 | title = What do people want to feel and why?

====Distancing====
Distancing, an example of cognitive change, involves taking on an independent, third-person perspective when evaluating an emotional event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ochsner | first1 = K. N. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2008 | title = Cognitive emotion regulation: Insights from social, cognitive, affective neuroscience | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00566.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distancing has been shown to be an adaptive form of self-reflection, facilitating the emotional processing of negatively valenced stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2009 | title = Asking why from a distance facilitates emotional processing: A reanalysis of Wimalaweera and Moulds (2008) | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 88–92 | doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing emotional and cardiovascular reactivity to negative stimuli, and increasing problem-solving behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2010 | title = From a distance: Implications of spontaneous self-distancing for adaptive self-reflection | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 5| pages = 809–829 | doi=10.1037/a0019205 | pmid=20438226 | pmc=2881638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor====
[[Humor]], an example of cognitive change, has been shown to be an effective emotion regulation strategy. Specifically, positive, good-natured humor has been shown to effectively upregulate positive emotion and downregulate negative emotion. On the other hand, negative, mean-spirited humor is less effective in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samson | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2012 | title = Humour as emotion regulation: The differential consequences of negative versus positive humour | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 375–384 | doi=10.1080/02699931.2011.585069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response modulation===
Response modulation involves attempts to directly influence experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Expressive suppression====
[[Expressive Suppression|Expressive suppression]], an example of response modulation, involves inhibiting emotional expressions. It has been shown to effectively reduce facial expressivity, subjective feelings of positive emotion, heart rate, and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic activation]]. However, the research is mixed regarding whether this strategy is effective for downregulating negative emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dan-Glauser | first1 = E. S. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = The temporal dynamics of two response-focused forms of emotion regulation: Experiential, expressive, and autonomic consequences | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1309–1322 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2011.01191.x| pmc = 3136552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that expressive suppression may have negative social consequences, correlating with reduced personal connections and greater difficulties forming relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Egloff | first2 = B. | last3 = Wlhelm | first3 = F. H. | last4 = Smith | first4 = N. C. | last5 = Erickson | first5 = E. A. | last6 = Gross | first6 = J. J. | year = 2003 | title = The social consequences of expressive suppression | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 48–67 | doi = 10.1037/1528-3542.3.1.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressive suppression is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to reappraisal, it is correlated positively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; associated with worse interpersonal outcomes, is negatively related to wellbeing,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and requires the mobilization of a relatively substantial amount of cognitive resources.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jane|title=The Cognitive Consequences of Concealing Feelings|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2004|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–134|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts suppression may be adaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"/&gt;

====Drug use====
[[Drug]] use, an example of response modulation, can be a way to alter emotion-associated physiological responses. For example, [[Ethanol|alcohol]] can produce [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects&lt;ref&gt;Sher, K. J. &amp; Grekin, E. R. (2007). Alcohol and affect regulation. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 560-580). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beta blockers]] can affect sympathetic activation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Exercise====
[[Exercise]], an example of response modulation, can be used to downregulate the physiological and experiential effects of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Regular physical activity has also been shown to reduce emotional distress and improve emotional control.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oaten|first=Megan|author2=Cheng, Ken|title=Longitudinal gains in self-regulation from regular physical exercise|journal=British Journal of Health Psychology|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=717–733|doi=10.1348/135910706X96481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sleep====
[[Sleep]] plays a role in emotion regulation, although stress and worry can also interfere with sleep. Studies have shown that sleep, specifically [[REM sleep]], down-regulates reactivity of the [[amygdala]], a brain structure known to be involved in the processing of emotions, in response to previous emotional experiences.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Matthew P. |date=March 2009 |title=The Role of Sleep in Cognition and Emotion |url=http://walkerlab.berkeley.edu/reprints/Walker_NYAS_2009.pdf |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1156 |pages=168–197 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04416.x |access-date=25 November 2015 |pmid=19338508}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the flip side, [[sleep deprivation]] is associated with greater emotional reactivity or overreaction to negative and stressful stimuli. This is a result of both increased amygdala activity and a disconnect between the amygdala and the [[prefrontal cortex]], which regulates the amygdala through inhibition, together resulting in an overactive emotional brain.&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; Due to the subsequent lack of emotional control, sleep deprivation may be associated with depression, [[impulsivity]], and mood swings. Additionally, there is some evidence that sleep deprivation may reduce emotional reactivity to positive stimuli and events and impair [[emotion recognition]] in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beattie |first=Louise |last2=Kyle |first2=Simon D. |last3=Espie |first3=Colin A. |last4=Biello |first4=Stephany M. |date=December 2015 |title=Social interactions, emotion and sleep: A systematic review and research agenda |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079214001579 |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=24 |pages=83–100 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.12.005 |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychotherapy==

Emotion-regulation strategies are taught, and emotion-regulation problems are treated, in a variety of approaches to [[counseling]] and [[psychotherapy]], including [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[emotion-focused therapy]] (EFT), and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berking |first1=Matthias |authorlink1=Matthias Berking |last2=Wupperman |first2=Peggilee |last3=Reichardt |first3=Alexander |last4=Pejic |first4=Tanja |last5=Dippel |first5=Alexandra |last6=Znoj |first6=Hansjörg |date=November 2008 |title=Emotion-regulation skills as a treatment target in psychotherapy |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=1230–1237 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.08.005 |pmid=18835479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kring |editor1-first=Ann M. |editor2-last=Sloan |editor2-first=Denise M. |date=2010 |title=Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology: A Transdiagnostic Approach to Etiology and Treatment |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=9781606234501 |oclc=319318901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infancy===
Intrinsic emotion-regulation efforts during [[infancy]] are believed to be guided primarily by innate physiological response systems.&lt;ref&gt;Derryberr, D., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2001). Early temperament and emotional development. In A. F. Kalverboer &amp; A. Gramsbergen (Eds.), ''Handbook of Brain and Behavior in Human Development'' (pp. 967-988). Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; These systems usually manifest as an approach towards and an avoidance of pleasant or unpleasant stimuli. At three months, infants can engage in self-soothing behaviors like sucking and can reflexively respond to and signal feelings of distress.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Rothbart, M., Ziaie, H., &amp; O'Boyle, C. (1992). Self-regulation and emotion in infancy. In N. Eisenberg, &amp; R. Fabes (Eds.), ''Emotion and Its Regulation in Early Development'' (pp. 7-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass/Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, infants have been observed attempting to suppress anger or sadness by knitting their brow or compressing their lips.&lt;ref name="Malatesta et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malatesta|first=C.Z.|author2=Grigoryev, P. |author3=Lamb, C. |author4=Albin, M. |author5=Culver, C. |title=Emotional socialization and expressive development in preterm and full-term infants|journal=Child Development|year=1986|volume=57|pages=316–330|doi=10.2307/1130587|pmid=3956316|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between three and six months, basic [[Motor skills|motor functioning]] and attentional mechanisms begin to play a role in emotion regulation, allowing infants to more effectively approach or avoid emotionally relevant situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G. | last2 = Coy | first2 = K.

Extrinsic emotion-regulation efforts by caregivers, including situation selection, modification, and distraction, are particularly important for infants.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Calkins, S. D., &amp; Hill, A. (2007). Caregiver influence on emerging emotion regulation: Biological and environmental transactions in early development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 229-248). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotion regulation strategies employed by caregivers to attenuate distress or to upregulate positive affect in infants can impact the infants' emotional and behavioral development, teaching them particular strategies and methods of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, L. A. (1996). ''Emotional development: The organization of emotional life in the early years''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of [[Attachment styles|attachment style]] between caregiver and infant can therefore play a meaningful role in the regulatory strategies infants may learn to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G | year = 2001 | title = Emotional development in children with different attachment histories: The first three years | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence supports the idea that maternal singing has a positive effect on affect regulation in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trehub | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Ghazban | first2 = N. | last3 = Corbeil | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Musical affect regulation in infancy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1337 | issue = 1| pages = 186–192 | doi=10.1111/nyas.12622 | pmid=25773634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing play-songs, such as "The Wheels on the Bus" or "She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain" have a visible affect-regulatory consequence of prolonged positive affect and even alleviation of distress. In addition to proven facilitation of social bonding, when combined with movement and/or rhythmic touch, maternal singing for affect regulation has possible applications for infants in the NICU and for adult caregivers with serious personality or adjustment difficulties.

===Toddler-hood===
By the end of the first year, [[toddler]]s begin to adopt new strategies to decrease negative arousal. These strategies can include rocking themselves, chewing on objects, or moving away from things that upset them.&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopp|first=C.B.|title=Regulation of distress and negative emotions|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1989|volume=25|pages=343–354|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At two years, toddlers become more capable of actively employing emotion regulation strategies.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; They can apply certain emotion regulation tactics to influence various emotional states.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Additionally, maturation of brain functioning and language and motor skills permits toddlers to manage their emotional responses and levels of arousal more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rueda, M. R., Posner, M. I., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2004). Attentional control and self-regulation. In R. F. Baumeister &amp; K. D. Vohs (Eds.),'' Handbook of self-regulation: Research, theory, and applications ''(pp. 283-300). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrinsic emotion regulation remains important to emotional development in toddlerhood. Toddlers can learn ways from their caregivers to control their emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kopp | first1 = C. | year = 1989 | title = Regulation of distress and negative emotions: A developmental view | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 243–254 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, caregivers help teach self-regulation methods by distracting children from unpleasant events (like a [[vaccination]] shot) or helping them understand frightening events.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R.A.|title=Emotional regulation: A theme in search of definition|journal=Monographs of Society for Research in Child Development|year=1994|volume=59|pages=2–3|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.1994.tb01276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
Emotion-regulation knowledge becomes more substantial during childhood. For example, children aged six to ten begin to understand [[display rules]]. They come to appreciate the contexts in which certain emotional expressions are socially most appropriate and therefore ought to be regulated. For example, children may understand that upon receiving a gift they should display a smile, irrespective of their actual feelings about the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = P. L. | year = 1983 | title = Children's understanding of the link between situation and emotion | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1016/0022-0965(83)90048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During childhood, there is also a trend towards the use of more cognitive emotion regulation strategies, taking the place of more basic distraction, approach, and avoidance tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Stegge, H. &amp; Terwog, M. M. (2007). Awareness and regulation of emotion in typical and atypical development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 269-286). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the development of emotion dysregulation in children, one robust finding suggests that children who are frequently exposed to negative emotion at home will be more likely to display, and have difficulties regulating, high levels of negative emotion.&lt;ref name="Caspi et. al, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caspi|first=A.|author2=Moffitt, T.E. |author3=Morgan, J. |author4=Rutter, M. |author5=Taylor, A. |author6=Arseneault, L. |author7=Tully, L. |author8=Jacobs, C. |author9=Kim-Cohen, J. |author10=Polo-Tomas, M. |title=Maternal expressed emotion predicts children's antisocial behaviour problems: Using monozygotic-twin differences to identify environmental effects on behavioural development|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|pages=149–161|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.2.149|pmid=14979757|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg, Zhou &amp; Koller, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=N.|author2=Zhou, Q. |author3=Koller, S. |title=Brazilian adolescents' prosocial moral judgement and behaviour: Relations to sympathy, perspective-taking, gender-role orientation, and demographic characteristics|journal=Child Development|year=2001|volume=72|pages=518–534|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00294|pmid=11333082|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maughan &amp; Cicchetti"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maughan|first=A.|author2=Cicchetti, D.|title=Impact of child maltreatment and interadult violence on children's emotional regulation abilities and socioemotional adjustements|journal=Child Development|year=2002|volume=73|pages=1525–1542|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00488|pmid=12361317|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valiente, Eisenberg &amp; Spinrad, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C.|author2=Fabes, R.A. |author3=Eisenberg, N. |author4=Spinrad, T.L. |title=The relations of parental expressivity and support to children's coping with daily stress|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=97–106|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.18.1.97|pmid=14992613|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
[[Adolescence|Adolescents]] show a marked increase in their capacities to regulate their emotions, and emotion-regulation decision making becomes more complex, depending on multiple factors. In particular, the significance of interpersonal outcomes increases for adolescents. When regulating their emotions, adolescents are therefore likely to take into account their social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, adolescents show a tendency to display more emotion if they expect a sympathetic response from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Garber | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Display rules for anger, sadness, and pain: it depends on who is watching | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 957–973 | doi=10.2307/1131873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, spontaneous use of cognitive emotion-regulation strategies increases during adolescence, which is evidenced both by self-report data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garnefski | first1 = N. | last2 = Kraaij | first2 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Relationships between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms: A comparative study of five specific samples | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1659–1669 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and neural markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luna | first1 = B. | last2 = Padmanabhan | first2 = A. | last3 = O'Hearn | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = What has fMRI told us about the development of cognitive control through adolescence? | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 101–113 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.08.005 | pmc = 2815087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
Social losses increase and health tends to decrease as people age. As people get older their motivation to seek emotional meaning in life through social ties tends to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carstensen | first1 = L. A. L. | last2 = Fung | first2 = H. | last3 = Charlse | first3 = S. | year = 2003 | title = Socioemotional selectivity theory and the regulation of emotion in the second half of life | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 103–123 | doi=10.1023/a:1024569803230}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomic nervous system|Autonomic]] responsiveness decreases with age, and emotion-regulation skill tends to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawton | first1 = M. P. | year = 2001 | title = Emotion in later life | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 120–123 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of perspectives==

===Neuropsychological perspective===

====Affective====
As people age, their [[affect (psychology)|affect]]{{spaced ndash}}the way they react to emotions{{spaced ndash}}changes, either positively or negatively. Studies show that positive affect increases as a person grows from adolescence to their mid 70s. Negative affect, on the other hand, decreases until the mid 70s. Studies also show that emotions differ in adulthood, particularly affect (positive or negative). Although some studies found that affect decreases{{Clarify|reason=Becomes less positive / more negative or rather becomes less extreme, i.e., less positive or less negative as applicable?|date=February 2017}} with age, some have concluded that adults in their middle age experience more positive affect and less negative affect than younger adults. Positive affect was also higher for men than women while the negative affect was higher for women than it was for men and also for single people. A reason that older people{{spaced ndash}}middle adulthood{{spaced ndash}}might have less negative affect is because they have overcome, "the trials and vicissitudes of youth, they may increasingly experience a more pleasant balance of affect, at least up until their mid-70s". Positive affect might rise during middle age but towards the later years of life{{spaced ndash}}the 70s{{spaced ndash}}it begins to decline while negative affect also does the same. This might be due to failing health, reaching the end of their lives and the death of friends and relatives.&lt;ref name="Labouvie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labouvie-Vief|first=Gisela|title=Dynamic Integration:Affect, Cognition and the Self in Adulthood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2003|volume=12|issue=6|pages=201–206|doi=10.1046/j.0963-7214.2003.01262.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Reference range|baseline]] levels of positive and negative affect, studies have found individual differences in the time-course of emotional responses to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. The [[Time|temporal]] dynamics of emotional regulation, also known as affective [[chronometry]], include two key variables in the emotional response process: rise time to peak emotional response, and recovery time to baseline levels of emotion.&lt;ref name="Davidson, R. J. 1998 pp. 307-330"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davidson, R. J. |title= Affective Style and Affective Disorders: Perspectives from Affective Neuroscience|journal= Cognition and Emotion|volume= 12|year=1998|pages=307–330|doi=10.1080/026999398379628|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of affective chronometry typically separate positive and negative affect into distinct categories, as previous research has shown (despite some correlation) the ability of humans to experience changes in these categories independently of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Ruef, Anna Marie; Levenson, Robert W. Coan, James A. (Ed); Allen, John J. B. (Ed) "Continuous measurement of emotion: The affect rating dial" (2007). Handbook of emotion elicitation and assessment. Series in affective science., New York, NY, US: Oxford University Press, pp. 287–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Affective chronometry research has been conducted on clinical populations with [[anxiety]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], and [[personality disorders]], but is also utilized as a measurement to test the effectiveness of different therapeutic techniques (including [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] training) on [[emotional dysregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geschwind N.|pmid=21767001|year=2011|last2=Peeters|first2=F|last3=Drukker|first3=M|last4=Van Os|first4=J|last5=Wichers|first5=M|title=Mindfulness training increases momentary positive emotions and reward experience in adults vulnerable to depression: A randomized controlled trial|volume=79|issue=5|pages=618–28|doi=10.1037/a0024595|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neurological====
The development of functional [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] imaging has allowed for the study of emotion regulation on a biological level. Specifically, research over the last decade strongly suggests that there is a neural basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = DW | last2 = Dewitt | first2 = M | last3 = Hudgens-Haney | first3 = ME | last4 = Schaeffer | first4 = DJ | last5 = Ball | first5 = BH | last6 = Schwarz | first6 = NF | last7 = Hussein | first7 = AA | last8 = Smart | first8 = LM | last9 = Sabatinelli | first9 = D | year = 2014 | title = Emotion regulation: Quantitative meta-analysis of functional activation and deactivation | url = | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 202–211 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient evidence has correlated emotion regulation to particular patterns of prefrontal activation. These regions include the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]al prefrontal cortex, the ventromedial [[prefrontal cortex]], and the [[dorsolateral]] prefrontal cortex. Two additional brain structures that have been found to contribute are the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. Each of these structures are involved in various facets of emotion regulation and irregularities in one or more regions and/or interconnections among them are affiliated with failures of emotion regulation. An implication to these findings is that individual differences in prefrontal activation predict the ability to perform various tasks in aspects of emotion regulation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = K.M. | last3 = Larson | first3 = C.L. | year = 2000 | title = Dysfunction in the neural circuitry of emotion regulation: A possible prelude to violence | url = | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = | pages = 591–594 | doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological===
People intuitively mimic [[facial expressions]]; it is a fundamental part of healthy functioning. Similarities across cultures in regards to [[nonverbal communication]] has prompted the debate that it is in fact a [[universal language]].&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elfenbein | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Ambady | first2 = N. | year = 2002 | title = On the universality and cultural specificity of emotion recognition: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 2| pages = 203–235 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.203 | pmid=11931516}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that emotional regulation plays a key role in the ability to emit the correct responses in social situations. Humans have control over facial expressions both [[conscious mind|consciously]] and [[unconscious mind|unconsciously]]: an intrinsic emotion program is generated as the result of a transaction with the world, which immediately results in an emotional response and usually a facial reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = P. | last2 = Friesen | first2 = W. V. | last3 = Ancoli | first3 = S. | year = 1980 | title = Facial signs of emotional experience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 1125–1134 | doi=10.1037/h0077722}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a well documented [[phenomenon]] that emotions have an effect on facial expression, but recent research has provided evidence that the opposite may also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Izard | first1 = C. E. | year = 1990 | title = Facial expressions and the regulation of emotions | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 487–498 | pmid = 2182826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.3.487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion would give rise to the belief that a person may not only control his emotion but in fact influence them as well. Emotional regulation focuses on providing the appropriate emotion in the appropriate circumstances. Some theories allude to the thought that each emotion serves a specific purpose in coordinating [[organism]]ic needs with [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] demands (cole 1994). This skill, although apparent throughout all nationalities,&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"/&gt; has been shown to vary in successful application at different age groups. In experiments done comparing younger and older adults to the same unpleasant stimuli, older adults were able to regulate their emotional reactions in a way that seemed to avoid negative confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charles | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Carstensen | first2 = L. L. | year = 2008 | title = Unpleasant situations elicit different emotional responses in younger and older adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 495–504 | doi = 10.1037/a0013284 | pmc = 2677442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings support the theory that with time people develop a better ability to regulate their emotions. This ability found in adults seems to better allow individuals to react in what would be considered a more appropriate manner in some social situations, permitting them to avoid adverse situations that could be seen as detrimental.

====Expressive regulation (in solitary conditions)====
In solitary conditions, emotional regulation can include a minimization-miniaturization effect, in which common outward expressive patterns are replaced with toned down versions of expression. Unlike other situations, in which physical expression (and its regulation) serve a social purpose (i.e. conforming to [[display rules]] or revealing emotion to outsiders), solitary conditions require no reason for emotions to be outwardly expressed (although intense levels of emotion can bring out noticeable expression anyway). The idea behind this is that as people get older, they learn that the purpose of outward expression (to appeal to other people), is not necessary in situations in which there is no one to appeal to.&lt;ref name="Holodynski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holodynski|first=Manfred|title=The Miniaturization of Expression in the Development of Emotional Self-Regulation|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|issue=1|pages=16–28|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.1.16|pmid=14700461}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the level of emotional expression can be lower in these solitary situations.

===Stress===
According to Yu. V. Scherbatykh, emotional stress in situations like school examinations can be reduced by engaging in self-regulating activities prior to the task being performed. To study the influence of [[Self-control|self-regulation]] on mental and [[physiological]] processes under exam stress, Shcerbatykh conducted a test with an experimental group of 28 students (of both sexes) and a control group of 102 students (also of both sexes).&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shcherbatykh|first=Yu. V.|title=Self-Regulation of Autonomic Homeostasis in Emotional Stress|journal=Human Physiology|year=2000|volume=26|issue=5|pages=641–642|url=http://www.no-stress.ru/stress/stress_science/emotional_stress_regulation.html|doi=10.1007/BF02760382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the moments before the examination, [[situational]] stress levels were raised in both groups from what they were in quiet states. In the experimental group, participants engaged in three self-regulating techniques (concentration on respiration, general body relaxation, and the creation of a mental image of successfully passing the examination). During the examination, the anxiety levels of the experimental group were lower than that of the control group. Also, the percent of unsatisfactory marks in the experimental group was 1.7 times less than in the control group. From this data, Scherbatykh concluded that the application of self-regulating actions before examinations helps to significantly reduce levels of emotional strain, which can help lead to better performance results.&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh /&gt;

===Decision making===
Identification of our emotional self-regulating process can facilitate in the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miclea, M. |author2=Miu, A. |pmid=20364902|title=Emotion Regulation and Decision Making Under Risk and Uncertainty|year=2010|volume=10|issue=2|pages=257–65|doi=10.1037/a0018489|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current literature on emotion regulation identifies that humans characteristically make efforts in controlling emotion experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gross, J. J.|pmid=12212647|url=http://sprweb.org/articles/Gross02.pdf|year=2002|title=Emotion regulation: Affective, cognitive, and social consequences|volume=39|issue=3|pages=281–91|journal=Psychophysiology|doi=10.1017/s0048577201393198}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is then a possibility that our present state emotions can be altered by emotional regulation strategies resulting in the possibility that different regulation strategies could have different decision implications.

==Effects of low self regulation==
With a failure in emotional regulation there is a rise in [[psychosocial]] and emotional dysfunctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bandura, A. |author2=Caprara, G. V. |author3=Barbaranelli, C. |author4=Gerbino, M. |author5=Pastorelli, C. |title=Role of Affective Self-Regulatory Efficacy in Diverse Spheres of Psychosocial Functioning|pmid=12795389 |jstor=3696228|year=2003|volume=74|issue=3|pages=769–82|journal=Child Development|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00567}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by traumatic experiences due to an inability to regulate emotions. These traumatic experiences typically happen in grade school and are sometimes associated with [[bullying]]. Children who can't properly self-regulate express their volatile emotions in a variety of ways, including screaming if they don't have their way, lashing out with their fists, or bullying other children. Such behaviors often elicit negative reactions from the social environment, which, in turn, can exacerbate or maintain the original regulation problems over time, a process termed cumulative continuity. These children are more likely to have conflict-based relationships with their teachers and other children. This can lead to more severe problems such as an impaired ability to adjust to school and predicts school dropout many years later. Children who fail to properly self-regulate grow as teenagers with more emerging problems. Their peers begin to notice this "immaturity", and these children are often excluded from social groups and teased and harassed by their peers. This "immaturity" certainly causes some teenagers to become social outcasts in their respective social groups, causing them to lash out in angry and potentially violent ways. Being teased or being an outcast during the teenage years is especially damaging and could lead to a dysfunctional future,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which is why it is recommended to foster emotional self-regulation in children as early as possible.

'''Extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances in the Philippines''' are illegal [[execution]]s{{snd}}unlawful or felonious killings{{snd}}and [[forced disappearance]]s in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111154519/http://www.radiopinoyusa.com/radiopinoy_news.php?id=NEWS-00592 radiopinoyusa.com, U.N.

Extrajudicial killings are most commonly referred to as '''"salvaging'''" in [[Philippine English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.waywordradio.org/salvage/ |title= Salvage|publisher=A Way with Words |access-date= 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usip.org/publications/2007/03/14/extrajudicial-killings-in-the-philippines-strategies-end-the-violence|title= Extrajudicial Killings in the Philippines: Strategies to End the Violence|author = G.

Extrajudicial killings (EJKs) is also synonymous with the term "extralegal killings" (ELKs). Extrajudicial/ extralegal killings (EJKs/ ELKs) and enforced disappearances (EDs) are unique in the Philippines in as much as it is publicly and commonly known to be committed also by non-state armed groups (NAGs) such as the New Peoples Army (NPA) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Although cases have been well documented with conservative estimates of EJKs/ ELKs and EDs committed by the NPAs numbering to about 900-1,000 victims based on the discovery of numerous mass grave sites all over country, legal mechanisms for accountability of non-state actors have been weak if not wholly non-existent.

{{update|section|January 1, 2018|date=January 2018}}
Philippine extrajudicial killings are politically motivated murders committed by government officers, punished by local and [[international law]] or [[Treaty|convention]]. They include assassinations; deaths due to strafing or indiscriminate firing; massacre; [[summary execution]] is done if the victim becomes passive before the moment of death (i.e., abduction leading to death); assassination means forthwith or instant killing while [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]] is akin to [[genocide]] or mass extermination; thus, killings occurred in many regions or places throughout the Philippines in different times - 136 killings in Southern Tagalog region were recorded by human rights group [[Karapatan]] from 2001 to May 19, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/publications/summit/Summit%20Papers/ta%C3%B1ada%20-%20ending%20extrajudicial%20killings.pdf|title=www.supremecourt.gov.ph, ENDING EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS AND ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES: REFRAMING THE NATIONAL SECURITY PARADIGM AND PUTTING HUMAN RIGHTS AT THE HEART OF THE PROCESS - WIGBERTO E.

A [[forced disappearance]] (desaparecidos), on the other hand, as form of [[extrajudicial punishment]] is perpetrated by government officers, when any of its public officers abducts an individual, to vanish from public view, resulting to murder or plain [[Sequestration (law)|sequestration]]. The victim is first kidnapped, then  illegally detained in [[concentration camps]], often tortured, and finally executed and the corpse hidden. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], "disappeared people" are called ''desaparecidos'', a term which specifically refers to the mostly [[South America]]n victims of [[state terrorism]] during the 1970s and the 1980s, in particular concerning [[Operation Condor]]. In the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]], "Enforced disappearance" is defined in Article 2 of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] as "the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx|title=redirect page|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AsiaRegion/Pages/PHIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR - Philippines Homepage|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Marcos regime===
In 1995, 10,000 Filipinos won a U.S. class-suit against the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] estate. The charges were filed by victims or their surviving relatives for torture, execution and disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1344412006 |title=No hero's resting place as Imelda Marcos finds site for husband's grave |author=Hrvoje Hranjski |work=The Scotsman |date=12 September 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights groups placed the number of victims of extrajudicial killings under martial law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/121365-torture-martial-law-marcos-regime|title=Worse than death: Torture methods during martial law|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 1500 and over 800 abductions; [[Karapatan]] (a local human rights group's) records show 759 involuntarily disappeared (their bodies never found). Military historian [[Alfred W. McCoy|Alfred McCoy]] in his book "Closer than Brothers: Manhood at the Philippine Military Academy" and in his speech "Dark Legacy" cites 3,257 extrajudicial killings, 35,000 torture victims, and 70,000 incarcerated during the Marcos years.&lt;ref name="hartford-hwp.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54a/062.html|title=Alfred McCoy, Dark Legacy: Human rights under the Marcos regime|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/6-32/6-32-power.htm |title=Marcos Kin, Allies Still within Corridors of Power |work=Bulatalat |author=Alexander Martin Remollino |date=September 17, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper "Bulatlat" places the number of victims of arbitrary arrest and detention at 120,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/6-32/6-32-specter.htm |title=The Specter of Martial Law |work=Bulatalat |author=Benjie Oliveros |date=September 17, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080105131654/http://news.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2809885 scotsman.com, No hero's resting place as Imelda Marcos finds site for husband's grave] (archived from [http://news.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2809885 the original] on 2008-01-05)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2007/10/01/18450919.php|title=Memoirs of Martial Law in the Philippines : Indybay|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New People's Army]] (NPA) groups known as "Sparrow Units" were active in the mid-1980s, killing government officials, police personnel, military members, and anyone else they targeted for elimination. They were also part of an NPA operation called "Agaw Armas" ([[Filipino language|Filipino]] for "Stealing Weapons"), where they raided government armories as well as stealing weapons from slain military and police personnel. A low level civil war with south [[Muslims]], [[Al-Qaeda]] sympathizers and [[communist]] insurgents has led to a general break down of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]]. The [[Politics of the Philippines#National Government of the Philippines|Philippines government]] has promised to curb the killings, but is itself implicated in many of the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoyhr.net/|title=Supporters of Marijuana Legalization|website=Supporters of Marijuana Legalization|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060107160314/http://www.philippinerevolution.net/index.shtml  philippinerevolution.net, website, CCP] (archived from [http://www.philippinerevolution.net/index.shtml the original] on 2006-01-07)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070105153252/http://www.philippinerevolution.net/npa/index.shtml  philippinerevolution.net, website NPA] (archived from [http://www.philippinerevolution.net/npa/index.shtml the original] on 2007-01-05)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1975, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) was deeply concerned in politics. Because of the armed conflict, the military continued its campaign versus the New People's Army of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP). Since 1969 it aimed to establish a Marxist regime with armed rebellion against the government. On top of all these chaos, left-wing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were/are critical of the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] administration. The members who associated with the CPP and NPA had been targeted as victims in the spate of political killings. [[Human Rights Watch]] investigated extrajudicial murders in the Philippines in September 2007.&lt;ref name="hartford-hwp.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/asia-pacific/048/05.html|title=Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions&lt;br&gt;In the Philippines, 2001-2006  - ヒューライツ大阪|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcij.org/blog/wp-docs/karapatan_2007_hr_report.pdf  www.pcij.org, Karapatan’s 2007 human rights report] {{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three major investigation groups were commissioned and their final reports had been submitted and published: the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] government-appointed bodies: a) Task Force Usig created by her on August; as a special police body, it was assigned to solve 10 cases of killings; it claimed having solved 21 cases, by initiating court cases, but only 12 suspects were arrested; b) the Melo Commission (chaired by Supreme Court Associate Justice Jose Melo) with members National Bureau of Investigation Director Nestor Mantaring, Chief State Prosecutor Jovencito Zuño, Bishop Juan de dios Pueblos, and Nelia Torres Gonzales; its final report states: "There is no official or sanctioned policy on the part of the military or its civilian superiors to resort to what other countries euphemistically call "alternative procedures"{{snd}}meaning illegal executions. However, there is certainly evidence pointing the finger of suspicion at some elements and personalities in the armed forces, in particular General [[Jovito Palparan]], as responsible for an undetermined number of killings, by allowing, tolerating, and even encouraging the killings."

===Malacañang's peace summit and Puno's killings summit===
* Because of the magnitude of Philippine killings and desaparecidos, 22nd [[Chief Justice]] [[Reynato Puno]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] called a National Consultative Summit on extrajudicial killings on July 16 and 17, 2007 at the [[Manila Hotel]]. Invited representatives from the branches of the government participated (including the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], the PNP, [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)]], media, [[academe]], [[civil society]] and other stakeholders). On the other hand, the [[Malacañang]]-sponsored "Mindanao Peace and Security Summit" (July 8–10, 2007 at [[Cagayan de Oro City]]) concentrated on the anti-terror law, or the Human Security Act (HSA) of 2007, to make it more acceptable to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75094|title=Inquirer.net, SC slates summit on extrajudicial killings|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708181922/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75094|archivedate=8 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/49959/SC-slates-summit-on-extrajudicial-killings|title=SC slates summit on extrajudicial killings|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the July 16 summit, Reynato Puno stated that he Commission on Human Rights reported the number of victims at 403 from 2001 to May 31, 2007, while [[Karapatan]] reported 863 deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view_article.php?article_id=78036 |title=Inquirer Opinion - Inquirer Opinion |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605022710/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/talkofthetown/view_article.php?article_id=78036 |archivedate=5 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2007, and more than 900 as of May, 2008, and most of them were members of left wing groups.

===Promulgation of Writs of Amparo and Habeas Data===
Because of the inefficacy and insufficiency of the Philippines [[Writ of Habeas Corpus]], on September 25, 2007, Chief Justice Reynato Puno signed and released the Writ of Amparo: "This rule will provide the victims of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances the protection they need and the promise of vindication for their rights. This rule empowers our courts to issue reliefs that may be granted through judicial orders of protection, production, inspection and other relief to safeguard one's life and liberty The writ of amparo shall hold public authorities, those who took their oath to defend the constitution and enforce our laws, to a high standard of official conduct and hold them accountable to our people.

===International groups' 2006 and 2008 probe of killings===
In 2006, the Dutch Lawyers for Lawyers Foundation and Lawyers without Borders with the support of the Netherlands Bar Association, the Amsterdam Bar Association and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers created a fact-finding mission in different parts of the Philippines. The international groups conducted interviews of various legal sectors from June 15 to June 20, 2006.

From November 4–12, 2008, the Dutch Lawyers for Lawyers Foundation will conduct a follow-up verification and fact finding mission (IVFFM) in Manila and [[Mindanao]], with the National Host Committee, National Union of Peoples' Lawyers (NUPL) and the Counsels for the Defense of Liberties (CODAL). This team is composed of 8 judges and lawyers from [[Belgium]] and [[Netherlands]], who had dialogue with [[Reynato Puno]] on the probe of killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindanaoexaminer.com/news.php?news_id=20081103210751|title=mindanaoexaminer.com, Human Rights Fact-Finding Mission Begins In The Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122174237/http://www.mindanaoexaminer.com/news.php?news_id=20081103210751|archive-date=2016-01-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International criticism===
On September 28, 2007, the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]] (AHRC) criticized the [[Writ of Amparo and Habeas Data (Philippines)]] for being insufficient: "Though it responds to practical areas it is still necessary that further action must be taken in addition to this. The legislative bodies, [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], should also initiate its own actions promptly and without delay. They must enact laws which ensure protection of rights—laws against torture and [[enforced disappearance]] and laws to afford adequate legal remedies to victims." AHRC objected since the [[writ]] failed to protect non-witnesses, even if they too face threats or risk to their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/62409/Writ-of-amparo-not-enough--Hong-Kong-rights-group|title=Writ of amparo not enough – Hong Kong rights group|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reports - the root cause of killings==

===Alston UN report===
* [[Philip Alston]] submitted his final report on the killings; he found that the Armed Forces of the Philippines killed left-wing activists to get rid of communist insurgents: "the executions had "eliminated civil society leaders, including human rights defenders, trade unionists and land reform advocates, intimidated a vast number of civil society actors, and narrowed the country’s political discourse." Alston denied for lack of merit the government's claim that killings were perpetrated by communists to exterminate spies and to make negative propaganda versus government. Alston, in February 2007 stated that the military made alibis or denials on its role about 800 deaths of activists and journalists since 2001. Alston blamed "impunity" which caused the executions of journalists and leftist activists: "the priorities of the criminal justice system had been "distorted," and had "increasingly focused on prosecuting civil society leaders rather than their killers." But Alston noted the government's creation of{{snd}}special courts to try extrajudicial killings, the Melo Commission and the Philippine National Police's Task Force Usig.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080125073614/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=103513 newsinfo.inquirer.net, Alston report: AFP behind killings, Report rejects RP claim of Red purge] (archived from [http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=103513 the original] on 2008-01-25)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080507174217/http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/about/people.html Philip Alston, UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions] (archived from [http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/about/people.html#alston the original] on 2008-05-07&lt;!-- data retrieval error being reported as of 2010-12-10--&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt; In the November U.N. Alston report - the killings in 2007 was only 68, huge drop from the 209 murdered in 2006. Karapatan published its report however, listing 830 victims of extrajudicial killings since 2001, under Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40582|title=ipsnews.net/news, CHALLENGES 2007-2008:  Short Shrift for Human Rights in South-east Asia|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207111406/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40582|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 2007, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] issued Administrative Order No. 25-2007, which created by designation 99 regional trial courts to try cases of killings and desaparecidos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070708181922/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75094 newsinfo.inquirer.net, Chief Justice unfazed by Palace meet] (archived from [http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=75094 the oritginal] on 2007-07-08)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failed investigations and prosecutions===
*The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Execution found that just on paper trails, cases are filed; but Alston officially concluded that “there is a passivity, bordering on an abdication of responsibility, which affects the way in which key institutions and actors approach their responsibilities in relation to such human rights concerns; prosecutors refused to take a role in gathering evidence, and instead being purely passive, waiting for the police to present them with a file; the Ombudsman’s office did almost nothing in recent years in this regard, failing to act in any of the 44 complaints alleging extrajudicial executions attributed to State agents submitted from 2002 to 2006." (“Preliminary note on the visit of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, to the Philippines (12–21 February 2007),” A/HRC/4/20/Add.3, March 22, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;4., etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2007/philippines0607/5.htm#_ftn104|title=Scared Silent: Impunity for Extrajudicial Killings in the Philippines: V.

===Eric G. John and G. Eugene Martin testimonies===
* On March 14, 2007, Eric G. John, Deputy Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs testified before the USA Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations at [[Washington, D.C.]] John submitted his written statement: a) the increase in extrajudicial killings, b) the “Huk Rebellion” in the 1940s and 50s causing thousands of murdered victims; c) the communist New People's Army (NPA), which was listed in the [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]] campaigned to overthrow the government since 1968; d) Extrajudicial killings by the security forces, the NPA, etc. during the Marcos regime, were less; and e) noted the report of UN Special Rapporteur Alston which submitted the Philippine Government's recognition of the gravity of the problem, expresses concern about the views of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regarding the problem, but much had to submitted that the reforms made did not and will not resolve the killings. Mr. Alston's March report stated that "the question of resources or technical expertise will partly resolve the killings but the strong risk is that these measures will treat only some of the symptoms of the crisis, and will fail to address meaningfully two of the most important underlying causes of a great many of the killings." (A/HRC/4/20/Add.3, March 22, 2007) Alston named two root causes of the killings: (1) 'vilification', 'labeling’, or 'guilt by association'{{snd}}"characterization of most groups on the left of the political spectrum as ‘front organizations’ for armed groups whose aim is to destroy democracy" making the groups "considered to be legitimate targets; and (2) the Government’s counter-insurgency strategy's extent of facilitating killings of activists and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alrc.net/doc/mainfile.php/alrc_statements/453/|title=[ALRC Joint Statement] PHILIPPINES: Extrajudicial killings|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usip.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/congress/testimony/2007/0314_martin.html|title=www.usip.org, Briefings and Congressional Testimony - Testimony of G.

Eugene Martin specifically expanded the 2 causes of the violence and killings: a) weak political and social institutions, corrupt and ineffective judicial system, resulting to failure to obtain justice from corrupt Philippine courts; and b) the legacy of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] regime; [[Martial law]] caused the corrupt system where soldiers, police, judges and prosecutors became principals of offenses like extralegal arrest, detention, incarceration, disappearances and killings (salvaging), all permitted or allowed. He traced the spate of violence and killings to political instability of President Arroyo government; while she created the Independent Commission to Address Media and Activist Killings, Melo Commission, she had no capability to end the killings, due to her political lameness because of the 2004 election controversy.&lt;ref name="usip.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usip.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080801144003/https://www.senate.gov/~foreign/hearings/2007/hrg070314p.html www.senate.gov, Extrajudicial Killings In The Philippines: Strategies To End The Violence] (archived from [https://www.senate.gov/~foreign/hearings/2007/hrg070314p.html the original] on 2008-08-01)&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIDH report===
* Three experts from the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (abbreviated ''FIDH''), Mr. Nabeel Rajab (Bahrain), Mr. Mouloud Boumghar (France) and Mr. Frédéric Ceuppens (Belgium), came to the Philippines on August 13 to 23, 2007. Their FIDH mission report stated that torture and ill-treatment was widespread versus suspected "terrorists". The Filipino government is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the UN Convention against Torture (CAT). The FIDH dismissed the Philippines government's claim doubts that mechanisms were placed to stop the killings, as it questioned the efficiency of{{snd}}the corrupt judiciary, the government “Witness Protection Programme” ; also, judges and lawyers were victims themselves of killings. It also found the Philippine anti-terrorism law ( “Human Security Act”) to result in more torture and extrajudicial killings as a fight against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/philippines-mission.pdfwww.fidh.org,|title=Philippines International Fact-Finding Mission|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2017}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial corruption===
On January 25, 2005, and on December 10, 2006, Philippines [[Social Weather Stations]] released the results of its two surveys on corruption in the judiciary; it published that: a) like 1995, 1/4 of lawyers said many/very many judges are corrupt. But (49%) stated that a judges received bribes, just 8% of lawyers admitted they reported the [[bribery]], because they could not prove it. [Tables 8-9]; judges, however, said, just 7% call many/very many judges as corrupt[Tables 10-11];b) "Judges see some corruption; proportions who said - many/very many corrupt judges or justices: 17% in reference to RTC judges, 14% to MTC judges, 12% to Court of Appeals justices, 4% i to Shari'a Court judges, 4% to [[Sandiganbayan]] justices and 2% in reference to Supreme Court justices [Table 15].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm |title=SWS Media Release: 6 July 2006 |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517073044/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr061210.htm |archivedate=17 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm |title=SWS Media Release |publisher= |accessdate=15 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517072913/http://www.sws.org.ph/pr050125.htm |archivedate=17 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fair Trade Certified Mark''' is a [[fair trade certification]] mark used in Canada and in the United States. It appears on products as an independent guarantee that disadvantaged producers in the developing world are getting a better deal. The Fair Trade Certified Mark is the North American equivalent of the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] used in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. 

For a product to carry either Certification Marks, it must come from [[FLO-CERT]] inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested in accordance with the International Fairtrade standards set by [[FLO International]]. The supply chain is also monitored by [[FLO-CERT]] to ensure the integrity of labelled products. Only [[Fair Trade USA]] or [[Fairtrade Canada]] (formerly "TransFair USA" and "TransFair Canada," respectively) licensees can use the Fair Trade Certified Mark on their products, however a gradual phase-out of this mark began in Canada in 2011.

The Canadian Fair Trade Certified Mark was introduced by [[TransFair Canada]] on the Canadian market in 1997.

The American Fair Trade Certified Mark was introduced by [[TransFair USA]] on the American market in 1998.

In 2010, Canada began actively promoting both the Fair Trade Certified Mark and the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]] as part of a transition process towards the latter, which became the primary Fairtrade Certification Mark in 2011.

In 2012 a variation of the US Fair Trade certification mark was adopted with the benefit of being registered globally as a trade mark. The mark is designed to pop better on the shelf through a far simpler design and the use of color. The one basket with outstretched hands indicates sharing and a "give and take" between producers and purchases. The green signals the environmental strength of Fair Trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtradeusa.org/sites/all/files/wysiwyg/filemanager/label/Fair-Trade-USA-FAQ-newcertificationmark.pdf|title=Certification Mark: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Fair Trade USA|date=|accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="96456">{{About|the theological questions of free will||Free will (disambiguation)}}
'''Free will in theology''' is an important part of the debate on [[free will]] in general. Religions vary greatly in their response to the standard argument against free will and thus might appeal to any number of responses to the [[argument from free will|paradox of free will]], the claim that [[omniscience]] and free will are incompatible.

==Overview==
{{main article|Argument from free will}}
The [[theology|theological]] doctrine of divine foreknowledge is often alleged to be in conflict with free will, particularly in [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] circles: if [[God]] knows exactly what will happen (right down to every choice a person makes), it would seem that the "freedom" of these choices is called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Alston, William P. 1985. "Divine Foreknowledge and Alternative Conceptions of Human Freedom." International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 18:1, 19–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem is related to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] problem of the sea battle: tomorrow either there will or will not be a sea battle. According to the [[Law of excluded middle]], there seems to be two options. If there will be sea battle, then it seems that it was true even yesterday that there would be one. Thus it is ''necessary'' that the sea battle will occur. If there will not be one, then, by similar reasoning, it is necessary that it will not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. "De Interpretatione" in ''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', vol. I, ed. Jonathan Barnes. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; That means that the future, whatever it is, is completely fixed by past truths: true propositions about the future (a [[determinism|deterministic]] conclusion is reached: things could not have been any other way).

However, some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp p. 46–7&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo]] in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common defenses==
[[Jewish philosophy]] stresses that free will is a product of the intrinsic human soul, using the word ''neshama'' (from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew root]] ''n.sh.m.'' or .נ.ש.מ meaning "breath"), but the ability to make a free choice is through ''Yechida'' (from Hebrew word "yachid", יחיד, singular), the part of the soul that is united with God,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} the only being that is not hindered by or dependent on cause and effect (thus, freedom of will does not belong to the realm of the physical reality, and inability of natural philosophy to account for it is expected).

In [[Islam]], the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge but with God's ''jabr'' or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia Islam]], Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm Man and His Destiny]&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. All actions committed by man's free will are said to be counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are his/her own and not God's.

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848)''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence,"''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

===In the Bible===
The biblical ground for free will lies in the [[fall of man|fall]] into sin by [[Adam and Eve]] that occurred in their "willfully chosen" disobedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', s.v. "Fall, the."&lt;/ref&gt;

"Freedom” and "free will" can be treated as one because the two terms are commonly used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, “Determinism and Freedom Philosophy – Its Terminology,” http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwTerminology.html (accessed November 7, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are widespread disagreements in definitions of the two terms.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kane, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', (Oxford, 2005), 10 and Fischer, J., Kane, R., Pereboom, D., &amp; Vargas, M., ''Four Views on Free Will'' (Blackwell, 2007), 128 and R. Eric Barnes, {{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/ebarnes/101/101-freedom-topic.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216033737/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/ebarnes/101/101-freedom-topic.htm |archivedate=2005-02-16 |df= }} (accessed October 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these disagreements, [[Mortimer Adler]] found that a delineation of three kinds of freedom is necessary for clarity on the subject, as follows:

(1) '''Circumstantial freedom''' is "freedom from coercion or restraint" that prevents acting as one wills.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the Bible, circumstantial freedom was given to the Israelites in [[The Exodus]] from slavery in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, Philip Wesley Comfort, eds, ''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'' (Tyndale House, 2001), s.v. “Exodus,” 456.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2) '''Natural freedom''' (a.k.a. volitional freedom) is freedom to determine one’s own "decisions or plans." Natural freedom is inherent in all people, in all circumstances, and "''without regard'' to any state of mind or character which they may or may not acquire in the course of their lives."&lt;ref name="Mortimer J. Adler 1958"&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bible, paralleling Adler, views all humanity as naturally possessing the "free choice of the will."&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. McKim, ''Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996). s.v. "free will."&lt;/ref&gt; If  "free will" is taken to mean unconstrained and voluntary choice, the Bible assumes that all people, unregenerate and regenerate, possess it.&lt;ref name="D. Douglas 1962"&gt;J. D. Douglas, ed., ''The New Bible Dictionary'' (Eerdmans, 1962), s.v. "Liberty, Section III. FREE WILL."&lt;/ref&gt; For examples, "free will" is taught in Matthew 23:37 and Revelation 22:17.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Free, revised and expanded by Howard Frederic Vos, ''Archaeology and Bible History'' (Zondervan, 1992.), 83.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2015}}

(3) '''Acquired freedom''' is freedom "to live as [one] ought to live," a freedom that requires a transformation whereby a person acquires a righteous, holy, healthy, etc. "state of mind or character."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Idea of Freedom: A Dialectical Examination of the Idea of Freedom'', Vol 1 (Doubleday, 1958), 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bible testifies to the need for acquired freedom because no one "is free for obedience and faith till he is freed from sin’s dominion." People possess natural freedom but their “voluntary choices” serve sin until they acquire freedom from "sin’s dominion." The ''New Bible Dictionary'' denotes this acquired freedom for "obedience and faith" as "free will" in a theological sense.&lt;ref name="D. Douglas 1962"/&gt; Therefore, in biblical thinking, an acquired freedom from being "enslaved to sin" is needed "to live up to Jesus' commandments to love God and love neighbor."&lt;ref&gt;Ted Peters, ''Sin: Radical Evil in Soul and Society'' (Eerdmans, 1994), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jesus told his hearers that they needed to be made "free indeed" (John 8:36). "Free indeed [''ontós'']" means "truly free" or "really free," as it is in some translations.&lt;ref&gt;Strong’s ''Greek Dictionary'' translates ''ontós'' as “really” or “truly.” Versions using these translations include ''The Darby Translation'', ''The Bible in Basic English'', ''New Century Version'', ''Young’s Literal Translation'', and ''Good News Translation''.&lt;/ref&gt; Being made “free indeed” means freedom from “bondage to sin.”&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Burge, “Gospel of John,” in ''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John's Gospel, Hebrews-Revelation'', ed. Craig A. Evans, (David C. Cook, 2005), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This acquired freedom is “freedom to serve the Lord.”&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', s.v. “Freedom.”&lt;/ref&gt; Being "free indeed" (i.e., true freedom) comes by "God’s changing our nature" to free us from being "slaves to sin." and endowing us with "the freedom to choose to be righteous."

Mark R. Talbot,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wheaton.edu/Academics/Faculty/T/Mark-Talbot&lt;/ref&gt; a "classical Christian theist,"&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, “Does God Reveal Who He Actually Is?” in ''God Under Fire'', ed. Douglas S. Huffman, Eric L. Johnson (Zondervan, 2002), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; views this acquired [[Compatibilism|"compatibilist]] freedom" as the freedom that "Scripture portrays as worth having."&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, “True Freedom: The Liberty That Scripture Portrays as Worth Having” in ''Beyond the Bounds'', ed. John Piper and others, 105-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Open theism]] denies that classical theism’s [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] "freedom to choose to be righteous without the possibility of choosing otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, "True Freedom: The Liberty That Scripture Portrays as Worth Having" in ''Beyond the Bounds'', ed. John Piper and others, (Crossway, 2003), 107,109.&lt;/ref&gt; qualifies as true freedom. For open theism, true [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian freedom]] is [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist freedom]]. Regardless of factors, a person has the freedom to choose opposite alternatives. In open theist [[William Hasker]]’s words, regarding any action it is always "''within the agent’s power to perform the action and also in the agent’s power to refrain from the action''."&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, “A Philosophical Perspective,” in ''The Openness of God'' (InterVarsity, 1994), 136-137, Hasker’s italics.&lt;/ref&gt; Although open theism generally contradicts classical theism’s "freedom to choose to be righteous without the possibility of choosing otherwise," Hasker allows that Jesus possessed and humans in heaven will possess such a freedom. Regarding Jesus, Hasker views Jesus as “a free agent,” but he also thinks that "it was not really possible" that Jesus would "abort the mission."&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, answer to "Did Jesus have free will?" at {{cite web |url=http://www.opentheism.info/pages/questions/phiq/freewill/freewill_03.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306181014/http://www.opentheism.info/pages/questions/phiq/freewill/freewill_03.php |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }} (accessed September 27, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding heaven, Hasker foresees that as the result of our choice we will be "unable to sin" because all sinful impulses will be gone.&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, answer to "So, will there be free will in heaven?" at
{{cite web |url=http://www.opentheism.info/pages/questions/phiq/freewill/freewill_01.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306181028/http://www.opentheism.info/pages/questions/phiq/freewill/freewill_01.php |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }} (accessed Oct 14, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholic===
Theologians of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] universally embrace the idea of free will, but generally do not view free will as existing apart from or in contradiction to [[divine grace|grace]]. According to the Roman Catholic Church "To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes in it each person's free response to his grace."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church, section 600&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] wrote extensively on free will, with Augustine focusing on the importance of free will in his responses to the [[Manichaeans]], and also on the limitations of a concept of unlimited free will as denial of grace, in his refutations of [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]].

The Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church asserts that "Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1731|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a3.htm|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It goes on to say that "God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1730|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a3.htm|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The section concludes with the role that grace plays, "By the working of grace the Holy Spirit educates us in spiritual freedom in order to make us free collaborators in his work in the Church and in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1742|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a3.htm|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin Christianity's views on free will and grace are often contrasted with predestination in [[Calvinism|Reformed]] [[Protestant Christianity]], especially after the [[Counter-Reformation]], but in understanding differing conceptions of free will it is just as important to understand the differing conceptions of the nature of God, focusing on the idea that God can be all-powerful and all-knowing even while people continue to exercise free will, because God transcends time.

The papal encyclical on human freedom, ''Libertas Praestantissimum'' by Pope Leo XIII (1888),&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII, ''[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13liber.htm Libertas Praestantissimum]'', 1888&lt;/ref&gt; seems to leave the question unresolved as to the relation between free will and determinism: whether the correct notion is the compatibilist one or the libertarian one. The quotations supporting compatibilism include the one from St. Thomas (footnote 4) near the end of paragraph 6, regarding the cause of evil ("Whereas, when he sins, he acts in opposition to reason, is moved by another, and is the victim of foreign misapprehensions"),&lt;ref&gt;Likewise in paragraph 5 that the good or the choice of the good comes from the judgement of reason (in Roman Catholic doctrine it is not identical with free will), which is usually considered causal in philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar passus suggesting a natural, cause-and-effect function of human will ("harmony with his natural inclinations", "Creator of will", "by whom all things are moved in conformity with their nature") near the end of paragraph 8 (when considering the problem of how grace can have effects on free will). On the other hand, metaphysical libertarianism &amp;ndash; at least as a sort of possibility of reversing the direction of one's acting &amp;ndash; is suggested by the reference to the well-known philosophical term ''metaphysical freedom'' at the beginning of paragraph 3 and, to an extent, a contrasting comparison of animals, which always act "of necessity", with human liberty, by means of which one can "either act or not act, do this or do that".

Critique that seems more or less to support popular incompatibilistic views can be found in some papal documents especially in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;See especially e.g. [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYRE.HTM an address of Pius XII to the Fifth International Congress on Psychotherapy and Clinical Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; no ''explicit'' condemnation, however, of causal determinism in its most generic form can be found there. More often these documents focus on condemnation of physicalism/materialism and the stressing of significance of belief in soul, as a non-physical indivisible substance equipped with intellect and will, which decides human proceeding in a (perhaps imprecise) way.

===Orthodox Christianity===

====Oriental Orthodox====
The concept of free will is also of vital importance in the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental]] (or [[miaphysitism|non-Chalcedonian]]) Churches,  those in communion with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. As in Judaism, free will is regarded as [[axiomatic]]. Everyone is regarded as having a free choice as to in what measure he or she will follow his or her [[conscience]] or [[:wikt:arrogance|arrogance]], these two having been appointed for each individual. The more one follows one's conscience, the more it brings one good results, and the more one follows one's arrogance, the more it brings one bad results. Following only one's arrogance is sometimes likened to the dangers of falling into a pit while walking in pitch darkness, without the light of conscience to illuminate the path. Very similar doctrines have also found written expression in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] "Manual of Discipline", and in some religious texts possessed by the [[Beta Israel]] Jews of [[Ethiopia]].

====Eastern Orthodox====
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] (or [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian]]) [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] espouses a belief different from the Lutheran, Calvinist, and Arminian Protestant views. The difference is in the interpretation of [[original sin]], alternatively known as "[[ancestral sin]]," where the Orthodox do not believe in [[total depravity]]. The Orthodox reject the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] view that the original sin did not damage human nature; they accept that the human nature is depraved, but despite man's fallenness the divine image he bears has not been destroyed.

The Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of synergy (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. St. [[John Cassian]], a 4th-century Church Father and pupil of St. [[John Chrysostom]], articulated this view and all the Eastern Fathers embraced it. He taught that "Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God", and that "Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God.".

Some [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] use the parable of a drowning man to plainly illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, pulls him up, saving him, and the man, if he wants to be saved, must hold on tightly to the rope; explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself, and that man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation.

[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christian novelist, suggested many arguments for and against free will. Famous arguments are found in "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" chapter in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', and in his work ''[[Notes from Underground]]''. He also developed an argument that suicide, if irrational, is actually a validation of free will (see Kirilov in the [[The Devils (novel)|Demons]]) novel. As for the argument presented in ''The Brothers Karamazov'''s section "The Rebellion" that the suffering of innocents was not worth the price of free will, Dostoevsky appears to propose the idea of [[apocatastasis]] (or [[universal reconciliation]]) as one possible rational solution.

;Roman Catholic teaching
Illustrating as it does that the human part in salvation (represented by holding on to the rope) must be preceded and accompanied by grace (represented by the casting and drawing of the rope), the image of the drowning man holding on to the rope cast and drawn by his rescuer corresponds closely to Roman Catholic teaching, which holds that God, who "destined us in love to be his sons" and "to be conformed to the image of his Son",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 257] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303003725/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM |date=March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; includes in his eternal plan of "predestination" each person's free response to his grace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1O.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 600]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church holds to the teaching that "by free will, (the human person) is capable of directing himself toward his true good … man is endowed with freedom, an outstanding manifestation of the divine image'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a1.htm CCC 1704-1705]&lt;/ref&gt; Man has free will either to accept or reject the grace of God, so that for salvation "there is a kind of interplay, or [[synergy]], between human freedom and divine grace".&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cymM4xEM76wC&amp;pg=PA766&amp;dq=Catechism+Catholic+Church+synergy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cu4dTLPRE8qHOLbolPEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Catechism of the Catholic Church, Reader's Guide to Themes (Burns &amp; Oates 1999] {{ISBN|0-86012-366-9}}), p. 766&lt;/ref&gt; "Justification establishes cooperation between God's grace and man's freedom. On man's part it is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in the cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his assent: 'When God touches man's heart through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, man himself is not inactive while receiving that inspiration, since he could reject it; and yet, without God's grace, he cannot by his own free will move himself toward justice in God's sight' (Council of Trent)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm CCC 1993] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623190358/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm |date=June 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative comes from God,&lt;ref&gt;We receive the grace of Christ in the Holy Spirit, and without the Holy Spirit no one can have faith in Christ ({{bibleverse|1|Cor.|12:3}}), and as Saint Cyril of Alexandria said: "It is unworkable for the soul of man to achieve any of the goods, namely, to control its own passions and to escape the mightiness of the sharp trap of the devil, unless he is fortified by the grace of the Holy Spirit and on this count he has Christ himself in his soul" (Against Julian, 3)&lt;/ref&gt; but it demands a free response from man: "God has freely chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. the fatherly action of God is first on his own initiative, and then follows man's free acting through his collaboration".&lt;ref name="vatican1"/&gt; "Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no one can merit the initial grace of forgiveness and justification, at the beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by charity, we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P70.HTM CCC 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Orthodox criticism of Roman Catholic theology
Orthodox theologian [[Vladimir Lossky]] has stated that the teaching of [[John Cassian]], who in the East is considered a witness to Tradition, but who "was unable to make himself correctly understood", "was interpreted, on the rational plane, as a semi-pelagianism, and was condemned in the West".&lt;ref&gt;It is not, in the circumstances, surprising that a representative of the Eastern tradition-St. John Cassian-who took part in this debate and was opposed both to the Pelagians and to St Augustine, was not able to make himself correctly understood. His position of seeming to stand 'above' the conflict, was interpreted, on the rational plane, as a semi-pelagianism, and was condemned in the West. The Eastern Church, on the other hand, has always considered him as a witness to tradition.

Where the Roman Catholic Church defends the concept of faith and free will these are questioned in the East by the conclusions of the [[Second Council of Orange]]. This council is not accepted by the Eastern churches and the Roman Catholic Church's use{{Failed verification|date=August 2010|reason = the citation says nothing of an alleged use or even a single instance of the Roman Catholic Church describing "their position" (whose?) and Cassian himself as semi-Pelagian - and Florovsky explicitly says that there wasn't unanimity within the Latin Church}}&lt;ref&gt;Council of Orange local Council, never accepted in the East, 529 AD Convened regarding Pelagianism. Condemned various beliefs of Pelagianism: that humans are unaffected by Adam's sin, that a person's move towards God can begin without grace, that an increase of faith can be attained apart from grace, that salvation can be attained apart from the Holy Spirit, that man's free will can be restored from its destruction apart from baptism, that 'merit' may precede grace, that man can do good and attain salvation without God's help, Statement we must, under the blessing of God, preach and believe as follows. The sin of the first man has so impaired and weakened free will that no one thereafter can either love God as he ought or believe in God or do good for God's sake, unless the grace of divine mercy has preceded him....According to the Roman Catholic faith we also believe that after grace has been received through baptism, all baptized persons have the ability and responsibility, if they desire to labor faithfully, to perform with the aid and cooperation of Christ what is of essential importance in regard to the salvation of their soul. We not only do not believe that any are foreordained to evil by the power of God, but even state with utter abhorrence that if there are those who want to believe so evil a thing, they are anathema. We also believe and confess to our benefit that in every good work it is not we who take the initiative and are then assisted through the mercy of God, but God himself first inspires in us both faith in him and love for him without any previous good works of our own that deserve reward, so that we may both faithfully seek the sacrament of baptism, and after baptism be able by his help to do what is pleasing to him.

Although the Roman Catholic Church explicitly teaches that "original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants",&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 405] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904224955/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM |date=September 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some Eastern Orthodox nevertheless claim that Roman Catholicism professes the teaching, which they attribute to Saint Augustine, that everyone bears not only the consequence, but also the guilt of Adam's sin.&lt;ref&gt;So far Roman Catholicism agrees with the Church; it differs with Orthodoxy on the nature of man's fall and the human condition. Following Augustine of Hippo, the Latins teach that Adam and Eve sinned against God. The guilt of their sin has been inherited by every man, woman and child after them. All humanity is liable for their "original sin." WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORTHODOXY AND ROMAN CATHOLICISM? by Father [[Michael Azkoul]] [http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/reading/ortho_cath.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Orthodox, I discovered, objected to the Roman Catholic understanding of original sin as the stain of inherited guilt passed down from Adam, as a result of his sin, to the rest of the human race. The Orthodox saw this notion of original sin as skewed, drawing almost exclusively on the thought of Saint Augustine. He had virtually ignored the teachings of the Eastern Fathers, who tended to see original sin not as inherited guilt but rather as "the ancestral curse" by which human beings were alienated from the divine life and thus became subject to corruption and death.

As I read further, I discovered that Saint Augustine's and consequently, the Roman Catholic Church's view was the result of the faulty Latin translation of Romans 5:12, the New Testament passage on which the teaching of original sin is based. When the original Greek is properly translated it reads, "Therefore, as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and death spread to all in that (eph ho) all sinned.  . ." The Latin which Augustine used rendered the eph ho ("in that") as in
&gt; quo ("in whom"), meaning "in Adam." Thus the passage was misconstrued as saying that all sinned in Adam, that all shared in the guilt of his original disobedience.

It is understandable how the Roman Catholic doctrine of original sin followed from this misinterpretation. It is also easy to see why the Orthodox rejected the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. Because they understood original sin in terms of the ancestral curse of human mortality, they saw Pius IX's dogma as amounting to no less than an assertion of Mary's immortality! That is, by saying that Mary was free from original sin, the Roman Church in effect was saying that Mary was not mortal! She was therefore not like the rest of the human race. This was something no Orthodox Christian could accept. In fact, Orthodoxy calls Mary "the first of the redeemed", the first human to receive the great blessing of salvation now available to all mankind.

The Orthodox Church holds to the teaching of [[synergy]] (συνεργός, meaning working together), which says that man has the freedom to, and must if he wants to be saved, choose to accept and work with the grace of God. Once baptised the experience of his salvation and relationship with God is called [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]. Mankind has free will to accept or reject the grace of God. Rejection of the gifts of God is called blasphemy of the Holy Spirit (gifts of grace, faith, life).&lt;ref&gt;We receive the grace of Christ in the Holy Spirit, and without the Holy Spirit no one can have faith in Christ (I Cor. 12:3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Alexandria: "For it is unworkable for the soul of man to achieve any of the goods, namely, to control its own passions and to escape the mightiness of the sharp trap of the devil, unless he is fortified by the grace of the Holy Spirit and on this count he has Christ himself in his soul." (Against Julian, 3)&lt;/ref&gt; The first who defined this teaching was [[John Cassian]], 4th-century Church Father, and a pupil of [[John Chrysostom]], and all Eastern Fathers accept it. He taught that "Divine grace is necessary to enable a sinner to return unto God and live, yet man must first, of himself, desire and attempt to choose and obey God", and that "Divine grace is indispensable for salvation, but it does not necessarily need to precede a free human choice, because, despite the weakness of human volition, the will can take the initiative toward God.".{{Citation needed|date=July 2010|reason = Are these 20th-century-sounding quotations really Cassian's words or only something taken from the Elwell Evangelical Dictionary? They seem to go far beyond what I have so far found in the much-cited conference of John Cassian.  Did I miss them?}}

Some Orthodox use an example of a drowning man to illustrate the teaching of synergy: God from the ship throws a rope to a drowning man, the man may take the rope if he wants to be saved, but he may decide not to take the rope and perish by his own will. Explaining both that salvation is a gift from God and man cannot save himself. That man must co-work (syn-ergo) with God in the process of salvation.

====Arminianism====
{{Main article|History of Calvinist–Arminian debate}}

Christians who were influenced by the teachings of [[Jacobus Arminius]] (such as [[Methodists]]) believe that while God is all-knowing and always knows what choices each person will make, and he still gives them the ability to choose or not choose everything, regardless of whether there are any internal or external factors contributing to that choice. 

Like [[John Calvin]], Arminius affirmed [[total depravity]], but Arminius believed that only [[prevenient grace]] allowed people to choose salvation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Concerning grace and free will, this is what I teach according to the Scriptures and orthodox consent: Free will is unable to begin or to perfect any true and spiritual good, without grace....  This grace [''prœvenit''] goes before, accompanies, and follows; it excites, assists, operates that we will, and co operates lest we will in vain.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus Arminius, ''The Works of James Arminius, D.D., Formerly Professor of Divinity in the University of Leyden'' (Auburn, NY: Derby and Miller, 1853), 4:472.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prevenient grace is [[divine grace]] which precedes human decision. It exists prior to and without reference to anything humans may have done. As humans are corrupted by the effects of [[sin]], prevenient grace allows persons to engage their God-given [[free will]] to choose the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ or to reject that salvific offer.

[[Thomas Jay Oord]] offers perhaps the most cogent free will theology presupposing prevenient grace. What he calls "essential kenosis" says God acts preveniently to give freedom/agency to all creatures. This gift comes from God's eternal essence, and is therefore necessary. God remains free in choosing how to love, but the fact that God loves and therefore gives freedom/agency to others is a necessary part of what it means to be divine.

This view is backed in the Bible with verses such as [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke13:34&amp;version=NKJV Luke 13:34], NKJV
&lt;blockquote&gt;
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!” 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here we see Jesus lamenting that He is unable to save [[Jerusalem]] as they are not willing. We see that whilst Jesus wants to save Jerusalem He respects their choice to continue on in sin despite His will that they be saved.

====Lutheranism====
{{main article|Lutheranism}}
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%202:14;&amp;version=50; 1 Cor. 2:14], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%2012:3;&amp;version=31; 12:3], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.%208:7;&amp;version=31; Rom. 8:7], [[Martin Chemnitz]], [[Examination of the Council of Trent]]: Vol. I. Trans. Fred Kramer,  St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1971, pp. 409-53, "Seventh Topic, Concerning Free Will: From the Decree of the Sixth Session of the Council of Trent".&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans believe that although humans have free will concerning civil righteousness, they cannot work spiritual righteousness without the Holy Spirit, since righteousness in the heart cannot be wrought in the absence of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.html#article18 Augsburg Confession, Article 18, Of Free Will].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, humanity is free to choose and act in every regard except for the choice of salvation.

Lutherans also teach that sinners, while capable of doing works that are outwardly "good," are [[Incurvatus in se|not capable]] of doing works that satisfy God's justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7:18 Rom. 7:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:7;&amp;version=9; 8:7] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor.%202:14;&amp;version=31; 1 Cor. 2:14], [[Martin Chemnitz]], Examination of the Council of Trent: Vol. I. Trans. Fred Kramer,  St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1971, pp. 639-52, "The Third Question: Whether the Good Works of the Regenerate in This Life Are So Perfect that They Fully, Abundantly, and Perfectly Satisfy the Divine Law".&lt;/ref&gt; Every human thought and deed is infected with sin and [[Concupiscence|sinful motives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%206:5;&amp;version=9; Gen. 6:5], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%208:21;&amp;version=31;#en-NIV-205 8:21], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat.%207:17;&amp;version=31; Mat. 7:17], [[Charles Porterfield Krauth|Krauth, C.P.]],&lt;cite&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qiURAAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=388 The Conservative Reformation and Its Theology: As Represented in the Augsburg Confession, and in the History and Literature of the Evangelical Lutheran Church] &lt;/cite&gt;. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott. 1875. pp. 388-90, Part IX The Specific Doctrines Of The Conservative Reformation: Original Sin, Thesis VII The Results, Section ii Positive.&lt;/ref&gt; For Luther himself, in his ''Bondage of the Will'', people are by nature endowed with free-will/free choice in regard to “goods and possessions” with which a person “has the right of using, acting, and omitting according to his Free-will.” However, in “God-ward” things pertaining to “salvation or damnation” people are in bondage “either to the will of God, or to the will of Satan.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823),  66.&lt;/ref&gt;

As found in [[Paul Althaus]]’ study of Luther’s theology,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Althaus, ''The Theology of Martin Luther'' (Fortress, 1966), §§ “The Bondage of the Will” and “Original Sin,” 156-170, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; sin’s infection of every human thought and deed began with [[Fall of man|Adam’s fall]] into sin, the [[Original sin|Original Sin]]. Adam’s fall was a “terrible example” of what “free will” will do unless God constantly motivates it to virtuous behavior. Humanity inherits Adam’s sin. Thus, in our “natural condition,” we have an inborn desire to sin because that is the person we are by birth. As Luther noted, “Adam sinned willingly and freely and from him a will to sin has been born into us so that we cannot sin innocently but only voluntarily.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Althaus, ''The Theology of Martin Luther'' (Fortress, 1966), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial term ''liberum arbitrium'' was translated “free-will” by [[Henry Cole (minister)|Henry Cole]]&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823)&lt;/ref&gt; and “free will” remains in general use. However, the [[Ernest Gordon Rupp|Rupp]]/Watson study of Luther and Erasmus chose “free choice” as the translation and provided a rationale.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson, ''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'' (Westminister, 1969), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther used “free choice” (or “free-will”) to denote the fact that humans act “spontaneously” and with “a desirous willingness.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 60&lt;/ref&gt; He also allowed “Free-will” as that “power” by which humans “can be caught by the Spirit” of God.&lt;ref&gt;63BOWCole&lt;/ref&gt; However, he deplored the use of the term “Free-will” because it is too “grand, copious, and full.” Therefore, Luther held that the inborn faculty of “willingness” should be “called by some other term.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cole, trans, ''Martin Luther on the Bondage of the Will'' (London, T. Bensley, 1823), 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although our wills are a function of and are in bondage to our inherited sinful desires, Luther insisted that we sin “voluntarily.” Voluntarily means that we sin of our own free will.&lt;ref&gt;“Voluntarily” means “of one's own free will.” http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/voluntarily&lt;/ref&gt; We will to do what we desire. As long as we desire sin, our wills are only free for sin. This is Luther’s “bondage of the will” to sin. The sinner’s “will is bound, but it is and remains ''his'' will. He repeatedly and voluntarily acts according to it.” So it is, to be set free from sin and for righteousness requires a “rebirth through faith.”&lt;ref&gt;Paul Althaus, ''The Theology of Martin Luther'' (Fortress, 1966), 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; A rebirth of faith gives “true freedom from sin,” which is, wrote Luther, "a liberty [freedom] to do good.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Commentary on Romans'', J. Theodore Mueller, translator (Kregel Classics, 1976), xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

To use a biblical word important to Luther, to be set free ''from'' sin and ''for'' righteousness requires a [[Metanoia (theology)|metanoia]].&lt;ref&gt;Treadwell Walden, ''The Great Meaning of the Word Metanoia: Lost in the Old Version, Unrecovered in the New'' (Thomas Whittaker, 1896), 26, footnote #1. Available online in Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther used Jesus’ image of [[The Tree and its Fruits|the good and bad trees]] to depict the necessity of changing the person to change what a person wills and does. In Jesus’ image, “a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit” (Matthew 7:18).&lt;ref&gt;Steven D. Paulson, ''Luther for the Armchair Theologians'' (Westminster John Knox, 2004), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the bad tree that can only produce bad fruit, before a rebirth through faith, people are in bondage to the sinful desires of their hearts. They can only will to do sin, albeit “spontaneously and with a desirous willingness.”&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Lutzer, ''The Doctrines That Divide: A Fresh Look at the Historic Doctrines That Separate Christians'' (Kregel, 1998), 172-173.&lt;/ref&gt; Given his view of the human condition, Luther concluded that, without a rebirth, the “free choice” that all humans possess is “not free at all” because it cannot of itself free itself from its inherent bondage to sin.&lt;ref&gt;''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'', edited by Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson (Westminister, 1969), 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Luther distinguished between different kinds of freedom: (a) by nature, a freedom to act as we will and (b) by rebirth through faith, a freedom to act righteously.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, “On the Bondage of the Will” (1525), in ''Luther and Erasmus: Free Will and Salvation'', edited by Ernest Gordon Rupp and Philip Saville Watson (Westminister, 1969, reissued by Westminster John Knox, 2006), 27, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

====God and creation====
Orthodox Lutheran theology holds that God made the world, including humanity, perfect, holy and sinless. However, [[Adam and Eve]] chose to disobey God, trusting in their own strength, knowledge, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Sponheim, "The Origin of Sin," in &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;, Carl E. Braaten and Robert W. Jenson, eds. (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984), 385–407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pieper"&gt;[[Franz August Otto Pieper|Francis Pieper]], "Definition of Original Sin," in &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt; (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1953), 1:538.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, people are saddled with [[Original sin#Lutheranism|original sin]], born sinful and unable to avoid committing sinful acts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Porterfield Krauth|Krauth, C.P.]],&lt;cite&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qiURAAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=355 The Conservative Reformation and Its Theology: As Represented in the Augsburg Confession, and in the History and Literature of the Evangelical Lutheran Church] &lt;/cite&gt;. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott. 1875. pp. 335-455, Part IX The Specific Doctrines Of The Conservative Reformation: Original Sin.&lt;/ref&gt; For Lutherans, original sin is the "chief sin, a root and fountainhead of all actual sins."&lt;ref&gt;[[Formula of Concord]], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-sd/originalsin.html Original Sin].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lutherans, God preserves his creation, in doing so cooperates with everything that happens, and guides the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J.T., ''Christian Dogmatics''.

====Predestination====
Lutherans believe that the elect are predestined to salvation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:48;&amp;version=9; Acts 13:48], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph.%201:4-11;&amp;version=47; Eph. 1:4–11], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

''The Lutheran Witness 2''(6). English Evangelical Missouri Synod: Baltimore. 1891, pp. 41ff.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lutheranism, the central final hope of the Christian is "the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting" as confessed in the [[Apostles' Creed]] rather than predestination.

Lutherans disagree with those that make predestination the source of salvation rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection. Lutherans reject the Calvinist doctrine of the [[perseverance of the saints]]. Like both Calvinist camps, Lutherans view the work of salvation as monergistic in that "the natural [that is, corrupted and divinely unrenewed] powers of man cannot do anything or help towards salvation" ([[Formula of Concord]]: [http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/freewill.html Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 71]), and Lutherans go further along the same lines as the Free Grace advocates to say that the recipient of saving grace need not cooperate with it. Hence, Lutherans believe that a true Christian (that is, a genuine recipient of saving grace) can lose his or her salvation, "[b]ut the cause is not as though God were unwilling to grant grace for perseverance to those in whom He has begun the good work... [but that these persons] wilfully turn away..." ([http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/election.html Formula of Concord: Solid Declaration, art. xi, par. 42]). Unlike Calvinists, Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim.%202:4;&amp;version=31; 1 Tim. 2:4], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet.%203:9;&amp;version=31; 2 Pet. 3:9], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election. Epitome of the Formula of Concord, Article 11, Election], and Engelder's [https://archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 Popular Symbolics], Part XXXI. The Election of Grace, pp. 124-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%2013:9;&amp;version=9; Hos. 13:9], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;.

"Eternal Death", paragraph 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anabaptism====
The [[Anabaptist]] movement was characterized by the fundamental belief in the free will of man. Many earlier movements such as [[Waldensians]] and others likewise held this viewpoint.  Denominations today representing this view include [[Old Order Mennonites]], [[Amish]], and [[Conservative Mennonites]].

====Calvinism====
{{main article|Calvinism}}
[[John Calvin]] ascribed “free will” to all people in the sense that they act “voluntarily, and not by compulsion.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.23.2. Available online at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.toc.html CCEL.org.&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated his position by allowing "that man has choice and that it is self-determined” and that his actions stem from “his own voluntary choosing.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin from ''Bondage and Liberation of the Will'', edited by A.N.S. Lane, translated by G. I. Davies (Baker Academic, 2002) 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The free will that Calvin ascribed to all people is what [[Mortimer Adler#Freedom and free will|Mortimer Adler]] calls the “natural freedom” of the will. This freedom to will what one desires is inherent in all people.&lt;ref name="Mortimer J. Adler 1958"/&gt;

Calvin held this kind of inherent/natural&lt;ref&gt;Inherent and natural are synonyms. http://thesaurus.com/browse/inherent.&lt;/ref&gt; free will in disesteem because unless people acquire the freedom to live as they ought by being transformed, they will desire and voluntarily choose to sin. “Man is said to have free will,” wrote Calvin, “because he acts voluntarily, and not by compulsion. This is perfectly true: but why should so small a matter have been dignified with so proud a title?”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, II.2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The glitch in this inherent/natural freedom of the will is that although all people have the “faculty of willing,” by nature they are unavoidably (and yet voluntarily without compulsion) under “the bondage of sin.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, II.3.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The kind of free will that Calvin esteems is what Adler calls “acquired freedom” of the will, the freedom/ability&lt;ref&gt;Freedom and ability are synonyms. http://thesaurus.com/browse/freedom.&lt;/ref&gt; “to live as [one] ought.” To possess acquired free will requires a change by which a person acquires a desire to live a life marked by virtuous qualities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As Calvin describes the change required for acquired freedom, the will “must be wholly transformed and renovated.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, II.3.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin depicts this transformation as “a new heart and a new spirit (Ezek. 18:31).” It sets one free from “bondage to sin” and enables “piety towards God, and love towards men, general holiness and purity of life.”&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', trans. Henry Beveridge, III.3.6, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] embrace the idea of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]], namely, that God chose who would be saved and who would be not saved prior to the creation.  They quote Ephesians 1:4 "For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight" and also 2:8 "For it is by grace you are saved, through faith, and this not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." One of the strongest defenders of this theological point of view was the American [[Puritan]] preacher and theologian [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]].

Edwards believed that indeterminism was incompatible with individual dependence on God and hence with his sovereignty. He reasoned that if individuals' responses to God's grace are contra-causally free, then their salvation depends partly on them and therefore God's sovereignty is not "absolute and universal." Edwards' book ''Freedom of the Will'' defends theological determinism. In this book, Edwards attempts to show that libertarianism is incoherent. For example, he argues that by 'self-determination' the libertarian must mean either that one's actions including one's acts of willing are preceded by an act of free will or that one's acts of will lack sufficient causes. The first leads to an infinite regress while the second implies that acts of will happen accidentally and hence can't make someone "better or worse, any more than a tree is better than other trees because it oftener happens to be lit upon by a swan or nightingale; or a rock more vicious than other rocks, because rattlesnakes have happened oftener to crawl over it."&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom of the Will'', 1754; Edwards 1957-, vol. 1, pp. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be thought that this view completely denies freedom of choice, however. It claims that man is free to act on his strongest moral impulse and volition, which is externally determined, but is not free to act contrary to them, or to alter them. Proponents, such as [[John L. Girardeau]], have indicated their belief that moral neutrality is impossible; that even if it were possible, and one were equally inclined to contrary options, one could make no choice at all; that if one is inclined, however slightly, toward one option, then that person will necessarily choose that one over any others.

Some non-Calvinist Christians attempt a reconciliation of the dual concepts of predestination and free will by pointing to the situation of God as Christ. In taking the form of a man, a necessary element of this process was that Jesus Christ lived the existence of a mortal. When Jesus was born he was not born with the omniscient power of God the Creator, but with the mind of a human child - yet he was still God in essence. The precedent this creates is that God is able to will the abandonment of His knowledge, or ignore knowledge, while remaining fully God. Thus it is not inconceivable that although omniscience demands that God knows what the future holds for individuals, it is within his power to deny this knowledge in order to preserve individual free will. Other theologians argue that the Calvinist-Edwardsean view suggests that if all human volitions are predetermined by God, then all actions dictated by fallen will of man necessarily satisfy His sovereign decree. Hence, it is impossible to act outside of God's perfect will, a conclusion some non-Calvinists claim poses a serious problem for ethics and [[moral theology]].

An early proposal toward such a reconciliation states that God is, in fact, not aware of future events, but rather, being eternal, He is outside time, and sees the past, present, and future as one whole creation.  Consequently, it is not as though God would know "in advance" that [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] would become guilty of homicide years prior to the event as an example, but that He was aware of it from all eternity, viewing all time as a single present.  This was the view offered by [[Boethius]] in Book V of ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]''.

Calvinist theologian [[Loraine Boettner]] argued that the doctrine of divine foreknowledge does not escape the alleged problems of divine foreordination. He wrote that "what God foreknows must, in the very nature of the case, be as fixed and certain as what is foreordained; and if one is inconsistent with the free agency of man, the other is also. Foreordination renders the events certain, while foreknowledge presupposes that they are certain."[https://web.archive.org/web/20060805100404/http://www.solagratia.org/Articles/The_Foreknowledge_of_God.aspx] Some Christian theologians, feeling the bite of this argument, have opted to limit the doctrine of foreknowledge if not do away with it altogether, thus forming a new school of thought, similar to [[Socinianism]] and [[process theology]], called [[open theism]].

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{Main article|Agency (LDS Church)}}
[[Mormonism|Mormons]] or Latter-day Saints, believe that God has given all humans the gift of moral agency. Moral agency includes free will and [[Agency (Mormonism)|agency]]. Proper exercise of unfettered choice leads to the ultimate goal of returning to God's presence. Having the choice to do right or wrong was important, because God wants a society of a certain type—those that comply with eternal laws. Before this Earth was created, this dispute over agency rose to the level that there was a "[[War of Heaven|war in heaven]]." [[Lucifer]] (who favored no agency) and his followers were cast out of heaven for rebelling against God's will.  Many Mormon leaders have also taught that the battle in Heaven over agency is now being carried out on earth{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, where dictators, influenced by Satan, fight against freedom (or free agency) in governments contrary to the will of God.

Mormons also believe in a limited form of foreordination — not in deterministic, unalterable decrees, but rather in callings from God for individuals to perform specific missions in mortality. Those who are foreordained can reject the foreordination, either outright or by transgressing the laws of God and becoming unworthy to fulfill the call.

===New Church===
[[The New Church]], or Swedenborgianism, teaches that every person has complete freedom to choose heaven or hell. [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], upon whose writings the New Church is founded, argued that if God is love itself, people must have free will.  If God is love itself, then He desires no harm to come to anyone: and so it is impossible that he would predestine anyone to hell.  On the other hand, if God is love itself, then He must love things outside of Himself; and if people do not have the freedom to choose evil, they are simply extensions of God, and He cannot love them as something outside of Himself.  In addition, Swedenborg argues that if a person does not have free will to choose goodness and faith, then all of the commandments in the Bible to love God and the neighbor are worthless, since no one can choose to do them - and it is impossible that a God who is love itself and wisdom itself would give impossible commandments.

==Hinduism==
{{see also|Free will#In Hindu philosophy}}
As [[Hinduism]] is primarily a conglomerate of different religious traditions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuhcs.org.uk/info.faq.php Cambridge University HCS] "Since Hinduism is itself a conglomerate of religions, an attitude of tolerance and acceptance of the validity of other belief systems has long been a part of Hindu thought."&lt;/ref&gt; there is no one accepted view on the concept of free will. Within the predominant schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] there are two main opinions. The [[Advaita]] ([[monistic]]) schools generally believe in a [[destiny|fate]]-based approach, and the [[Dvaita]] ([[Dualistic cosmology#Theistic dualism|dualistic]]) schools are proponents for the theory of free will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrologyforthesoul.com/vp/predictiveastrologyfatekarmafreewill.htm Predictive Astrology - Understanding Karma, Fate, &amp; Free Will ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206040507/http://www.astrologyforthesoul.com/vp/predictiveastrologyfatekarmafreewill.htm |date=2006-12-06 }} "“Dvaita” or dualism and is generally a proponent of a free will orientation. The path of surrender or non-action, represents “Advaita” or non-dualism and is generally a proponent of fate orientation."&lt;/ref&gt; The different schools' understandings are based upon their conceptions of the nature of the supreme Being (see [[Brahman]], [[Paramatma]] and [[Ishvara]]) and how the individual soul ([[Atman (Hinduism)|atma]] or [[jiva]]) dictates, or is dictated by [[karma]] within the illusory existence of [[Maya (illusion)|maya]].

In both Dvaita and Advaita schools, and also in the many other traditions within Hinduism, there is a strong belief in [[destiny]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/nineb/ Himalayan Academy] "Hindus believe in karma, the law of cause and effect by which each individual creates his own destiny by his thoughts, words and deeds"&lt;/ref&gt; and that both the past and future are known, or viewable, by certain [[saint]]s or [[rishi|mystics]] as well as by the supreme being ([[Ishvara]]) in traditions where Ishvara is worshipped as an ''all-knowing being''. In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Avatar]], [[Krishna]] says to [[Arjuna]]: 
*''I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedabase.com/en/bg/7/26 Bhagavad Gita 7.26] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220001/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/26/en1 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this belief in destiny is not necessarily believed to rule out the existence of free will, as in some cases both free will and destiny are believed to exist simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/27/en1 Bhagavad-Gita 3.27] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707123748/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/3/27/en1 |date=2012-07-07 }} "The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedabase.net/bg/15/7/en1 B-Gita 15.7 purport] "As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] also states:
:: ''Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone's sinful or pious activities'' (Bhagavad Gita 5.15)
:: ''From wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the self'' (Bhagavad Gita 6.26), indicating that God does not control anyone's will, and that it is possible to control the mind.

===Different approaches===
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] give differing opinions: In the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.  For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will.  The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name="viveka"&gt;Swami Vivekananda (1907) "Freedom" from The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. vol. 1.  [http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/vol_1 ((online))]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Vivekananda's above quote can't be taken as a literal refutation of all free will, as Vivekanda's teacher, [[Ramakrishna Paramahansa]] used to teach that man is like a goat tied to a stake - the karmic debts and human nature bind him and the amount of free will he has is analogous to the amount of freedom the rope allows; as one progresses spiritually, the rope becomes longer.

On the other hand, [[Mimamsa]], [[Vedanta]], and the more theistic versions of Hinduism such as [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] have often emphasized the importance of free will. For example, in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] the living beings ([[jiva]]s) are described as being of a ''higher nature'' who have the freedom to exploit the inferior material nature ([[prakrti]]):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/5/en1 Bhagavad Gita 7.5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301173148/http://bhagavadgitaasitis.com/7/5/en1 |date=2007-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The doctrine of [[Karma in Hinduism]] requires both that we pay for our actions in the past, and that our actions in the present be free enough to allow us to deserve the future reward or punishment that we will receive for our present actions. The [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitin]] philosopher [[Chandrashekhara Bharati|Chandrashekhara Bharati Swaminah]] puts it this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fate is past karma, free-will is present karma.  Both are really one, that is, karma, though they may differ in the matter of time.  There can be no conflict when they are really one.

Fate, as I told you, is the resultant of the past exercise of your free-will.  By exercising your free-will in the past, you brought on the resultant fate.  By exercising your free-will in the present, I want you to wipe out your past record if it hurts you, or to add to it if you find it enjoyable.  In any case, whether for acquiring more happiness or for reducing misery, you have to exercise your free-will in the present.&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;[[Chandrashekhara Bharati]] in ''Dialogues with the Guru'' by R. Krishnaswami Aiyar, Chetana Limited, Bombay, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Islam==
{{See also|Predestination in Islam}}
Disputes about free will in [[Islam]] began with the [[Mu'tazili]] vs [[Hanbali]] disputes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldschmit|first=Arthur|title=A Concise History of the Middle East|year=2010|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-4388-4|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Mu'tazili arguing that humans had ''qadar'', the capacity to do right or wrong, and thus deserved the reward or punishment they received, whereas Hanbali insisted on God's ''jabr'', or total power and initiative in managing all events.&lt;ref&gt;Denny, Frederick. An Introduction to Islam, 1985 Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools that developed around earlier thinkers such as [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] searched for ways to explain how both human ''qadar'' and divine ''jabr'' could be asserted at the same time.  Ash'ari develops a "dual agency" or "acquisition" account of free will in which every human action has two distinct agents. God creates the possibility of a human action with his divine ''jabr'', but then the human follows through and "acquires" the act, making it theirs and taking responsibility for it using their human ''qadar''.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Montgomery. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948.; Wolfson, Harry. The Philosophy of Kalam, 1976 Harvard University Press and {{cite web |url=http://umcc.ais.org/~maftab/ip/pdf/bktxt/kalam.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823124700/http://umcc.ais.org/~maftab/ip/pdf/bktxt/kalam.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
The belief in free will ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''bechirah chofshit'' בחירה חפשית, ''bechirah'' בחירה) is [[axiom]]atic in [[Jewish principles of faith|Jewish thought]], and is closely linked with the concept of reward and punishment, based on the [[Torah]] itself: "I [God] have set before you life and death, blessing and curse: therefore choose life" ( [[Deuteronomy]] 30:19).

Free will is therefore discussed at length in [[Jewish philosophy]], firstly as regards God's purpose in [[Creation myth|creation]], and secondly as regards the closely related, resultant, [[paradox]]. The topic is also often discussed in connection with [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]], [[Divine simplicity]] and [[Divine Providence#In Jewish thought|Divine Providence]], as well as [[Jewish principles of faith]] in general.

===Free will and creation===
The traditional teaching regarding the purpose of [[Jewish principles of faith#God as Creator of the universe|creation]], particularly as influenced by [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], is that "This world is like a corridor to the [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba (the world to come)|World to Come]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' {{cite web |url=http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/04-16.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830200534/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/04-16.htm |archivedate=2006-08-30 |df= }} 4:16]&lt;/ref&gt; "Man was created for the sole purpose of rejoicing in God, and deriving pleasure from the splendor of His Presence… The place where this joy may truly be derived is the World to Come, which was expressly created to provide for it; but the path to the object of our desires is this world..."&lt;ref&gt;([[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'', [http://www.shechem.org/torah/mesyesh/1.htm Ch.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912040826/http://www.shechem.org/torah/mesyesh/1.htm |date=2006-09-12 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Free will is thus required by God's justice, “otherwise, Man would not be given or denied good for actions over which he had no control”.&lt;ref name="aish.com"&gt;http://www.aish.com/literacy/concepts/The_Essence_of_Mankind.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

It is further understood that in order for Man to have true free choice, he must not only have inner free will, but also an environment in which a choice between obedience and disobedience exists. God thus created the world such that both good and evil can operate freely, this is the meaning of the rabbinic [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]], "All is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven".&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]], ''Berachot'' 33b)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maimonides,
{{quote|Free will is granted to every man. If he desires to incline towards the good way and be righteous, he has the power to do so; and if he desires to incline towards the unrighteous way and be a wicked man, he also has the power to do so. Give no place in your minds to that which is asserted by many of the ignorant: namely that the Holy One, blessed be He, decrees that a man from his birth should be either righteous or wicked. Since the power of doing good or evil is in our own hands, and since all the wicked deeds which we have committed have been committed with our full consciousness, it befits us to turn in penitence and to forsake our evil deed.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The paradox of free will===
In [[rabbinic literature]], there is much discussion as to the apparent [[contradiction]] between God's [[omniscience]] and free will. The representative view is that "Everything is foreseen; yet free will is given".&lt;ref&gt;([[Rabbi Akiva]], ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' [http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/03-15.htm 3:15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830203834/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/03-15.htm |date=2006-08-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this understanding, the problem is formally described as a [[paradox]], beyond our understanding.
{{quote|The Holy One, Blessed Be He, knows everything that will happen before it has happened. So does He know whether a particular person will be righteous or wicked, or not? If He does know, then it will be impossible for that person not to be righteous. If He knows that he will be righteous but that it is possible for him to be wicked, then He does not know everything that He has created. ...[T]he Holy One, Blessed Be He, does not have any temperaments and is outside such realms, unlike people, whose selves and temperaments are two separate things. God and His temperaments are one, and God's existence is beyond the comprehension of Man… [Thus] we do not have the capabilities to comprehend how the Holy One, Blessed Be He, knows all creations and events. [Nevertheless] know without doubt that people do what they want without the Holy One, Blessed Be He, forcing or decreeing upon them to do so... It has been said because of this that a man is judged according to all his actions.|[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panix.com/~jjbaker/MadaT.html ''Teshuva'' 5:5]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The paradox is explained, but not resolved, by observing that God exists outside of [[time]], and therefore, his knowledge of the future is exactly the same as his knowledge of the past and present. Just as his knowledge of the past does not interfere with man's free will, neither does his knowledge of the future.&lt;ref name="aish.com"/&gt; This distinction, between [[Foreknowledge of God|foreknowledge]] and [[predestination]], is in fact discussed by [[Abraham ibn Daud]].

One [[analogy]] here is that of [[time travel]]. The time traveller, having returned from the future, knows in advance what x will do, but while he knows what x will do, that knowledge does not cause x to do so: x had free will, even while the time traveller had foreknowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/John_Gribbin/timetrav.htm#time_an_illusion See]&lt;/ref&gt; One objection raised against this analogy – and ibn Daud’s distinction – is that if x truly has free will, he may choose to act otherwise when the event in question comes to pass, and therefore the time traveller (or God) merely has knowledge of a ''possible'' event: even having seen the event, there is no way to know with certainty what x will do; see the view of [[Gersonides]] below.  Further, the presence of the time traveller, may have had some [[chaos theory|chaotic]] effect on x's circumstances and choice, absent when the event comes to pass in the present.)

===Alternate approaches===
Although the above discussion of the paradox represents the majority Rabbinic view, there are several major thinkers who resolve the issue by explicitly ''excluding'' human action from divine foreknowledge.

Both [[Emunoth ve-Deoth#iv Free will: obedience and disobedience|Saadia Gaon]] and [[Judah ha-Levi]] hold that "the decisions of man precede God's knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=363&amp;letter=F&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gersonides]] holds that God knows, beforehand, the choices open to each individual, but does not know which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make. [[Isaiah Horowitz]] takes the view that God cannot know which moral choices people will make, but that, nevertheless, this does not impair his perfection.

In line with this thinking, the teaching from ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' above, is then to be read as: "Everything&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chagigah]]'' [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l2b01.htm 5b]: " Rab said: Even the superfluous conversation between a man and his wife is declared to a person in the hour of his death."&lt;/ref&gt; is ''observed'' (while - and no matter where - it happens), ''and'' (since the actor is unaware of being observed) free will is given ".&lt;ref&gt;See for example, the [[Mishnah#Commentaries|commentary]] of  "The Bartenura", [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], ''[[ad loc]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kabbalistic thought===
The existence of free will, and the paradox above (as addressed by either approach), is closely linked to the concept of ''[[Tzimtzum]]''. ''Tzimtzum'' entails the idea that God "constricted" his [[Infinity|infinite]] essence, to allow for the existence of a "conceptual space" in which a [[wiktionary:finite|finite]], independent world could exist. This "constriction" made free will possible, and hence the potential to earn the [[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba - the afterlife and the world to come|World to Come]].

Further, according to the first approach, it is understood that the Free-will Omniscience paradox provides a temporal parallel to the paradox inherent within ''Tzimtzum''. In granting free will, God has somehow "constricted" his foreknowledge, to allow for Man's independent action; He thus has foreknowledge and yet free will exists. In the case of ''Tzimtzum'', God has "constricted" his essence to allow for Man's independent existence; He is thus [[Immanence|immanent]] and yet [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]].

A '''functional block diagram''' in [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]] is a [[block diagram]]. It describes the functions and interrelationships of a [[system]]. 

The functional block diagram can picture:&lt;ref&gt;James Perozzo (1994) ''The complete guide to electronics troubleshooting''. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
* Functions of a system pictured by blocks  
* input and output elements of a block pictured with lines 
* the relationships between the functions, and 
* the functional sequences and paths for matter and or signals&lt;ref&gt;William H. Von Alven (1964) ''Reliability engineering'' explains: "Functional block diagrams show functional sequences and signal paths, and items which are wired in parallel are drawn in parallel" (p. 286)&lt;/ref&gt;
The block diagram can use additional schematic symbols to show particular properties. 

Functional block diagrams have been used in a wide range applications, from [[systems engineering]] to [[software engineering]], since the late 1950s. They became a necessity in complex systems design to "understand thoroughly from exterior design the operation of the present system and the relationship of each of the parts to the whole."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry H. Goode]], [[Robert Engel Machol]] (1957) System engineering: an introduction to the design of large-scale systems. p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many specific types of functional block diagrams have emerged. For example, the [[functional flow block diagram]] is a combination of the functional block diagram and the [[flow chart]]. Many software development methodologies are built with specific functional block diagram techniques. An example from the field of industrial computing is the [[Function Block Diagram]] (FBD), a graphical language for the design of [[programmable logic controller]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4690">The '''Harris–Todaro model''', named after [[John R. Harris]] and [[Michael Todaro]], is an economic model developed in 1970 and used in [[development economics]] and [[welfare economics]] to explain some of the issues concerning rural-urban [[Human migration|migration]]. The main assumption of the model is that the migration decision is based on expected income differentials between rural and urban areas rather than just wage differentials. This implies that rural-urban migration in a context of high urban unemployment can be economically rational if expected urban income exceeds expected rural income.

==Overview==
In the model, an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] is reached when the expected wage in urban areas (actual wage adjusted for the [[unemployment]] rate), is equal to the [[marginal product]] of an agricultural worker. The model assumes that unemployment is non-existent in the rural agricultural sector. It is also assumed that rural agricultural production and the subsequent labor market is [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]]. As a result, the agricultural rural wage is equal to agricultural marginal productivity. In equilibrium, the rural to urban migration rate will be zero since the expected rural income equals the expected urban income. However, in this equilibrium there will be positive unemployment in the urban sector. The model explains internal [[migration in China]] as the regional income gap has been proved to be a primary drive of rural-urban migration, while urban unemployment is local governments' main concern in many cities.&lt;ref name=paper5&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Zhong|title=Rural-Urban Migration in China – What Do We Know and What Do We Need to Know?|journal=China Center for Economic Research Peking University|date=2003|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e455/dfb811d8c35b4a776ffae3b351a8423ccb72.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formalism==
The formal statement of the equilibrium condition of the Harris–Todaro model is as follows:
*Let w&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; be the wage rate (marginal productivity of labor) in the rural agricultural sector.
*Let l&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; be the total number of jobs available in the urban sector, which should be equal to the number of employed urban workers.
*Let l&lt;sub&gt;us&lt;/sub&gt; be the total number of job seekers, employed and unemployed, in the urban sector.
*Let w&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; be the wage rate in the urban sector, which could possibly be set by government with a minimum wage law.

Rural to urban migration will take place if:
:&lt;math&gt;\ w_r &lt; \frac{l_e}{l_{us}} w_u &lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, urban to rural migration will occur if:
:&lt;math&gt;\ w_r &gt; \frac{l_e}{l_{us}} w_u &lt;/math&gt;

At equilibrium, 
:&lt;math&gt;\ w_r = \frac{l_e}{l_{us}} w_u &lt;/math&gt;

With the random matching of workers to available jobs, the ratio of available jobs to total job seekers gives the probability that any person moving from the agricultural sector to the urban sector will be able to find a job. As a result, in equilibrium, the agricultural wage rate is equal to the expected urban wage rate, which is the urban wage multiplied by the employment rate.

==Conclusions==
Therefore, migration from rural areas to urban areas will increase if:
*Urban wages (w&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;) increase in the urban sector (l&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;), increasing the expected urban income.
*[[Agricultural productivity]] decreases, lowering marginal productivity and wages in the agricultural sector (w&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), decreasing the expected rural income.

However, even though this migration creates unemployment and induces informal sector growth, this behavior is economically rational and utility-maximizing in the context of the Harris–Todaro model. As long as the migrating economic agents have complete and accurate information concerning rural and urban wage rates and probabilities of obtaining employment, they will make an expected income-maximizing decision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5994">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hopf lemma''', named after [[Eberhard Hopf]], states that if a continuous real-valued function in a domain in Euclidean space with sufficiently smooth boundary is harmonic in the interior and the value of the function at a point on the boundary is greater than the values at nearby points inside the domain, then the derivative of the function in the direction of the outward pointing normal is strictly positive. The lemma is an important tool in the proof of the [[maximum principle]] and in the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s. The Hopf lemma has been generalized to describe the behavior of the solution to an elliptic problem as it approaches a point on the boundary where its maximum is attained.

==Statement for harmonic functions==
Let Ω be a bounded domain in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with smooth boundary. Let ''f'' be a real-valued function continuous on the closure of Ω and [[harmonic function|harmonic]] on Ω. If ''x'' is a boundary point such that ''f''(''x'') &gt; ''f''(''y'') for all ''y'' in Ω sufficiently close to ''x'', then the (one-sided) [[directional derivative]] of ''f'' in the direction of the outward pointing normal to the boundary at ''x'' is strictly positive.

==Proof for harmonic functions==
Subtracting a constant, it can be assumed that ''f''(''x'') = 0 and ''f'' is strictly negative at interior points near ''x''. Since the boundary of Ω is smooth there is a small ball contained in Ω the closure of which is tangent to the boundary at ''x'' and intersects the boundary only at ''x''. It is then sufficient to check the result with Ω  replaced by this ball. Scaling and translating, it is enough to check the result for the unit ball in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, assuming ''f''(''x'') is zero for some unit vector ''x'' and ''f''(''y'') &lt; 0 if |''y''| &lt; 1.

By [[Harnack's inequality]] applied to −''f''

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{-f(rx)\ge -{1-r\over (1+r)^{n-1}} f(0),}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''r'' &lt; 1. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{f(x)-f(rx)\over 1-r}={-f(rx)\over 1-r} \ge -{1\over (1+r)^{n-1}} f(0)&gt; -{ f(0)\over 2^{n-1}} &gt;0.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the directional derivative at ''x'' is bounded below by the strictly positive constant on the right hand side.

==General discussion==
Consider  a second order, uniformly [[elliptic operator]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt; Lu = a_{ij}(x)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + b_i(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} + c(x)u, \qquad x \in \Omega.&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an open, bounded subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The Weak Maximum Principle states that a solution of the equation &lt;math&gt;Lu=0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; attains its maximum value on the closure &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; at some point on the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be such a point, then necessarily 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}(x_0) \geq 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial\nu&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[outer normal]] [[derivative]].  This is simply a consequence of the fact that &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; must be nondecreasing as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approach &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The Hopf Lemma strengthens this observation by proving that, under mild assumptions on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}(x_0) &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

A precise statement of the Lemma is as follows.  Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded region in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the operator described above.  Let &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; be of class &lt;math&gt;C^2(\Omega) \cap C^1(\overline{\Omega})&lt;/math&gt; and satisfy the differential inequality 
:&lt;math&gt; Lu \geq 0, \qquad \textrm{in}~ \Omega. &lt;/math&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be given so that &lt;math&gt; 0\leq u(x_0) = \max_{x \in \overline{\Omega}} u(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
If (i) &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, and (ii) &lt;math&gt;c \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then either &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, or &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}(x_0) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the outward pointing unit normal, as above.

The above result can be generalized in several respects.  The regularity assumption on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced with an interior ball condition:  the lemma holds provided that there exists an open ball &lt;math&gt;B \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \partial B&lt;/math&gt;.   It is also possible to consider functions &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; that take positive values, provided that &lt;math&gt;u(x_0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  For the proof and other discussion, see the references below.

In [[common law]], a '''hue and cry''' is a process by which bystanders are summoned to assist in the apprehension of a [[Crime|criminal]] who has been witnessed in the act of committing a [[crime]].

==History==
By the [[Statute of Winchester]] of 1285, 13 [[Edward I of England|Edw. I]] cc. 1 and 4, it was provided that anyone, either a [[constable]] or a private citizen, who witnessed a crime shall make hue and cry, and that the hue and cry must be kept up against the fleeing criminal from [[town]] to town and from [[county]] to county, until the felon is apprehended and delivered to the [[sheriff]]. All able-bodied men, upon hearing the shouts, were obliged to assist in the pursuit of the criminal, which makes it comparable to the ''[[posse comitatus (common law)|posse comitatus]]''. It was moreover provided that "the whole [[hundred (division)|hundred]] … shall be answerable" for any [[theft]] or [[robbery]], in effect a form of [[collective punishment]]. Those who raised a hue and cry falsely were themselves guilty of a crime.&lt;ref name="googlebooks"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTILAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;ots=1acfFeJFAJ&amp;dq=original%20text%20of%20Statute%20of%20Winchester%201285&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Statute of Winchester|editor=Adams, George Burton and Henry Morse Stephens|accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oath of office for [[constables]] in Tennessee specifically mentions that it is the duty of the constable to sound the hue and cry.&lt;ref group=note&gt;T.C.A. 8-10-108(b): ...according to the 1960 federal census or any subsequent federal census, and in Fentress County and Hamblen County, every constable shall take an oath that the constable will well and truly serve the state in the office of constable; that the constable will cause the peace of the state to be kept, to the best of the constable's power; that the constable will arrest all such persons as go in the constable's sight armed offensively, or who commit any riot, affray, or other breach of the peace, or will use the constable's best endeavor, on complaint made, to apprehend all felons, rioters, or persons riotously assembled; and that, if such persons flee or make resistance, the constable will pursue, '''and make hue and cry''', according to law; that the constable will faithfully, and without delay, execute and return all lawful process directed to the constable; and that the constable will well and truly, according to the constable's power and ability, do and execute all other duties of the office of constable.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
It is possible that the term is an Anglicization via [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] of the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|hutesium et clamor}}'', meaning "a horn and shouting".&lt;ref name="worldwidewords.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=What does Hue and Cry Mean? |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-hue1.htm |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources indicate that it has always been a somewhat redundant phrase meaning an outcry and cry, though such "redundancy" is a feature of the [[legal doublet]]. "Hue" appears to come from the [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|huer}}'', which means "to shout", and "cry" from Old French ''{{lang|fro|crier}}'' ("to cry").&lt;ref name="phrases.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hue and Cry |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/24/messages/1077.html |accessdate=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freedictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Compiled Definition and Etymology of Hue and Cry |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hue+and+cry |accessdate=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amheritage"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Soukhanov |editor-first=Anne H. |year=1992 |page=879 |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |isbn=978-0-395-44895-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
*From the late 18th century until 1839, ''Hue and Cry'' was a principal or variant title for the weekly newspaper, containing details of crimes and wanted people, that afterwards became better known as the ''[[Police Gazette (Great Britain and Ireland)|Police Gazette]]''. In [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837–9), chapter 15, the criminal [[Fagin]] is depicted "absorbed in the interesting pages of the ''Hue-and-Cry''".

'''Ideal ring bundle''' or '''gold ring bundle''' is a mathematical term which means an ''n''-stage [[Cyclic order|cyclic sequence]] of semi-measured terms, e.g. [[integer]]s for which the set of all circular sums enumerates row of [[natural number]]s by fixed times. The circular sum is called a sum of consecutive terms in the ''n''-sequence of any number of terms (from 1 to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).

==Examples==
For example, the cyclic sequence (1,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;7) is an Ideal Ring Bundle because four (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4) its terms enumerate of all natural numbers from 1 to ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12 as its starting term, and can be of any number of summing terms by exactly one (''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1) way:

: 1,
: 2,
: 3,
: 4 = 1 + 3,
: 5 = 3 + 2,
: 6 = 1 + 3 + 2,
: 7,
: 8 = 7 + 1,
: 9 = 2 + 7,
: 10 = 2 + 7 + 1,
: 11 = 7 + 1 + 3,

&lt;!--Note that an italicized letter ''s'' or ''t'' is sometimes used for distinction--&gt;

In [[linguistics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], and other fields, an '''intension''' is any [[Property (philosophy)|property]] or [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] [[Connotation|connoted]] by a [[word]], [[phrase]], or another symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=117|author=[[Antony Flew]]|date=1979|title=Dictionary of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a word, the word's [[definition]] often implies an intension. For instance, the intensions of the word ''[[plant]]'' include properties including "being composed of [[cellulose]]", "alive", and "organism", among others. A ''[[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]]'' is the collection of all such intensions.

The meaning of a word can be thought of as the bond between the ''idea the word means'' and the ''physical form of the word''. Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) contrasts three concepts:

# the ''signifier'' – the "sound image" or the string of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] on a page that one recognizes as the form of a [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]
# the ''signified'' – the meaning, the [[concept]] or [[idea]] that a sign expresses or evokes
# the ''referent'' – the actual [[Object (philosophy)|thing]] or set of things a sign refers to. See ''[[Sign (semiotics)#Dyadic signs|Dyadic signs]]'' and ''[[Reference#Semantics|Reference (semantics)]]''.

Without intension of some sort, a word has no meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Hilary|date=1973|title=Meaning and Reference|jstor=2025079|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=70|issue=19|pages=699–711|doi=10.2307/2025079}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the terms ''rantans'' or ''[[Jabberwocky|brillig]]'' have no intension and hence no meaning. Such terms may be suggestive, but a term can be ''suggestive'' without being meaningful. For instance, ''ran tan'' is an archaic onomatopoeia for chaotic noise or din and may suggest to English speakers a din or meaningless noise, and ''brillig'' though made up by [[Lewis Caroll]] may be suggestive of 'brilliant' or 'frigid'. Such terms, it may be argued, are always intensional since they connote the property 'meaningless term', but this is only an apparent paradox and does not constitute a counterexample to the claim that without intension a word has no meaning.  Part of its intension is that it has no extension.  Intension is analogous to the signified in the Saussurean system, [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] to the referent.

In philosophical arguments about [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] versus [[monism]], it is noted that thoughts have intensionality and physical objects do not (S. E. Palmer, 1999), but rather have extension in space and time.

==Statement forms==

A statement-form is simply a form obtained by putting blanks into a sentence where one or more expressions with extensions occur—for instance, "The quick brown ___ jumped over the lazy ___'s back." An instance of the form is a statement obtained by filling the blanks in.

=== Intensional statement form ===

An ''intensional statement-form'' is a statement-form with at least one instance such that substituting co-extensive expressions into it does not always preserve [[logical value]]. An ''intensional statement'' is a statement that is an instance of an intensional statement-form. Here co-extensive expressions are expressions with the same [[extension (semantics)|extension]].

That is, a statement-form is intensional if it has, as one of its instances, a statement for which there are two co-extensive expressions (in the relevant language) such that one of them occurs in the statement, and if the other one is put in its place (uniformly, so that it replaces the former expression wherever it occurs in the statement), the result is a (different) statement with a different logical value. An intensional statement, then, is an instance of such a form; it has the same form as a statement in which substitution of co-extensive terms fails to preserve logical value.

==== Examples ====
#Everyone who has read ''Huckleberry Finn'' knows that Mark Twain wrote it.
#It is possible that Aristotle did not tutor Alexander the Great.
#Aristotle was pleased that he had a sister.

To see that these are intensional, make the following substitutions: (1) "Mark Twain" → "The author of 'Corn-pone Opinions'"; (2) "Aristotle" → "the tutor of Alexander the Great"; (3) can be seen to be intensional given "had a sister" → "had a female sibling."

It will be noted that the intensional statements above feature expressions like "knows", "possible", and "pleased". Such expressions always, or nearly always, produce intensional statements when added (in some intelligible manner) to an extensional statement, and thus they (or more complex expressions like "It is possible that") are sometimes called ''intensional operators''. A large class of intensional statements, but by no means all, can be spotted from the fact that they contain intensional operators.

=== Extensional statement form ===

An ''extensional'' statement is a non-intensional statement. Substitution of co-extensive expressions into it always preserves logical value. A language is intensional if it contains intensional statements, and extensional otherwise. All natural languages are intensional.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The only extensional languages are artificially constructed languages used in [[mathematical logic]] or for other special purposes and small fragments of natural languages.

==== Examples ====
#Mark Twain wrote ''Huckleberry Finn''.
#Aristotle had a sister.

Note that if "Samuel Clemens" is put into (1) in place of "Mark Twain", the result is as true as the original statement. It should be clear that no matter what is put for "Mark Twain", so long as it is a singular term picking out the same man, the statement remains true. Likewise, we can put in place of the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] any other predicate belonging to Mark Twain and only to Mark Twain, without changing the logical value. For (2), likewise, consider the following substitutions: "Aristotle" → "The tutor of Alexander the Great"; "Aristotle" → "The author of the 'Prior Analytics'"; "had a sister" → "had a sibling with two X-chromosomes"; "had a sister" → "had a parent who had a non-male child".

=== Significance ===
Intensional languages cannot be given an adequate [[semantics]] in terms of the extensions of expressions in them, since the extensions themselves do not suffice to determine a logical value.  (If they did, then one could not change the logical value by substituting co-extensive expressions.)  On the other hand, for the first half of the 20th century the only known systems of formal semantics worked by assigning extensions to expressions and used a [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]-style truth-definition of statements constructed from the primitive expressions of the language under analysis.  Hence, these semantical methods were pathetically inadequate for understanding the semantics of any but a few small artificial languages or mutilated fragments of natural languages.

This situation changed in the 1960s with the invention of possible-world or "intensional" semantics, the main form of which is due to [[Saul Kripke]]. Though this has enabled improvements in the semantic modelling of natural languages, much work remains to be done.

[[File:Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators - PO-14 sub &amp; stock cartons - 2015 NAMM Show.jpg|thumb|Electronics inventory]]
'''Inventory''' ([[American English]]) or '''stock''' ([[British English]]) is the goods and materials that a [[business]] holds for the ultimate goal of resale (or repair).{{refn|group=nb|The word ''inventory'' is commonly used in [[American English]] and in business accounting. In the rest of the English-speaking world, ''stock'' is more commonly used, although ''inventory'' is recognised as a synonym.}}

[[Stock management|Inventory management]] is a discipline primarily about specifying the shape and placement of stocked goods. It is required at different locations within a facility or within many locations of a supply network to precede the regular and planned course of production and stock of materials.

The concept of inventory, stock or work-in-process has been extended from manufacturing systems to service businesses&lt;ref&gt;"Production and Operations Management: Manufacturing and Services", R.B. Chase, N.J. Aquiline and F.R. Jacobs, Eighth Edition, 1998, pp 582-583
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Operations and Supply Chain Management: The Core", Third Edition, F. Robert Jacobs and Richard B. Chase, p 346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maynard's Industrial Engineering Handbook, Fifth Edition, Kjell B. Landin (ed.), McGraw-Hill 2001, p G.8&lt;/ref&gt; and projects,&lt;ref&gt;"Factory Physics for Managers", E.S. Pound, J.H. Bell, and M.L. Spearman, McGraw-Hill 2014, p 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"New Era of Project Delivery – Project as Production System", R.G. Shiny and T.R. Zabelle, Journal of Project Production Management, Vol 1, pp Nov 2016, pp 13–24, [https://www.researchgate.net/publications/312602707_&amp;nbsp;New_Era_of_Project_Delivery_-_Project_as_Production_System https://www.researchgate.net/publications/312602707]
&lt;/ref&gt; by generalizing the definition to be "all work within the process of production- all work that is or has occurred prior to the completion of production." In the context of a manufacturing production system, inventory refers to all work that has occurred – raw materials, partially finished products, finished products prior to sale and departure from the manufacturing system. In the context of services, inventory refers to all work done prior to sale, including partially process information.

Definition

The scope of inventory management concerns the balance between replenishment lead time, carrying costs of inventory, asset management, inventory forecasting, inventory valuation, inventory visibility, future inventory price forecasting, physical inventory, available physical space, quality management, replenishment, returns and defective goods, and demand forecasting. Balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels, which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment.

Inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling and related costs are kept in check. It also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements, set targets, provide replenishment techniques, report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material. This would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. It also may include [[ABC analysis]], lot tracking, cycle counting support, etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system, functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs.

==Business inventory==

=== Reasons for keeping stock===
There are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory
#Time – The time lags present in the supply chain, from supplier to user at every stage, requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this [[lead time]]. However, in practice, inventory is to be maintained for consumption during 'variations in lead time'. Lead time itself can be addressed by ordering that many days in advance.
#[[Seasonality|Seasonal Demand]]: demands varies periodically, but producers capacity is fixed. This can lead to stock accumulation, consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption. 
#Uncertainty – Inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand, supply and movements of goods.
#[[Economies of scale]] – Ideal condition of "one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it, when he needs it" principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics. So bulk buying, movement and storing brings in economies of scale, thus inventory.
# Appreciation in Value – In some situations, some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption, or for production. For example; beer in the brewing industry

All these stock reasons can apply to any owner or product.

=== Special terms used in dealing with inventory management ===
* ''[[Stock Keeping Unit]]'' (SKU) SKUs are clear, internal identification numbers assigned to each of the products and their variants. SKUs can be any combination of letters and numbers chosen, just as long as the system is consistent and used for all the products in the inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SKUs and UPCs: do your products have a unique identity?|url = https://www.tradegecko.com/blog/skus-and-upcs-do-your-products-have-an-identity|website = www.tradegecko.com|accessdate = 2015-11-23|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151123213941/https://www.tradegecko.com/blog/skus-and-upcs-do-your-products-have-an-identity|archivedate = 2015-11-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Stockout'' means running out of the inventory of an SKU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialinvestor.com/terms/1072.html|title=Specialinvestor.com|author=|date=|website=www.specialinvestor.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231032227/http://www.specialinvestor.com/terms/1072.html|archivedate=31 December 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[New old stock]]" (sometimes abbreviated NOS) is a term used in business to refer to merchandise being offered for sale that was manufactured long ago but that has never been used. Such merchandise may not be produced anymore, and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time.

===Typology===
#Buffer/[[safety stock]]
#[[Reorder level]] 
#Cycle stock (Used in batch processes, it is the available inventory, excluding buffer stock)
#De-coupling (Buffer stock held between the machines in a single process which serves as a buffer for the next one allowing smooth flow of work instead of waiting the previous or next machine in the same process)
#Anticipation stock (Building up extra stock for periods of increased demand – e.g. ice cream for summer)
#Pipeline stock (Goods still in transit or in the process of distribution – have left the factory but not arrived at the customer yet)

Average Daily/Weekly usage quantity X Lead time in days + Safety stock

===Inventory examples===
While [[accountant]]s often discuss inventory in terms of goods for sale, organizations –  [[manufacturer]]s, [[service provider|service-provider]]s and [[not-for-profit]]s – also have inventories (fixtures, furniture, supplies, etc.) that they do not intend to sell. Manufacturers', [[distribution (business)|distributor]]s', and wholesalers' inventory tends to cluster in [[warehouse]]s. [[Retailer]]s' inventory may exist in a warehouse or in a [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]] or store accessible to [[customers]]. Inventories not intended for sale to customers or to [[consumer|client]]s may be held in any premises an organization uses.  Stock ties up cash and, if uncontrolled, it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore impossible to control them.

While the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier, most manufacturing organizations usually divide their "goods for sale" inventory into:
* [[Raw materials]] – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product.
* [[Work in process]], WIP – materials and components that have begun their transformation to finished goods.
* [[Finished goods]] – goods ready for sale to customers.
* Goods for resale – returned goods that are salable.
* Stocks in transit.
* Consignment stocks.
* Maintenance supply.

For example:

====Manufacturing====
A canned food manufacturer's materials inventory includes the ingredients to form the foods to be canned, empty cans and their lids (or coils of steel or aluminum for constructing those components), labels, and anything else (solder, glue, etc.) that will form part of a finished can. The firm's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers. This may be vats of prepared food, filled cans not yet labeled or sub-assemblies of food components. It may also include finished cans that are not yet packaged into cartons or pallets. Its finished good inventory consists of all the filled and labeled cans of food in its warehouse that it has manufactured and wishes to sell to food distributors (wholesalers), to grocery stores (retailers), and even perhaps to consumers through arrangements like [[factory outlet|factory store]]s and outlet centers.

==== Capital projects ====
The partially completed work (or work in process) is a measure of inventory built during the work execution of a capital project,&lt;ref&gt;“Construction: one type of Project Production System”, Proceedings of ''13th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction.'' Sydney, Australia, 19–21 Jul 2005. pp 29–35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Strategic Positioning of Inventory to match demand in a capital projects supply chain”, K. D. Walsh, J. C. Hershauer, I.D. Tommelein and T. A. Walsh, Journal of Construction Engineerign and Manabement, Nov–Dec 2014, p 818&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“New Era of Project Delivery – Project as Production System”, R. G. Shenoy and T. R. Zabelle, Journal of Project Production Management, Vol 1,  pp Nov 2016, pp 13–24

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312602707_New_Era_of_Project_Delivery_-_Project_as_Production_System |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218063109/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312602707_New_Era_of_Project_Delivery_-_Project_as_Production_System |archivedate=2017-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; such as encountered in civilian infrastructure construction or oil and gas. Inventory may not only reflect physical items (such as materials, parts, partially-finished sub-assemblies) but also knowledge work-in-process (such as partially completed engineering designs of components and assemblies to be fabricated).

====Virtual inventory====
A "virtual inventory" (also known as a "bank inventory") enables a group of users to share common parts, especially where their availability at short notice may be critical but they are unlikely to required by more than a few bank members at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;''Inventory and Logistics Operations'', CIPS Study Materials, Profex Publishing, 2012, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual inventory also allows distributors and fulfilment houses to ship goods to retailers direct from stock regardless of whether the stock is held in a retail store, stock room or warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;PLS Logistics,[http://info.plslogistics.com/blog/more-inventory-less-warehouse-space-how-virtual-inventory-works More Inventory, Less Warehouse Space: How Virtual Inventory Works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208123430/http://info.plslogistics.com/blog/more-inventory-less-warehouse-space-how-virtual-inventory-works |date=2018-02-08 }}, published 22 March 2016  accessed 7 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs associated with inventory===
There are several costs associated with inventory:
* [[Ordering cost]]
* [[Setup cost]]
* [[Holding Cost]]
* [[Shortage Cost]]

==Principle of inventory proportionality==

===Purpose===
Inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management. The primary optimal outcome is to have the same number of days' (or hours', etc.) worth of inventory on hand across all products so that the time of runout of all products would be simultaneous. In such a case, there is no "excess inventory," that is, inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out. Excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain it could have been utilized better elsewhere, i.e. to the product that just ran out.

The secondary goal of inventory proportionality is inventory minimization. By integrating accurate [[demand forecasting]] with inventory management, rather than only looking at past averages, a much more accurate and optimal outcome is expected.

Integrating demand forecasting into inventory management in this way also allows for the prediction of the "can fit" point when inventory storage is limited on a per-product basis.

===Applications===
The technique of inventory proportionality is most appropriate for inventories that remain unseen by the consumer, as opposed to "keep full" systems where a retail consumer would like to see full shelves of the product they are buying so as not to think they are buying something old, unwanted or stale; and differentiated from the "trigger point" systems where product is reordered when it hits a certain level; inventory proportionality is used effectively by just-in-time manufacturing processes and retail applications where the product is hidden from view.

One early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the United States was for motor fuel. Motor fuel (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists do not know whether they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel, each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by [[Petrolsoft Corporation]] in 1990 for [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.&lt;ref name=aspentech&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.aspentech.com/solutions/industry_solutions/refining_marketing/aspenone_supply_distribution.cfm|title=aspenONE Supply &amp; Distribution for Refining &amp; Marketing|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608125910/http://www.aspentech.com/solutions/industry_solutions/refining_marketing/aspenone_supply_distribution.cfm|archivedate=2010-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roots===
The use of inventory proportionality in the United States is thought to have been inspired by Japanese [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] parts inventory management made famous by [[Toyota]] Motors in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsu.edu/web/scfrazier2/jit/mainpage.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425054824/http://www.bsu.edu/web/scfrazier2/jit/mainpage.htm |archivedate=2010-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High-level inventory management==
It seems that around 1880&lt;ref&gt;Relevance Lost, Johnson and Kaplan, Harvard Business School Press, 1987, p126&lt;/ref&gt; there was a change in manufacturing practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information on the effect of product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for [[financial accounting]] of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate of managerial cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over [[management accounting]] remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.

Hence, high-level financial inventory has these two basic formulas, which relate to the accounting period:

#Cost of [[Beginning Inventory]] at the start of the period + inventory [[purchase]]s within the period + cost of [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] within the period =  cost of goods available
# Cost of goods available − cost of [[ending inventory]] at the end of the period = [[cost of goods sold]]

The benefit of these formulas is that the first absorbs all overheads of production and raw material costs into a value of inventory for reporting. The second formula then creates the new start point for the next period and gives a figure to be subtracted from the sales price to determine some form of sales-margin figure.

Manufacturing management is more interested in ''inventory turnover ratio'' or ''average days to sell inventory'' since it tells them something about relative inventory levels.

:Inventory turnover ratio (also known as [[inventory turns]]) = cost of goods sold / Average Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold / ((Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2)

and its inverse

:Average Days to Sell Inventory = Number of Days a Year / Inventory Turnover Ratio = 365 days a year / Inventory Turnover Ratio

This ratio estimates how many times the inventory turns over a year. This number tells how much cash/goods are tied up waiting for the process and is a critical measure of process reliability and effectiveness. So a factory with two inventory turns has six months stock on hand, which is generally not a good figure (depending upon the industry), whereas a factory that moves from six turns to twelve turns has probably improved effectiveness by 100%. This improvement will have some negative results in the financial reporting, since the 'value' now stored in the factory as inventory is reduced.

While these accounting measures of inventory are very useful because of their simplicity, they are also fraught with the danger of their own assumptions. There are, in fact, so many things that can vary hidden under this appearance of simplicity that a variety of 'adjusting' assumptions may be used. These include:
* [[Specific Identification]]
* [[Lower of cost or market]]
* [[Weighted Average Cost]]

Inventory Turn is a financial accounting tool for evaluating inventory and it is not necessarily a management tool. Inventory management should be forward looking. The methodology applied is based on historical cost of goods sold. The ratio may not be able to reflect the usability of future production demand, as well as customer demand.

Business models, including Just in Time (JIT) Inventory, Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) and Customer Managed Inventory (CMI), attempt to minimize on-hand inventory and increase inventory turns. VMI and CMI have gained considerable attention due to the success of third-party vendors who offer added expertise and knowledge that organizations may not possess.

Inventory management in modern days is online oriented and more viable in digital. This type of dynamics order management will require end-to-end visibility, collaboration across fulfillment processes, real-time data automation among different companies, and integration among multiple systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://magentone.over-blog.com/2017/03/big-trends-for-inventory-management-in-2017.html|title=Big trends for Inventory Management in 2017 [Infographic] (UPDATED) - Magentone Developers Website|work=Magentone Developers Website|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718182930/http://magentone.over-blog.com/2017/03/big-trends-for-inventory-management-in-2017.html|archivedate=2017-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounting for inventory==
{{Accounting}}

Each country has its own rules about [[accounting]] for inventory that fit with their financial-reporting rules.

For example, organizations in the U.S. define '''inventory''' to suit their needs within [[US generally accepted accounting principles|US Generally Accepted Accounting Practices]] (GAAP), the rules defined by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) (and others) and enforced by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and other federal and state agencies. Other countries often have similar arrangements but with their own accounting standards and national agencies instead.

It is intentional that [[financial accounting]] uses standards that allow the public to compare firms' performance, [[cost accounting]] functions internally to an organization and potentially with much greater flexibility. A discussion of inventory from standard and [[Theory of Constraints]]-based ([[throughput]]) [[cost accounting]] perspective follows some examples and a discussion of inventory from a [[financial accounting]] perspective.

The internal costing/valuation of inventory can be complex. Whereas in the past most enterprises ran simple, one-process factories, such enterprises are quite probably in the minority in the 21st century. Where 'one process' factories exist, there is a market for the goods created, which establishes an independent market value for the good. Today, with multistage-process companies, there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process' (WIP). This needs to be valued in the accounts, but the valuation is a management decision since there is no market for the partially finished product. This somewhat arbitrary 'valuation' of WIP combined with the allocation of overheads to it has led to some unintended and undesirable results.

===Financial accounting===
An organization's inventory can appear a mixed blessing, since it counts as an [[asset]] on the [[balance sheet]], but it also ties up money that could serve for other purposes and requires additional expense for its protection. Inventory may also cause significant tax expenses, depending on particular countries' laws regarding depreciation of inventory, as in [[Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner]].

Inventory appears as a [[current asset]] on an organization's balance sheet because the organization can, in principle, turn it into cash by selling it. Some organizations hold larger inventories than their operations require in order to inflate their apparent asset value and their perceived profitability.

In addition to the money tied up by acquiring inventory, inventory also brings associated costs for warehouse space, for utilities, and for [[insurance]] to cover staff to handle and protect it from fire and other disasters, obsolescence, shrinkage (theft and errors), and others. Such [[holding cost]]s can mount up: between a third and a half of its acquisition value per year. &lt;!-- An organization that reduced its inventory by $1,000,000 would add that amount to its net income [huh???  Its net income would only increase by the income received minus the cost of the goods sold], an attractive prospect that helps to explain the popularity of programs like [[Just in time]] (JIT) inventory.   --&gt;

Businesses that stock too little inventory cannot take advantage of large orders from customers if they cannot deliver. The conflicting objectives of cost control and customer service often put an organization's financial and operating managers against its [[sales]] and [[marketing]] departments. Salespeople, in particular, often receive sales-commission payments, so unavailable goods may reduce their potential personal income. This conflict can be minimised by reducing production time to being near or less than customers' expected delivery time. This effort, known as "[[Lean production]]" will significantly reduce [[working capital]] tied up in inventory and reduce manufacturing costs (See the [[Toyota Production System]]).

===Role of inventory accounting===
By helping the organization to make better decisions, the accountants can help the public sector to change in a very positive way that delivers increased value for the taxpayer’s investment. It can also help to incentive's progress and to ensure that reforms are sustainable and effective in the long term, by ensuring that success is appropriately recognized in both the formal and informal reward systems of the organization.

To say that they have a key role to play is an understatement. Finance is connected to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations are firmly laid. So often they are the litmus test by which public confidence in the institution is either won or lost.

Finance should also be providing the information, analysis and advice to enable the organizations’ service managers to operate effectively. This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, how much do we have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.

===FIFO vs. LIFO accounting===
{{main article|FIFO and LIFO accounting}}

When a merchant buys goods from inventory, the value of the inventory account is reduced by the [[cost of goods sold]] (COGS). This is simple where the cost has not varied across those held in stock; but where it has, then an agreed method must be derived to evaluate it. For [[commodity]] items that one cannot track individually, accountants must choose a method that fits the nature of the sale. Two popular methods in use are: FIFO (first in – first out) and LIFO (last in – first out).

FIFO treats the first unit that arrived in inventory as the first one sold. LIFO considers the last unit arriving in inventory as the first one sold. Which method an accountant selects can have a significant effect on net income and [[book value]] and, in turn, on taxation. Using LIFO accounting for inventory, a company generally reports lower net income and lower book value, due to the effects of inflation. This generally results in lower taxation. Due to LIFO's potential to skew inventory value, [[UK GAAP]] and [[International Accounting Standards|IAS]] have effectively banned LIFO inventory accounting. LIFO accounting is permitted in the United States subject to section 472 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title26/pdf/USCODE-2011-title26-subtitleA-chap1-subchapE-partII-subpartD-sec472.pdf Internal Revenue Code, § 472: Last-in, first-out inventories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223134628/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title26/pdf/USCODE-2011-title26-subtitleA-chap1-subchapE-partII-subpartD-sec472.pdf |date=2016-12-23 }}, accessed 23 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard cost accounting===
{{main article|Standard cost accounting}}
Standard cost accounting uses [[ratio]]s called [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiencies]] that compare the labour and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under "standard" conditions. As long as actual and standard conditions are similar, few problems arise. Unfortunately, standard cost accounting methods developed about 100 years ago, when labor comprised the most important cost in manufactured goods. Standard methods continue to emphasize labor efficiency even though that resource now constitutes a (very) small part of cost in most cases.

Standard cost accounting can hurt managers, workers, and firms in several ways. For example, a policy decision to increase inventory can harm a manufacturing manager's [[performance evaluation]]. Increasing inventory requires increased production, which means that processes must operate at higher rates. When (not if) something goes wrong, the process takes longer and uses more than the standard labor time. The manager appears responsible for the excess, even though s/he has no control over the production requirement or the problem.

In adverse economic times, firms use the same efficiencies to downsize, rightsize, or otherwise reduce their labor force. Workers laid off under those circumstances have even less control over excess inventory and cost efficiencies than their managers.

Many financial and cost accountants have agreed for many years on the desirability of replacing standard cost accounting. They have not, however, found a successor.

===Theory of constraints cost accounting===
[[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] developed the [[Theory of Constraints]] in part to address the cost-accounting problems in what he calls the "cost world." He offers a substitute, called [[throughput accounting]], that uses [[Throughput (business)|throughput]] (money for goods sold to customers) in place of output (goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a variable cost. He defines inventory simply as everything the organization owns that it plans to sell, including buildings, machinery, and many other things in addition to the categories listed here. Throughput accounting recognizes only one class of variable costs: the truly variable costs, like materials and components, which vary directly with the quantity produced

Finished goods inventories remain [[balance sheet|balance-sheet]] assets, but labor-efficiency ratios no longer evaluate managers and workers. Instead of an incentive to reduce labor cost, throughput accounting focuses attention on the relationships between throughput (revenue or income) on one hand and controllable operating expenses and changes in inventory on the other.

==National accounts==
Inventories also play an important role in [[national accounts]] and the analysis of the [[business cycle]]. Some short-term [[macroeconomic]] fluctuations are attributed to the [[Inventory investment#Inventory investment over the business cycle|inventory cycle]].

==Distressed inventory==
Also known as distressed or expired stock, distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal [[cost]] has passed or will soon pass. In certain industries it could also mean that the stock is or will soon be impossible to sell. Examples of distressed inventory include products which have reached their [[Shelf life|expiry date]], or have reached a date in advance of expiry at which the planned market will no longer purchase them (e.g. 3 months left to expiry), clothing which is out of [[fashion]], music which is no longer popular and old newspapers or magazines. It also includes computer or consumer-electronic equipment which is obsolete or discontinued and whose manufacturer is unable to support it, along with products which use that type of equipment e.g. [[VHS]] format equipment and videos.&lt;ref name="SAXENA2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. S. SAXENA|title=INVENTORY MANAGEMENT: Controlling in a Fluctuating Demand Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6AM-vRhmoAC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=1 December 2009|publisher=Global India Publications|isbn=978-93-8022-821-1|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Cisco]] wrote off inventory worth US $2.25 billion due to duplicate orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Armony |first=Mor
 |title=The Impact of Duplicate Orders on Demand Estimation and Capacity Investment |url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1050.0371}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered one of the biggest inventory write-offs in business history.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Stock rotation==

Stock rotation is the practice of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, in the case of supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Perlitz|title=Retail Services|year=2012|publisher=McGraw HIll|location=Australia|isbn=9781743070741|pages=440|url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9781743070741.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221050022/http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9781743070741.html|archivedate=2013-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventory credit==
Inventory credit refers to the use of stock, or inventory, as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in [[developing countries]] where [[land registration|land title]] may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks of a wide range of products held in a [[bonded warehouse]] is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiannotebook.com/local-interest/parmigiano-hedge/|title=Who moved my Parmigiano?|work=italiannotebook.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126133935/http://www.italiannotebook.com/local-interest/parmigiano-hedge/|archivedate=2013-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jonathan|last1=Coulter|first2=Andrew W.|last2=Shepherd|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v7470e/v7470e00.htm|title=Inventory Credit – An approach to developing agricultural markets|website=fao.org|location=Rome|year=1995|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314040802/http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/V7470E/V7470E00.HTM|archivedate=2009-03-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CTA and EAGC|title=Structured grain trading systems in Africa|url=http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1749_PDF.pdf|publisher=CTA|accessdate=27 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002180749/http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1749_PDF.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.

'''''Lesya''''', according to the [[Jain]] [[Karma in Jainism|theory of karma]], is the coloring of the soul on account of its association with the karmic matter. The colour of ''leśyā'' varies from person to person depending on the psychic states and mental activities behind an action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul |author2=John Hinnels ed.  | title =The Jains | publisher =Routledge | year =2002 | location =London | isbn =0-415-26606-8 }} p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The coloring of the soul is explained through the analogy of crystal, that acquires the color of the matter associated with it. In the same way, the soul reflects the qualities of colour, taste, smell and touch of associated karmic matter, although it is usually the colour that is referred to when discussing the ''leśyās.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Wiley | first =Kristi | title =Colors of the Soul: By-Products of Activity or Passions? | journal =[[Philosophy East and West]] | volume =50 | issue =3 | pages =348–366 | publisher =[[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai'i Press]] | location =Hawai'i | date =July 2000 | jstor =1400178 | issn =1527-943X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Dundas notes the key text expressing this Jain doctrine, explaining how the literary form of the text is helpful in dating and reconstructing the history of transmission.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A full statement of the theory of ''lesya'' occurs in chapter 34 of the Uttaradhyayana, one of the fundamental ''sutras'' of the scriptural canon. Inspection of the metrical structure there, which consists of a cluster of old ''sloka'' verses amplified by twice as many verses in the ''[[arya metre]]'', makes clear that a great deal of ancient editorial care was taken to ensure that an original rudimentary description of this dimension of karma became fully cogent.&lt;ref&gt;

The ancient [[Jain Agamas|Jain text]] ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' speaks of six main categories of ''leśyā'' represented by six colours – black (krishna), blue (neel), grey (kapot), red (tejo), yellow (padma) and white (shukla).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jacobi | first =Hermann | authorlink =Hermann Jacobi | editor =(ed.)

*Black lesya represents the lowest kind of [[:wikt:mental state|state of mind]]. A person in this state of mind shows no [[compassion]] or [[mercy]]. People are afraid of them as these kinds of people are often violent. They also carry [[jealousy]] and animosity within themselves.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who acts on the impulse of the five sins, does not possess the three ''guptis'', has not ceased to injure the six (kinds of living beings), commits cruel acts, is wicked and violent, is afraid of no consequences, is mischievous and does not subdue his senses – a man of such habits develops the black ''leśyā''.

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.21:22
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*People in this blue lesya of mind are proud, haughty, and lazy. They are unreliable and other people avoid their company. They are cheaters, cowards, and hypocrites. These people also avoid all things religious.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man of the following qualities: envy, anger, want of self-control, ignorance, deceit, want of modesty, greed, hatred, wickedness, carelessness, love of enjoyment; a man who pursues pleasures and does not abstain from sinful undertakings, who is wicked and violent – a man of such habits develops the blue ''leśyā''.

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.23:24
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Someone in grey lesya always remains sad and gloomy. They find faults in others and are vindictive. They boast about themselves, become excited over small matters, and lack mental balance.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who is dishonest in words and acts, who is base, not upright, a dissembler and deceiver 3, a heretic, a vile man, a talker of hurtful and sinful things, a thief, and full of jealousy – a man of such habits develops the grey ''leśyā''. 

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.25:26
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*People in red lesya are very careful about their actions and can discriminate between good and evil. They know the difference between what is right and what is wrong. They are kind, benevolent, religious, and lead a harmonious life.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who is humble, steadfast, free from deceit and inquisitiveness, well disciplined, restrained, attentive to his study and duties, who loves the Law and keeps it, who is afraid of forbidden things and strives after the highest good–a man of such habits develops the red ''leśyā''. 

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.27:28
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Lesya.jpg|thumb|250px|Lesyas depicted in Folio from ''Samghanayanarayna'' loose leaf manuscript (17th century) from Gujarat or Rajasthan]]
*A person with yellow lesya is kind and benevolent and forgives everyone, even their enemies. They observe some austerities ([[mahavrata]]) and are vigilant in keeping their vows till their last breath. They remain unaffected by joys and sorrows.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who has but little anger, pride, deceit, and greed, whose mind is at ease, who controls himself, who is attentive to his study and duties, who speaks but little, is calm, and subdues his senses–a man of such habits develops the yellow ''leśyā''.

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.29:30
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*'''Shukla''' ("white") ''leshya'' has two different levels. This state of mind refers to someone who strictly observe the principles of Jainism. They are trustworthy, treat every soul as if it were their own, and do not have any ill feelings even for their enemies. They remain calm even if someone abuses them. Passing in this state of mind allows a being to be reborn as a human being or an angel. People who have perfected this state of mind will become pure and will have escaped the cycle of life and death once they have died.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who abstains from constant thinking about his misery and about sinful deeds, but engages in meditation on the law and truth only, whose mind is at ease, who controls himself, who practises the ''samitis'' and ''guptis'', whether he be still subject to passion or free from passion, is calm, and subdues his senses–a man of such habits develops the white ''leśyā''.

— ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'', 34.31:32 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Consequences==
The black, blue and grey are inauspicious ''leśyā'' due to which the soul takes birth in various-unhappy states of existence. The yellow, red and white are the auspicious ''leśyās'' that enable a soul to take birth in various happy states of existence.&lt;ref name=varni&gt;*{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra |editor=Sagarmal Jain |translator=T.K. Tukol |translator2=K.K. Dixit |title=Samaṇ Suttaṁ | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }} p.197&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jain texts]], a person with black Leshya will go to [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]]. a person with blue lesya is reincarnated in plant life and person with grey lesya is reincarnated in animal life. On the other hand, persons having red lesya are reincarnated as humans, those with yellow lesya are reincarnated as celestial beings while those having white lesya are either reborn in highest heaven or having achieved purity attain liberation.

==Parable of tree==
[[Image:Depiction of lesyas.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Depiction of six persons having six lesyas corresponding to their state of mind and activities]]

The Jain texts further describe the mental dispositions of a soul on account of ''leśyās'' with an example of the reactions of six persons who are travelers, on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruits and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruits; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests cutting the branches only; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs; the fifth one suggests plucking the fruits only; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six ''leśyās''. The person with the black ''leśyā'', having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. The person proposing to cut the tree trunk has blue ''leśyā'', the one suggesting cutting branches has grey ''leśyā'', the person suggesting cutting twigs has red lesya and the person thinking of simply plucking the fruits has yellow ''leśyā''. On the other hand, the person with the white ''leśyā'', having pure disposition, thinks only of picking up fruits fallen on the ground sparing the tree.&lt;ref name=varni/&gt;

'''Avant-garde''' ({{IPA-fr|avɑ̃ ɡaʁd}}) is [[French language|French]] for "vanguard".&lt;ref name="dictref"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=avant-garde|title=Avant-garde definitions|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group, LLC|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in French, English, and German to refer to people or works that are [[experiment]]al or innovative, particularly with respect to [[art]] and [[culture]].

Avant-garde represents a pushing of the boundaries of what is accepted as the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] or the [[status quo]], primarily in the cultural realm. The notion of the existence of the avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of [[modernism]], as distinct from [[postmodernism]]. Postmodernism posits that the age of the constant pushing of boundaries is no longer with us and that avant-garde has little to no applicability in the age of [[Postmodern art]].

'''Looted art''' has been a consequence of [[looting]] during war, [[natural disaster]] and [[riot]] for centuries. Looting of [[art]], [[archaeology]] and other cultural property may be an opportunistic criminal act or may be a more organized case of [[Crime|unlawful]] or [[unethical]] pillage by the victor of a conflict.  The term "looted art" reflects bias, and whether particular art has been taken legally or illegally is often the subject of conflicting laws and subjective interpretations of governments and people; use of the term "looted art" in reference to a particular art object implies that the art was taken illegally.

Related terms include ''[[art theft]]'' (the stealing of valuable artifacts, mostly because of commercial reasons), ''[[illicit antiquities]]'' (covertly traded antiquities or artifacts of archaeological interest, found in illegal or unregulated excavations), ''[[provenance]]'' (the origin or source of a piece of art), and ''[[art repatriation]]'' (the process of returning artworks and antiques to their rightful owners).

Art [[looting]] has a long history, the winning party of armed conflicts often plundering the loser, and in the absence of social order, the local population often joining in. The contents of nearly all the tombs of the [[Pharaoh]]s were already completely looted by [[grave robber]]s before the invasion of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. There have been a total of seven [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sackings of Rome]]. The [[Old Testament]] includes several references to looting and to the looting of art and treasures; in the [[Book of Chronicles]] it is said: "King [[Shishak]] of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the Lord's temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including the gold shields that [[Solomon]] had made",&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles. Chapter. 12:9. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] 15:11 [[The name of God in Judaism#In English|the Lord]] says: "Jerusalem, I will surely send you away for your own good. I will surely bring the enemy upon you in a time of trouble and distress ... I will give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder. I will give it away free of charge for the sins you have committed throughout your land."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 15:11. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous examples include the Roman [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Sack of Corinth]] in 146 BC, the Sack of  [[Constantinople]] by the [[Fourth Crusade]], the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Sack of Baghdad in 1258]], [[Hernán Cortés]] and the looting of the [[Aztec]] gold. In only some of these was the removal of artworks for their own sake (rather than the value of their materials for example) a primary motivation.

Since the rise of an [[Illicit antiquities|art market]] for monumental sculpture, abandoned monuments all over the world have been at risk, notably in [[Iran]], the old territories of [[Mesoamerican culture]] and Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Mydans, Seth. Raiders of Lost Art Loot Temples in Cambodia. New York Times, April 1, 1999,Section A, Page 4, Column 3, 1152 words&lt;/ref&gt;

After the looting of Europe by Napoleon, others copied the institutionalized model of systematic plunder and looting. During the [[American Civil War]], legal frameworks and guidelines emerged that justified and legalized the plunder and looting of opposing parties and nations. [[Henry Wager Halleck]], a United States Army officer, scholar, and lawyer argued: "No belligerent would be justifiable in destroying temples, tombs, statutes [sic], paintings, or other works of art (except so far as their destruction may be the accidental or necessary result of military operations.) But, may he not seize and appropriate to his own use such works of genius and taste as belong to the hostile state, and are of a moveable character?".&lt;ref&gt;Halleck. International law, or, Rules regulating the intercourse of states in peace and war. Ch. XIX, Sections 10–11. (1861)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1862, [[Francis Lieber]], a professor at [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], who had worked with Halleck on guidelines for guerrilla warfare, was asked by Halleck, now [[General-in-Chief]] of [[Union Army|armies of the Union]], to develop a code of conduct for the armed forces. The code of conduct, published as General Orders No. 100 on April 24, 1863, signed by United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]], later became known as the [[Lieber Code]]&lt;ref name=lieber&gt;Francis Lieber, LL.D. [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lieber.htm Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field]. Originally Issued as General Orders No. 100, Adjutant General's Office, 1863, Washington 1898: [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically authorized the Armies of the United States to plunder and loot the enemy – a mindset that Hitler's armies copied one century later. The Lieber Code said in Article 36: "If such works of art, libraries, collections, or instruments belonging to a hostile nation or government, can be removed without injury, the ruler of the conquering state or nation may order them to be seized and removed for the benefit of the said nation.

The Lieber Code further defined the conditions of looting and the relationship between private plunder and booty and institutionalized looting "All captures and booty belong, according to the modern law of war, primarily to the government of the captor." (Article 45), "Neither officers nor soldiers are allowed to make use of their position or power in the hostile country for private gain, not even for commercial transactions otherwise legitimate." (Article 46) and "... [I]f large sums are found upon the persons of prisoners, or in their possession, they shall be taken from them, and the surplus, after providing for their own support, appropriated for the use of the army, under the direction of the commander, unless otherwise ordered by the government." (Article 72)&lt;ref name=lieber/&gt;

Massive art looting occurred during [[World War II]]; see [[art theft during World War II]].

==Looting of countries==

===Looting of Afghanistan===
Many art pieces and artifacts from Afghanistan were looted during several wars; scores of artworks were smuggled to Britain and sold to wealthy collectors. "There are also fears that the bulk of the collection once in [[Kabul Museum]], ... is now in smugglers' or collectors' hands. The most famous exhibits were the [[Begram ivories]], a series of exquisite Indian panels nearly 2,000 years old, excavated by French archaeologists in the Thirties (1930s)".&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke.

===Looting of Cyprus===
Following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 by [[Turkey]] and the occupation of the northern part of the island, churches belonging to the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]] have been looted in what is described as “one of the most systematic examples of the looting of art since World War II”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Morris, Chris. “Shame of Cyprus’s Looted Churches”.

The northern part of the island is where the church and art looting was concentrated.&lt;ref name="byzantinefrescochapel1"&gt;“Cyprus History”. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 12 February 2012. &lt; http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/cyprus-history/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is rumored that the Turkish-Cypriot leaders did not feel an obligation to preserve the artifacts and monuments in the north because they felt that the Greek-Cypriot government had oppressed them for too long.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt;

Archaeological sites, museums, churches, monasteries, castles, libraries, and private art collections have all been affected by the looting of the northern area of Cyprus; icons, frescoes, archaeological artifacts, and cultural heritage have been stripped from areas around the island and have been taken to places all over the world or simply destroyed.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"&gt;Jansen, Michael. “The Pillage by Turkey of the 12,000 year old cultural heritage of Cyprus”.

====Non-Christian places of importance====

Many non-Christian sites have been affected by the looting and destruction of northern Cyprus. During the time of the invasion, work on archaeological sites was halted. While the projects on the Greek-Cypriot southern area were started again after a short period of delay, the projects in the Turkish north were never started again. Many of the houses and workshops associated with archaeological projects in the north were looted, so the work that had been done was lost to the researchers.&lt;ref name="Nicolaou, Kyriakos 1976"&gt;Nicolaou, Kyriakos. 1976. “Archaeological News from Cyprus, 1974”. American Journal of Archaeology, 80 (4):361-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas on the island of Cyprus were damaged by bombing and machine gun fire, and because of these issues, the pavement mosaics of the House of Dionysos in Paphos suffered extensive damage. The fighting not only was destroying Byzantine and Christian cultural heritage, but it was even destroying culture that had been in existence for far longer. There have been appeals filed with UNESCO, ICOM, and ICOMOS to help with the preservation of the remaining cultural heritage on the island, and a representative of UNESCO was appointed to help by 1976.&lt;ref name="Nicolaou, Kyriakos 1976"/&gt;

====Looted religious sites and icons====

On the island of Cyprus before the invasion, the majority of the inhabitants were Greek-Cypriots, and for these citizens, the Greek Orthodox Church was and continues today to be central to their identity and faith.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt; In the north, there is a fear that Christianity is dying out because the churches and monasteries have been destroyed, transformed, or are falling into ruin. The northern Turkish inhabitants have transformed some former religious sites into mosques, army barracks, stables, night clubs and hotels, and it has been documented that only 3 churches and 1 monastery are currently in a dignified state out of the 520 churches and monasteries that were in the northern area of the country before the Turkish invasion.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;“Greek Orthodox Church sues Turkey Over Access to Religious Sites in Cyprus”. The Guardian. The Associated Press in Nicosia. 23 November 2009. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/24/greek-orthodox-church-sues-turkey?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="repubblica2006"&gt;Magister, Sandro. ”Cyprus: Portrait of a Christianity Obliterated”. Chiesa News. Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso Spa. 3 September 2006. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/46544?eng=y&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 55 churches have been converted into mosques, while another 50 churches and monasteries have been converted into other structures to serve the Turkish-Cypriots’.&lt;ref name="cyprusnet2005"/&gt; A spokesman for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus stated that the transformations of buildings happened because the buildings were falling into ruin, and he also stated that it is an Ottoman custom to transform buildings attributed to other religions into mosques; this idea can be linked to other Islamic sites, like the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Israel.&lt;ref name="repubblica2006"/&gt;

Yannis Eliades, the director of the Byzantine Museum of Nicosia, has estimated that 25,000 icons have disappeared since the Turkish military initially invaded the island in 1974, while others estimate that between 15,000 and 20,000 icons are missing, along with dozens of frescoes and mosaics dating between the 6th and 15th centuries, thousands of chalices, wood carvings, crucifixes, and Bibles.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="repubblica2006"/&gt; However, there have been some case in which the Church of Cyprus was able to reclaim icons or mosaics, and this is a great step forward for the reformation of their cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;

The transformations of religious sites have also spurred lawsuits from the few hundred Greek-Cypriots that are still living in the northern area. The Greek Orthodox Church has taken Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights because they were preventing practicing Christians from worshiping at previously religious, but currently transformed buildings. Even though the buildings have been destroyed or converted, the Greek-Cypriot citizens still want to be able to worship at these places to keep continuity with their faith without regard to the destruction.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

====Aydin Dikmen considered a key suspect====

Aydin Dikmen is a 60-year-old man who has been arrested in relation to the looting and selling of looted goods from the island of Cyprus. He had been suspected of being involved in the selling of looted art since 1982, but he kept a low profile and fell off the radar for some time.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; His involvement was cemented when Peg Goldberg was sued by the Church of Cyprus in 1989 because she knew that she bought the mosaics from Dikmen; he claimed that he found the remains in the rubble of a church that had been forgotten and basically destroyed while he was working as an archaeologist in the northern part of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"&gt;Bourloyannis, M. Christiane, and Virginia Morris. 1992. “Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyprus v. Goldberg &amp; Feldman Fine Arts, Inc”. The American Journal of International Law, 86 (1): 128-133.&lt;/ref&gt; We also have documentation of another transaction where Dikmen worked with art collectors in the United States; Dominique de Menil, of the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas, bought two 13th-century frescoes from Dikmen on behalf of the Church of Cyprus in 1983.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;

Those two previous cases are only two cases in which Dikmen’s presence has been suggested; he has been implicated in many more transactions, but those accusations have yet to be proven. However, in 1997, former colleagues of Dikmen helped the authorities arrest Dikmen and raid his many apartments. In these apartments, some of which Dikmen rented under false names and used as storage space, the authorities found a surplus of icons, frescoes, early Bibles, ancient pottery, statues, and coins from Cyprus. After learning of another residence of Dikmen’s, the authorities found 30 to 40 more crates filled with icons, frescoes, mosaics, and artifacts.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; Also in one of the residences, the authorities found drawings containing information on how to cut out mosaics to keep the faces of the religious figures intact, while still taking the piece away from the original space; this shows how systematic and planned out the looting of the churches and monasteries was for Dikmen and his associates in the northern part of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; The organization and the intense planning involved brings up the issue of possible aid coming from Turkish authorities in the northern part of Cyprus; there are rumors that the government and military knew about the looting and chose to not do anything about it. This discomforting idea is continually straining the ties between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt;

Since Dikmen’s arrest in 1998, the Antiphonitis frescoes and the Kanakarian mosaics have been returned to Cyprus, and soon the 13th-century frescoes currently housed by the Menil Collection in Houston will be returned to the island, as well.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="menil1"&gt;“The Menil Collection Celebrates Return of Byzantine Frescoes With Public Events Honoring Sacred Works”. Byzantine Fresco Chapel News. The Menil Collection. 30 January 2012. Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; http://www.menil.org/documents/MenilCelebratesReturnofByzantineFrescoeswithPublicEventsHonoringSacredWorks.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The search for the looted art of Cyprus continues, and there seems to be more and more evidence of Dikmen’s presence in other transactions of international looted art. Many think that Dikmen is just a middle man who is working on behalf of more knowledgeable and rich patrons, but the mystery is still not solved. Hopefully the truth will be discovered in the future, and these beautiful artifacts, icons, mosaics, and frescoes can be returned to Cyprus to enhance their cultural heritage and identity.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;

====Cases of repatriation====

=====The Menil Collection and 13th-century frescoes=====
One case of repatriation for the Church of Cyprus is associated with the Menil Collection, based in Houston, Texas.&lt;ref name="artdaily1"&gt;Hadjicostis, Menalaos. “Cyprus to get back rare 13th-century Orthodox frescoes from United States Museum”.

The original Cypriot chapel in the Ayios Themomianos Church in the northern part of Cyprus was a small limestone structure, with a central dome and pointed barrel vaults; the original was mostly used for prayer because of its small size.&lt;ref&gt;“Byzantine Frescoes: Origins”. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/origins/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; When the de Menil collection was granted temporary possession of the frescoes, they constructed a chapel to house the frescoes and keep them safe. This specially built chapel was designed by De Menil’s husband, François de Menil, who studied traditional Byzantine architecture and spatial arrangement from the original chapel at Lysi; the layout and the placement of the mosaics mirrors the arrangement from the original chapel.&lt;ref name="byzantinefrescochapel3"&gt;“The Byzantine Fresco Chapel: Architecture”. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/architecture/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the chapel has black walls which are illuminated to create a sense of vastness and infinity; the black walls help to focus the attention of the viewer on the frescoes and create a divine experience for the viewer.&lt;ref name="byzantinefrescochapel3"/&gt;

Icons are important because they depict images of greater significance, and they are used to instruct and inspire worship.&lt;ref&gt;Imprinting the Divine: Byzantine and Russian Icons from Houston’s Menil Collection”.

=====Boy George and the Gold Icon of Christ=====

However, it will not be going back to the original Church in the northern part of Cyprus; it is being held in Brussels, Belgium, and it will return to Cyprus at a later date when The Church of Cyprus has an appropriate space in which it can be stored.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artdaily3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; This case has contributed to the Church of Cyprus and their efforts to repatriate “stolen spiritual treasures” that have come from their homeland of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=====Peg Goldberg and the Kankarian mosaics=====
This case study outlines the events that occurred in 1989 between Peg Goldberg, a local art dealer in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg gained “ownership” and then tried to sell Cypriot mosaics from the 6th century. These mosaics have been looted from the Church of the Virgin of Kankaria in the village of Lythrangomi in Northern Cyprus after surviving the 8th and 9th century.&lt;ref name="cyprusnet2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt; These mosaics had survived the 8th- and 9th-century iconoclasm in the Byzantine world and were considered to be finer than other mosaics, even the mosaics found in Ravenna, Italy and the mosaics in St. Catherine’s monastery in Sinai.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt; The Kankarian mosaics were cut into pieces when they were looted from the original church, and Peg Goldberg was able to purchase four segments of these early mosaics from Aydin Dikmen. These mosaics are important to the cultural, artistic, and religious heritage of Cyprus because they are some of the few remaining Byzantine mosaics from the island; when and how these mosaics were taken from Cyprus is unknown because there is documentation to show that they were still intact in 1976, two years after the initial invasion by the Turkish troops.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt;

These mosaics first came into the view of the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg approached the Getty Museum to purchase the mosaic pieces. The Getty Museum recognized them as the lost Kankarian mosaics and informed Cyprus that they were in the United States. Shortly afterward, the Church of Cyprus filed a claim at the district court to try to reclaim the mosaics.&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; The federal court in Indiana made a verdict in favor of the Church of Cyprus, and the mosaics were returned in 1991 to the Byzantine Museum in Nicosia, Cyprus.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; The verdict showed that Goldberg could not own the pieces because Dikmen had stolen the mosaics and had no right to pass on the ownership of the stolen mosaics. Goldberg stated that the pieces had been bought “in good faith” from a “Turkish antiquities dealer” who found the mosaics in an abandoned church, but the judge ruled that not looking into the background and workings of the dealer was unacceptable because it was her responsibility to look into the people she was working with.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; This case called in the multilateral treaty of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, which calls for all available parties to help recover and return items that have been requested by the country of origin; using this international decree helped to show the importance of these artifacts which needed to be sent to their home land of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; People have been happy with this verdict for the Kankarian case because they want others to realize that cultural heritage of the world is not for sale, and hopefully discourage further selling of looted art in the international market.&lt;ref name="nytimes1990"&gt;[[William H. Honan|Honan, William H]]. “Art Dealer Told Again to Return Mosaics”. Arts. The New York Times. 26 Oct 1990. Web. 1 March 2012. &lt; https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/26/arts/art-dealer-told-again-to-return-mosaics.html?emc=eta1&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic pieces that were involved in the Kankarian case have four different religious images. They depict Jesus as a young boy, the archangel Michael, Matthew and James; the final two are images of apostles from the 1st century.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; The mosaics were named after the Church in which they were placed originally around 530.&lt;ref name="nytimes1990"/&gt; These mosaics have fallen into destruction because of the damage that they experienced through the process of removal from the church, shipping around the world, and during the restoration work that Goldberg commissioned. It is unlikely that these mosaics will ever be reinstalled in their original home, even if there are changes in the political situation on Cyprus, because they would most likely not make it through the re-installation process in the state that they are currently in.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;

===Looting of Germany===
After World War II, Germany was looted by Allied and Soviet forces; the systematic pillaging and looting by the Allies (particularly the [[Soviet Union]]) is still causing disputes and conflicts between Germany, Russia and the United States, as many of the objects have never been returned to Germany.

Among those there is a large collection from Berlin, which in Polish referred to as ''[[Berlinka (art collection)|Berlinka]]''.

The reasons for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] looting of Germany and the subsequent Russian attempts are revealed in an interview that Irina Antonova gave to the German ''[[Die Welt]]'' newspaper; the interview specifically focuses on the Russian notion of looting, using the historical example of Napoleon as a direct reference for the Russian justification of the Plunder of Germany: "Three quarters of all the Italian art in the Louvre came to Paris with Napoleon. We all know this, yet the works remain in the Louvre. I know the place where Veronese's large painting used to hang in the monastery of Vicenza. Now it's in the Louvre where it will stay.

U.S. troops and tanks were stationed in that area but, concerned with defending themselves from attack and without orders to stop the looting, "watched for several days before moving against the thieves."&lt;ref name=knickmeyer/&gt; Sergeant Jackson of the 1st Marine Battalion explained that "...our orders were to avoid engaging religious Muslims who were unarmed. So when groups of Imams demanded to remove religious items to prevent them from being defiled by the infidels, how were we supposed to know that they were thieves? Our captain didn't want to create an international incident by arresting religious leaders."

''The Boston Globe'' writes: "Armies not of fighters but of looters, capitalizing on a security vacuum after war, have pillaged Babylon."

Sennott. Looters Pillage Babylon Leaving Iraqis, Archeologists Devastated. The Boston Globe Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News. April 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; }}

George's comments followed widespread reporting that 100 percent of the museum's 170,000 inventoried lots (about 501,000 pieces) had been removed by Iraqi looters. In fact, about 95 percent of the museum's contents never left the museum. According to investigators of the thefts, about two percent of the museum pieces were stored elsewhere for safekeeping. Another two percent were stolen, in an apparent "inside job", just before U.S. troops arrived; about one percent, or about 5,000 items, were taken by outside looters. Most of the looted items were tiny beads and amulets.

The horror of art looting in general is made clear by Hashem Hama Abdoulah, director of the museum of antiquities in Sulaymaniyah, in the Kurdish-controlled zone of northern Iraq. {{Centered pull quote|"When your history is stolen from you, you lose your sense of that history.

===Looting of Italy===
The looting of Italian art was not limited to Napoleon alone; Italian criminals have long been, and remain, extremely active in the field, and Italy's battle to recover the antiquities it says were looted from the country and sold to museums and art collectors worldwide is still ongoing. The Italian government and the [[Carabinieri Art Squad|Art Squad]] of the [[Carabinieri]], Italy's national police force, made special efforts to "[crack] the network of looters, smugglers, and dealers supplying American museums," collecting "mountains of evidence—thousands of antiquities, photographs, and documents—seized from looters and dealers in a series of dramatic raids." According to the BBC, Italian authorities have for several years insisted on the return of stolen or looted artworks from wealthy museums and collectors, particularly in America.&lt;ref name=bbcgetty&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/273618.stm Getty Museum returns stolen art]. BBC. February 6, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has successfully fought numerous lawsuits that have resulted in the repatriation of many items of looted art and antiquities from many famous American institutions, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles, the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], the [[Princeton Museum of Art]], the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], and the private collection of [[Leon Levy]] and his wife, [[Shelby White]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/0607/abstracts/raiders.html Raiding the Tomb Raiders]. [[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]. Volume 59 Number 4, July/August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As the result of lawsuits filed by the Italian and Turkish governments, as well as the work of investigative journalist [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] and archaeologist [[Vernon Silver]], both the Metropolitan Museum and the J. Paul Getty Museum have been repeatedly exposed as two of the world's biggest institutional recipients of looted and stolen Mediterranean artefacts, and the museums benefited from the illegal antiquities trade, both through direct acquisition, and via donations and bequests from major private collectors. A significant number of Met and Getty acquisitions over a period of at least 40 years were everntually shown to have been sourced from a major international illegal antiquities trading network that centred on Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]]. From the late 1960s, Medici rose to become the central figure in  a large criminal conspiracy, acting as the middleman between gangs of ''tombaroli'' (tomb robbers) - who systematically looted tens of thousands of important artefacts from Italian and other Mediterranean archaeological sites, as well as stealing objects from museums, churches and private collections - and an elite group of American and British dealers who helped Medici to "launder" his contraband and sell it to major buyers like the Met, the Getty and leading American private collectors.

Medici typically paid the ''tombaroli'' small sums for the looted and stolen goods, and then smuggled them out of Italy to Switzerland, where they were restored. Taking advantage of the lax attitudes and practices of 'cooperative' auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - Medici built up an elaborate network of front companies and elite antiquities dealers and galleries, including the British dealer [[Robin Symes]], Rome-based American dealer [[Robert E. Hecht]], and Hollywood dealer and producer [[Bruce McNall]]. A major investigation by the TPC (the art crimes division of the [[Carabinieri]]) beginning in the 1990s, which eventually resulted in Medici's conviction, recovered tens of thousands of looted artefacts, and extensive documentary evidence, including thousands of sequential photographs that showed the journey of these looted objects from excavation, through restoration, to their final placement in museum collections, as well as a crucial handwritten 'organigram' (organisational chart) that named and linked all the members of Medici's operation. TPC investigations also revealed that Medici used front companies to anonymously sell and then buy back many items, often multiple times, in order to manipulate the market, as well as allowing him to acquire the all-important Sotheby's provenances. In February 2016, TPC officials announced that a raid on Robin Symes' warehouse in the Geneva Freeport had uncovered a huge collection of 17,000 looted antiquities, nearly all of which are thought to have been sourced from Medici, and which Symes secretly placed there ca. 2000 in order to conceal their existence from the executors of the estate of his former lover and business partner, Christo Michelaides, who died in 1999.

In 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art finally agreed to relinquish ownership of a 2,500-year-old Greek vase known as the [[Euphronios krater]], a [[krater]] painted by [[Euphronios]], after the TPC was able to establish that the object had been looted from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled out of Italy by the Medici gang. The Met also surrendered 15 pieces of Sicilian silver and four ancient vessels in exchange for long-term loans of other antiquities. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the case, "of its kind, perhaps second only to the dispute between Greece and Great Britain over the Elgin marbles," "became emblematic of the ethical questions surrounding the acquisition of ancient art by major museums."&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy and Hugh Eakin.

The Metropolitan Museum has been involved in several other major controversies involving antiquities believed or proven to have been looted or stolen, including:

* the [[Cloisters Cross]], a large [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cross carved from walrus ivory, said to have been carved in England, but possibly made in Germany. It was initially offered to the [[British Museum]] in 1961 by its then owner, a shady Yugoslav 'collector' called [[Ante Topić Mimara]], who is now widely believed to have acquired as part of a huge collection of art and antiquities that he stole at the end of WWII from the Central Collecting Point in Munich, the Allied clearinghouse for the repatriation of material looted by the Nazis. The British Museum eventually declined to buy the cross because Topić Mimara would not provide proof that he had full title to the object, but immediately after the British Museum's option expired in 1963, the cross was purchased for the Met by curator [[Thomas Hoving]] for GBP£200,000. The Cross is currently still in the collection of the Met, at its [[Cloisters Museum]] annexe.&lt;ref name="Peter Watson 2007 pp.133-146"&gt;Peter Watson; Cecilia Todeschini (2007), ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'' (Public Affairs, NY), pp.133-146&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Karun Treasure]], also known as the Lydian Hoard, is a fabulous collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE. It formed part of a larger haul of some 450 objects that were looted by local tomb robbers from ancient four royal tombs near [[Sardis]], in Turkey in 1966-67. The contents of the tombs, including painted pieces of the walls, were stripped and sold (via Swiss and American middlemen) to the Metropolitan Museum between 1966 and 1970 for a total of US$1.5 million, but they were kept hidden in storage for more than 20 years. The Treasure was eventually put on display in 1984 in a major exhibition, where it was seen by Turkish journalist Özgen Acar, who had been investigating the looting of the tombs for many years. Although the Met intentionally mislabeled the objects as part of an “East Greek treasure,” Acar immediately recognised them as the Lydian artefacts, from the descriptions he had been given by the looters. He alerted the Turkish government, and in 1986, they officially requested the hoard be returned. The Met refused, so Turkey began legal action to recover it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761 The History Blog: "Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found" (posted 28 November 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; After a six-year legal battle which reportedly cost the Turkish government UK£25 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey Constanze Letch, "King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey", ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; the case ended dramatically after the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee revealed that a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects. The Met was forced to concede that staff had known the objects were stolen when it bought them, and the collection was repatriated to Turkey in 1993.&lt;ref name="Peter Watson 2007 pp.133-146"/&gt;
* the [[Morgantina treasure]], a 16-piece hoard of 3rd century BCE Roman silver, valued at US$100 million. Acquired in the early 1980s, it was later shown to have been looted from an important archaeological site in Morgantina, Sicily. After another protracted law suit, the Met was also forced to relinquish the treasure, and it was repatriated to Sicily in 2010.&lt;ref name="Peter Watson 2007 pp.133-146"/&gt;&lt;ref name=povoledo/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'', a publication of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], investigative journalist [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] wrote in June 2006 that according to the Italian public prosecutor [[Paolo Ferri]], 100,000 tombs have been looted in Italy alone, representing a value of US$500 million. He estimates that the overall monetary value of looted art, including Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Cyprus, West Africa, Central America, Peru, and China, is at least four times the Italian figure.&lt;ref name=archaeologyexposing&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/watson.html Exposing the Culture Thieves].

The aforementioned institutions have agreed to hand over the artworks in exchange for loans of other treasures.

In 2005 [[Marion True]], former curator of the Getty Museum, and art dealer [[Robert E.

June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence against both emerged in a 1995 raid of a [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], warehouse that contained many stolen artifacts. In September 2007, Italy dropped the civil charges against True.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute/undergrad/prizes/Combs2010.pdf] Combs, Jacob, and Morag Kersel.

The warehouses were registered to a Swiss company called Editions Services, which police traced to an Italian art dealer, [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]]. The Carabinieri stated that the warehouses contained 10,000 artifacts worth 50 billion [[Italian lira|lire]] (about $35 million).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Slayman.

In another, unrelated case in 1999, the Getty  had to hand over three antiquities to Italy after determining they were stolen. The objects included a Greek red-figure [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] from the 5th century BC signed by the painter, [[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]], and the potter, Euphronios, looted from the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] site of [[Cerveteri]]; a torso of the god [[Mithra]] from the 2nd century AD; and the head of a youth by the Greek sculptor [[Polykleitos]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L.

===Looting of South East Asia===

During their occupation of Indochina, the French government removed various statues and other objects from the region. During its existence, the Khmer Empire was regularly raided by its neighbours, which resulted in its cultural heritage being distributed widely across the region.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''Ancient Khmer Empire''&lt;/ref&gt; The major historian of the Khmer Empire, Lawrence Palmer Briggs, regularly mentions these raids—for example, the sack of Angkor in 1430–31 by the Siamese who carried off their loot to [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]],&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p258&lt;/ref&gt; after which "people fled from the 'great and glorious capital' of Khmer civilisation as if it were ridden with plague".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p261&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the cultural heritage of the region was already widely spread by the time the French founded their protectorate in IndoChina in 1864. Briggs describes [[Preah Khan Kompong Svay]] as "shamefully looted" in the late 19th century by [[Louis Delaporte]], "who carried the spoils away to French museums (thus beginning the systematic looting of Cambodian temples for the benefit of public and private collections of Europe and America)".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p 222&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes how French tourists well into the 20th century carried off many statues.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p77&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by the early 20th century it was rare to find Khmer objects in situ{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} and local and foreign collectors, particularly in France, had built up collections of Khmer objects. Many objects from the region were exported to Europe and elsewhere and ended up in museums such as the Guimet.&lt;ref&gt;http://asemus.museum/museum/musee-national-des-arts-asiatiques-guimet/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second world war, whilst France was occupied by Nazi Germany, the Indochina region was controlled variously by the Japanese, locally, and after the war, the French regained control. There followed a period of 35 years of disruption and warfare, including Dien Ben Phu and the Vietnam war. Thereafter Cambodia fell under the control of the notorious Khmer Rouge regime. Some objects left the country during that period, either to save them from destruction or for looting purposes. Reports have suggested that where objects have been moved, local officials and armed forces (both before and after the periods of turmoil) were responsible.&lt;ref&gt;see movie Angkor for Sale directed Adrian Maben 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, a report in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' described art experts' concerns about a "rampant degradation of archeological sites and an accelerating trade in stolen artifacts sweeping Southeast Asia" as a consequence of war in Cambodia and instability in the region.&lt;ref name="Tefft"&gt;Tefft, Sheila. [http://www.csmonitor.com/1992/1015/15121.html "Plundering of Artifacts Sweeps Asia"], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 15 October 1992.

The British-born Thai-based collector [[Douglas Latchford]] says that when he and other collectors traversed Cambodia and Thailand in the 1960s, buying and trading Cambodian antiquities, they were not concerned about provenance, but regarded themselves as rescuers of artefacts that otherwise might have been neglected or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Mashberg, Tom, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/arts/design/us-links-collector-to-statue-in-khmer-looting-case.html?_r=0 "Claims of Looting Shadow Expert in Khmer Art"], ''The New York Times'', 12 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the objects they purchased were later donated or sold to museums. In the 2000s, evidence that the artefacts had been looted persuaded a number of major museums around the world to return the objects to Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;"In 2012, Latchford was identified in [US] federal court records as a middleman in the trafficking of looted antiquities from Sotheast Asia. Authorities allege Latchford knowingly purchased two looted Khmer sculptures from “an organized looting network” and conspired with the London auction house Spink to obtain false export permits for them. The case was a civil lawsuit, and Latchford was not charged with a crime. But after a lengthy legal battle, Sotheby’s agreed to return its sculpture to Cambodia. Soon after, the Norton Simon Museum, Christie’s auction house and the Metropolitan Museum of Art all returned sculptures tied to Latchford."

Among the objects sold or donated to major museums by Latchford are a number of rare ancient [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] statues, reportedly looted from the temple site of [[Koh Ker]] in Cambodia, and at least two Indian seated [[Kushan]] Buddhas, looted from the ancient Indian city of [[Mathura]]. One of the seated Buddhas was originally offered—via Manhattan dealer [[Nancy Wiener]]—to Canada's [[Royal Ontario Museum]], but they ultimately declined to buy it, owing to its dubious provenance. In 2000 it was bought by the [[National Gallery of Australia]], but subsequent investigations exposed the seated Buddha as a looted artwork, and it has since been repatriated to India. Other US museums reported to have received looted Asian artefacts from Latchford include the [[Denver Museum of Art]], the [[Kimbell Museum]] in Ft. Worth, Texas, and the [[Norton Simon Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chasingaphrodite.com/2013/05/03/breaking-the-met-returns-two-khmer-statues-to-cambodia-citing-clear-evidence-of-looting/ Chasing Aphrodite: "The Met Returns Two Khmer Statues to Cambodia, Citing Clear Evidence Of Looting" (posted 3 May 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] voluntarily returned to Cambodia a 10th-century sculpture of the Hindu monkey god [[Hanuman]], after a curator from the museum uncovered evidence that it had been looted—the statue's head having appeared on the market in Bangkok in 1968 during the [[Vietnam War]] and its body having appeared on the market in 1972 during the [[Cambodian Civil War]]. The museum's director said, "Our research revealed a very real likelihood that it was removed from a site enormously important to the kingdom of Cambodia during a terrible time and its return was completely consistent with the highest legal and fiduciary standards."&lt;ref&gt;Litt, Steven.

The [[Załuski Library]], the first public library in Poland, was founded by two brothers, [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]], crown referendary and bishop of Kiev, and [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]], crown chancellor and bishop of Cracow. The library was considered one of the most important libraries of the world, featuring a collection of about 400,000 printed items, manuscripts, artworks, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens. Located in Warsaw's [[Daniłowiczowski Palace]], it was looted in the aftermath of the [[second Partition of Poland]] and [[Kościuszko Uprising]] in 1794 by [[Russia]]n troops on orders from Russian Tsarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]; the stolen artworks were transported to [[St. Petersburg]] and became part of the [[Russian Imperial Library]], which was founded one year later. Although some pieces were returned by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921 and were burned during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] against German forces, other parts of the collection have still not been returned by Russia. Polish scientists have been allowed to access and study the objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warsawvoice.pl/archiwum.phtml/7723/ What's On. Library Anniversary]. [[The Warsaw Voice]].

During the Second World War, Germany tried to destroy Poland completely and exterminate its population as well as culture. Countless art objects were looted, as Germany systematically carried out a plan of looting prepared even before the start of hostilities{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} (see also [[Nazi plunder]]).&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; Twenty-five museums and many other facilities were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The total cost of German theft and destruction of Polish art is estimated at 20 billion dollars,&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt; or an estimated 43% of Polish cultural heritage; over 516,000 individual art pieces were looted (including 2,800 paintings by European painters; 11,000 paintings by Polish painters; 1,400 sculptures, 75,000 manuscripts, 25,000 maps, 90,000 books including over 20,000 printed before 1800, and hundreds of thousands of other items of artistic and historical value).&lt;ref name="MSZ"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.msz.gov.pl/Rewindykacja,dobr,kultury,1775.html Rewindykacja dóbr kultury] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821215332/http://www.msz.gov.pl/Rewindykacja%2Cdobr%2Ckultury%2C1775.html |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet troops afterward contributed to the plunder as well.&lt;ref name="polamcon"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.polamcon.org/lostart/intro.htm |title = Wartime Losses-Polish Painting |work = polamcon.org |accessdate = 2008-03-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071218105004/http://www.polamcon.org/lostart/intro.htm |archivedate = December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Looting of Latin and South America===
The looting of Central and South America by the [[conquistador]]s is one of the best-known plunders in the world.

Roger Atwood writes in ''Stealing History: Tomb Raiders, Smugglers, and the Looting of the Ancient World'': "Mayan stonework became one of those things that good art museums in America just had to have, and looters in the jungles of southern Mexico and Guatemala worked overtime to meet the demand."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Atwood, Roger.

Looting in Mesoamerica has a long tradition and history. Graves are often looted before the archaeologists can reach them, and the artifacts are then sold to wealthy collectors in the United States, Japan, or Europe. Guillermo Cock, a Lima-based archaeologist, says about a recent find of dozens of exquisitely preserved Inca mummies on the outskirts of Peru's capital city, [[Lima]]: "The true problem is the looters," he said. "If we leave the cemetery it is going to be destroyed in a few weeks."&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;John Roach.

==Looting by perpetrator==

===Looting by the British Empire===

The transformation of theft and plunder as an incentive for troops to institutionalized, indiscriminate looting following military conflict can be observed in the wake of British conquest in Asia, Africa and India. The looting of artifacts for "both personal and institutional reasons" became "increasingly important in the process of "othering" Oriental and African societies and was exemplified in the professionalism of exploration and the growth of ethnographic departments in museums, the new 'temples of Empire'." Looting, not necessarily of art, became a vital instrument for the projection of power and the British imperial desire to gather and provide information about the "exotic" cultures and primitive tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrington. Officers Gentlemen and Thieves: The Looting of Monasteries during the 1903/4. [[Francis Younghusband|Younghusband Mission]] to Tibet, [[Modern Asian Studies]] 37, 1 (2003), pp 81–109 {{doi|10.1017/S0026749X03001033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Empire and authority: Curzon, collisions, character and the Raj, 1899–1905''. Michael Carrington. A Ph. D (British Library)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Looting by Napoleon===
[[File:Descent from the Cross (Rembrant).jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]]'s ''Descent from the Cross'' was looted in 1806 by French soldiers from the [[Landgrave]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], Germany; current location: [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], St. Petersburg.]]

Napoleon's conquests in Europe were followed by a systematic attempt, later more tentatively echoed by Hitler, to take the finest works of art of conquered nations back to the [[Louvre]] in Paris for a grand central museum of all Europe. Napoleon boasted: {{Centered pull quote|We will now have all that is beautiful in Italy except for a few objects in Turin and Naples.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;}}
Many works were returned after his fall, but many others were not, and remain in France. Many works confiscated from religious institutions under the French occupation now form the backbone of national museums: "Napoleon's art-loot depots became the foundation of [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Venice's Accademia]], Milan's [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Brera galleries]]. His brother [[Napoleon III of France|Louis]] founded [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum]]; brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] started [[Museo del Prado|Madrid's Prado]]" (for the Spanish royal collection).&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891933-1,00.html Masterpieces of the Louvre]. ''Time'' magazine. June 30, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleonic commander and Marechal [[Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult]] stole in 1810 six large pictures painted by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] in 1668 for the [[Hospital de la Caridad (Seville)|Hospital de la Caridad]] in [[Seville]]. One painting, ''[[The Return of the Prodigal Son]]'', is now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington; a second looted painting, ''[[The Healing of the Paralytic]]'', is in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London; only two of the original paintings have returned to Seville.&lt;ref name=bloombergplease/&gt;

Another French general looted several pictures, including four Claudes and [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'', from the [[Landgrave]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] in 1806. The stolen goods were later bought by the [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Josephine]] and subsequently by the tsar. Since 1918, when the [[Bolshevik]] government signed a peace treaty with Germany and Austria, have German negotiators demanded the return of the paintings. Russia refused to return the stolen goods; the pictures still remain in the Hermitage.&lt;ref name=bloombergplease/&gt;

===Looting by the Union and Confederate Armies during the American Civil War===

On November 7, 1863, [[Edward D. Townsend]] of the Union army wrote General Order No. 360: “Satisfactory evidence having been produced to the War Department that a bronze equestrian statue, unlawfully taken from a private house in Fredericksburg, at the time of the capture of that place by the Union forces, was the private property of Mr. Douglas Gordon, of that city, it is— .Ordered: That it be restored to Mrs. Annie C. Thomas, the sister of Mr. Gordon, who has made application therefor.”&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Thomas M., and Oliver Diefendorf. ''General Orders of the War Department, Embracing the Years 1861, 1862 &amp; 1863''. Vol. 2. New York, NY: Derby &amp; Miller, 1864, p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Gordon's works of art were recovered through [[Lafayette C. Baker]], chief of the Union secret police.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Lafayette Curry. ''History of the United States Secret Service''. Philadelphia, PA: King &amp; Baird, Printers, 1867, p. 259-260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Congress enacted legislation allowing for claims to be filed for property losses on July 4, 1864. Claims were restricted to loyal citizens.

===Looting by Nazi Germany===

During World War II, the Nazis set up special departments "for a limited time for the seizure and securing of objects of cultural value",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/12-18-45.htm Letter from Rosenberg to the Reich Commissioner for the East and Reich Commissioner for the Ukraine, April 27, 1942], as cited in: Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 4.

December 18, 1945, Morning Session, Document 153-PS, Exhibit USA-381&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the Occupied Eastern Territories, including the [[Baltic states]], [[Ukraine]], [[Hungary]] and [[Greece]]. The Russian imperial residences around [[St. Petersburg]] were thoroughly looted and deliberately blown up, so that their restoration is still under way. The [[Catherine Palace]] and [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] were reduced to smoldering ruins; among the innumerable trophies was the world-famous [[Amber Room]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bruhn: Das Bernsteinzimmer in Zarskoje Selo bei Sankt-Petersburg, 2nd edition. Berlin, 2004 {{ISBN|978-3-86155-109-6}}. In an updated version also available as bibliographical database [http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~pbruhn/bernzim.htm Das Bernsteinzimmer von Zarskoje Selo]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5msN0LHUv?url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~pbruhn/bernzim.htm |date=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval churches of [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]], with their unique 12th-century frescoes, were systematically plundered and reduced to piles of rubble. Major museums around [[Moscow]], including [[Yasnaya Polyana]], [[Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery]], and [[New Jerusalem Monastery|New Jerusalem]], faced a similar fate, with their architectural integrity irrevocably impaired.

The legal framework and the language of the instructions used by Germany resembles the [[Lieber Code]], but in the [[Nuremberg Trial]] proceedings, the victorious Allied armies applied different standards and sentenced the Nazis involved as [[war criminals]]. Article 6 of the [[Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] of Nuremberg, detailing the Jurisdiction and General Principles, declares the "plunder of public or private property" a war crime,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/imtconst.htm#art6 Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 1, Charter of the International Military Tribunal, II. Jurisdiction and General Principles, Article 6]. Yale.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Lieber Code and the actions of the Allied armies in the aftermath of World War II allowed or tolerated the looting. The main objective of the looting is made clear by Dr. Muhlmann, responsible for the securing of all Polish art treasures: "I confirm that the art treasures ... would not have remained in Poland in case of a German victory, but they would have been used to complement German artistic property."&lt;ref name=nuremberg&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/12-18-45.htm Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 4. Twenty-Second Day. December 18, 1945, Morning Session]. Yale.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

One inventory of 39 volumes featuring the looted art and antiques, prepared by the Nazis and discussed during the Nuremberg trials, lists "21,903 Works of Art: 5,281 paintings, pastels, water colors, drawings; 684 miniatures, glass and enamel paintings, illuminated books and manuscripts; 583 sculptures, terra cottas, medallions, and plaques; 2,477 articles of furniture of art historical value; 583 textiles (tapestries, rugs, embroideries, Coptic textiles); 5,825 objects of decorative art (porcelains, bronzes, [[faience]], [[Maiolica|majolica]], ceramics, jewelry, coins, art objects with precious stones); 1,286 East Asiatic art works (bronzes, sculpture, [[porcelain]]s, paintings, [[folding screen]]s, weapons); 259 art works of antiquity (sculptures, bronzes, vases, jewelry, bowls, [[engraved gem]]s, [[terracotta]]s)."&lt;ref name=nuremberg/&gt;

When Allied forces bombed Germany's cities and historic institutions, Germany "began storing the artworks in salt mines and caves for protection from Allied bombing raids. These mines and caves offered the appropriate humidity and temperature conditions for artworks."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rothfeld.

In 1998, and after considerable controversy, Russia passed the [[Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation]], which allowed Russians to keep the illegally stolen art works and museum pieces and to prevent any restitution to their rightful owners in Germany.

===Looting by the Spanish Empire and others===
The [[conquistador]]s looting Latin and South America became one of the most commonly recognized plunders in the world.

Roger Atwood writes in ''Stealing History: Tomb Raiders, Smugglers, and the Looting of the Ancient World'': "Mayan stonework became one of those things that good art museums in America just had to have, and looters in the jungles of southern Mexico and Guatemala worked overtime to meet the demand."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; (See: [[Maya stelae#Looting]])

Looting in Mesoamerica has a long tradition and history, many graves are looted before the archaeologists could reach them, and the artifacts are then sold to wealthy collectors in the United States, Japan or Europe. [[Guillermo Cock]], a Lima-based archaeologist, says about a recent find of dozens of exquisitely preserved Inca mummies on the outskirts of Peru's capital city, [[Lima]]: "The true problem is the looters," he said. "If we leave the cemetery it is going to be destroyed in a few weeks."&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

==Case studies==
A large number of institutions and museums have at various times been subject to both moral claims and legal claims concerning the provenance of their holdings subject to occasional review and challenge. One example of such a case study can be provided by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s reputation which has experienced a series of allegations and lawsuits about its status as an occasional institutional buyer of looted and stolen antiquities. Since the 1990s the Met has been the subject of numerous investigative reports and books critical of the Met's ''laissez-faire'' attitude to acquisition.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders&gt;Peter Watson, Cecilia Todeschini (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jlcPcCuicKQC&amp;q=Morgantina%20Met%20OR%20Metropolitan ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Silver, ''The Lost Chalice: The Epic Hunt for a Priceless Masterpiece''. Harper Collins Books, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-06-188296-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Met has lost several major lawsuits, notably against the governments of Italy and Turkey, who successfully sought the repatriation of hundreds of ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern antiquities, with a total value in the hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt;

In the late 1990s, long-running investigations by the [[Carabinieri Art Squad|Tutela del Patrimonio Culturale]] (TPC), the art crimes division of the Italian [[Carabinieri]], accused the Metropolitan Museum of acquiring "black market" antiquities. TPC investigations in Italy revealed that many ancient Mediterranean objects acquired from the 1960s to the 1990s had been purchased, via a complex network of front companies and unscrupulous dealers, from the criminal gang led by Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]]."&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt; The Met is also one of many institutional buyers known to have acquired looted artifacts from a Thai-based British "collector", [[Douglas Latchford]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chasingaphrodite.com/tag/metropolitan-museum-of-art/ Chasing Aphrodite]. "The Kushan Buddhas: Nancy Wiener, Douglas Latchford and New Questions about Ancient Buddhas" (originally posted 1 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Met announced that it would repatriate to [[Cambodia]] two ancient [[Khmer Republic|Khmer]] statues, known as "The Kneeling Attendants" , which it had acquired from Latchford (in fragments) in 1987 and 1992. A spokesperson for the Met stated that the museum had received "dispositive" evidence that the objects had been looted from Koh Ker and illegally exported to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-metropolitan-museum-returns-cambodian-statues-20130503-story.html Jason Felch, "Metropolitan Museum says it will return Cambodian statues"]. ''Los Angeles Times'', 3 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ongoing investigations by the Italian police ([[Carabinieri Art Squad|TPC]]), lawsuits brought by the Governments of Italy, Turkey and Cambodia against the Metropolitan Museum of Art contend that the acquisition of the Euphronius krater may have demonstrated a pattern of less than rigorous investigation into the origin and legitimate provenance of highly desirable antiquities for the museum's collections. Examples include, the [[Cloisters Cross]], a large [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cross carved from walrus ivory,&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt; the [[Karun Treasure]], also known as the Lydian Hoard, a collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE, and  part of a larger haul of some 450 objects looted by local tomb robbers from four ancient royal tombs near [[Sardis]], in Turkey in 1966–67.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761 "Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found"]. The History Blog, 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After a six-year legal battle that reportedly cost the Turkish government UK£25 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey "King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey"].Constanze Letch, ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the case ended dramatically after it was revealed that the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee described how a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects. The Met was forced to concede that staff had known the objects were stolen when it bought them, and the collection was repatriated to Turkey in 1993.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt;

The [[Morgantina treasure]] is a hoard of ornate Hellenistic silverware dated 3rd century BC, valued at perhaps up to US$100 million, acquired by the Met in the early 1980s. It was later shown to have been looted from the [[Morgantina|Morgantina archaeological site]] in Sicily. After a protracted lawsuit, the Met conceded that it was looted, and agreed in 2006 to repatriate it to Sicily, with the Met stating in 2006 that the repatriation "redresses past improprieties in the acquisitions process".&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article, [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/morgantina-silver/ "Morgantina Silver"], by Suzie Thomas, year 2012 at the website [http://traffickingculture.org/ TraffickingCulture.org], website devoted to illicit trafficking in ancient art objects. The article cites the following press release issued by the Metropolitian Museum on 21 Feb 2006: [http://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2006/statement-by-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-on-its-agreement-with-italian-ministry-of-culture "Statement by the Metropolitan Museum of Art on its agreement with the Italian Ministry of Culture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first of several cases across the [[United States]] that were reported to the police as supposed acts of retaliation for the attacks. Balbir Singh Sodhi, who wore a beard and a [[turban]] in accordance with his [[Sikh]] faith, was mistaken for an [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] and murdered by 42-year-old [[Frank Silva Roque]], a [[Boeing]] aircraft mechanic at a local repair facility who held a criminal record for an [[robbery|attempted robbery]] in [[California]]. Roque had reportedly told friends that he was "going to go out and shoot some towel-heads" the day of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Valarie|last=Karr|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-23/his-brother-was-murdered-wearing-turban-after-911-last-week-he-spoke-killer|title=His brother was murdered for wearing a turban after 9/11. 15 years later, he spoke to the killer|work=pri.org|date=September 23, 2016|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roque was sentenced to death ([[clemency|commuted]] later to [[life imprisonment]]) for [[first degree murder]].

== Background ==
Born in [[Punjab, India]], Balbir Singh Sodhi was a member of the [[Sikh]] religion. He immigrated to the United States in 1989 and initially resided in [[Los Angeles]], where he worked as a computer engineer and analyst at [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]. He saved enough money to buy a gas station and several affiliated franchises in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and moved there.&lt;ref name="NYT09-17-2001"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tamar | last=Lewin | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/us/sikh-owner-of-gas-station-is-fatally-shot-in-rampage.html? | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=Sikh Owner Of Gas Station Is Fatally Shot In Rampage | date=September 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2001, members of [[al-Qaeda]], a militant [[Islamist]] group, hijacked four airplanes and perpetrated [[September 11 attacks|the 9/11 attacks]], killing 2,977 victims. According to family members, Sodhi had become distraught by the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Naomi|last=Gingold|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-20/brother-one-first-hate-crime-victims-post-911-keeps-teaching-tolerance|title=The brother of one of the first hate-crime victims post 9/11 keeps on teaching tolerance|work=pri.org|date=September 20, 2016|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roque shootings==
On September 15, 2001, Roque took his [[Chevrolet S-10]] from the Wild Hare sports bar in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], where he had reportedly been ranting about immigrants, and drove to the [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron gas station]] owned by Sodhi. Roque shot Sodhi five times from his truck with a .380 handgun, killing him. At the time of the shooting, Sodhi was helping landscaper Luis Ledesma plant flowers around the edge of his gas station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Grado|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/news/roque-could-get-death-penalty-for-sikh-murder/article_83b74c56-3b8f-5e72-85af-ce8d4a4d944d.html|title=Roque could get death penalty for Sikh murder|work=[[East Valley Tribune]]|publisher=[[Times Media Group]]|location=Tempe, Arizona|date=October 1, 2003|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roque, who apparently wanted revenge for the 9/11 attacks, mistook him for an [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] because of the clothes he wore, his [[turban]], and his beard. Roque then drove to a [[Mobil|Mobil gas station]] 10 miles away. Twenty minutes after the first shooting, he shot at a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-American clerk from his truck, but missed.&lt;ref name="NYT09-17-2001" /&gt; Roque then drove to his former residence, which had been purchased by a local Afghan family, and fired multiple rounds at the outside of the house. After fleeing the scene of the final shooting, Roque was reported to have gone to a local bar and boasted, "They're investigating the murder of a turban-head down the street."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Sunny | last=Hundal| title = Wisconsin temple shooting: Sikhs have been silent scapegoats since 9/11 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/wisconsin-temple-shooting-sikh-scapegoats | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date = August 6, 2012|accessdate = August 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="splc"/&gt;

==Arrest, trial, conviction==
Police arrested Roque the next day, initially unaware of the later shooting incidents. He reportedly shouted slogans including "I am a patriot!" and "I stand for America all the way!" during his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/sac/dc0603/ch6.htm|title=Chapter 6: Fears and Concerns of Affected, At-Risk Communities|website=Usccr.gov|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[bail]] was set at $1 million.

Roque's [[trial by jury]] began on August 18, 2003. Defense attorneys argued he was not guilty [[plea of insanity|due to insanity]], claiming that he had a diminished [[IQ]] and heard relentless voices telling him that Arabs were Satanic and must be killed. Two coworkers testified that Roque was "narrow-minded" and that he hated both immigrants and Arabs. Roque's defense attorney characterized him as mentally ill, and noted that his mother had twice been hospitalized for [[schizophrenia]], a condition which has been shown to appear in those genetically predisposed to it.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Julian|last=Borger|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/11/usa.julianborger|title=September 11 revenge killer to die for shooting Sikh|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=10 October 2003|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 2003, he was found guilty of [[first degree murder]], and was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] nine days later.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

On July 19, 2005, Roque was found guilty of an unspecified conspiracy charge while in prison, specified only as a violent crime. On February 27, 2006, he was found guilty of having manufactured a primitive weapon in prison three days earlier. In August 2006, the Arizona Supreme Court changed Roque's death sentence to a sentence of life in prison without parole, citing his low IQ and [[mental illness]] as [[mitigating factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Michael|last1=Kiefer|first2=Jim|last2=Walsh|title=9/11-tied slayer won't be executed|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0815roque0815.html |work=[[Arizona Republic]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Phoenix, Arizona|date=August 15, 2006|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720154640/http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0815roque0815.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://korematsu.blogspot.com/2006/08/arizona-supreme-court-overturns-death.html |title=DNSI Blog: Arizona Supreme Court Overturns Death Sentence for Frank Roque - Killer of Balbir Singh Sodhi |publisher=Korematsu.blogspot.com |date=August 15, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was aired by [[Court TV]] in a five-part series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Walsh|url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/2003/09/03/149112-killer-of-sikh-after-9-11-called-ill/|title=Killer of Sikh after 9-11 called ill|work=[[Tucson Citizen]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Tucson, Arizona|date=September 3, 2003|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sukhpal Sodhi==
On August 4, 2002, less than a year after Sodhi's death, his younger brother Sukhpal was shot to death while driving his taxicab in San Francisco, apparently killed by a stray bullet from a nearby [[gang]] fight. In response to this second tragedy, Balbir's son Sukhwinder said, "What are you going to do with anger? We like peace and we are a peaceful people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Judi|last1=Villa|first2=Adam|last2=Klawonn|url=http://www.sikhmediawatch.org/newsite/news/newsdetail.asp?newsid%3D50 |title=Brother of slain Valley Sikh killed in San Francicso (sic)|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Phoenix, Arizona|date=August 6, 2002|accessdate=June 8, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030122220844/http://www.sikhmediawatch.org/newsite/news/newsdetail.asp?newsid=50 |archivedate=January 22, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nemesis''' is a [[hypothetical astronomical objects|hypothetical]] [[red dwarf]]&lt;ref name=Leader/&gt; or [[brown dwarf]],&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; originally postulated in 1984 &lt;ref&gt;{{M. Davis, P. Hut, and R. Muller, “Extinction of species by periodic comet showers,” Nature 308, 715 (1984).}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be orbiting the [[Sun]] at a distance of about 95,000 [[astronomical unit|AU]] (1.5 [[light-year]]s),&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; somewhat beyond the [[Oort cloud]], to explain a perceived [[Extinction event#Patterns in frequency|cycle of mass extinctions]] in the [[history of Earth|geological record]], which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Raup1984/&gt; {{As of|2012}}, more than 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified.&lt;ref name="DwarfArchives"/&gt; There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought. Rather than one star for every brown dwarf, there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf.&lt;ref name="space2012"/&gt; The majority of [[Sun|solar]]-type stars are single.&lt;ref name=Deepak2010/&gt; The previous idea stated half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary, trinary, or multiple-star systems associated with clusters of stars, rather than the single-star systems that tend to be seen most often.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In a 2017 paper, Sarah Sadavoy and Steven Stahler argued that the Sun was likely part of a [[binary system]] at the time of its formation, leading them to suggest "there probably was a Nemesis, a long time ago.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/06/13/new-evidence-that-all-stars-are-born-in-pairs/|title=New evidence that all stars are born in pairs|date=2017-06-13|work=Berkeley News|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadavoy|first=Sarah I.|last2=Stahler|first2=Steven W.|date=2017-05-03|title=Embedded binaries and their dense cores|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/469/4/3881/3795556%7Cjournal=Monthly|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=469|issue=4|pages=3881–3900|doi=10.1093/mnras/stx1061|issn=0035-8711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a star would have separated from this binary system over four billion years ago, meaning it could not be responsible for the more recent perceived cycle of mass extinctions, [[Douglas Vakoch]] told ''[[Business Insider]]'', adding that "If the sun really was part of a binary star system in its early days, its early twin deserves a benign name like Companion, rather than the threatening Nemesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stars-form-in-pairs-nemesis-theory-2018-4|title=All stars in the universe may form in pairs — but we can't find the sun's missing 'Nemesis'|last=Levine|first=David|date=2018-06-19|website=Business Insider|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More recent theories suggest that other forces, like close [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passage of other stars]], or the angular effect of the galactic gravity plane working against the outer solar orbital plane, may be the cause of orbital perturbations of some outer Solar System objects.&lt;ref name=Kenyon/&gt; In 2011, Coryn Bailer-Jones analyzed craters on the surface of the Earth and reached the conclusion that the earlier findings of simple periodic patterns (implying periodic comet showers dislodged by a hypothetical Nemesis star) were [[statistical artifact]]s, and found that the crater record shows no evidence for Nemesis.&lt;ref name="Myth2011"/&gt; However, in 2010, [[Adrian Melott|A.L. Melott]]&lt;!--position?--&gt; and R.K. Bambach&lt;!--position?--&gt; found evidence in the fossil record confirming the extinction event periodicity originally claimed by Raup &amp; Sepkoski in 1984, but at a higher confidence level and over a time period nearly twice as long.&lt;ref name="melott"/&gt; The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ([[IRAS]]) failed to discover Nemesis in the 1980s. The [[2MASS]] [[astronomical survey]], which ran from 1997 to 2001, failed to detect an additional star or brown dwarf in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Space2010-03"/&gt;

Using newer and more powerful infrared telescope technology which is able to detect brown dwarfs as cool as 150 [[kelvin]]s out to a distance of 10 [[light-year]]s from the Sun,&lt;ref name="browndwarf"/&gt; the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE survey) has not detected Nemesis.&lt;ref name="Morrison2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick2011v1"/&gt; In 2011, [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], a senior scientist at NASA known for his work in risk assessment of near Earth objects, has written that there is no confidence in the existence of an object like Nemesis, since it should have been detected in infrared sky surveys.&lt;ref name="Morrison2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrison"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrison2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA20140307"/&gt;

==Claimed periodicity of mass extinctions==
In 1984, [[paleontologists]] [[David M. Raup|David Raup]] and [[Jack Sepkoski]] published a paper claiming that they had identified a statistical periodicity in extinction rates over the last 250 million years using various forms of [[Time series|time series analysis]].&lt;ref name=Raup1984/&gt; They focused on the extinction intensity of [[fossil]] families of marine [[vertebrates]], [[invertebrates]], and [[protozoans]], identifying 12 [[extinction event]]s over the time period in question. The average time interval between extinction events was determined as 26 million years. At the time, two of the identified extinction events ([[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous–Paleogene]] and [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event|Eocene–Oligocene]]) could be shown to coincide with large impact events. Although Raup and Sepkoski could not identify the cause of their supposed periodicity, they suggested a possible non-terrestrial connection. The challenge to propose a mechanism was quickly addressed by several teams of astronomers.&lt;ref name=Whitmire1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis1984/&gt;

In 2010, Melott &amp; Bambach re-examined the fossil data, including the now-improved dating, and using a second independent database in addition to that Raup &amp; Sepkoski had used. They found evidence for a signal showing an excess extinction rate with a 27-million-year periodicity, now going back 500 million years, and at a much higher statistical significance than in the older work. They also determined that this periodicity is inconsistent with the Nemesis hypothesis. The change from 26 to 27 million years is expected based on a 3% "stretch" in the geological timescale since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="melott"/&gt;

==Development of the Nemesis hypotheses==
Two teams of [[astronomer]]s, Daniel P. Whitmire and Albert A. Jackson IV, and [[Marc Davis (astronomer)|Marc Davis]], [[Piet Hut]], and [[Richard A. Muller]], independently published similar [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain Raup and Sepkoski's extinction periodicity in the same issue of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Whitmire1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis1984/&gt; This hypothesis proposes that the Sun may have an undetected [[Binary Star|companion star]] in a highly elliptical orbit that periodically disturbs [[comet]]s in the [[Oort cloud]], causing a large increase of the number of comets visiting the inner Solar System with a consequential increase of [[impact event]]s on Earth. This became known as the "Nemesis" or "Death Star" hypothesis.

If it does exist, the exact nature of Nemesis is uncertain. Muller suggests that the most likely object is a [[red dwarf]] with an [[apparent magnitude]] between 7 and 12,&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; while Daniel P. Whitmire and Albert A. Jackson argue for a [[brown dwarf]].&lt;ref name="Whitmire1984"/&gt; If a red dwarf, it would exist in [[star catalog]]s, but it would only be confirmed by measuring its [[parallax]]; due to orbiting the Sun it would have a low [[proper motion]] and would escape detection by older proper motion surveys that have found stars like the 9th-magnitude [[Barnard's star]]. (The proper motion of Barnard's star was detected in 1916.)&lt;ref name="EEB"/&gt; Muller expects Nemesis to be discovered by the time parallax surveys reach the 10th magnitude.&lt;ref name="Muller2002"/&gt;

Muller, referring to the date of a recent extinction at 11 million years before the present day, posits that Nemesis has a [[semi-major axis]] of about {{convert|1.5|ly}}&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; and suggests it is located (supported by Yarris, 1987) near [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], based on a hypothetical orbit derived from original [[aphelion]]s of a number of atypical long-period comets that describe an orbital arc meeting the specifications of Muller's hypothesis. Richard Muller's most recent paper relevant to the Nemesis theory was published in 2002.&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; In 2002, Muller speculated that Nemesis was [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] 400 million years ago by a [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passing star]] from a circular orbit into an orbit with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.7.&lt;ref name="Muller2002"/&gt;

==Orbit of Sedna==
[[File:Oort cloud Sedna orbit.svg|thumb|300px|Sedna orbit compared to the Solar System and Oort cloud]]

The [[trans-Neptunian object]] [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] has an extra-long and unusual elliptical orbit around the Sun,&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; ranging between 76 and 937 AU. Sedna's orbit is estimated to last between 10.5 and 12 thousand years. Its discoverer, [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]] of Caltech, noted in a ''Discover'' magazine article that Sedna's location seemed to defy reasoning: "Sedna shouldn't be there", Brown said. "There's no way to put Sedna where it is. It never comes close enough to be affected by the Sun, but it never goes far enough away from the Sun to be affected by other stars."&lt;ref name="discover2006"/&gt; Brown therefore postulated that a massive unseen object may be responsible for Sedna's anomalous orbit.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; This line of inquiry eventually led to the hypothesis of [[Planet Nine]].

Brown has stated that it is more likely that one or more non-companion stars, passing near the Sun billions of years ago, could have pulled Sedna out into its current orbit.&lt;ref name="discover2006"/&gt; In 2004, Kenyon forwarded this explanation after analysis of Sedna's orbital data and computer modeling of possible ancient non-companion star passes.&lt;ref name=Kenyon/&gt;

==Past, current, and pending searches for Nemesis==
Searches for Nemesis in the infrared are important because cooler stars comparatively shine more brightly in infrared light. The [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]]'s [[Leuschner Observatory]] failed to discover Nemesis by 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=Ph.D. |title=An Astrometric Search for a Stellar Companion to the Sun |last=Perlmutter |first=Saul |authorlink=Saul Perlmutter |date=1986 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ([[IRAS]]) failed to discover Nemesis in the 1980s. The [[2MASS]] [[astronomical survey]], which ran from 1997 to 2001, failed to detect a star, or brown dwarf, in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; If Nemesis exists, it may be detected by [[Pan-STARRS]] or the planned [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope|LSST]] astronomical surveys.

In particular, if Nemesis is a [[red dwarf]] or a [[brown dwarf]], the [[WISE mission]] (an infrared sky survey that covered most of our solar neighborhood in movement-verifying [[parallax]] measurements) was expected to be able to find it.&lt;ref name="mullen2010"/&gt; WISE can detect 150-kelvin brown dwarfs out to 10 [[light-year]]s. But the closer a brown dwarf is, the easier it is to detect.&lt;ref name="browndwarf"/&gt; Preliminary results of the WISE survey were released on April 14, 2011.&lt;ref name=NASA2011-117/&gt; On March 14, 2012, the entire catalog of the WISE mission was released.&lt;ref name="fullrelease"/&gt; In 2014 WISE data ruled out a [[Saturn]] or larger-sized body in the Oort cloud out to ten thousand AU.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/march/nasas-wise-survey-finds-thousands-of-new-stars-but-no-planet-x/ NASA's WISE Survey Finds Thousands of New Stars, But No 'Planet X']&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculations in the 1980s suggested that a Nemesis object would have an irregular orbit due to  perturbations from the galaxy and passing stars. The Melott &amp; Bambach work&lt;ref name="melott"/&gt; shows an extremely regular signal, inconsistent with the expected irregularities in such an orbit. Thus, while supporting the extinction periodicity, it appears to be inconsistent with the Nemesis hypothesis, though of course not inconsistent with other kinds of [[substellar object]]s. According to a 2011 NASA news release, "recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals, and thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed."&lt;ref name="Tyche2011-060"/&gt;

[[Image:Kosuth OneAndThreeChairs.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Kosuth]], ''One and Three Chairs'' (1965)]]

'''''One and Three Chairs''''', 1965, is a work by [[Joseph Kosuth]]. An example of [[conceptual art]], the piece consists of a [[chair]], a photograph of the chair, and an enlarged dictionary definition of the word "chair". The photograph depicts the chair as it is actually installed in the room, and thus the work changes each time it is installed in a new venue.

Two elements of the work remain constant: a copy of a dictionary definition of the word "chair" and a diagram with instructions for installation. Both bear Kosuth's signature. Under the instructions, the installer is to choose a chair, place it before a wall, and take a photograph of the chair. This photo is to be enlarged to the size of the actual chair and placed on the wall to the left of the chair. Finally, a blow-up of the copy of the dictionary definition is to be hung to the right of the chair, its upper edge aligned with that of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Dickel, Hans u.a.: Die Sammlung Paul Maenz. Neues Museum Weimar. Edition Cantz, Ostfildern-Ruit 1998, p. 82s.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early conceptual art==

"Event cards" of [[Fluxus]]-artists like [[George Brecht]], [[Dick Higgins]] and [[Yoko Ono]] prefigured Kosuth's concern with the difference between a concept and its mode of presentation. These artists also tackled the problem of presenting "concepts" to an art audience. ''One and Three Chairs'' is, perhaps, a step towards a resolution of this problem. Rather than present the viewer with the bare written instructions for the work, or make a live event of the realization of the concept (in the manner of the Fluxus artists), Kosuth instead unifies concept and realization. ''One and Three Chairs'' demonstrates how an artwork can embody an idea that remains constant despite changes to its elements. 

Kosuth stresses the difference between concept and presentation in his writings (e.g., "Art after Philosophy", 1969&lt;ref name="Kosuth1"&gt;Kosuth J., (1969), [http://www.ubu.com/papers/kosuth_philosophy.html ''Art after Philosophy, part 1'']&lt;/ref&gt;
) and interviews (see the quotation below). He tries to intimately bind the conceptual nature of his work with the nature of art itself, thus raising his instructions for the presentation of an artwork to the level of a discourse on art. In 1963 [[Henry Flynt]] articulated these problems in the article "Concept Art".&lt;ref&gt;Flynt, Henry: [http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html ''Concept Art'']. In: Mac Low, Jackson/Young: LaMonte (ed.): An Anthology. New York 1963, unpaginated.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a forerunner to Kosuth's thematization of "Concept Art" in "Art after Philosophy", the text that made ''One and Three Chairs'' famous.&lt;ref&gt;Kosuth, Joseph: Art after Philosophy, Part III. In: Studio International, November 1969, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==

The work ''One and Three Chairs'' can be seen to highlight the relation between language, picture and referent. It problematizes relations between object, visual and verbal references ([[denotation (semiotics)|denotations]]) plus semantic fields of the term chosen for the verbal reference. The term of the dictionary includes [[connotation (semiotics)|connotations]] and possible denotations which are  relevant in the context of the presentation of ''One and Three Chairs''. The meanings of the three elements are congruent in certain semantic fields and incongruent in other semantic fields: A semantic congruity ("One") and a threefold incongruity ("One and Three").  Ironically,  ''One and Three Chairs'' can be looked upon as simple but rather complex model, of the science of signs. A viewer may ask "what's real here?" and answer that "the definition is real"; Without a definition, one would never know what an actual chair is.

There exist different interpretations of these semantic and ontological aspects. Some refer to [[Plato]]´s ''Republic'' (Book X);&lt;ref&gt;Gerwen, Rob van: Introducing My Philosophical Directions: [http://www.phil.uu.nl/~rob/directions/cave.shtml Plato´s Cave]. Universiteit Utrecht 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; others refer to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]´s ''Tractatus''&lt;ref&gt;Inboden, Gudrun: Introduction: Joseph Kosuth - Artist and Critic of Modernism. In: Joseph Kosuth: The Making of Meaning. Selected Writings and Documentation of Investigations on Art Since 1965. Cat. of exhib. Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. Stuttgart 1981, p. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s triad icon-index-symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Tragatschnig, Ulrich: Konzeptuelle Kunst. Interpretationsparadigmen: Ein Propädeutikum. Reimer, Berlin 1998, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Dreher discusses the semantic problems of ''One and Three Chairs'' as inclusions of circles which represent semantic fields.&lt;ref&gt;Dreher, Thomas: Konzeptuelle Kunst in Amerika und England zwischen 1963 und 1976. Thesis Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität/Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main 1992, p. 70-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work tends to defy formal analysis because one chair can be substituted for another chair, rendering the photograph and the chair photographed elusive to description. Nevertheless the particular chair and its accompanying photograph lend themselves to formal analysis. There are many chairs in the world; thus only those actually used can be described. Those chairs not used would not be analyzed. The enlarged dictionary definition of the word chair is also open to formal analysis, as is the diagram containing instructions of the work.

==The concept and the theory of art==
Kosuth's thematization of semantic congruities and incongruities can be seen as a reflection of the problems which the relations between concept and presentation pose. Kosuth uses the related questions, "how meanings of signs are constituted" and "how signs refer to extra-lingual phenomena" as a fundament to discuss the relation between concept and presentation. Kosuth tries to identify or equate these philosophical problems with the theory of art. Kosuth changes the art practice from hand-made originals to notations with substitutable realizations, and tries to exemplify the relevance of this change for the theory of art. 

In "Art after Philosophy," Kosuth provoked a confrontation with the formal criticism of [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried]]. Both exposed the concept of the art work as a non-substitutable instance realized by an artist who follows no other criteria than visual ones. They defined this concept as the core of modernism. In the sixties, Greenberg's and Fried's modernist doctrine dominated the American discussions on art; meanwhile, the artists [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Dick Higgins]], Henry Flynt, [[Mel Bochner]], [[Robert Smithson]] and Joseph Kosuth wrote articles on art exemplifying a pluralistic anti- and post-modernist tendency which gained more influence at the end of the sixties. In 1968, Greenberg tried to disqualify the new tendencies as "'novelty' art": "The different mediums are exploding...when everybody is a revolutionary the revolution is over."&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Clement: [http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/avantgarde.html Avant Garde Attitudes], 1968. The Jon Power Lecture in Contemporary Art, 17 Mai 1968. First published in: In Memory of John Joseph Wardell Power. Power Institute of Fine Arts, University of Sydney, 1969. Republished in: Greenberg, Clement: The Collected Essays and Criticism. volume 4: Modernism with a Vengeance, 1957-1969. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 1993, p. 292, 299.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Hunter]] offered a more positive view in 1972: "The situation of open possibilities which confronted artists in the first years of the seventies allowed a variety of means and many fertile idea systems to coexist, reconciling through the poetic imagination apparent contradictions." &lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Sam: American Art of the 20th Century. New York 1972, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotation==
Joseph Kosuth, WBAI, April 7, 1970:

:"I used common, functional objects - such as a chair - and to the left of the object would be a full-scale photograph of it and to the right of the object would be a photostat of a definition of the object from the dictionary. Everything you saw when you looked at the object had to be the same that you saw in the photograph, so each time the work was exhibited the new installation necessitated a new photograph. I liked that the work itself was something other than simply what you saw. By changing the location, the object, the photograph and still having it remain the same work was ''very'' interesting. It meant you could have an art work which was that ''idea'' of an art work, and its formal components weren't important." &lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Jeanne: Artwords. Discourse on the 60s and 20s. UMI Research Press, Ann Arbour/Michigan 1985; second edition Da Capo Press, New York 1992, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OptimJ''' is an extension of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] with language support for writing optimization models and abstractions for bulk data processing. The extensions and the proprietary product implementing the extensions were developed by Ateji which went out of business in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;
 {{cite web

  | accessdate=2012-01-11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
OptimJ aims at providing a clear and concise algebraic notation for optimization modeling, removing compatibility barriers between optimization modeling and application programming tools, and bringing software engineering techniques such as object-orientation and modern IDE support to optimization experts.

OptimJ models are directly compatible with Java source code, existing Java libraries such as database access, Excel connection or graphical interfaces. OptimJ is compatible with development tools such as Eclipse, CVS, JUnit or JavaDoc. OptimJ is available free with the following solvers: lp_solve, glpk, LP or MPS file formats and also supports the following commercial solvers: [[Gurobi]], [[MOSEK]], IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.

==Language concepts==

OptimJ combines concepts from object-oriented imperative languages with concepts from [[algebraic modeling language]]s for optimization problems. Here we will review the optimization concepts added to Java, starting with a concrete example.

==The example of map coloring==

The goal of a map coloring problem is to color a map so that regions sharing a common border have different colors. It can be expressed in OptimJ as follows.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
package examples;

// a simple model for the map-coloring problem
public model SimpleColoring solver lpsolve
{
  // maximum number of colors
  int nbColors = 4;

  // decision variables hold the color of each country
  var int belgium in 1 .. nbColors;
  var int denmark in 1 .. nbColors;
  var int germany in 1 .. nbColors;

  // neighbouring countries must have a different color
  constraints {
    belgium != germany;
    germany != denmark;
  }

  // a main entry point to test our model
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    // instantiate the model
    SimpleColoring m = new SimpleColoring();

    // solve it
    m.extract();
    m.solve();

    // print solutions
    System.out.println("Belgium: " + m.value(m.belgium));
    System.out.println("Denmark: " + m.value(m.denmark));
    System.out.println("Germany: " + m.value(m.germany));
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Readers familiar with Java will notice a strong similarity with this language. Indeed, OptimJ is a [[conservative extension]] of Java: every valid Java program is also a valid OptimJ program and has the same behavior.

This map coloring example also shows features specific to optimization that have no direct equivalent in Java, introduced by the keywords &lt;code&gt;model&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;constraints&lt;/code&gt;.

==OR-specific concepts==

===Models===

A model is an extension of a Java class that can contain not only fields and methods but also constraints and an objective function. It is introduced by the &lt;code&gt;model&lt;/code&gt; keyword and follows the same rules as class declarations. A non-abstract model must be linked to a solver, introduced by the keyword &lt;code&gt;solver&lt;/code&gt;. The capabilities of the solver will determine what kind of constraints can be expressed in the model, for instance a linear solver such as [[lp solve]] will only allow linear constraints.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
public model SimpleColoring solver lpsolve
&lt;/source&gt;

===Decision variables===

Imperative languages such as Java provide a notion of [[Imperative programming|imperative variable]]s, which basically represent memory locations that can be written to and read from.

OptimJ also introduces the notion of a decision variable, which basically represents an unknown quantity whose value one is searching. A solution to an optimization problem is a set of values for all its decision variables that respects the constraints of the problem—without decision variables, it would not possible to express optimization problems. The term "decision variable" comes from the optimization community, but decision variables in OptimJ are the same concept as logical variables in logical languages such as Prolog.

Decision variables have special types introduced by the keyword &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;. There is a &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; type for each possible Java type.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  // a var type for a Java primitive type
  var int x;

  // a var type for a user-defined class
  var MyClass y;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the map coloring example, decision variables were introduced together with the range of values they may take.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  var int germany in 1 .. nbColors;
&lt;/source&gt;

This is just a shorthand equivalent to putting a constraint on the variable.

===Constraints===

Constraints express conditions that must be true in any solution of the problem. A constraint can be any Java boolean expression involving decision variables.

In the map coloring example, this set of constraints states that in any solution to the map coloring problem, the color of Belgium must be different from the color of Germany, and the color of Germany must be different from the color of Denmark.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  constraints {
    belgium != germany;
    germany != denmark;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

The operator &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; is the standard Java not-equal operator.

Constraints typically come in batches and can be quantified with the &lt;code&gt;forall&lt;/code&gt; operator. For instance, instead of listing all countries and their neighbors explicitly in the source code, one may have an array of countries, an array of decision variables representing the color of each country, and an array &lt;code&gt;boolean[][] neighboring&lt;/code&gt; or a predicate (a boolean function) &lt;code&gt;boolean isNeighbor()&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
constraints {
  forall(Country c1 : countries, Country c2 : countries, :isNeighbor(c1,c2)) {
    color[c1] != color[c2];
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Country c1 : countries&lt;/code&gt; is a generator: it iterates &lt;code&gt;c1&lt;/code&gt; over all the values in the collection &lt;code&gt;countries&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;:isNeighbor(c1,c2)&lt;/code&gt; is a filter: it keeps only the generated values for which the predicate is true (the symbol &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; may be read as "if").

Assuming that the array &lt;code&gt;countries&lt;/code&gt; contains &lt;code&gt;belgium&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;germany&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;denmark&lt;/code&gt;, and that the predicate &lt;code&gt;isNeighbor&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for the couples (&lt;code&gt;Belgium &lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Germany&lt;/code&gt;) and (&lt;code&gt;Germany&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Denmark&lt;/code&gt;), then this code is equivalent to the constraints block of the original map coloring example.

===Objectives===

Optionally, when a model describes an optimization problem, an objective function to be minimized or maximized can be stated in the model.

==Generalist concepts==

Generalist concepts are programming concepts that are not specific to OR problems and would make sense for any kind of application development. The generalist concepts added to Java by OptimJ make the expression of OR models easier or more concise. They are often present in older modeling languages and thus provide OR experts with a familiar way of expressing their models.

===Associative arrays===

While Java arrays can only be indexed by 0-based integers, OptimJ arrays can be indexed by values of any type. Such arrays are typically called [[associative array]]s or maps. In this example, the array &lt;code&gt;age&lt;/code&gt; contains the age of persons, identified by their name:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  int[String] age;
&lt;/source&gt;

The type &lt;code&gt;int[String]&lt;/code&gt; denoting an array of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; indexed by &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. Accessing OptimJ arrays using the standard Java syntax:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  age["Stephan"] = 37;
  x = age["Lynda"];
&lt;/source&gt;

Traditionally, associative arrays are heavily used in the expression of optimization problems. OptimJ associative arrays are very handy when associated to their specific initialization syntax. Initial values can be given in [[intention|intensional definition]], as in:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
int[String] age = { 
  "Stephan" -&gt; 37,
  "Lynda"   -&gt; 29 
};
&lt;/source&gt;

or can be given in [[Extensibility|extensional definition]], as in:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  int[String] length[String name : names] = name.length();
&lt;/source&gt;

Here each of the entries &lt;code&gt;length[i]&lt;/code&gt; is initialized with &lt;code&gt;names[i].length()&lt;/code&gt;.

===Extended initialization===

===Tuples===

[[Tuple]]s are ubiquitous in computing, but absent from most mainstream languages including Java. OptimJ provides a notion of tuple at the language level that can be very useful as indexes in combination with associative arrays.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  (: int, String :) myTuple = new (: 3, "Three" :);
  String s = myTuple#1;
&lt;/source&gt;

Tuple types and tuple values are both written between &lt;code&gt;(:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt;.

===Ranges===

===Comprehensions===

[[List comprehension|Comprehension]]s, also called aggregates operations or reductions, are OptimJ expressions that extend a given binary operation over a collection of values. A common example is the sum:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  // the sum of all integers from 1 to 10
  int k = sum { i | int i in 1 .. 10};
&lt;/source&gt;

This construction is very similar to the big-sigma [[summation]] notation used in mathematics, with a syntax compatible with the Java language.

Comprehensions can also be used to build collections, such as lists, sets, multisets or maps:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  // the set of all integers from 1 to 10
  HashSet&lt;Integer&gt; s = `hashSet(){ i | int i in 1 .. 10};
&lt;/source&gt;

Comprehension expressions can have an arbitrary expression as target, as in:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  // the sum of all squares of integers from 1 to 10
  int k = sum { i*i | int i in 1 .. 10};
&lt;/source&gt;

They can also have an arbitrary number of generators and filters:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  // the sum of all f(i,j), for 0&lt;=i&lt;10, 1&lt;=j&lt;=10 and i!=j 
  int k = sum{ f(i,j) | int i : 10, int j : 1 .. 10, :i!=j }
&lt;/source&gt;

Comprehension need not apply only to numeric values. Set or multiset-building comprehensions, especially in combination with tuples of strings, make it possible to express queries very similar to SQL database queries:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
  // select name from persons where age &gt; 18
  `multiSet(){ p.name | Person p : persons, :p.age &gt; 18 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In the context of optimization models, comprehension expressions provide a concise and expressive way to pre-process and clean the input data, and format the output data.

==Development environment==

OptimJ is available as an Eclipse plug-in. The compiler implements a [[Source-to-source compiler|source-to-source translation]] from OptimJ to standard Java, thus providing immediate compatibility with most development tools of the Java ecosystem.

==OptimJ GUI and Rapid Prototyping==

Since the OptimJ compiler knows about the structure of all data used in models, it is able to generate a structured graphical view of this data at compile-time. This is especially relevant in the case of associative arrays where the compiler knows the collections used for indexing the various dimensions.

The basic graphical view generated by the compiler is reminiscent of an [[OLAP cube]]. It can then be customized in many different ways, from simple coloring up to providing new widgets for displaying data elements.

The compiler-generated OptimJ GUI saves the OR expert from writing all the glue code required when mapping graphical libraries to data. It enables rapid prototyping, by providing immediate visual hints about the structure of data.

Another part of the OptimJ GUI reports in real time performance statistics from the solver. This information can be used for understanding performance problems and improving solving time. At this time, it is available only for lp_solve.

==Supported solvers==

OptimJ is available for free with the following solvers lp_solve, glpk, LP or MPS file formats and also supports the following commercial solvers: [[Gurobi]], Mosek, IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.

Word ''Pafama'' is an abbreviation of the German ''PApier-FArben-MAlerei'', ({{lang-de|Paper, color, painting}}) which is a word from [[zenitism]] vocabulary, meaning that the artist focuses on the painting process and materials, a radical approach at the beginning of the third decade of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.posta.hr/default.aspx?id=744&amp;m=53256 HRVATSKA LIKOVNA UMJETNOST - JOSIP SEISSEL, PAFAMA, posta.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This is a square painting of small dimensions whose center is dominated by multi-colored geometric elements on a black background. It is based on the principles of [[suprematism]] and is reduced to primary geometric shapes - triangle, rectangle, polygon and cone. In addition, it is reduced to the primary colors - red, yellow, blue and their derivatives which are projected on a black background.

The painting is characterized by structural imaging techniques and is synonymous with European [[avant-garde]] art at the time. The painting marks the appearance of avant-garde art in Croatia and leaves lasting effects on the Croatian art in the 20th century and especially in the 1950s and 1960s, when neo-[[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] trends were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avantgarde-museum.com/en/museum/collection/authors/josip-seissel-jo-klek~pe4481/ |title=Josip Seissel |website=avantgarde-museum.com |access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its size is 17x17 cm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1810">A '''pasigraphy''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶσι ''pasi'' "to all" and γράφω ''grapho'' "to write") is a [[writing system]] where each written [[symbol]] represents a concept (rather than a word or sound or series of sounds in a spoken language).

The aim (as with ordinary numerals 1, 2, 3, etc.) is to be intelligible to persons of all languages. The term was first applied to a system proposed in 1796, though a number of pasigraphies had been devised prior to that; [[Leopold Einstein]] reviews 60 attempts at creating an [[international auxiliary language]], the majority of the 17th–18th century projects being pasigraphies of one kind or another,&lt;ref name="einstein1884"&gt;Leopold Einstein, "Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibniz ĝis la Nuna Tempo", 1884. Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', UEA 1992 [1903].&lt;/ref&gt; and several pasigraphies and auxiliary languages, including some sample texts, are also reviewed in [[Arika Okrent]]'s book on constructed languages.&lt;ref name="okrent2009"&gt;Arika Okrent, ''In The Land of Invented Languages'', Spiegel &amp; Grau 2009 ({{ISBN|0385527888}}).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] wrote about the [[alphabet of human thought]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] corresponded with [[Peter Stephen Du Ponceau]] who proposed a universal [[phonemic orthography|phonetic alphabet]].

Examples of pasigraphies include [[Blissymbols]] and [[An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language|Real Character]].

One of the most visible approaches to '''peer learning''' comes out of [[cognitive psychology]], and is applied within a "mainstream" [[education]]al framework: "Peer learning is an educational practice in which students interact with other students to attain educational goals."&lt;ref name="peer-learning-book"&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum
| isbn = 0805824480
| last = O'Donnell

|author2=A. King
| title = Cognitive perspectives on peer learning
| year = 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it can be compared to the practices that go by the name [[cooperative learning]]. However, other contemporary views on peer learning relax the constraints, and position "'''peer-to-peer learning'''" as a mode of "learning for everyone, by everyone, about almost anything."&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt&gt;Jeff Brazil, May 23, 2011, [http://dmlcentral.net/blog/jeff-brazil/p2pu-learning-everyone-everyone-about-almost-anything P2PU: Learning for Everyone, by Everyone, about almost Anything]&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether it takes place in a [[Formal learning|formal]] or [[Informal learning|informal]] learning context, in small groups or [[Social peer-to-peer processes|online]], peer learning manifests aspects of [[self-organization]] that are mostly absent from [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] models of teaching and learning.

==Connections with other practices==
=== Constructivism===
In his 1916 book, [[Democracy and Education]], [[John Dewey]] wrote, “Education is not an affair of 'telling' and being told, but an active and constructive process.” In a later essay, entitled "Experience and Education",&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [http://ruby.fgcu.edu/courses/ndemers/colloquium/ExperiencEducationDewey.pdf Experience and Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey went into greater detail about the science of child development and developed the basic [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivist]] theory that knowledge is created through experience, rather than passed down from teacher to student through rote memorization.  Soviet psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]], who developed the concept of the [[Zone of Proximal Development]], was another proponent of constructivist learning: his book, ''Thought and Language'', provides evidence that students learn better through collaborative, meaningful problem-solving activities than through solo exercises.

The three distinguishing features of constructivist theory are claims that:&lt;ref name=akhras-and-self&gt;{{Cite book
| chapter=Modeling the process, not the product, of learning
| last=Akhras
| first=F.N.
|author2=Self, J.A.
| editor=S.P. Lajoie
| title=Computers as cognitive tools, volume two: No more walls,
| pages=3–28
| year=2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Learning occurs within a context that is itself part of what is learned
* Knowing and doing cannot be separated
* Learning is a process that is extended over time
These are clearly meaningful propositions in a social context with sustained relationships, where people work on projects or tasks that are collaborative or otherwise shared.

Educational Psychology Professor Alison King explains in "Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning"&lt;ref name=alisonking&gt;Alison King, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1477535?seq=4 Promoting Thinking Through Peer Learning]&lt;/ref&gt; that peer learning exercises as simple as having students explain concepts to one another are proof of social constructivism theory at work; the act of teaching another individual demands that students “clarify, elaborate on, and otherwise reconceptualize material.” Joss Winn, Senior Lecturer in Educational Research at University of Lincoln, proposes that schools radically redefine the teacher-student relationship to fit this constructivist theory of knowledge in his December 2011 paper, "Student as Producer".&lt;ref name=winn&gt;Joss Winn, [http://joss.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2011/01/28/pedagogy-technology-and-student-as-producer/ Student as Producer]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Rogers]]' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"&lt;ref name=carlrogers&gt;[http://www.panarchy.org/rogers/learning.html Carl Rogers' "Personal Thoughts on Learning"]&lt;/ref&gt; focus on the individual’s experience of effective learning, and eventually conclude that nearly the entire traditional educational structure is at odds with this experience. Self-discovered learning in a group that designates a facilitator is the “new approach” Rogers recommends for education.

In general, peer learning may adapt [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] or [[discovery learning]] methods for the peer-to-peer context: however, peer learning typically manifests constructivist ideas in a more informal way, when [[learning]] and [[collaboration]] are simply applied to solve some real shared problem.

===Critical pedagogy===

[[Critical pedagogy]] engages students and instructors in analyzing and critiquing power structures around them. The most influential scholar in the development of this field was [[Paulo Freire]], whose book [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] described the traditional teaching framework as a “banking system” in which students are thought of as empty vessels to be filled with knowledge and concepts.  Instead, Freire advocated a more equitable relationship between teachers and students, one in which information is questioned and situated in political context, and all participants in the classroom work together to create knowledge.

Freire’s vision for dialogical education, where learning is situated within students’ lived experience, has been commonly deemed idealistic by modern educators.  Yet Paulo Blikstein, Assistant Professor of Education at Stanford University wrote in ''Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation''&lt;ref name=troy&gt;[http://www.blikstein.com/paulo/documents/books/Blikstein-TravelsInTroyWithFreire.pdf Travels in Troy with Freire: Technology as an Agent of Emancipation]&lt;/ref&gt; that through exploratory building activities, “Not only did students become more autonomous and responsible, they learned to teach one another.”

=== Connectivism ===

[[Yochai Benkler]] explains how the now-ubiquitous computer helps us produce and process knowledge together with others in his book, [[The Wealth of Networks]]. [[George Siemens]] argues in [http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age], that technology has changed the way we learn, explaining how it tends to complicate or expose the limitations of the learning theories of the past.  In practice, the ideas of connectivism developed in and alongside the then-new social formation, "[[massive open online course]]s" or MOOCs.

[[Connectivism]] proposes that the knowledge we can access by virtue of our connections with others is just as valuable as the information carried inside our minds. The learning process, therefore, is not entirely under an individual’s control—learning can happen outside ourselves, as if we are a member of a large organization where many people are continuously updating a shared database.

Rita Kop and Adrian Hill, in their critique of connectivism,&lt;ref name=connectivism-critique&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Connectivism: Learning theory of the future or vestige of the past?

| first = R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that:
: it does not seem that connectivism’s contributions to the new paradigm warrant it being treated as a separate learning theory in and of its own right.  Connectivism, however, continues to play an important role in the development and emergence of new pedagogies, where control is shifting from the tutor to an increasingly more autonomous learner.

== Perspectives of other modern theorists ==

In a joint paper, Roy Williams, Regina Karousou, and Jenny Mackness argue that educational institutions should consider "emergent learning," in which learning arises from a self-organized group interaction, as a valuable component of education in the Digital Age.  Web 2.0 puts distributed individuals into a group setting where emergent learning can occur. However, deciding how to manage emergence is important; “fail-safe” management drives activity towards pre-determined outcomes, while “safe/fail experiments” steer away from negative outcomes while leaving space open for mistakes and innovation.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{Cite journal

| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams ''et al.'' also distinguish between the term “environment” as controlled, and “ecology” as free/open.

[[Cathy Davidson]] and [[David Theo Goldberg]] write in ''The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age'' about the potential of “participatory learning,” and a new paradigm of education that is focused on mediated interactions between peers.
They argue that if institutions of higher learning could begin to value this type of learning, instead of simply trying to implement “Instructional Technology” in classrooms, they could transform old models of university education. Davidson and Goldberg introduce “Ten Principles for the Future of Learning,”  which include self-learning, horizontal structures, and open source education.  [[Peter Sloterdijk]]'s recent book "You Must Change Your Life" proposes similar ideas in the context of a "General Disciplinics" that would "counteract the atrophy of the educational system" by focusing on forms of learning that takes place through direct participation in the disciplines.&lt;ref name="Sloterdijk-change"&gt;{{Cite book

[[Yochai Benkler]] &amp; [[Helen Nissenbaum]] discuss implications for the realm of moral philosophy in their 2006 essay, 
"Commons-Based Peer Production and Virtue".&lt;ref name="benkler-and-nissenbaum"&gt;{{Cite journal

Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff proposed the label “paragogy” to describe a collection of “best practices of effective peer learning.”&lt;ref name=paragogy-paper&gt;Joseph Corneli and Charles Jeffrey Danoff, [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:Arided/ParagogyPaper Paragogy: Synergizing individual and organizational learning]&lt;/ref&gt; They published a short book&lt;ref name="paragogy-book"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
along with several papers in which they discuss five "paragogical principles" that form the core of their proposed [[Learning theory (education)#Informal and post-modern theories|learning theory]].  These were generated by rethinking [[Malcolm Knowles]] principles of [[andragogy]] for a learning context that is co-created by the learners.

==Experiments==

The learning theories and approaches described above are currently being tested in peer-learning communities around the world, often adapting [[educational technology]] to support [[informal learning]], though results in formal learning contexts exist too.  For example, [[Eric Mazur]] and colleagues report on "Ten years of experience and results" with a teaching technique they call "[[Peer Instruction]]":

: Peer Instruction engages students during class through activities that require each student to apply the core concepts being presented, and then to explain those concepts to their fellow students.&lt;ref name=mazur&gt;{{Cite journal
| title=Peer instruction: Ten years of experience and results,
| last=Crouch

| year=2001
| doi=10.1119/1.1374249
| citeseerx=10.1.1.113.6060
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach made early use of a variant of the technique that is now known as the "[[flipped classroom]]":

: To free up class time for ConcepTests, and to prepare students better to apply the material during class, students are required to complete the reading on the topics to be covered before class.

[[P2PU|Peer 2 Peer University]], or P2PU, which was founded in 2009 by Philipp Schmidt and others, is an example from the informal learning side.  Speaking about the beginnings of P2PU, Schmidt echoes Siemens’ connectivism ideas and explains that, “The expertise is in the group. That’s the message, that everyone can bring something to the conversation.”&lt;ref name=dml-schmidt /&gt;  In numerous public talks, Schmidt argues that current educational models are "broken" (particularly on the basis of the high cost of university-level training).   He suggests that social assessment mechanisms similar to those applied in open-source software development can be applied to education.&lt;ref name="jps"&gt;{{Cite journal

Jeff Young’s article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, "When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas",&lt;ref name=young&gt;Jeff Young, Chronicle of Higher Education, [http://chronicle.com/article/When-Professors-Print-Their/1185/ When Professors Print Their Own Diplomas]&lt;/ref&gt; sparked a conversation about the necessity of formal degrees in an age when class lectures can be uploaded for free. The MIT Open Teaching initiative, for example, has since 2001 put all of its course materials online.  But [[David A. Wiley]], then Psychology Professor at Utah State, went further, signing certificates for whoever takes his class.  A similar practice has become even more visible in learning projects like [[Udacity]], [[Coursera]], and [[EdX]].  Although these projects attempt to "scale education" by distributing learning materials produced by experts (not classic examples of peer learning), they do frequently feature peer-to-peer discussions in forums or offline.&lt;ref name=anya&gt;Anya Kamenetz, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2012/06/kamenetz Who can Learn Online, And How?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications in development ==

In the forward to a book on the ''Power of peer learning'' by Jean-H. Guilmette, Maureen O'Neil, then president of Canada's International Development Research Centre, states that
: Our experience has proven that [peer learning] is an efficient way to transmit knowledge across a wide range of groups or regions. Peer learning, based on jointly generated evidence, is also an effective means to build capacity and foster scientific excellence. The body of knowledge it generates is a powerful tool for the development of evidence-based policy.&lt;ref name=power-peer&gt;{{Cite book
| last = Guilmette
| first = J-H.
| title = Power of peer learning : networks and development cooperation
| publisher = IDRC, Ottawa, ON, CA
| url = http://hdl.handle.net/10625/28624
| year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilmette suggests that peer learning is useful in the development context because
:It is my view that managing networks, especially those that are made up of sovereign nations, is fundamentally different from managing companies, organizations, or ministries that fall under a single authority. In essence, the dominant management approach for companies and institutions rests on cybernetics, with the view of keeping communications and accountability simple and clear. Managing methods that are successful in such a context [are] counterproductive when managing networks.

Guilmette cites Anne K. Bernard, who in a report based on extensive interviews, concludes:

: Effective networks act not simply on the basis of optimizing within constraints by attempting to force-fit predicted, linear and regulated programmes of work onto dynamic policy and client communities. Rather, they hone capacities and create mechanisms for the regular feedback and reflected analyses which are needed to deal with the ambiguity of these environments, and to adapt interactively with them.&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

[[Marlene Scardamalia|Scardamalia]] and [[Carl Bereiter|Bereiter]] explain in "Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities"&lt;ref name=s-and-b&gt;Scardamalia and Bereiter, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1466822 Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities]&lt;/ref&gt; that computers in the classroom have the opportunity to restructure the learning environment, but too often they are simply used to provide a digital version of a normal lesson or exam. They propose that classrooms be exchanged for “[[Knowledge building|knowledge-building communities]]” where students can use computers to connect to and create knowledge in the outside world.  However, as illustrated in citations above, this way of thinking about learning is often at odds with traditional educational praxis.

In "The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning", Kurliha, Miettinen, Nokelainen, and Tirri found a "difference in
learning outcomes based on the tools used."&lt;ref name=k-and-m&gt;J. Kurhila, M. Miettinen, P. Nokelainen, and H. Tirri, [http://cosco.hiit.fi/Articles/hiit-2004-10.pdf The Role of the Learning Platform in Student-Centered E-Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the variables at work are not well understood, and are the subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref name=alpine-retreat&gt;Call for participation: Workshop at the Alpine Rendez-Vous 2013 January, 28 - February, 1st 2013 [http://engaged.hnlc.org/story_comments/list/18 It's About Time: Addressing the Many Challenges of Analyzing Multi-Scale Temporal Data]&lt;/ref&gt;   Within a formal education setting, a 1994 study found that students were more responsive to feedback from a teacher than they were to [[Peer feedback#Limitations|peer feedback]].  However, another later study showed that training in assessment techniques had a positive impact on individual student performance.

A classic study&lt;ref name=garbarino&gt;{{cite journal

Although other more recent work has shown that non-monetary rewards or acknowledgement can make a difference in ''performance'' (for certain populations of peer producers),&lt;ref name=barnstar&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Experimental Study of Informal Rewards in Peer Production

| pmid=22479610
| pmc=3315525
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the exact motivations for going out of the way to teach or tutor someone else are not clearly understood. As mentioned [[Peer Learning#Connections with Constructivism|above]], learning is often just part of solving a problem, so "peer learning" and "peer teaching" would tend to happen informally when people solve problems in groups.

==Peer learning in practice==
===Research on peer learning===

Research on peer learning may involve [[participant observation]], and may itself be [[Commons-Based Peer Production|peer produced]].  Some of this research falls under the broader umbrella of [[Scholarship of Teaching and Learning]].  [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]] is one obvious context in which to study peer learning, since in such settings "learning is observably and accountably embedded in collaborative activity."&lt;ref name=koschmann&gt;{{Cite journal
| last=Koschmann
| first=T.
| year=2001
| title=Revising the paradigms of instructional technology
| journal=Meeting at the Crossroads: 8th Annual Conference of the Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, peer learning can play a role in settings where traditional conceptions of both "teaching" and "learning" do not apply, for instance, in [[peer review|academic peer review]], in [[organizational learning]], in development work, and in public health programmes.  Research in these areas may fall within the area of [[organizational studies|organization science]], [[science, technology and society]] (STS) or other fields.

A '''person''' is a being that has certain capacities or attributes such as [[reason]], [[morality]], [[consciousness]] or [[self-consciousness]], and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as [[kinship]], [[ownership]] of [[property]], or [[legal obligation|legal responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0169.xml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Craemer, Willy. “A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Personhood.” The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. Health and Society, vol. 61, no. 1, 1983, pp. 19–34., www.jstor.org/stable/3349814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Smith. 2003. Moral, Believing Animals: Human Personhood and Culture. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrithers, Michael, Steven Collins, and Steven Lukes, eds. 1985. The category of the person: Anthropology, philosophy, history. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The defining features of [[personhood]] and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.

In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about [[personal identity]] and [[self]]: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.

The common plural of "person", "[[people]]", is often used to refer to an entire [[nation]] or [[ethnic group]] (as in "a people"). The plural "persons" is often used in [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[law|legal]] writing.

==Development of the concept==

In ancient Rome, the word ''[[persona]]'' (Latin) or ''[[prosopon]]'' (πρόσωπον; Greek) originally referred to the masks worn by actors on stage. The various masks represented the various "personae" in the stage play.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1911|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|volume=11|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this, it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of person was further developed during the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] and [[Christology|Christological]] debates of the 4th and 5th centuries in contrast to the word nature.&lt;ref&gt;Thisleton NIGNTC commentary on 1 Corinthians "Thinkers in ancient times had a difficulty in expressing the notion of personality"; Barfield in History of English Words “Take, for instance, the word person...Its present meaning of an individual human being is largely due to the theologians who hit upon it when they were looking for some term that would enable them to assert the trinity of Godhead without admitting more than one 'substance'"; John Zizioulas in ''Being as Communion'', 1985 New York:St Vladimirs Press p. 27 writes: "although the person and “personal identity” are widely discussed nowadays as a supreme ideal, nobody seems to recognize that historically as well as existentially the concept of the person is indissolubly bound up with theology."&lt;/ref&gt;  During the theological debates, some philosophical tools (concepts) were needed so that the debates could be held on common basis to all theological schools. The purpose of the debate was to establish the relation, similarities and differences between the Λóγος/''Verbum'' and God. The philosophical concept of person arose, taking the word "[[prosopon]]" (πρόσωπον) from the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek theatre]]. Therefore, Christus (the Λóγος/''Verbum'') and God were defined as different "persons". This concept was applied later to the Holy Ghost, the angels and to all human beings.

Since then, a number of important changes to the word's meaning and use have taken place, and attempts have been made to redefine the word with varying degrees of adoption and influence.

==Personhood==

{{main article|Personhood}}

{{quotation|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt|}}
Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]], and is closely tied to legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].
Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate, and has been questioned during the abolition of [[slavery]] and the fight for [[women's rights]], in debates about [[abortion]], [[fetal rights]], and in [[animal rights]] advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of non-human personhood, see Midgley, Mary. [http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/midgley01.htm "Persons and non-persons"], in Peter Singer (ed.) ''In Defense of Animals''. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various debates have focused on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities. Historically, the personhood of animals, women, and slaves has been a catalyst of social upheaval. In most societies today, living adult humans are usually considered persons, but depending on the context, theory or definition, the category of "person" may be taken to include or not [[adultism|children]] or such [[Non human|non-human]] entities as [[animals]], [[artificial intelligences]], or [[extraterrestrial life]], as well as legal entities such as [[corporations]], [[sovereign states]] and other [[Polity|polities]], or [[estate (law)|estate]]s in [[probate]].&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5-4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal identity==
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|What does it take for individuals to persist from moment to moment – or in other words, for the same individual to exist at different moments?]]
{{main article|Personal identity}}

Personal identity is the [[Identity (philosophy)|unique identity]] of persons through time. That is to say, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the ''same'' person, persisting through time. In the modern [[philosophy of mind]], this concept of personal identity is sometimes referred to as the ''[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]]'' problem of personal identity. The ''[[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]'' problem is grounded in the question of what features or traits characterize a given person at one time.

Identity is an issue for both [[continental philosophy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A key question in continental philosophy is in what sense we can maintain the modern conception of identity, while realizing many of our prior assumptions about the world are incorrect.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Proposed solutions to the problem of personal identity include continuity of the physical body, continuity of an immaterial mind or soul, continuity of consciousness or memory,&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).  Charleston SC, USA: CreateSpace.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[bundle theory]] of self,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} continuity of personality after the death of the physical body,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of post-mortal personhood, see Roth, S. (2013) ''Dying is only human. The case death makes for the immortality of the person''. Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Inquiry, Vol. 11, No. 2, pp. 35-39. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2260793]&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals that there are actually no persons or selves who persist over time at all.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

{{Rights}}
'''Personal rights''' are the rights that a person has over their own body. In the Merriam-Webster Dictionary Person Rights are defined as "rights (as of personal security, personal liberty, and private property) appertaining to the person".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/personal%20rights|title=Definition of PERSONAL RIGHTS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among personal rights are associated rights to protect and safeguard the body, most obviously protected by the [[tort]]s of [[assault (tort)|assault]] and [[Battery (tort)|battery]]. Furthermore, aspects of [[wikt:personality|personality]] are protected, such as a person's [[reputation]] and [[honour]], by the tort of [[defamation]], and [[legislation]] protecting the [[privacy]] of individuals, and freedom of movement.

In English [[land law]], a personal right (from the Latin ''ius in personam'') refers to a permission to use land for a specific purpose that is personal to the owner and which cannot bind future purchasers of the land. A personal right is thus distinct from a [[proprietary right|proprietary (property) right]] (''ius in rem'') which refers to a right that affects the land itself, such as a [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].

'''Predicable''' (Lat. praedicabilis, that which may be stated or affirmed, sometimes called ''quinque voces'' or ''five words'') is, in [[term logic|scholastic logic]], a term applied to a [[Categorization|classification]] of the possible relations in which a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] may stand to its [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].  It is not to be confused with '[[praedicamenta]]', the [[scholasticism|schoolmen's]] term for [[Aristotle]]'s ten [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]].

The list given by the schoolmen and generally adopted by modern logicians is based on the original fivefold classification given by Aristotle ([[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]], a iv. 101 b 17-25): [[definition]] (''horos''), [[Genus (philosophy)|genus]] (''genos''), [[differentia]] (''diaphora''), [[property (logic)|property]] (''idion''), and [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] (''sumbebekos'').&lt;ref&gt;Strictly Aristotle's classification is into four as διαφορά ([[differentia|''diaphora'']]) really belongs to γένος ([[Genus (philosophy)|''genos'']]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The scholastic classification, obtained from [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boëthius]]'s Latin version of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'', modified Aristotle's by substituting [[species (logic)|species]] (''eidos'') for definition.  Both classifications are of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[concept]]s or general [[terminology|terms]], [[proper names]] of course being excluded.  There is, however, a radical difference between the two systems.  The standpoint of the Aristotelian classification is the predication of one universal concerning another.  The Porphyrian, by introducing species, deals with the predication of universals concerning individuals (for species is necessarily predicated of the individual), and thus created difficulties from which the Aristotelian is free (see below).

The Aristotelian classification is: 
* The ''definition'' of anything is the statement of its [[essence]] (Arist. τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι), i.e., that which makes it what it is: e.g., a triangle is a three-sided rectilinear figure.
* ''Genus'' is that part of the essence which is also predicable of other things different from them in kind. A triangle is a rectilinear figure; i.e., in fixing the genus of a thing, we subsume it under a higher universal, of which it is a species. 
* ''Differentia'' is that part of the essence which distinguishes one species from another. As compared with quadrilaterals, hexagons, and so on, all of which are rectilinear figures, a triangle is differentiated as having three sides.
* A ''property'' is an attribute which is common to all the members of a class, but is not part of its essence (i.e., need not be given in its definition). The fact that the interior angles of all triangles are equal to two right angles is not part of the definition, but is universally true.
* An ''accident'' is an attribute which may or may not belong to a subject. That the colour of a human's hair should be black, for instance, is an accident, for blackness-of-hair belongs in no way to the essence of humanity, nor do all humans have black hair.

This classification, though it is of high value in the clearing up of our conceptions of the essential contrasted with the accidental, the relation of genus, differentia and definition and so forth, is of more significance in connection with abstract sciences, especially mathematics, than for the physical sciences. It is superior on the whole to the Porphyrian scheme, which has grave defects. As has been said, the Porphyrian scheme classifies universals as predicates of individuals and thus involves the difficulties which gave rise to the controversy between realism and nominalism. How are we to distinguish species from genus? Napoleon was a Frenchman, a man, an animal. In the second place how do we distinguish property and accident? Many so-called accidents are predicable necessarily of any particular persons. This difficulty gave rise to the distinction of separable and inseparable accidents, which is one of considerable difficulty.

Some Aristotelian examples may be briefly mentioned. In the true statement “Man is a rational animal,” the predicate is convertible with the subject and states its essence; therefore, “rational animal” is the definition of man. The statements “Man is an animal” and “Man is rational,” while true, are not convertible; their predicate terms, however, are parts of the definition and hence are the genus and differentia of man. On the other hand, the statement “Man is capable of learning grammar” is true and convertible; but “capable of learning grammar” does not state the essence of man and is therefore a property of man. The true statement “Man is featherless” offers an example of an accident. Its predicate is not convertible with its subject, nor is it part of the definition; accordingly, it expresses only an accidental characteristic of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/predicable |title=Predicable, Logic |publisher=Encycopledia Britannica |access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Procrastination''' is defined as the avoidance of doing a task that needs to be accomplished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen K. Kirst-Ashman|author2=Grafton H. Hull, Jr.|title=Empowerment Series: Generalist Practice with Organizations and Communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvK6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=2016|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-305-94329-2|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could be further stated as a habitual/intentional [[Delayed gratification|delay]] of starting or finishing a task despite its negative consequences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrari|first=Joseph|date=June 2018|title=Delaying Disposing: Examining the Relationship between Procrastination and Clutter across Generations|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12144-017-9679-4.pdf|journal=Current Psychology|volume=(New Brunswick, N.J.)

It is a common human experience involving delay in everyday chores or even putting off salient tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment, or broaching a stressful issue with a partner.

The most prominent explanation in present literature draws upon "Intemporal discounting, task averseness and certain personality traits such as indecisiveness and distractibility" as the common causes of procrastination.

A study of behavioural patterns of pigeons through delayed reward suggests that procrastination is not unique to humans, but can also be observed in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazur|first=James|date=1998|title=Procrastination by Pigeons with Fixed-Interval Response Requirements|journal=Experimental Analysis Behav|volume=69|pages=|via=|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284653/pdf/9540230.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Latin: ''procrastinare'', ''pro-'', 'forward', with ''-crastinus'', 'till next day' from "''cras''", 'tomorrow'

== Prevalence ==
In a study of academic procrastination from the [[University of Vermont]], published in 1984, 46% of the subjects reported that they "always" or "nearly always" procrastinate writing papers, while approximately 30% reported procrastinating studying for exams and reading weekly assignments (by 28% and 30% respectively). Nearly a quarter of the subjects reported that procrastination was a problem for them regarding the same tasks. However, as many as 65% indicated that they would like to reduce their procrastination when writing papers, and approximately 62% indicated the same for studying for exams and 55% for reading weekly assignments.&lt;ref name="Solomon1984"&gt;{{cite web |author= Solomon, LJ |author2=Rothblum |url= http://rothblum.sdsu.edu/doc_pdf/procrastination/AcademicProcrastinationFrequency.pdf|date=1984|title=Academic Procrastination: Frequency and Cognitive-Behavioural Correlates|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729211829/http://rothblum.sdsu.edu/doc_pdf/procrastination/AcademicProcrastinationFrequency.pdf|archivedate=2016-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 study showed that "52% of surveyed students indicated having a moderate to high need for help concerning procrastination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gallagher |first1=Robert P. |last2=Golin |first2=Anne |last3=Kelleher |first3=Kathleen |journal=Journal of College Student Development |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=301–10|date=1992 |title=The Personal, Career, and Learning Skills Needs of College Students|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-03494-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 80–95% of college students engage in procrastination, and approximately 75% consider themselves procrastinators.

In a study performed on university students, procrastination was shown to be greater on tasks that were perceived as [[unpleasant]] or as impositions than on tasks for which the student believed they lacked the required skills for accomplishing the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norman A. Milgram |author2=Barry Sroloff |author3=Michael Rosenbaum |title=The Procrastination of Everyday Life|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=22|number=2|date=June 1988|pages=197–212|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(88)90015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral criteria of academic procrastination ==
Gregory Schraw, Theresa Wadkins, and Lori Olafson in 2007 proposed three criteria for a behavior to be classified as academic procrastination: it must be counterproductive, needless, and delaying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.99.1.12 |title=Doing the Things We Do: A Grounded Theory of Academic Procrastination |year=2007 |last1=Schraw |first1=Gregory |last2=Wadkins |first2=Theresa |last3=Olafson |first3=Lori |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |volume=99 |pages=12–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel reviewed all previous attempts to define procrastination, and concluded in a 2007 study that procrastination is "to voluntarily delay an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay."&lt;ref name="Steel2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65 |url=http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf |title=The Nature of Procrastination: A Meta-Analytic and Theoretical Review of Quintessential Self-Regulatory Failure |year=2007 |last1=Steel |first1=Piers |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=133 |pages=65–94 |pmid=17201571 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401132716/http://studiemetro.au.dk/fileadmin/www.studiemetro.au.dk/Procrastination_2.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-01 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.335.2796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabini &amp; Silver argued that postponement and irrationality are the two key features of procrastination. Delaying a task is not deemed as procrastination, they argue, if there are rational reasons behind the delay.

An approach that integrates several core theories of motivation as well as meta-analytic research on procrastination is the [[temporal motivation theory]]. It summarizes key predictors of procrastination (expectancy, value, and impulsiveness) into a mathematical equation.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

== Psychological perspective==
The [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] may be responsible for procrastination; one may prefer to avoid negative emotions by delaying stressful tasks. As the deadline for their target of procrastination grows closer, they are more stressed and may, thus, decide to procrastinate more to avoid this stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pychyl, T.|date=20 February 2012|accessdate=20 February 2012|title=The real reasons you procrastinate — and how to stop|publisher=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/27/why-you-cant-help-read-this-article-about-procrastination-instead-of-doing-your-job/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[psychologist]]s cite such behavior as a [[coping mechanism|mechanism for coping]] with the [[anxiety]] associated with starting or completing any task or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Penguin Group| isbn = 978-1-58542-552-5| last = Fiore| first = Neil A| title = The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play| location = New York| year = 2006| page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Piers Steel indicated in 2010 that anxiety is just as likely to induce people to start working early as late, and that the focus of studies on procrastination should be [[impulsiveness]]. That is, anxiety will cause people to delay only if they are impulsive.&lt;ref name=Steel2010&gt;{{cite book |last=Steel |first=Piers |title=The Procrastination Equation: How to Stop Putting Things Off and Start Getting Stuff Done |year=2010 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-170361-4}}{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coping responses ===
Negative coping responses of procrastination tend to be avoidant or emotional rather than task-oriented or focused on problem-solving. Emotional and avoidant coping is employed to reduce stress (and [[cognitive dissonance]]) associated with delaying intended and important personal goals. This option provides immediate pleasure and is consequently very attractive to impulsive procrastinators, at the point of discovery of the achievable goals at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1520-8583.2007.00127.x |title=Self-Deception As Pretense |year=2007 |last1=Gendler |first1=Tamar Szabó |journal=Philosophical Perspectives |volume=21 |pages=231–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gosling|first=J.|title=Weakness of the Will|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}{{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several emotion-oriented strategies, similar to Freudian [[defense mechanisms]], [[Coping (psychology)|coping styles]] and [[self-handicapping]].  
 
Coping responses of procrastinators include the following.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

*[[Avoidance coping|Avoidance]]: Avoiding the location or situation where the task takes place (e.g. a graduate student avoiding driving into the university).
*[[Denial]] and [[trivialization (psychology)|trivialization]]: Pretending that procrastinatory behavior is not actually procrastinating, but rather a task which is more important than the avoided one, or that the essential task that should be done is not of immediate importance.
*[[Distraction]]: Engaging or immersing in other behaviors or actions to prevent awareness of the task (e.g. [[Cyberslacking|intensive video game playing or web browsing]]). The subject is very sensitive to instant gratification and becomes absorbed in coping behaviors beyond self-restraint.
* Descending [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactuality]]: Comparing consequences of one's procrastinatory behavior with others' worse situations (e.g. "Yes, I procrastinated and got a B− in the course, but I didn't fail like one other student did.")
*Valorisation: Pointing in satisfaction to what one achieved in the meantime while one should have been doing something else.
* Blaming: Delusional attributions to external factors, such as rationalizing that the procrastination is due to external forces beyond one's control (e.g. "I'm not procrastinating, but this assignment is tough.")
* Mocking: Using [[humor]] to validate one's procrastination. The person uses [[slapstick]] or slipshod methods to criticize and ridicule others' striving towards the goal.

Task- or problem-solving measures are taxing from a procrastinator's outlook. If such measures are pursued, it is less likely the procrastinator would remain a procrastinator. However, pursuing such measures requires actively changing one's behavior or situation to prevent and minimize the re-occurrence of procrastination.

In 2006, it was suggested that neuroticism has no direct links to procrastination and that any relationship is fully mediated by [[conscientiousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.05.010 |title=A Closer Look at the Relationships Among Trait Procrastination, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness |year=2006 |last1=Lee |first1=Dong-gwi |last2=Kelly |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Edwards |first3=Jodie K. |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=40 |pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, it had been suggested that irrationality was an inherent feature of procrastination. "Putting things off even until the last moment isn't procrastination if there is a reason to believe that they will take only that moment".&lt;ref name="Sabini &amp; Silver."&gt;Sabini, J. &amp; Silver, M. (1982) Moralities of everyday life, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Steel ''et al.'' explained in 2001, "actions must be postponed and this postponement must represent poor, inadequate, or inefficient planning".&lt;ref name="Steel2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steel | first1 = P. | last2 = Brothen | first2 = T. | last3 = Wambach | first3 = C. | year = 2001 | title = Procrastination and Personality, Performance and Mood | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900000131 | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 30| issue = | pages = 95–106| doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health perspective ==
To a certain degree it is [[normality (behavior)|normal]] to procrastinate and it can be regarded as a useful way to prioritize between tasks, due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks (for most people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavlina|first=Steve|title=How to Fall in Love with Procrastination|url=http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/06/how-to-fall-in-love-with-procrastination/|accessdate=18 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419055057/http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2010/06/how-to-fall-in-love-with-procrastination/|archivedate=19 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, [[stress (medicine)|stress]],&lt;ref name="Tice1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tice | first1 = DM | last2 = Baumeister | first2 = RF | year = 1997 | title = Longitudinal Study of Procrastination, Performance, Stress, and Health: The Costs and Benefits of Dawdling | jstor = 40063233 | journal = Psychological Science| volume = 8| issue = 6| page = | pages=454–58 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00460.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.461.1149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anxiety]], sense of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[crisis]] as well as loss of personal [[productivity]] and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination becomes almost [[chronic condition|chronic]]. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also [[social stigma]] and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of [[Self discipline|willpower]] or low ambition. In some cases problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying [[mental illness|psychological disorder]], but not necessarily.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

Research on the [[physiological]] roots of procrastination have been concerned with the role of the [[prefrontal cortex]],&lt;ref name="Evans2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James R.|title=Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20oUOtjs9DkC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=8 August 2007|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7890-3360-4|page=293|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601195833/http://books.google.com/books?id=20oUOtjs9DkC&amp;pg=PA293|archivedate=1 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the area of the brain that is responsible for [[executive functions|executive brain functions]] such as [[impulse control]], [[attention]] and planning. This is consistent with the notion that procrastination is strongly related to such functions, or a [[Executive dysfunction|lack thereof]]. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this area can reduce one's ability to avert diversions, which results in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased procrastination. This is similar to the prefrontal lobe's role in [[ADHD|attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], where it is commonly underactivated.&lt;ref name="strub"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2775008 |year=1989 |last1=Strub |first1=RL |title=Frontal Lobe Syndrome in a Patient with Bilateral Globus Pallidus Lesions |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=1024–27 |journal=Archives of Neurology |doi=10.1001/archneur.1989.00520450096027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 U.S. study surveying procrastination and impulsiveness in [[twin#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal-]] and [[twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|identical twin]] pairs, both traits were found to be "moderately heritable". The two traits were not separable at the genetic level (r&lt;sub&gt;genetic&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.0), meaning no unique genetic influences of either trait alone was found.&lt;ref name="gustav"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gustavson|first=Daniel E|author2=Miyake A|author3=Hewitt JK|author4=Friedman NP|title=Genetic Relations Among Procrastination, Impulsivity, and Goal-Management Ability Implications for the Evolutionary Origin of Procrastination|journal=Psychological Science|date=4 April 2014|volume=25|doi= 10.1177/0956797614526260|pmid=24705635|issue=6|pages=1178–88|pmc=4185275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors confirmed three constructs developed from the evolutionary hypothesis that procrastination arose as a by-product of impulsivity: "(a) Procrastination is heritable, (b) the two traits share considerable genetic variation, and (c) goal-management ability is an important component of this shared variation."&lt;ref name="gustav" /&gt;

== Management ==
[[Psychologist]] William J. Knaus estimated that more than 90% of college students procrastinate.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis and Knaus, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Of these students, 25% are chronic procrastinators and typically abandon higher education (college dropouts).

Perfectionism is a prime cause for procrastination&lt;ref&gt;Hillary Rettig (2011). ''The 7 Secrets of the Prolific: The Definitive Guide to Overcoming Procrastination, Perfectionism, and Writer's Block''&lt;/ref&gt; because pursuing unattainable goals (perfection) usually results in failure. Unrealistic expectations destroy [[self-esteem]] and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness. To overcome procrastination, it is essential to recognize and accept the power of failure without condemning,&lt;ref&gt;James Prochaska, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Principles of ACT|date=October 2015}} to stop focusing on faults and flaws and to set goals that are easier to achieve.

Behaviors and practices that reduce procrastination:{{citation needed|reason=post the paraphrased guideline/Rx protocol|date=October 2015}}

* Awareness of habits and thoughts that lead to procrastinating.
* Seeking help for self-defeating problems such as fear, anxiety, difficulty in concentrating, poor time management, indecisiveness, and perfectionism.
* Fair evaluation of personal goals, strengths, weaknesses, and priorities.
* Realistic goals and personal positive links between the tasks and the concrete, meaningful goals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macan|first=Therese Hoff|date=1994|title=Time management: Test of a process model|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|language=en|volume=79|issue=3|pages=381–391|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.79.3.381|issn=0021-9010|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.4283}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Structuring and organization of daily activities. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Modification of one's environment for that newly gained perspective: the elimination or minimization of noise or distraction; investing effort into relevant matters; and ceasing day-dreaming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Disciplining oneself to set priorities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Motivation with enjoyable activities, socializing and constructive hobbies.
* Approaching issues in small blocks of time, instead of attempting whole problems at once and risking intimidation.
* To prevent relapse, reinforce pre-set goals based on needs and allow yourself to be rewarded in a balanced way for accomplished tasks.
 
Making a plan to complete tasks in a rigid schedule format might not work for everyone. There is no hard-and-fast rule to follow such a process if it turns out to be counter-productive. Instead of scheduling, it may be better to execute tasks in a flexible, unstructured schedule which has time slots for only necessary activities.&lt;ref&gt;Burka &amp; Yuen (1990). ''Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It''&lt;/ref&gt;

Piers Steel suggests&lt;ref&gt;The Procrastination Equation, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; that better [[time management]] is a key to overcoming procrastination, including being aware of and using one's "power hours" (being a "morning person" or "night owl"). A good approach is to creatively utilize one's internal [[circadian rhythms]] that are best suited for the most challenging and productive work. Steel states that it is essential to have realistic goals, to tackle one problem at a time and to cherish the "small successes". Brian O'Leary supports that "finding a work-life balance...may actually help us find ways to be more productive", suggesting that dedicating leisure activities as motivation can increase one's efficiency at handling tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/work-life-is-productivity-in-the-balance|title=Work-Life: Is Productivity in the Balance?|date=2004-07-05|work=HBS Working Knowledge|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After contemplating his own procrastination habits, philosopher [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] authored an essay entitled "Structured Procrastination",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|title=How to Procrastinate and Still Get Things Done|last=Perry|first=John|authorlink=John Perry (philosopher)|date=February 23, 1996|website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218090944/http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-ProcrastinateStill/93959|archive-date=February 18, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he proposes a "cheat" method as a safer approach for tackling procrastination: using a [[pyramid scheme]] to reinforce the unpleasant tasks needed to be completed in a quasi-prioritized order. In other words, the procrastinator should postpone tasks with a mental note that one feels to do while engaged in a work that requires their current attentional focus.

== Severe and negative impact ==
For some people, procrastination can be persistent and tremendously disruptive to everyday life. For these individuals, procrastination may be symptomatic of a psychological disorder. Procrastination has been linked to a number of negative associations, such as [[clinical depression|depression]], irrational behaviour, low [[self-esteem]], [[anxiety]] and neurological disorders such as [[ADHD]]. Others have found relationships with [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&lt;ref name="Pychyl2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pychyl | first1 = TA | last2 = Lee | first2 = JM | last3 = Thibodeau | first3 = R | last4 = Blunt | first4 = A | year = 2000 | title = Five Days of Emotion: An Experience Sampling Study of Undergraduate Student Procrastination (special issue) | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2002-10572-019 | journal = Journal of Social Behavior and Personality | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 239–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stress.&lt;ref name="Tice1997" /&gt; Therefore, it is important for people whose procrastination has become chronic and is perceived to be debilitating to seek out a trained [[psychotherapy|therapist]] or [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] to investigate whether an underlying mental health issue may be present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schouwenburg|first=H.C.|year=1993|title=Trait procrastination, time management, and academic behavior|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21344492853&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=8922AD549640D5B2BACA406E901F44B5.wsnAw8kcdt7IPYLO0V48gA%3a1|journal=Trait Procrastination, Time Management, and Academic Behavior|volume=8|pages=647–62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a distant deadline, procrastinators report significantly less stress and physical illness than do non-procrastinators. However, as the deadline approaches, this relationship is reversed. Procrastinators report more stress, more symptoms of physical illness, and more medical visits,&lt;ref name="Tice1997" /&gt; to the extent that, overall, procrastinators suffer more stress and health problems.

== Correlates ==
Procrastination has been linked to the complex arrangement of [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[Behavior|behavioral]] relationships from task desirability to low self esteem and [[anxiety]] to [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Solomon1984" /&gt; A study found that procrastinators were less future-oriented than their non-procrastinator counterparts. This result was hypothesized to be in association with [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] perspectives on the present; instead it was found procrastination was better predicted by a fatalistic and hopeless attitude towards life.&lt;ref name="Jackson2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = T. | last2 = Fritch | first2 = A. | last3 = Nagasaka | first3 = T. | last4 = Pope | first4 = L. | year = 2003 | title = Procrastination and Perceptions of Past, Present, and Future | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=2004-15383-003 | journal = Individual Differences Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 17–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation between procrastination and [[Morningness–eveningness questionnaire|eveningness]] was observed where individuals who had later sleeping and waking patterns were more likely to procrastinate{{Fact|date=August 2018}}. It has been shown that [[Morningness–eveningness questionnaire|Morningness]] increases across lifespan and procrastination decreases with age.&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;,&lt;ref name="Duffy2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duffy | first1 = JF | last2 = Czeisler | first2 = CA | year = 2002 | title = Age-Related Change in the Relationship Between Circadian Period, Circadian Phase, and Diurnal Preference in Humans | url =https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394001024272 | journal = | volume = | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Perfectionism ===
{{Main|Perfectionism (psychology)}}
Traditionally, procrastination has been associated with perfectionism: a tendency to negatively evaluate outcomes and one's own performance, intense fear and avoidance of evaluation of one's abilities by others, heightened social self-consciousness and anxiety, recurrent low mood, and "[[workaholic|workaholism]]". However, adaptive perfectionists—[[egosyntonic]] perfectionism—were ''less'' likely to procrastinate than non-perfectionists, while maladaptive perfectionists, who saw their perfectionism as a problem—[[egodystonic]] perfectionism—had high levels of procrastination and anxiety.&lt;ref name="McGarvey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rps.psu.edu/sep96/almost.html|title=The Almost Perfect Definition|author=McGarvey, Jason A.|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313153133/http://www.rps.psu.edu/sep96/almost.html|archivedate=2006-03-13|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a regression analysis study of Steel, from 2007, it is found that mild to moderate perfectionists typically procrastinate slightly less than others, with "the exception being perfectionists who were also seeking clinical counseling".&lt;ref name="Steel2007" /&gt;

=== Academic ===
According to an Educational Science Professor, Hatice Odaci, academic procrastination is a significant problem during college years in part because many college students lack efficient [[time management]] skills in using the Internet. Also, Odaci notes that most colleges provide free and fast twenty-four-hour Internet service which some students are not usually accustomed to, and as a result of irresponsible use or lack of firewalls these students become engulfed in distractions, and thus in procrastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odaci|first1=Hatice|title=Academic Self-Efficacy and Academic Procrastination as Predictors of Problematic Internet Use in University Students|date=August 1, 2011|url=https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=5624d9855cd9e38cd78b456e&amp;assetKey=AS%3A286236704034819%401445255556988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Student syndrome]]" refers to the phenomenon where a student will begin to fully apply themself to a task only immediately before a deadline. This negates the usefulness of any buffers built into individual task [[duration (project management)|duration]] [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]]. Results from a 2002 study indicate that many students are aware of procrastination and accordingly set binding deadlines long before the date for which a task is due. These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Ariely|first=Dan|author-link=Dan Ariely|last2=Wertenbroch|first2=Klaus|year=2002|title=Procrastination, Deadlines, and Performance: Self-Control by Precommitment|journal=Psychological Science|volume=13|issue=3|pages=219–224|url=http://web.mit.edu/ariely/www/MIT/Papers/deadlines.pdf|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00441|pmid=12009041|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215131540/http://web.mit.edu/ariely/www/MIT/Papers/deadlines.pdf|archivedate=2010-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In one experiment, participation in online exercises was found to be five times higher in the final week before a deadline than in the summed total of the first three weeks for which the exercises were available. Procrastinators end up being the ones doing most of the work in the final week before a deadline.&lt;ref name="Steel2001"/&gt;

Other reasons cited on why students procrastinate include fear of failure and success, perfectionist expectations, as well as legitimate activities that may take precedence over school work, such as a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/writing-the-paper/procrastination |title=Procrastination |publisher=The Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill |website=writingcenter.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318150005/http://writingcenter.unc.edu/resources/handouts-demos/writing-the-paper/procrastination |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procrastinators have been found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al. (1997) report that more than one-third of the variation in final exam scores could be attributed to procrastination. The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used procrastination scales&lt;ref name="Solomon1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckman1991"&gt;Tuckman, BW (1991). The Development and Concurrent Validity of the Procrastination Scale [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;UID=1991-32090-001]&lt;/ref&gt; were not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of procrastination on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.&lt;ref name="Howell2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howell | first1 = AJ | last2 = Watson | first2 = DC | last3 = Powell | first3 = RA | last4 = Buro | first4 = K | year = 2006 | title = Academic Procrastination: The Pattern and Correlates of Behavioral Postponement | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000055 | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 40| issue = 8| pages = 1519–30| doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.11.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a study conducted by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi and published in the ''[[Journal of Social Psychology]]'' intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis &amp; Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsin Chun Chu|first=Angela|last2=Nam Choi|first2=Jin|title=Rethinking Procrastination: Positive Effects of "Active" Procrastination Behavior on Attitudes and Performance|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=145|issue=3|pages=245–64|doi=10.3200/socp.145.3.245-264|pmid=15959999|year=2005|citeseerx=10.1.1.502.2444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different findings emerge when observed and self-reported procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini’s "irrational" and "postponement" criteria. They also sought to measure this behavior objectively.&lt;ref name="Steel2001"/&gt; During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each chapter quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified with the number of practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, may not be the most appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades. Steel et al. noted that those students who completed all of the practice exercises "tended to perform well on the final exam no matter how much they delayed."

Procrastination is considerably more widespread in students than in the general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/media-spotlight/201307/getting-around-procrastination|title=Getting Around to Procrastination|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the Effect of Academic Procrastination on the Frequency and Variety of Academic Misconduct: A Panel Study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = 40| issue = 6| pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study argues that academic misconduct can be seen as a means to cope with the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as performance impairment.

The '''Prusa i3''' is an [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[fused deposition modeling]] [[3D printer]]. Part of the [[RepRap project]], it is the most used desktop 3D printer for parts ordered through the [[3D Hubs]] fee-for-service business.&lt;ref name="PrusaOrg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prusaprinters.org/whats-up-with-original-prusa-i3/|title=What's up with Original Prusa i3? – Prusa Printers|date=2016-03-02|website=Prusa Printers|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://downloads.3dhubs.com/Digital_Manufacturing_Trends_Q3-2018.pdf|title=3D Printing Trends Q3 2018|website=3D Hubs|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prusa i3 was designed by Josef Průša in 2012 with the Prusa i3 MK2 being released in 2016 and the MK2S being released in 2017.&lt;ref name="Hackaday"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hackaday.com/2016/06/15/prusa-shows-us-the-new-i3-mk2-3d-printer-and-where-the-community-is-headed/|title=Prusa Shows Us the New i3 MK2 3D Printer and Where the Community is Headed|last=By|website=Hackaday|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version, called the Prusa i3 MK3 was released in September 2017 with significant improvements over the prior models.

==History==
The Prusa i3 is the third printer design by Josef Průša, a core developer of the RepRap project who had previously developed the PCB heated bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2172|title=PCB heated print bed  by josefprusa|last=Thingiverse.com|website=www.thingiverse.com|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first iteration was the Prusa Mendel&lt;ref name="Thingverse" /&gt; produced in 2010 followed by the Prusa Mendel (iteration 2), in 2011.&lt;ref name="Weekend" /&gt; The printer was named Prusa Mendel by the RepRap community rather than Průša himself.&lt;ref name="MakingSoc" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Prusa Mendel===
The first Prusa Mendel was released in September 2010 with the aim of simplifying the existing Mendel design, including reducing the time needed to create the 3D printed parts from 20 to 10 hours and 3D printable bushings replacing regular bearings.&lt;ref name="MakingSoc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thingverse"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/josefprusa/PrusaMendel/commit/6ed4480bd708121c18f67fc6903092e7dbaecb5f|title=first commit · josefprusa/PrusaMendel@6ed4480|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prusa Mendel (iteration 2)===
The second Prusa Mendel was released in November 2011 and with upgrades including snap fit parts, reduction of the number of tools needed to construct, maintain the printer and improved belts attached to the stepper motors and use of LM8UU linear bearings.&lt;ref name="Weekend"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://3dprintingindustry.com/news/hobbyist-weekend-with-prusa-mendel-3d-printer-2594/|title=Hobbyist Weekend – With Prusa Mendel 3D Printer|website=3D Printing Industry|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prusa i3===
In May 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/commit/d3618a65684dae11b45e364b28529af3ea1782e5|title=initial commit · josefprusa/Prusa3@d3618a6|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; designs (produced in [[OpenSCAD]]) for the Prusa i3 were released, it was a major redesign from previous versions and other RepRap printers. The design replaced the triangular threaded rod frame construction with a [[Water jet cutter|water jet cut]] [[Aluminium|aluminum]] frame, had a food-safe hot end called the Prusa Nozzle, and used M5 threaded screws instead of M8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hackaday.com/2016/04/18/implicitcad-programmatic-cad-built-with-3d-printing-in-mind/|title=ImplicitCAD: Programmatic CAD Built with 3D Printing in Mind|last=By|website=Hackaday|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hackaday.com/2014/11/19/interview-with-a-printer/|title=Interview With A Printer|last=By|website=Hackaday|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20130930-prusa-nozzle-all-metal-food-safe-reprap-hot-end-with-one-piece-design.html|title=Prusa Nozzle: All metal food safe RepRap hot-end|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hackaday.com/2016/04/29/fail-of-the-week-my-3d-printer-upgrade/|title=Fail Of The Week: My 3D Printer Upgrade|last=By|website=Hackaday|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design focused on ease of construction and use rather than maximising the number of self replicated components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.open-electronics.org/interview-to-josef-prusa/|title=Open Source 3D printing: an Interview with Josef Prusa|website=Open Electronics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Průša released a version which he called the Original Prusa i3, selling through his company Prusa Research.&lt;ref name="PrusaOrg" /&gt;

===Prusa i3 MK2===
In May 2016 the Prusa i3 MK2 was released, it is the first printer with automatic geometry skew correction for all three axes and includes a larger build volume, custom stepper motors with integrated lead screws, mesh bed levelling using a non-contact inductance sensor and a rewritten version of the Marlin [[firmware]].&lt;ref name="Hackaday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160517-prusa-research-unveils-original-prusa-i3-mk2-3d-printer.html|title=Josef Prusa unveils $699 Original Prusa i3 MK2 3D printer|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160517-prusa-research-unveils-original-prusa-i3-mk2-3d-printer.html|title=Josef Prusa unveils $699 Original Prusa i3 MK2 3D printer|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prusaprinters.org/first-printer-to-correct-geometry-in-all-axes/|title=The first printer to correct its geometry in all axes - Prusa Printers|date=2016-08-11|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other new features include a [[polyetherimide]] print surface, Rambo controller board and an E3D V6 Full hotend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/134786/prusa-i3-mk2-new-features/|title=The All New Original Prusa i3 MK2 Kit Has a Ton of New Features|date=2016-05-18|website=3DPrint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://3dprintingindustry.com/news/interview-josef-prusa-ceo-founder-prusa-research-81650/|title=Interview with Josef Prusa, CEO and Founder of Prusa Research|website=3D Printing Industry|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prusa MK2 became the first RepRap printer to be supported by Windows Plug-and-Play USB ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160523-microsoft-adds-network-3d-printing-support-with-windows-10-iot-core-app-for-raspberry-pi-3.html|title=Microsoft adds network 3D printing support with Windows 10 IoT Core app for Raspberry Pi 3|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prusa i3 MK2S===
In March 2017, Josef Prusa announced on his blog &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-i3-mk2s-release/|title=Original Prusa I3 MK2S Release|website=Official Prusa 3D printers community|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Prusa i3 MK2 was now shipping as the Prusa i3 MK2S.  
Enhancements cited include U-bolts to hold the LM8UU bearings, improved LM8UU bearings, smoother rods, an improved mount for the inductance sensor, improved cable management, and a new electronics cover.  While new shipments of the MK2 automatically receive the "S" upgrades, an upgrade kit is available to bring these improvements to earlier purchasers.

===Prusa i3 MK3 and MK2.5===
In September 2017, Prusa i3 MK3 was released,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original Prusa i3 MK3 is out! And it's bloody smart! - Prusa Printers|url=https://www.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-i3-mk3-bloody-smart/|website=Prusa Printers|accessdate=24 October 2017|ref=mk3-announce|date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketed as "bloody smart". Upgraded features included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Original Prusa i3 MK3: Review the Facts Here! {{!}} All3DP|url=https://all3dp.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3-review/|website=All3DP|accessdate=24 October 2017|ref=mk3-review|date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sturdier Y axis, a new [[3D printer extruder|extruder]] with double sided Bondtech drive-gears, quieter fans with rpm monitoring, an updated bed [[leveling]] sensor, a new electronics board named "Einsy", quieter [[Stepper motor|stepper motors]] with 128 step [[Stepper motor#Microstepping|microstepping]] drivers and a magnetic heatbed with interchangeable [[Polyetherimide|PEI]]-coated steel sheets. This model also includes new sensors: several temperature sensors, a filament detector, and a sensor that detects power interruptions. The MK3 runs on 24[[Volt|V]] instead of 12V, so all the electrical components were updated to 24V variants. The printer also offers dedicated sockets to connect [[Raspberry Pi Zero|Raspberry Pi Zero W]] running [[open source]] [[Octoprint]] software for wireless printing, and offers a custom Octoprint build for Prusa i3.

The idea of the MK3 update was to make the printer easier to use for casual users and less likely to lead to failed prints. The filament detector allows users to load filament just by inserting it, and it can detect and pause the print if the filament is jammed or runs out. In both cases, printing resumes normally after the issue is fixed. The new stepper motor drivers can handle skipped steps automatically and prevent layer shifts. The power panic sensor allows the printer to recover from [[power outage]]s, and uses the remaining charge in the [[power supply]]'s [[capacitor]]s to lift the print head up to prevent it from melting the printed part while the power is out. The ambient temperature sensor is able to detect mainboard overheating caused by loose electrical connections.

The upgraded chassis and electronics also allow for faster print speeds — up to 200&amp;nbsp;mm/s.

Existing MK2 and MK2S users were offered a $200 partial upgrade named MK2.5, limited to features which are cheaper to upgrade. After negative feedback from the community, Prusa made available a more expensive $500 MK2S to MK3 full upgrade.

===Clones===
As an open-source design the success of the Prusa i3 is underlined by the ready availability of both complete and kit-built machines that follow the various iterations of the i3 design. Rather than compete directly with these versions, Prusa Research's strategy is to pursue continual refinement of its designs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prusaprinters.org/whats-up-with-original-prusa-i3/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition===
In 2012 Josef received honours from the governor of the [[Vysočina Region]] in the [[Czech Republic]] for his accomplishments in technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jihlavske-listy.cz/clanek11706-nejvyssi-oceneni-kraje-ziskali-doktorka-nemeckova-a-vytvarnik-ranny.html|title=Jihlavské listy {{!}} Aktuality {{!}} Noviny Kraje Vysočina|website=www.jihlavske-listy.cz|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014 he was featured on the cover of [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]] as one of the 30 under 30 list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/forbescesko/photos/pb.236488496391722.-2207520000.1465767584./707318989308668/?type=3&amp;theater|title=Forbes Česko|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capabilities==
[[File:Josef Prusa in Prusa Research offices inside MK2 printfarm.jpg|thumb|right|Josef Průša inside the Prusa i3 MK2 printfarm producing 3D printed parts at Prusa Research in Prague, Czech Republic.]]

===Self replication===
Like other RepRap printers the Prusa i3 is capable of creating many of its own parts, which were usually printed in ABS plastic prior to the Mk3, which uses PETG instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-i3-mk3-2-months/|title=Original Prusa i3 Mk3 after 2 months|website=prusaprinters.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard Prusa i3 has 26 printed parts.

===Printable materials===
Depending on the hot end and heated bed installed, the Prusa i3 is capable of printing many materials including [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)]], [[Polylactic acid|polylactic acid (PLA)]], high impact [[polystyrene]] (HIPS), [[polyetilene]] (PET), different flexible filaments (FLEX, TPU, TPE), [[polypropylene]] (PP) and [[nylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prusa3d.com/material-guides/|title=Material guides – Prusa3D – 3D Printers from Josef Průša|website=Prusa3D – 3D Printers from Josef Průša|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different materials require different working temperatures and techniques to make them [[Adhesion|adhere]] to the print bed.

==Components==
The Prusa i3, like many RepRap printers, is made from a combination of self-replicated 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf components which are commonly referred to as "vitamins", as they cannot be produced by the printer itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://3dprintingindustry.com/news/distributing-3dp-parts-and-vitamins-with-passion-15476/|title=Distributing 3DP Parts — and Vitamins — With Passion|website=3D Printing Industry|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vitamins used on the Prusa i3 are a combination of common components including threaded rods, smooth rods, screws, nuts, 5 NEMA 17 [[stepper motor]]s and more specialist equipment including a controller board, heated bed and hot end.

In [[sociology]], '''rationalization''' (or '''rationalisation''') is the replacement of traditions, values, and emotions as motivators for behavior in society with concepts based on [[rationality]] and [[reason]]. For example, the implementation of bureaucracies in government is a kind of rationalization, as is the construction of high-efficiency living spaces in architecture and urban planning. A potential reason as to why rationalization of a culture may take place in the modern era is the process of [[globalization]]. Countries are becoming increasingly interlinked, and with the rise of technology, it is easier for countries to influence each other through [[social networking]], the [[News media|media]] and [[politics]]. An example of rationalization in place would be the case of witch doctors in certain parts of Africa. Whilst many locals view them as an important part of their culture and traditions, development initiatives and aid workers have tried to rationalize the practice in order to educate the local people in modern medicine and practice (Giddens, 2013).

Many sociologists, [[critical theorists]] and contemporary [[philosophers]] have argued that rationalization, falsely assumed as progress, has had a negative and [[dehumanization|dehumanizing]] effect on society, moving [[modernity]] away from the central tenets of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jürgen 1985 p2"&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity'', Polity Press (1985), {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, p2&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of sociology had critical reaction to rationalization:

{{Quotation|Marx and Engels associated the emergence of modern society above all with the development of capitalism; for Durkheim it was connected in particular with [[industrialization]] and the new social division of labour which this brought about; for Weber it had to do with the emergence of a distinctive way of thinking, the rational calculation which he associated with the Protestant Ethic (more or less what Marx and Engels speak of in terms of those 'icy waves of egotistical calculation').|John Harriss ''The Second Great Transformation? Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' 1992|&lt;ref&gt;Harriss, John. ''The Second Great Transformation? Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' in Allen, T. and Thomas, Alan (eds) ''Poverty and Development in the 21st Century'', Oxford University Press, Oxford. p325.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Capitalism==
Rationalization formed a central concept in the foundation of classical sociology, particularly with respect to the emphasis the discipline placed – by contrast with [[anthropology]] – on the nature of modern Western societies. The term was presented by the profoundly influential German [[antipositivist]] [[Max Weber]], though its themes bear parallel with the critiques of modernity set forth by a number of scholars. A rejection of [[dialectism]] and [[sociocultural evolution]] informs the concept.

Weber demonstrated rationalization in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', in which the aims of certain [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Theologies, particularly [[Calvinism]], are shown to have shifted towards rational means of economic gain as a way of dealing with their 'salvation anxiety'. The rational consequences of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with its religious roots, and so the latter were eventually discarded. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on [[bureaucracy]] and on the classifications of [[authority]]. In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber believed that a move towards [[rational-legal authority]] was inevitable. In [[charismatic authority]], the death of a leader effectively ends the power of that authority, and only through a rationalized and bureaucratic base can this authority be passed on. [[Traditional authority|Traditional authorities]] in rationalized societies also tend to develop a rational-legal base to better ensure a stable accession. (See also: [[Tripartite classification of authority]])

{{Quotation|What Weber depicted was not only the [[secularization]] of Western ''culture'', but also and especially the development of modern ''societies'' from the viewpoint of rationalization. The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organizational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus. Weber understood this process as the institutionalization of purposive-rational economic and administrative action. To the degree that everyday life was affected by this cultural and societal rationalization, traditional forms of life - which in the early modern period were differentiated primarily according to one's trade - were dissolved.|[[Jürgen Habermas]]'s ''Modernity's Consciousness of Time''|&lt;ref name="Habermas, Jürgen 1985 p2"/&gt;}}

Whereas in [[Traditional society|traditional societies]] such as [[feudalism]] governing is managed under the [[traditional authority|traditional leadership]] of, for example, a [[queen regnant|queen]] or [[tribal chief]], modern societies operate under [[rational-legal authority|rational-legal systems]]. For example, [[democracy|democratic systems]] attempt to remedy qualitative concerns (such as [[racism|racial discrimination]]) with rationalized, quantitative means (for example, [[civil rights]] [[Statutory law|legislation]]). Weber described the eventual effects of rationalization in his ''[[Economy and Society]]'' as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in an "[[iron cage]]" (or "steel-hard casing") of rule-based, [[rationality|rational]] control.

[[Jürgen Habermas]] has argued that understanding rationalization properly requires going beyond Weber's notion of rationalization. It requires distinguishing between ''instrumental rationality'', which involves calculation and efficiency (in other words, reducing all relationships to those of means and ends), and ''communicative rationality'', which involves expanding the scope of mutual understanding in communication, the ability to expand this understanding  through reflective discourse about communication, and making social and political life subject to this expanded understanding.

{{Quotation|It is clear that in ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]]'' Weber is playing something like the role that Hegel played for Marx. Weber, for Habermas, must be not so much stood on his head (or put back the right way up) as persuaded to stand on two legs rather than one, to support his theory of modernity with more systematic and structural analyses than those of the (purposive-rational) rationalization of action ... Weber 'parts company with a theory of communicative action' when he defines action in terms of the actor attaching a subjective meaning to it. He does not elucidate "meaning" in connection with the model of speech; he does not relate it to the linguistic medium of possible understanding, but to the beliefs and intentions of an acting subject, taken to being with in isolation. This leads him to his familiar distinction between value-rational, purposive-rational, traditional and affectual action. What Weber should have done instead was to concentrate not on orientations of action but on the general structures of the lifeworld to which acting subjects belong. |[[William Outhwaite]] ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'' 1988|&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Holocaust, modernity and ambivalence===
[[File:Rail leading to Auschwitz II (Birkenau).jpg|thumb|The railway line leading to the death camp at Auschwitz II (Birkenau).]]
For [[Zygmunt Bauman]], rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be closely associated with the events of the [[Holocaust]]. In ''Modernity and Ambivalence'', Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar.

Yet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled and ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is constantly threatening. Bauman's most famous book, ''Modernity and the Holocaust'', is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of these kinds of fears. Drawing upon [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]'s books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman argues that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he says, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorization of different species, and the tendency to view rule-following as morally good all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass.

For this reason, Bauman argues that modern societies have not fully taken on board the lessons of the Holocaust; it is generally viewed – to use Bauman's metaphor – like a picture hanging on a wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis, the Jews became 'strangers' ''par excellence'' in Europe;&lt;ref&gt;''Modernity and the Holocaust'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Final Solution]] was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempts made by societies to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements existing within them. Bauman, like the philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]], contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.

===Adorno and Horkheimer's definition of "enlightenment"===
In their analysis of contemporary western society, ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1944, revised 1947), [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] developed a wide and pessimistic concept of enlightenment. In their analysis, enlightenment had its dark side: while trying to abolish superstition and myths by 'foundationalist' philosophy, it ignored its own 'mythical' basis. Its strivings towards totality and certainty led to an increasing instrumentalization of [[reason]]. In their view, the enlightenment itself should be enlightened and not posed as a 'myth-free' view of the world. For [[Marxist]] philosophy in general, rationalization is closely associated with the concept of "[[commodity fetishism]]", for the reason that not only are products designed to fulfill certain tasks, but employees are hired to fulfill specific tasks as well.

==Consumption==
[[File:Harlem Micky Dz.jpg|thumb|The sign at a [[McDonald's]] '[[drive-thru]]'. The "over 99 billion served" statement illustrates Ritzer's idea of calculability.]]
Modern food consumption typifies the process of rationalization. Where food preparation in traditional societies is more laborious and technically inefficient, modern society has strived towards speed and precision in its delivery. [[Fast-food restaurant]]s, designed to maximise profit, have strived toward total efficiency since their conception, and continue to do so. A strict level of efficiency has been accomplished in several ways, including stricter control of its workers' actions, the replacement of more complicated systems with simpler, less time-consuming ones, simple numbered systems of value meals and the addition of [[drive-through]] windows.

Rationalization is also observable in the replacement of more traditional stores, which may offer subjective advantages to consumers, such as what sociologists consider a less regulated, more natural environment, with modern stores offering the objective advantage of lower prices to consumers. The case of [[Wal-Mart]] is one strong example demonstrating this transition. While Wal-Marts have attracted [[Criticism of Wal-Mart|considerable criticism]] for effectively displacing more traditional stores, these subjective social-value concerns have held minimal effectiveness in limiting expansion of the enterprise, particularly in more rationalized nations,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} due to the preferences of the public for lower prices over the advantages sociologists claim for more traditional stores.&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, David. (November 8, 1996). "[http://www.cato.org/dailys/11-08-96.html Chrysler, Microsoft, and Industrial Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203063630/http://www.cato.org/dailys/11-08-96.html |date=2006-02-03 }}." ''[[Cato Institute]].'' Retrieved on August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociologist [[George Ritzer]] has used the term [[McDonaldization]] to refer, not just to the actions of the fast food restaurant, but to the general process of rationalization. Ritzer distinguishes four primary components of McDonaldization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  | last = Ritzer
  | first = George
  | title = The McDonaldization of Society
  | publisher = Pine Forge Press
  | year = 2008
  | location = Los Angeles
  | isbn = 0-7619-8812-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Efficiency – the optimal method for accomplishing a task; the fastest method to get from point A to point B. Efficiency in McDonaldization means that every aspect of the organization is geared toward the minimization of time.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[Calculability]] – goals are quantifiable (i.e., sales, money) rather than subjective (i.e., taste, labour). McDonaldization developed the notion that quantity equals quality, and that a large amount of product delivered to the customer in a short amount of time is the same as a high quality product. "They run their organization in such a way that a person can walk into any McDonald's and receive the same sandwiches prepared in precisely the same way. This results in a highly rational system that specifies every action and leaves nothing to chance".&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[Predictability]] – [[standardization|standardized]] and uniform services.  "Predictability" means that no matter where a person goes, they will receive the same service and receive the same product at every interaction with the corporation. This also applies to the workers in those organizations; their tasks are highly repetitive and predictable routines.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;
* [[Social control|Control]] – standardized and uniform employees, replacement of human by non-human technologies.&lt;ref name="Macionis, J. 2010"/&gt;

==Commercialization==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
As [[capitalism]] itself is a rationalized economic policy, so is the process of [[commercialization]] it utilizes in order to increase sales. Most holidays, for instance, were created out of a religious context or in celebration of some past event. However, in rationalized societies these traditional values are increasingly diminished and the aim shifts from the qualitative aim of a meaningful celebration to the more quantitative aim of increasing sales.

In the [[United States]], for example, most major holidays now are represented by rationalized, [[secularism|secularized]] figures which serve as a corporate [[totem]]. In more traditional environments, [[gift]]s are more often hand-crafted works which hold some symbolic meaning. This qualitative value of gifts diminishes in rationalized societies, where individuals often offer hints or speak directly about what present they are interested in receiving. In these societies, the value of a gift is more likely to be weighed by objective measures (i.e. monetary value) than subjective (i.e. symbolism).

==Further objects of rationalization==

===Human body===
One rational tendency is towards increasing the efficiency and output of the human body. Several means can be employed in reaching this end, including trends towards regular [[exercise]], [[dieting]], increased [[hygiene]], [[medication|drugs]], and an emphasis on optimal [[nutrition]]. As well as increasing [[Longevity#Longevity and lifestyle|lifespans]], these allow for stronger, leaner, more optimized bodies for quickly performing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''The History of Sexuality'' (subtitle: ''The Care of the Self, vol. 3''), which identifies this rationalization as emerging from capitalist ideologies  vis &amp;agrave; vis control of workers (i.e., in this case, specifically, their bodies) for the rigors of commerce and the marketplace.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another aspect of this is maintaining a certain level of [[Physical attractiveness|physical attraction]]. Processes such as the [[comb]]ing of hair, use of a fragrance, having an appropriate [[haircut]], and wearing certain [[Clothing|clothes]] receive [[calculation|calculated]] use, that of giving off a certain impression to other individuals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In these cases, we see how rationalization does produce meaning and is not just simply a way to speed things up, i.e., a fat person is said to have poor self-control and discipline and thus you can now make personal judgments about them.

Another trend is in the [[bureaucratization]] of processes that formerly might have been done through the home. This includes the use of [[hospital]]s for childbirth and the use of [[Physician|doctor]]s to identify symptoms of an illness and to prescribe treatment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Education===
Rationalized education tends to focus less on subjects based around the use of critical discourse (for instance, [[religion]]) and more on matters of a calculated importance (such as [[business administration]]). This is reflected also in the move towards [[standardized testing|standardized]] and [[multiple choice]] testing, which measures students on the basis of numbered answers and against a uniform standard.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3948">The '''right to development''' was first recognized in 1981 in Article 22 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] as a definitive individual and collective right.  Article 22(1) provides that: "All peoples shall have the right to their economic, social and cultural development with due regard to their freedom and identity and in the equal enjoyment of the common heritage of mankind."

The right to development was subsequently proclaimed by the [[United Nations]] in 1986 in the "Declaration on the Right to Development," which was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution 41/128.  The Right to development is a [[group right]] of peoples as opposed to an [[individual right]], and was reaffirmed by the 1993 [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]].  

The right to development is now included in the mandate of several UN institutions and offices.

The Preamble of the Declaration on the Right to Development states "development is a comprehensive economic, social, cultural and political process, which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom."

==The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action==
The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] states in Article 10 "The [[World Conference on Human Rights]] reaffirms the "right to development", as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development, as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights.
As stated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, the human person is the central subject of development. While development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights, the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights. States should cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development. The international community should promote an effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development. Lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level, as well as equitable economic relations and a favorable economic environment at the international level."

==The Rio Declaration==
The [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], also known as Rio Declaration or the G.R.E.G, recognizes the right to development as one of its 27 principles. Principle 3 of the Declaration states "The right to development" must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations."

==Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples==
The [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] recognizes the right to development as an indigenous peoples' right. The declaration states in its preamble that the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] is "Concerned that indigenous peoples have suffered from historic injustices as a result of, inter alia, their colonization and dispossession of their lands, territories and resources, thus preventing them from exercising, in particular, their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests."

Article 23 elaborates "Indigenous peoples have the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their "right to development". In particular, indigenous peoples have the right to be actively involved in developing and determining health, housing and other economic and social programmes affecting them and, as far as possible, to administer such programmes through their own institutions."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31820">'''Spiritual evolution''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology|theological]], [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] idea that nature and human beings and/or [[human culture]] evolve: either extending from an established [[esoteric cosmology|cosmological]] [[pattern]] (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials. The phrase "spiritual evolution" can occur in the context of "'''higher evolution'''", a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the "lower" or [[biological evolution]] of physical form.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of spiritual evolution is also complemented by the idea of a [[creative impulse]] in human beings, known as [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;

Within this broad definition, theories of spiritual evolution are very diverse. They may be cosmological (describing existence at large), personal (describing development of an individual), or both. They can be [[Holism|holistic]] (holding that higher realities emerge from and are not reducible to the lower), [[Idealism|idealist]] (holding that reality is primarily mental or spiritual) or [[nondual]] (holding that there is no ultimate distinction between mental and physical reality). One can regard all of them as [[teleology|teleological]] to a greater or lesser degree.

Philosophers, scientists, and educators who have proposed theories of spiritual evolution include [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] (1775-1854), [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel | Hegel]] (1770-1831), [[Carl Jung]] (1875-1961), [[Max Théon]] (1848-1927), [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] (1831-1891), [[Henri Bergson]] (1859-1941), [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861-1925), [[Sri Aurobindo]] (1872-1950), [[Jean Gebser]] (1905-1973), [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881-1955), [[Owen Barfield]] (1898-1997), [[Arthur M. Young]] (1905-1995), [[Edward Haskell]] (1906-1986), [[E. F. Schumacher]] (1911-1977), [[Erich Jantsch]] (1929-1980), [[Clare W. Graves]] (1914-1986), [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (1861-1947), [[Terence McKenna]] (1946-2000), and [[P. R. Sarkar]] (1921-1990). {{As of | 2015}} [[William Irwin Thompson]] (born 1938), [[Victor Skumin]] (born 1948), [[Ken Wilber]] (born 1949), and [[Brian Swimme]] (born 1950) work in this field.

==Precursors to the idea==

===The cyclic cosmos===
[[Mircea Eliade]] has suggested that in many pre-modern cultures one finds the concept of the Fall and a "nostalgia for paradise". However, for those cultures that have a [[Cyclic pattern|cyclic]] cosmology, the concept of a progressive deterioration of the universe (as in the [[Hesiod]]ic, [[Hinduism|Hindu]], and [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Lurianic]] cosmologies of a degradation from a [[Golden Age]] to an Iron Age or [[Kali Yuga]]) might be balanced by a corresponding ascent to more spiritual stages and a return to paradisical conditions. This is what one finds in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and especially [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmologies.

===Emanation===
Many premodern cosmologies and [[esoteric]] systems of thought are based on an [[emanation]]ist view of reality. If the Cyclic view is temporal, then emanation is a non-temporal precursor to the theory of spiritual evolution.

According to this paradigm, Creation proceeds as an outpouring or even a transformation in the original [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] or [[Deity|Godhead]]. The Supreme Light or Consciousness descends through a series of stages, gradations, worlds or [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostases]], becoming progressively more material and embodied, before finally turning around to return to the One, retracing its steps through spiritual knowledge, contemplation and ascent.

A supreme example of this form of thinking is the [[Neoplatonism]] of [[Plotinus]] and his successors. Other examples and interpretations might be found in the Hindu sect of [[Kashmir Shaivism]] and [[Tantra]] in general, [[Gnosticism]], [[Sufism]], and [[Kabbalah]]. The [[Hindu]] idea of the [[Chakra]]s might also considered here as the "microcosmic" counterpart of macrocosmic involution and evolution. The Yogi raises the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] or life force through and thus transcends each chakra in turn, until he reaches the [[Sahasrara|crown chakra]] and liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Avalon, ''The Serpent Power''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samkhya===
An early example of the doctrine of spiritual evolution is found in [[Samkhya]], one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy, that goes back more than two and a half thousand years (although its present form dates to around the 4th or 5th century c.e.). Unlike most types of classic Hinduism, the traditional Samkhyan philosophy is [[Atheism|atheistic]] and [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]]. Pure spirit (called ''purusha'') comes into proximity with ''prakriti'' (psychophysical nature), disturbing its equilibrium. As a result, the original root-prakriti (''mulaprakriti'') undergoes a series of progressive transformations or unfoldings, in the form of successive essences called ''[[tattva]]s''. The most subtle tattwas emerge first, then progressively grosser ones, each in a particular order, and finally the elements and the organs of sense. The goal of evolution however is, paradoxically, the release of purusha and the return to the unmanifest condition. Hence everything is tending towards a goal of spiritual quiescence.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard J. Larson, (1979) ''Classical Samkhya'' (Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 2nd. Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The great chain of being===
The concept of the [[great chain of being]] developed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] whose ideas were taken up and synthesised by Plotinus. Plotinus in turn heavily influenced [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s theology, and from there [[Aquinas]] and the Scholastics. The Great Chain of Being was an important theme in [[Renaissance]] and [[Elizabethan]] thought, had an under-acknowledged influence on the shaping of the ideas of [[the Enlightenment]] and played a large part in the worldview of 18th century Europe. And while essentially a static worldview, by the 18th and early 19th century it had been "temporalized" by the concept of the [[soul]] ascending or progressing spiritually through the successive rungs or stages, and thus growing or evolving closer to [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur O. Lovejoy (1936), ''The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1936, 1961, 1970). {{ISBN|0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had at this time an impact on theories of biological evolution.

[[E. F. Schumacher]], author of ''Small is Beautiful'', has recently proposed a sort of simplified Great Chain of Being, based on the idea of four "[[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]" (mineral, vegetable, animal, human).&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Schumacher (1977), ''A Guide for the Perplexed'', (New York:Harper &amp; Row) {{ISBN|0-06-090611-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher rejects modernist and scientific themes, his approach recalling the universalist orientation of writers like [[Huston Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Huston Smith (1976), ''Forgotten Truth: The Common Vision of the World's Religions'', (New York: Harper &amp; Row), {{ISBN|0-06-250787-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likely contributing to Ken Wilber's "holonomic" hierarchy or "Great Nest of Being".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Wilber (1996) ''A Brief History of Everything'', (Boston &amp; London: Shambhala Publications, 2nd edition, 2000), {{ISBN|1-57062-740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Main article|Buddhism and evolution}}

The concept of spiritual evolution has been taught in [[Buddhism]]. [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] - a [[physician]] and Buddhist - attempted to merge [[biology]] with [[spirituality]]. He accepted the existence of both material and spiritual realms, and many of his ideas were discussed in his book ''Buddhism and Immortality'' (1908). Bigelow used the concept of [[natural selection]] as a mechanism for [[evolution]]. According to the author, spiritual evolution involves an individual emerging from "unconditioned consciousness" and moving "up the scale of evolution guided by natural selection". Then the individual moves to a level of celestial experience, and finally is able to "return to the unconditioned consciousness from which all things emerge". Bigelow accepted both material and spiritual evolution and he also believed that Buddhism and [[science]] were compatible.&lt;ref&gt;American encounter with Buddhism, 1844–1912: Victorian culture &amp; the limits of dissent, Thomas A. Tweed, 2000, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Low]] a [[Zen master]] and author of ''The Origin of Human Nature: A Zen Buddhist Looks at Evolution'' (2008) opposes [[neo-Darwinism]] and the [[selfish gene theory]] as he claims they are [[materialistic]]. He also opposes [[creationism]] for being dogmatic and instead advocates spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Low, The Origin of Human Nature: A Zen Buddhist Looks at Evolution, Sussex Academic Pr, 2008, {{ISBN|1-84519-260-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vajrayana]], spiritual evolution is equivalent with the development of the three bodies of [[Trikaya]].

==Occult concepts==
Theories of spiritual evolution are important in many [[Occult]] and [[Esotericism|Esoteric]] teachings, which emphasise the progression and development of the individual either after death ([[spiritualism]]) or through successive [[reincarnation]]s ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Hermeticism]]).

===Spiritualism===
{{details|Spiritualism}}

Spiritualists reacted with uncertainty to the theories of [[evolution]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking, the concept of evolution fit the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time, however, a belief in the animal origins of man threatened the foundation of the immortality of the [[spirit]], for if man had not been created, it was scarcely plausible that he would be specially endowed with a spirit. This led to spiritualists embracing spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914, 1988, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Anglo-American [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualist]] ideas emphasized the progression of the soul after death to higher states of existence, in contrast to [[Spiritism]] which admits to reincarnation.

Spiritualism taught that after death, spirits progressed to new spheres of existence. According to this idea, evolution occurred in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]] “at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favorable to growth” than encountered on earth.&lt;ref name="Janet Oppenheim 1914, p. 270"&gt;Janet Oppenheim, The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914, 1988, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[biologist]] and spiritualist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823–1913) believed that qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular, the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a [[supernatural]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;Debora Hammond, The Science of Synthesis: Exploring the Social Implications of General Systems Theory, 2003, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of spiritualism and believed in an [[wikt:immaterial|immaterial]] origin for the higher mental faculties of humans. He believed that evolution suggested the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes. In a 1909 magazine article entitled ''The World of Life'', which he later expanded into a book of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=World of Life|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S669.htm|publisher=The Alfred Russel Wallace Page hosted by [[Western Kentucky University]]|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace argued in his 1911 book ''World of life'' for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as “creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose”. Wallace believed [[natural selection]] could not explain [[intelligence]] or [[morality]] in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of man could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate “in the unseen universe of spirit”.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fichman, An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace, 2004, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Clodd, Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Broom]] in his book ''The Coming of Man: Was it Accident or Design?'' (1933) claimed that "spiritual agencies" had guided [[evolution]] as [[animals]] and [[plants]] were too complex to have arisen by chance. According to Broom there were at least two different kinds of spiritual forces, and [[psychics]] are capable of seeing them.&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in the early-twentieth-century Britain, Peter J. Bowler, 2001, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; Broom claimed there was a plan and purpose in evolution and that the origin of [[Homo sapiens]] is the ultimate purpose behind evolution. According to Broom "Much of evolution looks as if it had been planned to result in man, and in other animals and plants to make the world a suitable place for him to dwell in.&lt;ref&gt;Bones of contention: controversies in the search for human origins, Roger Lewin, 1997, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglo-American position recalls (and is presumably inspired by) 18th century concepts regarding the temporalization of The Great Chain of Being. Spiritual evolution, rather than being a physical (or physico-spiritual) process is based on the idea of realms or stages through which the soul or spirit passes in a non-temporal, qualitative way. This is still an important part of some spiritualist ideas today, and is similar to some mainline (as opposed to [[fundamentalist]]) [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] beliefs, according to which after death the person goes to "summerland" (see [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit world]])

===Theosophical conceptions===
{{See also|Theosophy and science#Theosophical evolutionism}}
[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] presents a more sophisticated and complex cosmology than Spiritualism, although coming out of the same general milieu. [[H. P. Blavatsky]] developed a highly original cosmology, according to which the human race (both collectively and through the succession of individual reincarnation and spiritual evolution) passes through a number of [[Root Race]]s, beginning with the huge ethereal and mindless Polarian or First Root Race, through the Lemurian (3rd), Atlantean (4th) and our present "Aryan" 5th Race. This will give rise to a future, Post-Aryan 6th Root Race of highly spiritual and enlightened beings that will arise in [[Baja California]] in the 28th century, and an even more sublime 7th Root Race, before ascending to totally superhuman and cosmic states of existence.

Blavatsky's ideas were further developed by her successors, such as [[C.W. Leadbeater]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Alice Bailey]], [[Benjamin Creme]], and [[Victor Skumin]] each of whom went into huge detail in constructing baroque cycles of rounds, races, and sub-races. Skumin elaborated on the theosophical conceptions of spiritual evolution, he proposed a [[definition]] and classification of '''''Homo spiritalis''''' ([[Latin]]: "spiritual man"), [[Root race#the sixth root race|the sixth root race]], consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): HS0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS1 Scientella spiritalis, HS2 Aurora spiritalis, HS3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS5 Illuminatio spiritalis, НS6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS7 Servitus spiritalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first=V. A. |script-title=ru: Человек духовный: роль культуры духовного здоровья в утверждении новой человеческой расы на планете |trans-title=Spiritual man: The role of the Culture of spiritual health for approval of the new human race on the planet |year=1996 |publisher=theeuropeanlibrary.org |url= http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/3000010564370?query=%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80+%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD+ |language=Russian |isbn=5-88167-012-4 |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although including elements of the science of her day as well as both eastern and western esoteric thought, Blavatsky rejected the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] idea that man evolved from apes, and most subsequent esotericists followed this lead. Darwinism, with its explanation of evolution through material factors like [[natural selection]] and random mutation, does not sit well with many spiritual evolutionists, for whom evolution is initiated or guided by metaphysical principles or is tending towards a [[Teleology|final spiritual or divine state]].  It is believed by Theosophists that humans are evolving ''spiritually'' through a series of esoteric [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiations]] and in the future humans will become esoteric [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|masters]] themselves as their [[soul]]s gradually rise upward through the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|spiritual hierarchy]] over the course of eons as they reincarnate.

Despite this, recent Theosophists and [[Anthroposophy|Anthroposophists]] have tried to incorporate the facts of geology and paleontology into their cosmology and spiritual evolution (in Anthroposophy [[Hermann Poppelbaum]] is a particularly creative thinker in this regard). Some have attempted to equate [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] with [[Gondwana]]land, for example. Today all these ideas have little influence outside their specialised followings, but for a time Theosophical concepts were immensely influential.  Theosophy-like teachings also continue today in a group of religions based on Theosophy called the [[Ascended Master Teachings]].

===Theurgy===
[[Theurgy]] has a clear relationship to [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Kabbalah]] and contains the concept of spiritual evolution{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and ultimately unification with [[God]] or the [[Deity|Godhead]] at its core. Theurgy is considered by many to be another term for high magic and is known to have influenced the members of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] many of whom considered the order to be Theurgic in nature. [[Aleister Crowley]] also considered his [[Thelemic]] system of magical philosophy to be a Theurgic tradition as it emphasized the [[Great Work]], which is essentially another form of spiritual evolution. The Great Work is believed to result in communication with one's personal [[angel]] or [[higher self]].

==Epigenesis==
Epigenesis is the [[philosophical]]/[[theology|theological]]/[[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] idea that since the [[mind]] was given to the human being, it is the original creative impulse, epigenesis, which has been the cause of all of [[Human|mankind]]'s development.

According to spiritual evolution, humans build upon that which has already been created, but add new elements because of the activity of the spirit.  Humans have the capacity, therefore, to become creative intelligences&amp;mdash;[[Creativity|creators]]. For a human to fulfill this promise, his training should allow for the exercise of originality, which distinguishes creation from [[imitation]]. When epigenesis becomes inactive, in the individual or even in a race, evolution ceases and [[degeneration]] commences.

This concept is based on the [[Rosicrucian]] view of the world as a training school, which posits that while mistakes are made in life, humans often learn more from mistakes than successes.  Suffering is considered as merely the result of error, and the impact of suffering on the [[consciousness]] causes humans to be active along other lines which are found to be [[Goodness and value theory|good]], in [[harmony]] with [[nature]]. Humans are seen as spirits attending the school of life for the purpose of unfolding latent spiritual power, developing themselves from ''impotence'' to [[omnipotence]] (related also to development from [[innocence]] into [[virtue]]), reaching the stage of creative gods at the end of mankind's present evolution: ''Great Day of Manifestation''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel]], ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]]: Involution, Evolution and Epigenesis'', November 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}} [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng14.htm#par67 www]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution towards Godhead==

===A common vision===
[[Sri Aurobindo]] and [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] both describe a progression from inanimate matter to a future state of Divine consciousness. Teilhard de Chardin refers to this as the [[Omega Point]], and Sri Aurobindo as the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supermind]].&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977) ''The Life Divine'', (Sri Aurobindo Ashram Trust), {{ISBN|0-941524-62-0}} (hardcover), {{ISBN|0-941524-61-2}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1955), ''The Phenomenon of Man'', (New York:Harper &amp; Row), {{ISBN|0-06-090495-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teilhard de Chardin===
Teilhard, who was a [[Jesuit]] [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] who played an important role in the discovery of [[Peking Man]], presented a teleological view of planetary and cosmic evolution, according to which the formation of atoms, molecules and inanimate matter is followed by the development of the [[biosphere]] and organic evolution, then the appearance of man and the [[noosphere]] as the total envelope of human thought. According to Teilhard evolution does not cease here but continues on to its culmination and unification in the Omega Point, which he identifies with [[Christ]].

===Meher Baba's "involution"===
[[Meher Baba]] has used the term [[God Speaks#Involution|involution]] to describe the inner journey of consciousness after transcending the physical or gross state up to the attainment of Self-consciousness, or merging with God. According to Meher Baba, the consciousness of the soul in duality first goes through the long process of evolution of form, then, upon reaching the human form, consciousness enters the process of ''reincarnation'', and finally reaches the process of ''involution'', which culminates in ''[[God-realization (Meher Baba)|God-realization]]''.

==Surat Shabda Yoga==
[[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] [[esoteric cosmology]] depicts the whole of creation (the [[macrocosm]]) as being [[Emanationism|emanated]] and arranged in a spiritually differentiated hierarchy, often referred to as eggs, regions, or [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]]. Typically, eight spiritual levels are described above the physical plane, although names and subdivisions within these levels will vary to some extent by mission and Master. (One version of the creation from a Surat Shabda Yoga perspective is depicted at the Sant Ajaib Singh Ji Memorial Site in [http://www.santji.allegre.ca/planes-640.jpg “The Grand Scheme of All Creation”].)

The constitution of the individual (the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]) is an exact replica of the macrocosm. Consequently, the microcosm consists of a number of [[Subtle body|bodies]], each one suited to interact with its corresponding plane or region in the macrocosm. These bodies developed over the [[yuga]]s through [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]] ([[Emanationism|emanating]] from higher planes to lower planes) and evolution (returning from lower planes to higher planes), including by [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] in various [[altered state of consciousness|states]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Holtje (1995) ''[http://www.masterpath.org/masterpath_books/index.htm From Light to Sound: The Spiritual Progression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105042502/http://www.masterpath.org/masterpath_books/index.htm |date=2005-11-05 }}''. Temecula, CA: MasterPath, Inc. {{ISBN|1-885949-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamic evolution through successive kingdoms==
[[Arthur M. Young]] and [[Edward Haskell]] have each independently incorporated the findings of science into a larger theory of spiritual evolution, and extended the traditional human, animal, vegetable, and mineral categories with kingdoms representing [[photon]]s, [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name=young76&gt;Arthur M. Young (1976), ''The Reflexive Universe&amp;nbsp;– Evolution of Consciousness'' (Delacorte Press), {{ISBN|0-440-05924-0}}; Anodos Foundation 1999 revised edition, {{ISBN|1-892160-11-0}} (paperback), {{ISBN|1-892160-10-2}} (hardcover) see diagram pp.86-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Haskell (1972) ''[http://www.synearth.net/Haskell/FC/ Full Circle; the Moral Force of Unified Science]'', ed. by Edward Haskell (Gordon and Breach, New York, London &amp; Paris)&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur M. Young goes further in considering the human state as a subset of a larger kingdom of "Dominion", of which the sixth stage is represented for example by Christ and Buddha, and the seventh (final) stage an even higher level of Enlightenment or God-realisation.&lt;ref name=young76/&gt; Moreover, both Haskell and Young present profound accounts of evolution through these kingdoms in terms of [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] principles. A more "mainstream" scientific presentation of this same idea is provided by [[Erich Jantsch]] in his account of how self-organising systems evolve and develop as a series of "[[symmetry breaking|symmetry break]]s" through the sequence of matter, life, and mind.&lt;ref name="jantsch"&gt;Erich Jantsch (1980), The Self Organizing Universe&amp;nbsp;– Scientific and Human Implication of the Emerging Paradigm of Evolution (New York: Pergamon), {{ISBN|0-08-024312-6}}, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; Although abiding strictly by the understanding of science, Jantsch arranges the various elements of cosmic, planetary, biological, psychological, and human evolution in a single overall framework of [[emergent evolution]] that may or may not be considered teleological.&lt;ref name=jantsch/&gt;

==New Age ideas==
[[New Age]] thought is strongly syncretic. A common theme is the evolution or the transcendence of the human or collective planetary consciousness in a higher state or higher "vibratory" (a metaphor taken from [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]) level.

David Spangler's communications speak of a "New Heaven and a new Earth", while [[Christopher Hills]] refers (perhaps influenced by Sri Aurobindo) to
the divinization of man.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hills (1977) ''Nuclear Evolution&amp;nbsp;– Discovery of the Rainbow Body'' (university of Trees Press, Boulder Creek, CA) 2nd ed. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]'' narrated the idea of evolution in a fascinating fashion. [[James Redfield]] in his novel ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]'' suggested that through experiencing a series of personal spiritual insights, humanity is becoming aware of the connection between our evolution and the Divine. More recently in his book ''God and the Evolving Universe: The Next Step in Personal Evolution'' (2002) co-written with [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]], he claims that humanity is on the verge of undergoing a change in [[higher consciousness|consciousness]].

==Integral theory and spiral dynamics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
An interpretation of social and psychological development that could also be considered a theory of spiritual evolution is [[spiral dynamics]], based on the work of [[Clare W. Graves]].

More recently the concept of spiritual evolution has been given a sort of respectability it has not had since the early 19th century through the work of the [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theorist]] [[Ken Wilber]], in whose writings both the cosmological and the personal dimensions are described. In this [[Integral movement|integral philosophy]] (inspired in part by the works of Plotinus, Hegel, Sri Aurobindo, Eric Jantsch, and many others) reality is said to consist of several realms or stages, including more than one of the following: the physical, the vital, the psychic, (after the Greek ''psyche'', "soul"), the causal (referring to "that which causes, or gives rise to, the manifest world"), and the ultimate (or non-dual), through which the individual progressively evolves. Although this schema is derived in large part from [[Tibetan Buddhism]], Wilber argues (and uses many tables of diagrams to show) that these same levels of being are common to all wisdom teachings. Described simplistically, Wilber sees humans developing through several stages, including [[Magic and religion|magic]], [[mythology|mythic]], pluralistic, and [[holism|holistic]] mentalities. But he also sees cultures as developing through these stages. And, much like Hegel, he sees this development of individuals and cultures ''as'' the evolution of existence itself. Wilber has also teamed up with [[Don Beck (management consultant)|Don Beck]] to integrate Spiral Dynamics into his own Integral philosophy, and vice versa. Spiral Dynamics posits a series of stages through which human's cultural development progresses&amp;nbsp;– from a survival-based hunter-gatherer stage to a magical-tribal-agrarian stage to a city-building-invading stage to a mythic-religious-empire stage to a rational-scientific-capitalist stage to a green-holistic-inclusive stage and then ascending to a second tier where all the previous stages are contemplated and integrated and a third transpersonal tier where a spiritual unity or Omega point is eventually reached, which all the other stages are struggling to embody. He feels that individuals in each of the meme-plexes/stages can ascend to the peak of consciousness&amp;nbsp;– these being the prophets, visionaries and leaders of any region/age.

In [[control engineering]], a '''state-space representation''' is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s. State variables are variables whose values evolve through time in a way that depends on the values they have at any given time and also depends on the externally imposed values of input variables. Output variables’ values depend on the values of the state variables.

The "[[state space]]" is the [[Euclidean space]] in which the variables on the axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a vector within that space.

To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs and states, these variables are expressed as [[row and column vectors|vectors]]. Additionally, if the [[dynamical system]] is linear, time-invariant, and finite-dimensional, then the differential and [[algebraic equation]]s may be written in [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form.&lt;ref&gt;

The state-space method is characterized by significant algebraization of general [[system theory]], which makes it possible to use Kronecker vector-matrix structures. The capacity of these structures can be efficiently applied to research systems with modulation or without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13866/modelirovanie_dinamicheskih_sistem_s_modulyacieys_ispolzovaniem_kronekerovskih_vektorno-matrichnyhpredstavleniy.htm|title=Modeling of dynamic systems with modulation by means of Kronecker vector-matrix representation.|author1=Vasilyev A.S. |author2=Ushakov A.V. |journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=839–848.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;         
The state-space representation (also known as the "[[time-domain]] approach") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; inputs and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; outputs, we would otherwise have to write down &lt;math&gt;q \times p&lt;/math&gt; [[Laplace transform]]s to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the [[frequency domain]] approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. The state-space model is used in many different areas. In [[econometrics]], the state-space model can be used for forecasting [[stock price]]s&lt;ref&gt;Rita Yi Man Li,Kwong Wing Chau (2016) Econometric Analyses of International Housing Markets, Routledge, https://books.google.com.hk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=xyneCwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Rita+yi+man+li%22&amp;ots=7YTLXxGi5z&amp;sig=1j-NKyZu1yGUbzUv_O84z2bysTc&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rita%20yi%20man%20li%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other variables.

== State variables ==

The internal [[state variable]]s are the smallest possible subset of system variables that can represent the entire state of the system at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nise |first1=Norman S. |year=2010 |title=Control Systems Engineering |edition=6th |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-0-470-54756-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum number of state variables required to represent a given system, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is usually equal to the order of the system's defining differential equation. If the system is represented in transfer function form, the minimum number of state variables is equal to the order of the transfer function's denominator after it has been reduced to a proper fraction. It is important to understand that converting a state-space realization to a transfer function form may lose some internal information about the system, and may provide a description of a system which is stable, when the state-space realization is unstable at certain points. In electric circuits, the number of state variables is often, though not always, the same as the number of energy storage elements in the circuit such as [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s. The state variables defined must be linearly independent, i.e., no state variable can be written as a linear combination of the other state variables or the system will not be able to be solved.

== Linear systems ==

[[Image:Typical State Space model.png|framed|Block diagram representation of the linear state-space equations]]

The most general state-space representation of a linear system with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; inputs, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; outputs and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; state variables is written in the following form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brogan |first1=William L. |year=1974 |title=Modern Control Theory |edition=1st |publisher=Quantum Publishers, Inc. |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + B(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + D(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "state vector",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "output vector",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^q&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "input (or control) vector",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;A(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "state (or system) matrix",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[A(\cdot)] = n \times n&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;B(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "input matrix",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[B(\cdot)] = n \times p&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;C(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "output matrix",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[C(\cdot)] = q \times n&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;D(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "feedthrough (or feedforward) matrix" (in cases where the system model does not have a direct feedthrough, &lt;math&gt;D(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the zero matrix),&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[D(\cdot)] = q \times p&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) := \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t} \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

In this general formulation, all matrices are allowed to be time-variant (i.e. their elements can depend on time); however, in the common [[LTI system|LTI]] case, matrices will be time invariant. The time variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; can be continuous (e.g. &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;) or discrete (e.g. &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;). In the latter case, the time variable &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is usually used instead of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. [[Hybrid system]]s allow for time domains that have both continuous and discrete parts. Depending on the assumptions taken, the state-space model representation can assume the following forms:
{| cellpadding="4"
|- valign="top"
|'''System type''' || '''State-space model'''

|Continuous time-invariant || &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: continuous-time LTI case ===

Stability and natural response characteristics of a continuous-time [[LTI system]] (i.e., linear with matrices that are constant with respect to time) can be studied from the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix '''A'''.  The stability of a time-invariant state-space model can be determined by looking at the system's [[transfer function]] in factored form. It will then look something like this:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = k \frac{ (s - z_{1})(s - z_{2})(s - z_{3})
                              }{ (s - p_{1})(s - p_{2})(s - p_{3})(s - p_{4})
                                }. &lt;/math&gt;

The denominator of the transfer function is equal to the [[characteristic polynomial]] found by taking the [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;sI - A&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\lambda}(s) = |sI - A|. &lt;/math&gt;
The roots of this polynomial (the [[eigenvalue]]s) are the system transfer function's [[complex pole|pole]]s (i.e., the [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] where the transfer function's magnitude is unbounded). These poles can be used to analyze whether the system is [[exponential stability|asymptotically stable]] or [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]. An alternative approach to determining stability, which does not involve calculating eigenvalues, is to analyze the system's [[Lyapunov stability]].

The zeros found in the numerator of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; can similarly be used to determine whether the system is [[minimum phase]].

The system may still be '''input&amp;ndash;output stable''' (see [[BIBO stability|BIBO stable]]) even though it is not internally stable. This may be the case if unstable poles are canceled out by zeros (i.e., if those singularities in the transfer function are [[removable singularity|removable]]).

=== Controllability ===
{{Main| Controllability}}

The state controllability condition implies that it is possible&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; by admissible inputs&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; to steer the states from any initial value to any final value within some finite time window. A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is '''controllable''' [[iff|if and only if]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}\begin{bmatrix}B&amp; AB&amp; A^{2}B&amp; \dots &amp; A^{n-1}B\end{bmatrix} = n, &lt;/math&gt;
where [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] is the number of linearly independent rows in a matrix, and where ''n'' is the number of state variables.

=== Observability ===
{{Main| Observability}}

Observability is a measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and controllability of a system are mathematical duals (i.e., as controllability provides that an input is available that brings any initial state to any desired final state, observability provides that knowing an output trajectory provides enough information to predict the initial state of the system).

A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is '''observable''' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}\begin{bmatrix}C\\ CA\\ \vdots\\ CA^{n-1}\end{bmatrix} = n. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Transfer function ===

The "[[transfer function]]" of a continuous time-invariant linear state-space model can be derived in the following way:

First, taking the [[Laplace transform]] of 
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;  
yields
:&lt;math&gt;s\mathbf{X}(s)-\mathbf{x}(0) = A \mathbf{X}(s) + B \mathbf{U}(s). &lt;/math&gt;
Next, we simplify for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s)&lt;/math&gt;, giving
:&lt;math&gt;(s\mathbf{I} - A)\mathbf{X}(s) =\mathbf{x}(0)+ B\mathbf{U}(s), &lt;/math&gt;
and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s) =(s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}\mathbf{x}(0)+ (s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B\mathbf{U}(s). &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s)&lt;/math&gt; in the output equation

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}(s) = C\mathbf{X}(s) + D\mathbf{U}(s),&lt;/math&gt; giving
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}(s) = C((s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}\mathbf{x}(0)+ (s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B\mathbf{U}(s)) + D\mathbf{U}(s). &lt;/math&gt;

The [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ratio of the output to the input of a system considering its initial conditions to be zero (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(0) =\mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;). However, the ratio of a vector to a vector does not exist, so we consider the following condition satisfied by the transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s)\times\mathbf{U}(s) = \mathbf{Y}(s) &lt;/math&gt;
comparison with the equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}(s) &lt;/math&gt; above gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s) = C(s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B + D. &lt;/math&gt;
Clearly &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; must have &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; dimensionality, and thus has a total of &lt;math&gt;qp&lt;/math&gt; elements.
So for every input there are &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; transfer functions with one for each output.
This is why the state-space representation can easily be the preferred choice for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The [[Rosenbrock system matrix]] provides a bridge between the state-space representation and its [[transfer function]].

=== Canonical realizations ===
{{main|Realization (systems)}}

Any given transfer function which is [[strictly proper]] can easily be transferred into state-space by the following approach (this example is for a 4-dimensional, single-input, single-output system):

Given a transfer function, expand it to reveal all coefficients in both the numerator and denominator. This should result in the following form:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \frac{n_{1}s^{3} + n_{2}s^{2} + n_{3}s + n_{4}}{s^{4} + d_{1}s^{3} + d_{2}s^{2} + d_{3}s + d_{4}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients can now be inserted directly into the state-space model by the following approach:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                                0&amp;      1&amp;      0&amp;      0\\
                                0&amp;      0&amp;      1&amp;      0\\
                                0&amp;      0&amp;      0&amp;      1\\
                               -d_{4}&amp; -d_{3}&amp; -d_{2}&amp; -d_{1}
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ 1\\ \end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} n_{4}&amp; n_{3}&amp; n_{2}&amp; n_{1} \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t). &lt;/math&gt;

This state-space realization is called '''controllable canonical form''' because the resulting model is guaranteed to be controllable (i.e., because the control enters a chain of integrators, it has the ability to move every state).


The transfer function coefficients can also be used to construct another type of canonical form
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                               0&amp;   0&amp;  0&amp;  -d_{4}\\
                               1&amp;   0&amp;  0&amp; -d_{3}\\
                               0&amp;   1&amp;  0&amp; -d_{2}\\
                               0&amp;   0&amp;  1&amp;  -d_{1}
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} n_{4}\\ n_{3}\\ n_{2}\\ n_{1} \end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t). &lt;/math&gt;

This state-space realization is called '''observable canonical form''' because the resulting model is guaranteed to be observable (i.e., because the output exits from a chain of integrators, every state has an effect on the output).

=== Proper transfer functions ===

Transfer functions which are only [[proper transfer function|proper]] (and not [[strictly proper]]) can also be realised quite easily. The trick here is to separate the transfer function into two parts: a strictly proper part and a constant. 
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \textbf{G}_\mathrm{SP}(s) + \textbf{G}(\infty). &lt;/math&gt;

The strictly proper transfer function can then be transformed into a canonical state-space realization using techniques shown above. The state-space realization of the constant is trivially &lt;math&gt;\textbf{y}(t) = \textbf{G}(\infty)\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Together we then get a state-space realization with matrices ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' determined by the strictly proper part, and matrix ''D'' determined by the constant.

Here is an example to clear things up a bit:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \frac{s^{2} + 3s + 3}{s^{2} + 2s + 1}
                      = \frac{s + 2}{s^{2} + 2s + 1} + 1&lt;/math&gt;
which yields the following controllable realization
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                               -2&amp; -1\\
                                1&amp;      0\\
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp; 2\end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 1\end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Notice how the output also depends directly on the input. This is due to the &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(\infty)&lt;/math&gt; constant in the transfer function.

=== Feedback ===
[[Image:Typical State Space model with feedback.png|framed|Typical state-space model with feedback]]

A common method for feedback is to multiply the output by a matrix ''K'' and setting this as the input to the system: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) = K \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Since the values of ''K'' are unrestricted the values can easily be negated for [[negative feedback]].
The presence of a negative sign (the common notation) is merely a notational one and its absence has no impact on the end results.

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B K \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D K \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

solving the output equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and substituting in the state equation results in

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A + B K \left(I - D K\right)^{-1} C \right) \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \left(I - D K\right)^{-1} C \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of this is that the [[eigenvalues]] of ''A'' can be controlled by setting ''K'' appropriately through eigendecomposition of &lt;math&gt;\left(A + B K \left(I - D K\right)^{-1} C \right)&lt;/math&gt;.
This assumes that the closed-loop system is [[controllability|controllable]] or that the unstable eigenvalues of ''A'' can be made stable through appropriate choice of ''K''.

==== Example ====
For a strictly proper system ''D'' equals zero. Another fairly common situation is when all states are outputs, i.e. ''y'' = ''x'', which yields ''C'' = ''I'', the [[Identity matrix]]. This would then result in the simpler equations

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A + B K \right) \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

This reduces the necessary eigendecomposition to just &lt;math&gt;A + B K&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Feedback with setpoint (reference) input ===
[[Image:Typical State Space model with feedback and input.png|framed|Output feedback with set point]]

In addition to feedback, an input, &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, can be added such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) = -K \mathbf{y}(t) + \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) - B K \mathbf{y}(t) + B \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) - D K \mathbf{y}(t) + D \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

solving the output equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and substituting in the state equation 
results in

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A - B K \left(I + D K\right)^{-1} C \right) \mathbf{x}(t) + B \left(I -  K \left(I + D K\right)^{-1}D \right) \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \left(I + D K\right)^{-1} C \mathbf{x}(t) + \left(I + D K\right)^{-1} D \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

One fairly common simplification to this system is removing ''D'', which reduces the equations to

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A - B K C \right) \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Moving object example ===
A classical linear system is that of one-dimensional movement of an object.
[[Newton's laws of motion]] for an object moving horizontally on a plane and attached to a wall with a spring

:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{y}(t) = u(t) - b\dot{y}(t) - k y(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is position; &lt;math&gt;\dot y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is velocity; &lt;math&gt;\ddot{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration
*&lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; is an applied force
*&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the viscous friction coefficient
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the spring constant
*&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object

The state equation would then become

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{\dot{x}_1}(t) \\ \mathbf{\dot{x}_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{x_1}(t) \\ \mathbf{x_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right] + \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{x_1}(t) \\ \mathbf{x_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the position of the object
*&lt;math&gt;x_2(t) = \dot{x}_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object
*&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) = \ddot{x}_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the object
*the output &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the object

The [[controllability]] test is then

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix} B &amp; AB \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{matrix} \right] &amp; \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m} \end{matrix} \right]   \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; \frac{1}{m} \\ \frac{1}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m^2} \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

which has full rank for all &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[observability]] test is then

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix} C \\ CA \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right] \\ \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

which also has full rank.
Therefore, this system is both controllable and observable.

== Nonlinear systems ==
The more general form of a state-space model can be written as two functions.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot{x}}(t) = \mathbf{f}(t, x(t), u(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf{h}(t, x(t), u(t))&lt;/math&gt;

The first is the state equation and the latter is the output equation.
If the function &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of states and inputs then the equations can be written in matrix notation like above.
The &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; argument to the functions can be dropped if the system is unforced (i.e., it has no inputs).

=== Pendulum example ===
A classic nonlinear system is a simple unforced [[pendulum]]

:&lt;math&gt;m\ell^2\ddot\theta(t)= - m\ell g\sin\theta(t) - k\ell\dot\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the pendulum with respect to the direction of gravity
*&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum (pendulum rod's mass is assumed to be zero)
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is coefficient of friction at the pivot point
*&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the pendulum (to the center of gravity of the mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;)
The state equations are then

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_1(t) = x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) = - \frac{g}{\ell}\sin{x_1}(t) - \frac{k}{m\ell}{x_2}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) = \theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the pendulum
*&lt;math&gt;x_2(t) = \dot{x}_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the rotational velocity of the pendulum
*&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2 = \ddot{x}_1&lt;/math&gt; is the rotational acceleration of the pendulum

Instead, the state equation can be written in the general form

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left( \begin{matrix} \dot{x}_1(t) \\ \dot{x}_2(t) \end{matrix} \right) = \mathbf{f}(t, x(t)) = \left( \begin{matrix} x_2(t) \\  - \frac{g}{\ell}\sin{x_1}(t) - \frac{k}{m\ell}{x_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]/[[stationary point]]s of a system are when &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and so the equilibrium points of a pendulum are those that satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \begin{matrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} n\pi \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

for integers ''n''.

[[Image:SpeakFrenchBeClean.jpg|thumb|400px|right|"Speak French, Be Clean" written on the wall of the [[Ayguatébia-Talau]] school]]

The '''''symbole''''', also called '''''ar vuoc'h''''' ("the [[cow]]"), was an object used by [[French language|Francophone]] headmasters in [[public education|public]] and [[private education|private schools]] in [[Brittany]], [[French Flanders]], [[Occitania]], [[Northern Basque Country|Basque Country]] and [[North Catalonia]] as a means of punishment for students caught speaking [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Flemish]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] or [[Catalan language|Catalan]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. 

Generally, the student was supposed to pass the ''symbole'' onto another of his fellow students after catching him speaking Breton, Occitan or Catalan (referred to as ''patois''). The student in possession of the object at the end of [[Recess (break)|recess]], the half-day, or the day would be punished with, for example, [[manual labor]], extra [[homework]], [[corporal punishment]], or organized mockery led by the headmaster.

==Nature of the object==
The ''symbole'' could be:
* an ordinary wooden [[Clog (shoe)|clog]], sometimes not hollowed out, worn around the neck
* a [[slate]] worn around the neck. At the [[Plouaret]] public school from 1943 to 1949 students were required to write "je parle breton" ("I speak Breton") on the slate.
* an object to be carried in the pocket, such as a button, toy sabot, or badge.

The purpose of its use was:
* Exclusion of the targeted language (Breton, Occitan...) from school and play;
* Bringing mockery upon those who didn't follow the established language rules;
* to help bring detriment upon students and prevent student solidarity.

The '''T-failure criterion''' is a set of [[material failure theory|material failure criteria]] that can be used to predict both [[brittle]] and [[ductile]] failure.  &lt;ref name=Adrian/&gt;
&lt;ref name=Adrian2/&gt;

These criteria were designed as a replacement for the [[von Mises yield criterion]] which predicts the unphysical result that pure [[hydrostatic]] tensile loading of metals never leads to failure.  The T-criteria use the volumetric stress in addition to the [[deviatoric stress]] used by the von Mises criterion and are similar to the [[Drucker Prager yield criterion]].  T-criteria have been designed on the basis of energy considerations and the observation that the reversible [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[energy density]] storage process has a limit which can be used to determine when a material has failed. 

==Description==
The strain energy density stored in the material and calculated by the area under the &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;\bar{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; curve represents the total amount of energy stored in the material only in the case of pure shear. In all other cases, there is a divergence between the actual and calculated stored energy in the material, which is maximum in the case of pure hydrostatic loading, where, according to the von Mises criterion, no energy is stored. This paradox is resolved if a second constitutive equation is introduced, that relates hydrostatic pressure p with the volume change &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;. These two curves, namely &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}-\bar{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; and (p-&lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;) are essential for a complete description of material behaviour up to failure.  Thus, two criteria must be accounted for when considering failure and two constitutive equations that describe material response. According to this criterion, an upper limit to allowable strains is set either by a critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;V,0&lt;/sub&gt; of the elastic energy density due to volume change ('''dilatational energy''') or by a critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;D,0&lt;/sub&gt; of the elastic energy density due to change in shape ('''distortional energy'''). The volume of material is considered to have failed by extensive plastic flow when the distortional energy Τ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; reaches the critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;D,0&lt;/sub&gt; or by extensive dilatation when the dilatational energy Τ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reaches a critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;V,0&lt;/sub&gt;. The two critical values Τ&lt;sub&gt;D,0&lt;/sub&gt; and Τ&lt;sub&gt;V,0&lt;/sub&gt; are considered material constants independent of the shape of the volume of material considered and the induced loading, but dependent on the strain rate and temperature.

==Deployment for Isotropic Metals==
For the development of the criterion, a [[continuum mechanics]] approach is adopted. The material volume is considered to be a continuous medium with no particular form or manufacturing defect. It is also considered to behave as a linear elastic isotropically hardening material, where stresses and strains are related by the generalised Hook’s law and by the incremental theory of plasticity with the von Mises flow rule. For such materials, the following assumptions are considered to hold:&lt;br /&gt;
(a) The total increment of a strain component &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is decomposed into the elastic and the plastic &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^e&lt;/math&gt; increment and &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^p&lt;/math&gt; respectively:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}=d\epsilon_{i,j}^e+d\epsilon_{i,j}^p&lt;/math&gt; (1)&lt;br /&gt;
(b) The elastic strain increment &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^e&lt;/math&gt; is given by Hooke’s law:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^e=\cfrac{1}{2G}(d{\sigma}_{i,j}-\cfrac{3\nu}{1+{\nu}}{\delta}_{i,j}dp)&lt;/math&gt;(2)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G=\cfrac{E}{2(1+\nu)}&lt;/math&gt;the [[shear modulus]], &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the [[Poisson ratio|Poisson’s ratio]] and &lt;math&gt;{\delta}_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Kronecker delta|Krönecker delta]].&lt;br /&gt;
(c) The plastic strain increment &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^p&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the respective deviatoric stress:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^p=s_{i,j}d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;(3)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;s_{i,j}={\sigma}_{i,j}-{\delta}_{i,j}p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; an infinitesimal scalar. (3) implies that the plastic strain increment:
* depends on the value of stresses, not on their variation 
* is independent of the hydrostatic component of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]
* is collinear with the deviatoric stresses (isotropic material)
(d) The increment in plastic work per unit volume using (4.16) is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dw_{p}={\sigma}_{i,j}d{\epsilon}_{i,j}^p={\sigma}_{i,j}s_{i,j}d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; (4)&lt;br /&gt;
and the increment in strain energy, &lt;math&gt;dT&lt;/math&gt;, equals to the total differential of the potential &lt;math&gt;{\Pi}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dT=d{\Pi}=pd{\Theta}+{\sigma}d{\epsilon}=dT_{V}+dT_{D}^*&lt;/math&gt;(5)&lt;br /&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;{\Theta}={\epsilon}_{11}+{\epsilon}_{22}+{\epsilon}_{33}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p=\cfrac{1}{3}({\sigma}_{11}+{\sigma}_{22}+{\sigma}_{33})&lt;/math&gt; and for metals following the von Mises yield law, by definition&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}=\cfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}[({\sigma}_{11}-{\sigma}_{22})^2+({\sigma}_{22}-{\sigma}_{33})^2+({\sigma}_{33}-{\sigma}_{11})^2]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;(6)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\bar{\epsilon}=\cfrac{1'''}{2}\sqrt{2}[({\epsilon}_{11}-{\epsilon}_{22})^2+({\epsilon}_{22}-{\epsilon}_{33})^2+({\epsilon}_{33}-{\epsilon}_{11})^2]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;(7)&lt;br /&gt;
are the equivalent stress and strain respectively.
In (5) the first term of the right hand side, &lt;math&gt;dT_{V}=pd\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the increment in elastic energy for unit volume change due to hydrostatic pressure. Its integral over a load path is the total amount of dilatational strain energy density stored in the material. The second term &lt;math&gt;dT_{D}^*=\bar{\sigma}d\bar{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the energy required for an infinitesimal distortion of the material. The integral of this quantity is the distortional strain energy density. The theory of plastic flow permits the evaluation of stresses, strains and strain energy densities along a path provided that &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; in (3) is known. In elasticity, linear or nonlinear, &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of strain hardening materials, &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; can be evaluated by recording the &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}=\bar{\sigma}(\bar{\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt; curve in a pure shear experiment. The hardening function after point “y” in Figure 1 is then:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H(\bar{\sigma},\bar{\epsilon})=\cfrac{d\bar{\sigma}}{d\bar{\epsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;(8)&lt;br /&gt;
and the infinitesimal scalar &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is:
&lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}=\cfrac{3}{2\bar\sigma^2}dw_p(H)&lt;/math&gt; (9)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;dw_p(H)&lt;/math&gt;is the infinitesimal increase in plastic work (see Figure 1). The elastic part of the total distortional strain energy density is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dT_D=\bar{\sigma}d\bar{\epsilon}^e&lt;/math&gt; (10)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\epsilon}^e&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic part of the equivalent strain. When there is no nonlinear elastic behaviour, by integrating (4.22) the elastic distortional strain energy density is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T_D=\int\bar{\sigma}d\bar{\epsilon}^e=\cfrac{1}{6G}\bar{\sigma}^2&lt;/math&gt; (11)&lt;br /&gt;
Similarly, by integrating the increment in elastic energy for unit volume change due to hydrostatic pressure, &lt;math&gt;dT_V=pd\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, the dilatational strain energy density is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T_V=\int{pd\Theta}=\cfrac{1}{2K}p^2=\cfrac{1}{2}K{\Theta}^2&lt;/math&gt; (12)&lt;br /&gt;
assuming that the unit volume change'' &lt;math&gt;{\Theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic straining, proportional to the hydrostatic pressure, p (Figure 2):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\Theta}=\cfrac{1}{2K}p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;d{\Theta}=\cfrac{1}{K}dp&lt;/math&gt; (13)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{\Theta}={\epsilon}_{11}+{\epsilon}_{22}+{\epsilon}_{33}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p=\cfrac{1}{3}({\sigma}_{11}+{\sigma}_{22}+{\sigma}_{33})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K=\cfrac{E}{3(1-2\nu)}&lt;/math&gt; the bulk modulus of the material. &lt;br /&gt;
In summary, in order to use (12) and (13) to determine the failure of a material volume, the following assumptions hold:
* The material is isotropic and follows the von Mises yield condition
* The elastic part of the stress-strain curve is linear
* The relationship between hydrostatic pressure and unit volume change is linear
* The derivative (hardening slope) must be positive or zero'''

== Limitations ==
The criterion will not predict any failure due to distortion for elastic-perfectly plastic, rigid-plastic, or strain softening materials. For the case of nonlinear elasticity, appropriate calculations for the integrals in and (12) and (13) accounting for the nonlinear elastic material properties must be performed. The two threshold values for the elastic strain energy &lt;math&gt;T_{V,0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{D,0}&lt;/math&gt; are derived from experimental data. A drawback of the criterion is that elastic strain energy densities are small and comparatively hard to derive. Nevertheless, example values are presented in the literature as well as applications where the T-criterion appears to perform quite well.

'''''The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values''''' is a book by [[Sam Harris]] published in 2010. In it, he promotes a [[science of morality]] and argues that many thinkers have long confused the relationship between morality, facts, and science. He aims to carve a third path between secularists who say morality is subjective (e.g. [[ethical relativism|moral relativists]]), and religionists who say that morality is given by God and scripture. Harris contends that the only moral framework worth talking about is one where "morally good" things pertain to increases in the "well-being of conscious creatures". He then argues that, problems with philosophy of science and reason in general notwithstanding, 'moral questions' will have objectively right and wrong answers which are grounded in empirical facts about what causes people to flourish.

Challenging the traditional philosophical notion that humans can never get an 'ought' from an 'is' (the so called [[Hume's law]]), Harris argues that moral questions are best pursued using not just philosophy, but the [[scientific method|methods of science]]. Thus, "science can determine human values" translates to "science can tell us which values lead to human flourishing". It is in this sense that Harris advocates that scientists begin conversations about a normative science of "morality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samharris.org/ |title=Sam Harris |publisher=Sam Harris |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Primary sources|synopsis|date=August 2012}}
Sam Harris's case starts with two premises: "(1) some people have better lives than others, and (2) these differences are related, in some lawful and not entirely arbitrary way, to states of the human brain and to states of the world".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that a person is simply describing material facts (many about their brain) when they describe possible "better" and "worse" lives for themselves. Granting this, Harris says we must conclude that there are facts about which courses of action will allow one to pursue a better life.

Harris attests to the importance of admitting that such facts exist, because he says this logic applies to groups of individuals as well. He suggests that there are better and worse ways for whole societies to pursue better lives. Just like at the scale of the individual, there may be multiple different paths and "peaks" to flourishing for societies - and many more ways to fail.

Harris then makes a case that science could usefully define "morality" according to such facts (about people's wellbeing). Often his arguments point out that problems with this scientific definition of morality seem to be problems shared by all science, or reason and words in general. Harris also spends some time describing how science might engage nuances and challenges of identifying the best ways for individuals, and groups of individuals, to improve their lives. Many of these issues are covered below.

===Philosophical case===
[[File:Researchers using Niskin bottle to collect water sample · DN-SD-01-00282.JPEG|thumb|right|Harris says science requires that one acknowledge certain values (e.g. curiosity)]]Although Harris's book discusses the challenges that a [[science of morality]] must face, he also mentions that his scientific argument is indeed [[Philosophy of science|philosophical]]. Furthermore, he says that this is the case for almost all scientific investigation. He mentions that modern science amounts to careful practice of accepted [[first principles|first philosophical principles]] like [[empiricism]] and [[physicalism]].&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 180"&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that science has already very much settled on ''values'' in answering the question "what should I believe, and why should I believe it?".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Harris says it should not be surprising that normative ethical sciences are, or would be, similarly founded on bedrock assumptions ([[Basic norm]]s). Harris says:

{{quote|...science is often a matter of philosophy in practice. It is probably worth recalling that the original name for the physical sciences was, in fact, 'natural philosophy'... One could call [my proposal in ''The Moral Landscape''] a 'philosophical' position, but it is one that directly relates to the boundaries of science.&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 180"/&gt;}}

The way he thinks science might engage moral issues draws on various philosophical positions like [[ethical realism]] (there are facts worth calling 'moral facts'), and [[ethical naturalism]] (these facts relate to the physical world). Harris says a [[science of morality]] may resemble [[Utilitarianism]], but that the science is, importantly, more open-ended because it involves an evolving definition of well-being. Rather than committing to [[Reductive materialism]], then, Harris recognizes the arguments of [[Revisionary materialism|revisionists]] that psychological definitions themselves are contingent on research and discoveries. Harris adds that any science of morality must consider everything from emotions and thoughts to the actual actions and their consequences.&lt;ref name=EdgeHarris&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/morality10/morality10_index.html |title=The New Science Of Morality |publisher=Edge |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Harris, moral propositions, and explicit values in general, are concerned with the flourishing of conscious creatures in a society.&lt;ref name=tedharris&gt;{{cite web|author=TED2010 |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html |title=Sam Harris: Science can answer moral questions &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Social morality exists to sustain cooperative social relationships, and morality can be objectively evaluated by that standard."&lt;ref name=HarrisCFI1&gt;{{cite web|author=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/video_of_sam_harris_talking_the_moral_landscape_in_nyc/ |title=Sam Harris Talks "The Moral Landscape" in NYC |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris sees some philosophers' talk of strictly ''private'' morality as akin to unproductive discussion of some private, personal physics. "If philosophers want to only talk about some bizarrely unnatural private morality, they are just changing the subject..."&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris also discusses how [[veil of ignorance|interchangeability of perspective]] might emerge as an important part of moral reasoning. He alludes to an 'unpleasant surprise principle', where someone realizes they have been supporting an ineffective moral norm (e.g. reported cases of Jew-hunting Nazis discovering that they themselves were of Jewish descent).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and moral truths===
Harris identifies three projects for science as it relates to morality: (1) explaining why humans do what they do in the name of "morality" (e.g. traditional [[evolutionary psychology]]), (2) determining which patterns of thought and behaviour humans actually ''should'' follow (i.e. the [[science of morality]]), and (3) generally persuading humans to change their ways.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Harris says that the first project is focused only on describing what is, whereas projects (2) and (3) are focused on what should and could be, respectively. Harris's point is that this second, prescriptive project should be the focus of a [[science of morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions, however, that we should not fear an "Orwellian future" with scientists at every door - vital progress in the science of morality could be shared in much the same way as advances in medicine.&lt;ref name=SalonHarris&gt;{{cite web|last=Don |first=Katherine |url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/10/17/sam_harris_interview/ |title="The Moral Landscape": Why science should shape morality |publisher=Salon.com |date=2010-10-17 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris says it is important to delineate project (1) from project (2), or else we risk committing a [[moralistic fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; He also highlights the importance of distinguishing between project (2) (asking what is right) from project (3) (trying to change behaviour). He says we must realize that the nuances of human motivation is a challenge in itself; humans often fail to do what they "ought" to do even to be successfully selfish - there is every reason to believe that discovering what is best for society would not change every member's habits overnight.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris does not imagine that people, even scientists, have always made the right moral decisions—indeed it is precisely his argument that many of them are wrong about moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the many real challenges of good science in general, including human cognitive limitations and biases (e.g. [[loss aversion]] can sway human decisions on important issues like medicine). He mentions [[psychic numbing#Paul Slovic|the research of Paul Slovic]] and others to describe just a few of these established mental [[heuristics]] that might keep us from reasoning properly.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Although he mentions that training might temper the influence of these biases, Harris worries about research showing that incompetence and ignorance in a domain leads to confidence (the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris explains that debates and disagreement are a part of the [[scientific method]], and that one side can certainly be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt; He also explains that all the debates still available to science illustrate how much work could still be done, and how much conversation must continue.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harris's positive beliefs===
The book is full of issues that Harris thinks are far from being empirically, morally grey areas. That is, besides saying that 'reasonable' thinking about moral issues amounts to scientific thinking. For instance, he references one poll that found that 36 percent of British Muslims think apostates should be put to death for their unbelief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-432075/Multiculturalism-drives-young-Muslims-shun-British-values.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Multiculturalism 'drives young Muslims to shun British values' | date=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he says that these individuals are "morally confused".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests it is obvious that loneliness, helplessness, and poverty are "bad", but that these are by no means as far as [[positive psychology]] has taken, and will take us.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

In one section, called ''The illusion of free will'', Harris argues that there is a wealth of evidence in [[psychology]] (e.g. the [[illusion of introspection]]) or specifically related to the [[neuroscience of free will]] that suggests that metaphysically free will does not exist. This, he thinks, is intuitive; "trains of thought...convey the apparent reality of choices, freely made. But from a deeper perspective...thoughts simply arise (what else could they do?)".&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 105"&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt; He adds "The illusion of free will is itself an illusion".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of free will's non-existence may be a working determinism, and Harris warns us not to confuse this with [[fatalism]].&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 105"/&gt;

One implication of a determined will, Harris says, is that it becomes unreasonable to punish people out of retribution—only behaviour modification and the deterrence of others still seem to be potentially valid reasons to punish.&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 109"&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt; This, especially because behaviour modification is a sort of cure for the evil behaviours; Harris provides a thought experiment: {{quote|Consider what would happen if we discovered a cure for human evil. Imagine, for the sake of argument...the cure for psychopathy can be put directly into the food supply like vitamin D...consider, for instance, the prospect of withholding the cure for evil from a murderer as part of his punishment. Would this make any moral sense at all?&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 109"/&gt;}}

Harris acknowledges a hierarchy of moral consideration (e.g. humans are more important than bacteria or mice). He says it follows that there could, in principle, be a species compared to which we are relatively unimportant (although he doubts such a species exists).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris supports the development of lie-detection technology and believes it would be, on the whole, beneficial for humanity. He also supports the formation of an explicit global civilization because of the potential for stability under a [[world government]].&lt;ref name="SalonHarris"/&gt;

====Religion: good or bad?====
Consistent with Harris's definition of morality, he says we must ask whether religion increases human flourishing today (regardless of whether it increased it in the distant past).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that religions may largely be practiced because they fit well with human cognitive tendencies (e.g. [[animism]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;
In Harris's view, religion and religious dogma is an impediment to reason, and he discusses the views of [[Francis Collins]] as one example.

Harris criticizes the tactics of secularists like [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]], who argue that science is not fundamentally (and certainly not superficially) in conflict with religion. Harris sees this as a very serious disagreement, that patronizingly attempts to pacify more devout theists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Harris claims that societies can move away from deep dependence on religion just as it has from witchcraft, which he says was once just as deeply ingrained.&lt;ref name="SalonHarris"/&gt;

Krauss, "God and Science Don't Mix"], ''The Wall Street Journal''(describing Harris and Dawkins as his "friends") (accessed on Harris's personal website, Nov. 7, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; biologist and science popularizer [[Richard Dawkins]], novelist [[Ian McEwan]], psycholinguist [[Steven Pinker]], and theoretical physicist [[Lawrence Krauss]], offered their praise for the book. They each serve on the Advisory Board of Harris's [[Project Reason]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-reason.org/about/advisory_board/ |title=Project Reason Advisory Board |publisher=Project-reason.org |date=1989-02-14 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their praise appears as [[blurb]]s (released by the book's publisher on Harris's website and reproduced on the book's [[dust jacket]]).&lt;ref name="blurb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tweet &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/the-moral-landscape/ |title=www.samharris.org |publisher=www.samharris.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dawkins said,
{{quote|I was one of those who had unthinkingly bought into the hectoring myth that science can say nothing about morals. To my surprise, The Moral Landscape has changed all that for me. It should change it for philosophers too. Philosophers of mind have already discovered that they can't duck the study of neuroscience, and the best of them have raised their game as a result...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values |url=https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Landscape-Science-Determine-Values/dp/1439171211 |title=The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values (9781439171219): Sam Harris: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McEwan wrote that "Harris breathes intellectual fire into an ancient debate. Reading this thrilling, audacious book, you feel the ground shifting beneath your feet. Reason has never had a more passionate advocate."&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt; Pinker said that Harris offers "a tremendously appealing vision, and one that no thinking person can afford to ignore."&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt; Krauss opined that Harris "has the rare ability to frame arguments that are not only stimulating, they are downright nourishing, even if you don't always agree with him!"&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt;  Krauss predicted that "readers are bound to come away with previously firm convictions about the world challenged, and a vital new awareness about the nature and value of science and reason in our lives."&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt;

==Reception==
''The Moral Landscape'' reached 9th in the ''[[New York Times]]'' Best Seller list for Hardcover Non-Fiction in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-10-24/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jennifer | last=Schuessler | title=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
[[Eastern Connecticut State University|ECSU]] Associate Professor of Philosophy James W. Diller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Gate|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Diller/publications|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Andrew E. Nuzzolilli wrote a generally favorable review in a journal of the [[Association for Behavior Analysis International]]:

{{quote|The Moral Landscape represents an important contribution to a scientific discussion of morality.

In his review for [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[California State University|Cal State]] Associate Professor of Philosophy Troy Jollimore wrote that the book "has some good, reasonable, and at times persuasive things to say" to people who are unfamiliar with [[moral skepticism]], but "has little to say to those people who actually do know what the arguments are, and it will not help others become much better informed." Jollimore also worried that Harris wrongly presents complex issues as having simple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/The-Moral-Landscape/ba-p/3477T. Jollimore, ''Barnes &amp; Noble Review''], Oct. 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' "when [Harris] stays closest to neuroscience, he says much that is interesting and important...".&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Appiah-t.html K.A. Appiah, "Science Knows Best"], ''The New York Times'', Oct. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He later criticized Harris for failing to articulate "his central claim" and to identify how science has "revealed" that human well-being has an objective component.&lt;ref name= Times/&gt;  Appiah argued that Harris "ends up endorsing ... something very like [[utilitarianism]], a philosophical position that is now more than two centuries old, ... that faces a battery of familiar problems," which Harris merely "push[es] ... aside."&lt;ref name= Times/&gt; Harris responded to Appiah in the afterword of the paperback version, writing that  all of Appiah's criticisms had already been addressed in the chapter "Good and Evil".

Cognitive scientist and anthropologist [[Scott Atran]] criticized Harris for failing to engage with the philosophical literature on ethics and the problems in attempting to scientifically quantify human well being, noting that
{{quote|Nobel Prize–winner Daniel Kahneman studies what gives Americans pleasure—watching TV, talking to friends, having sex—and what makes them unhappy—commuting, working, looking after their children.

Critiquing the book, [[Kenan Malik]] wrote:

{{quote|Imagine a sociologist who wrote about evolutionary theory without discussing the work of Darwin, Fisher, Mayr, Hamilton, Trivers or Dawkins on the grounds that he did not come to his conclusions by reading about biology and because discussing concepts such as "adaptation", "speciation", "homology", "phylogenetics" or "kin selection" would "increase the amount of boredom in the universe". How seriously would we, and should we, take his argument?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malik|first=Kenan|title=Test tube truths|accessdate=12 November 2011|newspaper=New Humanist|page=26|date=May–June 2011|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/2538/test-tube-truths}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

American novelist [[Marilynne Robinson]], writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', asserted that Harris fails to "articulate a positive morality of his own" but, had he done so, would have found himself in the company of the "[[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], busily cooperating on schemes to enhance the world's well being, as they have been doing for generations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703882404575520062380030080 M. Robinson, "What Unitarians Know (and Sam Harris Doesn't)"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', Oct. 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

David Sexton of the London Evening Standard described Harris's claim to provide a science of morality as“the most extraordinarily overweening claim and evidently flawed. Science does not generate its own moral values; it can be used for good or ill and has been. Harris cannot stand outside culture, and the 'better future' he prophesies is itself a cultural projection. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The King James Bible bashers|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23938503-the-king-james-bible-bashers.do|accessdate=13 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430172150/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23938503-the-king-james-bible-bashers.do|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]], journalist for the ''[[Scientific American]]'' blog and author of ''The End of Science'', wrote "Harris further shows his arrogance when he claims that neuroscience, his own field, is best positioned to help us achieve a universal morality. ... Neuroscience can't even tell me how I can know the big, black, hairy thing on my couch is my dog Merlin. And we're going to trust neuroscience to tell us how we should resolve debates over the morality of abortion, euthanasia and armed intervention in other nations' affairs?"&lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2010/10/11/be-wary-of-the-righteous-rationalist-we-should-reject-sam-harriss-claim-that-science-can-be-a-moral-guidepost/ J. Horgan, "Be wary of the righteous rationalist: We should reject Sam Harris's claim that science can be a moral guidepost"], ''Scientific American'' blog, Oct. 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell Blackford]] said "The Moral Landscape is an ambitious work that will gladden the hearts, and strengthen the spines, of many secular thinkers" but that he had "serious reservations about a good book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm |title=Book review: Sam Harris’ The Moral Landscape |publisher=Jetpress.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], reviewing the book, described Harris as "a knockabout atheist" who "joins the prodigious ranks of those whose claim to have transcended philosophy is just an instance of their doing it very badly", pointing out that "if [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s hedonist is in one brain state and [[Aristotle]]'s active subject is in another, as no doubt they would be, it is a moral, not an empirical, problem to say which is to be preferred."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2011/03/blackburn-ethics-without-god-secularism-religion-sam-harris/ Morality without God] [[Prospect magazine]] 23-Mar-2011&lt;/ref&gt;  And [[H. Allen Orr]] in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' finds that "Despite Harris's bravado about 'how science can determine human values,' The Moral Landscape delivers nothing of the kind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/may/12/science-right-and-wrong/?page=2 The Science of Right and Wrong] by [[H.

Steve Isaacson wrote ''Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values''. Isaacson concludes, "The largest objection to Harris' argument is still Moore's [[open-question argument]]. Harris dismisses the argument as a word game easily avoided, but he never explains the game nor how to avoid it. He just ignores it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values |url=https://www.amazon.com/Mining-Moral-Landscape-Science-Determine/dp/1480292680 |title=Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values (978-1480292680): Steve Isaacson: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-20}}, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Moving Naturalism Forward workshop, [[Nobel Prize]] winning physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] described how in his youth he had been a utilitarian but had been dissuaded of the notion that "the fundamental principle that guides our actions should be the greatest happiness for the greatest number" by reading [[Aldous Hŭley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Weinberg went on to say: "Now, Sam Harris is aware of this kind of counter argument [to utilitarianism], and says it's not happiness, it's human welfare. Well, as you make things vaguer and vaguer, of course, it becomes harder and harder to say it doesn't fit your own moral feelings, but it also becomes less and less useful as a means of making moral judgements. You could take that to the extreme and make up some nonsense word and say that's the important thing and no-one could refute it but it wouldn't be very helpful. I regard human welfare and the way Sam Harris refers to it as sort of halfway in that direction to absolute nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebuve4INdAU&amp;list=PLrxfgDEc2NxYQuZ5T6CSdS8uafdh0kmDL&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after the book's release, Sam Harris wrote a follow-up at ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' responding to his critics.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/a-response-to-critics_b_815742.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Sam | last=Harris | title=A Response to Critics | date=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Moral Landscape Challenge''===

On August 31, 2013, in response to the negative reviews of his book, Harris issued a public challenge for anyone to write an essay of less than 1,000 words rebutting the "central argument" of the book.&lt;ref name="MLChallenge"&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-moral-landscape-challenge1/ The Moral Landscape Challenge : : Sam Harris]&lt;/ref&gt; The submissions were vetted by Russell Blackford, with the author of the essay judged best to receive $2,000, or $20,000 if they succeeded in changing Harris's mind.&lt;ref name="MLChallenge"/&gt; 424 essays were received by the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Metamagician/status/433134620637274113 "Twitter Russell Blackford"]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2014, Blackford announced the winning essay was written by philosophy instructor Ryan Born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-moral-landscape-challenge ''The Moral Landscape Challenge: The Winning Essay'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5008">The '''tunnel problem''' is a [[philosophical]] [[thought experiment]] first introduced by Jason Millar. It is a variation on the classic [[trolley problem]] designed to focus on the [[ethics]] of [[autonomous vehicles]], as well as the question of who gets to decide how they react in life-and-death scenarios.

==Original formulation==
The tunnel problem is intended to draw one's attention to a specific issue in design/engineering ethics, and was first presented as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tunnel Problem: You are travelling along a single lane mountain road in an [[autonomous car]] that is fast approaching a narrow tunnel. Just before entering the tunnel a child attempts to run across the road but trips in the center of the lane, effectively blocking the entrance to the tunnel. The car has but two options: hit and kill the child, or swerve into the wall on either side of the tunnel, thus killing you. How should the car react?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robohub.org/an-ethical-dilemma-when-robot-cars-must-kill-who-should-pick-the-victim/|title=An ethical dilemma: When robot cars must kill, who should pick the victim? - Robohub|website=robohub.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar thought experiments have been brought forth by other philosophers focusing on the topic of autonomous cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/the-robot-car-of-tomorrow-might-just-be-programmed-to-hit-you/|title=The Robot Car of Tomorrow May Just Be Programmed to Hit You|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of these thought experiments is that even with highly sophisticated self-driving-car technologies, the cars will face situations where harm cannot be avoided.

==Purpose==
The tunnel problem is meant to focus one's attention on two questions that it raises for designers and users of autonomous cars:
# How should the car react?
# Who should decide how the car reacts?

In its original formulation, the tunnel problem is discussed as an "end-of-life" decision for the passenger of the car: depending on the way the car reacts, the passenger either lives or dies. Because of that feature, Millar argues that the tunnel problem forces us to question whether designers/engineers have the legitimate moral authority to make the decision on behalf of autonomous car users. Indeed, the second question is meant to challenge the standard notion that all design decisions are just technical in nature. Where design features provide "material answers to moral questions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://robots.law.miami.edu/2014/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Proxy-Prudence-Rethinking-Models__-of-Responsibility-for-Semi-autonomous-Robots-Millar.pdf |title=Proxy Prudence: Rethinking Models of Responsibility for Semi-autonomous Robots|work=University of Miami School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the use context, Millar argues that designers must find ways to incorporate user preferences in order to avoid unjustifiable paternalistic relationships between technology and the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.miami.edu/webcast/video.php?location=depatments&amp;stream=20140404_WeRobot_Part3.mp4&amp;width=480&amp;height=270&amp;page=|title=Untitled Video - University of Miami School of Law|website=www.law.miami.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the tunnel problem focuses on ethical design issues in semi-autonomous technologies, it is considered a problem in [[roboethics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ubyssey.ca/news/ubc-researchers-are-looking-to-open-up-dialogue-surrounding-public-opinion-on-driverless-cars-323/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==
[[Roger Crisp]] featured the tunnel problem on the Oxford University Practical Ethics blog. The entry contains a critique of the problem as presented by Millar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/07/the-tunnel-problem/|title=The Tunnel Problem - Practical Ethics|website=blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel problem was the focus of a poll conducted by the Open Roboethics Initiative (ORi). In response, 64% of participants said the car should continue straight and kill the child, while 36% said it should swerve and kill the passenger. In addition, 48% of respondents reported that the decision was "easy", while 28% and 24% claimed it was "moderately difficult" and "difficult" respectively. When asked who should make the decision, only 12% felt the designer/manufacturer should make it, 44% felt the passenger should make it, and 33% thought it should be left to lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robohub.org/if-a-death-by-an-autonomous-car-is-unavoidable-who-should-die-results-from-our-reader-poll/|title=If death by autonomous car is unavoidable, who should die?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="303">In [[type theory]] '''universal type(s)''' may refer to:

* The [[top type]] in a [[type system]] with [[subtyping]].
* Universal types is a shorthand for [[universally quantified]] types in systems that support [[parametric polymorphism]] like [[System F]].
