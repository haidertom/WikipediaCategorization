[[File:5S methodology.png|thumb|upright=1.3|5S methodology.]]
[[File:Resource corner 5S Safety Scanfil Sieradz.jpg|thumb|5S resource corner at Scanfil Poland factory in [[Sieradz]].]]
'''5S''' is a workplace organization method that uses a list of five [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words: {{nihongo|''seiri''|整理}}, {{nihongo|''seiton''|整頓}}, {{nihongo|''seisō''|清掃}}, {{nihongo|''seiketsu''|清潔}}, and {{nihongo|''shitsuke''|躾}}. These have been translated as "Sort", "Set In  order", "Shine", "Standardize" and "Sustain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/what-is-5s/|title=What Is 5S? - Sort, Set In Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list describes how to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order. The decision-making process usually comes from a dialogue about standardization, which builds understanding among employees of how they should do the work.

In some quarters, 5S has become 6S, the sixth element being safety.&lt;ref&gt;Gapp, R., Fisher, R., Kobayashi, K. 2008. Implementing 5S within a Japanese Context: An Integrated Management System, ''Management Decision''. 46(4): 565-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than a specific stand-alone methodology, 5S is frequently viewed as an element of a broader construct known as ''visual control'',&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Chris A. and Park, Murry. 2010. ''Visual Controls: Applying Visual Management to the Factory''. New York: Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''visual workplace'',&lt;ref&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn D. 2005. ''Visual Workplace: Visual Thinking''. Portland, Ore: Visual-Lean Enterprise Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''visual factory''.&lt;ref&gt;Greif, Michel. 1989. ''The Visual Factory: Building Participation through Shared Information''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Hiroyuki, ed. 1988. ''JIT Factory Revolution: A Pictorial Guide to Factory Design of the Future''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Under those (and similar) terminologies, Western companies were applying underlying concepts of 5S before publication, in English, of the formal 5S methodology. For example, a workplace-organization photo from Tennant Company (a Minneapolis-based manufacturer) quite similar to the one accompanying this article appeared in a manufacturing-management book in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Schonberger, Richard J. 1986. ''World Class Manufacturing: The Lessons of Simplicity Applied''. New York: Free Press, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins of 5S ==
[[File:The scheme "Correct Arrangement of the Tool", CIT, Russia, 1920-1924.png|thumb|The scheme "Correct Arrangement of the Tool" from a CIT instruction sheet, 1920-1924.]]

5S was developed in Japan and was identified as one of the techniques that enabled [[Just in time (business)|Just in Time]] manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Hiroyuki. 1988. ''JIT Factory Revolution: A Pictorial Guide to Factory Design of the Future.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major frameworks for understanding and applying 5S to business environments have arisen, one proposed by Osada, the other by Hirano.&lt;ref name="5-pillars"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=5 Pillars of the Visual Workplace|last=Hirano|first=Hiroyuki|publisher=Productivity Press|year=1995|isbn=978-1-56327-047-5|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osada"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ll-1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+5S%E2%80%99s:+Five+keys+to+a+Total+Quality+Environment&amp;dq=The+5S%E2%80%99s:+Five+keys+to+a+Total+Quality+Environment&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC8OXB0abVAhXFeD4KHWBTBZAQ6AEIKDAA|title=The 5S’s: Five keys to a Total Quality Environment|last=Osada|first=Takashi|publisher=Asian Productivity Organization &lt;!--|123= 9283311167--&gt;|year=1995|isbn=978-9-28331-115-7|location=US|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hirano provided a structure to improve programs with a series of identifiable steps, each building on its predecessor. As noted by John Bicheno,&lt;ref name="lean-toolbox"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Lean Toolbox: Towards Fast, Flexible Flow|last=Bicheno|first=John|publisher=PICSIE|isbn=978-0-9541244-1-0|location=Buckingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota's adoption of the Hirano approach was '4S', with Seiton and Seiso combined.{{Verify source|date=February 2016}}

A precursor development to the Japanese system of management was outlined by [[Aleksei Gastev|Alexey Gastev's]] development and the [[Central Institute of Labour]] (CIT) in Moscow.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="WorkManagingRusJap"&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/managing-modernity-work-community-and-authority-in-late-industrializing-japan-and-russia/oclc/231965117 Managing «modernity»: work, community, and authority in late-industrializing Japan and Russia, Rudra Sil, Publisher: Ann Arbor, Mich. : University of Michigan Press, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 5S ==
There are five 5S phases. They can be translated from the Japanese as "sort", "set in order", "shine", "standardize", and "sustain". Other translations are possible.

===Sort (Seiri)===
[[File:Red Tag Area 0123.jpg|thumb|1S – a red tag area containing items waiting for removal.]]
Seiri is sorting through all items in a location and removing all unnecessary items from the location.

Goals:
* Reduce time loss looking for an item by reducing the number of items.
* Reduce the chance of distraction by unnecessary items.
* Simplify inspection.
* Increase the amount of available, useful space.
* Increase safety by eliminating obstacles.

Implementation:
* Check all items in a location and evaluate whether or not their presence at the location is useful or necessary.
* Remove unnecessary items as soon as possible. Place those that cannot be removed immediately in a 'red tag area' so that they are easy to remove later on.
* Keep the working floor clear of materials except for those that are in use to production.

===Set in order (Seiton) ===
[[File:5S ręczny wózek paletowy.jpg|thumb|2S – simple floor marking.]]
Seiton is putting all necessary items in the optimal place for fulfilling their function in the workplace.

Goal:
* Make the [[workflow]] smooth and easy.

Implementation:
* Arrange work stations in such a way that all tooling / equipment is in close proximity, in an easy to reach spot and in a logical order adapted to the work performed. Place components according to their uses, with the frequently used components being nearest to the workplace.
* Arrange all necessary items so that they can be easily selected for use. Make it easy to find and pick up necessary items.
* Assign fixed locations for items. Use clear labels, marks or hints so that items are easy to return to the correct location and so that it is easy to spot missing items.

===Shine (Seiso)===
[[File:Cleanliness point 5S Scanfil Sieradz.jpg|thumb|3S – cleanliness point with cleaning tools and resources.]]
Seiso is sweeping or cleaning and inspecting the workplace, tools and machinery on a regular basis.

Goals:
* Prevent deterioration.
* Keep the workplace safe and easy to work in.
* Keep the workplace clean and pleasing to work in.
* When in place, anyone not familiar to the environment must be able to detect any problems within 50 feet in 5 sec.

Implementation:
* Clean the workplace and equipment on a daily basis, or at another appropriate (high frequency) cleaning interval.
* Inspect the workplace and equipment while cleaning.

===Standardize (Seiketsu) ===
Seiketsu is to standardize the processes used to sort, order and clean the workplace.

Goal:
* Establish procedures and schedules to ensure the repetition of the first three ‘S’ practices.

Implementation:
* Develop a work structure that will support the new practices and make it part of the daily routine.
* Ensure everyone knows their responsibilities of performing the sorting, organizing and cleaning.
* Use photos and visual controls to help keep everything as it should be.
* Review the status of 5S implementation regularly using audit checklists.

===Sustain/Self-discipline (Shitsuke) ===
Shitsuke or sustain the developed processes by self-discipline of the workers. Also translates as "do without being told".

Goal:
* Ensure that the 5S approach is followed.

Implementation:
* Organize training sessions.
* Perform regular audits to ensure that all defined standards are being implemented and followed.
* Implement improvements whenever possible. Worker inputs can be very valuable for identifying improvements.
* When issues arrise, identify their cause and implement the changes necessary to avoid their recurral.

== Variety of 5S applications ==
5S methodology has expanded from manufacturing and is now being applied to a wide variety of industries including health care, education, and government. Visual management and 5S can be particularly beneficial in health care because a frantic search for supplies to treat an in-trouble patient (a chronic problem in health care) can have dire consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Graban, Mark. 2012. ''Lean Hospitals: Improving Quality, Patient Safety, and Employee Engagement''. Boca Raton, Fl: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the origins of the 5S methodology are in manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.5stoday.com/what-is-5s/|title=What Is 5S?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it can also be applied to [[knowledge economy]] work, with information, software, or media in the place of physical product.&lt;ref name="ceiton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/company/profile.html#Origin|title=CEITON – Profile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5S in lean product &amp; process development ==
The output of engineering and design in a lean enterprise is information, the theory behind using 5S here is "Dirty, cluttered, or damaged surfaces attract the eye, which spends a fraction of a second trying to pull useful information from them every time we glance past. Old equipment hides the new equipment from the eye and forces people to ask which to use"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward|first1=Allen|title=Lean Product and Process Development|date=March 2014|publisher=Lean Enterprise Institute|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-934109-43-4|page=215|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afghan Wireless Communication Company''', commonly referred to as '''Afghan Wireless''' or '''AWCC''', is [[Afghanistan]]'s first [[wireless]] communications company. Founded in 1998, it is based in Kabul, Afghanistan with various regional offices.&lt;ref name="PCWorldGrows"/&gt; The company operates as a subsidiary of [[Telephone Systems International]], which is a joint venture between the [[Ehsan Bayat|Bayat Group]] and the [[Afghan Ministry of Communications]].&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ Herald"&gt;http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=3006609&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan Wireless launched the first [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] service in Afghanistan in 2017, at which point it was the largest private employer in the country.&lt;ref name="SpectrumLee"/&gt; It has around five million clients&lt;ref name="SpectrumLee"/&gt; and provides coverage in all of Afghanistan's provinces.&lt;ref name="AWCC Press Release Tution"&gt;https://afghan-wireless.com/afghan-wireless-announces-increased-tuition-assistance-for-employees-awcc-employees-enrolled-in-bachelors-and-masters-degree-programs-to-receive-significantly-higher-tuition-rebates-and-discounts/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding and licensing===
In 1998, [[Afghan-American]] telecommunications entrepreneur [[Ehsan Bayat]] won an exclusive license from Afghanistan's [[Taliban]] government to create a joint venture with the country's [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Communications]],&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; which was given 20% ownership.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Jeong"&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-one-thing-that-works-in-afghanistan-mobile/article17115573/&lt;/ref&gt; The deal had been negotiated by investors from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/26/business/telecommunications-entrepreneur-with-a-colorful-resume.html&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan Wireless Communications Company, or AWCC, was established as a subsidiary of [[Telephone Systems International]],&lt;ref name="NZ Herald"/&gt; and financial backing was provided by the British entrepreneurs Stuart Bentham and Lord Michael Cecil.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tapei Times Ringing"&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/bizfocus/archives/2001/11/27/0000113386&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1999 the Taliban granted Afghan Wireless a 15-year [[monopoly]] on cell phone traffic in Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; and within the year Afghan Wireless had re-enabled Afghanistan's [[List of country calling codes|international country calling code]].&lt;ref name=rose/&gt; In 1999 and 2000&lt;ref name="Tapei Times Ringing"/&gt; the company set up digital [[telephone exchange]]s in the cities of [[Kabul]] and [[Kandahar]], replacing the outdated manual telephone switchboards that the country's telecommunications had long relied upon.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/09/preventing-9-11-201109 |title=9/11: The Tapping Point |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=September 2011 |first=David|last=Rose|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tapei Times Ringing"/&gt;

Although the Taliban were overthrown by [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|an American invasion in 2001]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/business/international/once-a-bright-spot-afghan-telecoms-face-unsustainable-losses.html?_r=0 |title=Once a Bright Spot, Afghan Telecoms Face Unsustainable Losses |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 April 2016 |first=Kristina|last=Shevory|accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan Wireless was nevertheless the first company licensed to provide [[GSM]] wireless service in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Radio Liberty"/&gt; With the lifting of the trade embargo, Afghan Wireless brought in technology from American vendors including WorldCom, TECORE Wireless Systems, and AirNet Communications Corporation.&lt;ref name="Radio Liberty"/&gt; Afghan interim leader [[Hamid Karzai]] publicly made the first phone call on April 6, 2002, calling and speaking with the Afghan ambassador to the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]]. As the network went public using a pre-paid platform, phone booths were set up for those unable to afford cellphones.&lt;ref name="Radio Liberty"&gt;{{cite web

The following year Argent also developed a billing system for the network,&lt;ref name="NZ Herald"/&gt; and competing companies such as [[Roshan (telco)|Roshan]] started to appear.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Jeong"/&gt;

An '''air knife''' is a tool used to blow off liquid or debris from products as they travel on conveyors.  Air knives are normally used in [[manufacturing]] or as the first step in a [[recursive recycling]] process to separate lighter or smaller particles from other components for use in later or subsequent steps, post manufacturing parts drying and conveyor cleaning, part of component cleaning. The knife consists of a high-intensity, uniform sheet of [[laminar flow|laminar airflow]] sometimes known as [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]] flow.

An industrial air knife is a pressurized air plenum containing a series of holes or continuous slots through which pressurized air exits in a laminar flow pattern. The exit air velocity then creates an impact air velocity onto the surface of whatever object the air is directed. This impact air velocity can range from a gentle breeze to greater than [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.6 (40,000&amp;nbsp;ft/min) to alter the surface of a product without mechanical contact.

Air knives remove liquids, control the thickness of liquids, dry the liquid coatings, remove foreign particles, cool product surfaces or create a hold down force to assist in the mechanical bonding of materials to the surface. Electrical currents from anti-static bars can also be injected into the exit air knife stream to neutralize the static electricity charge on some surfaces.

In the majority of manufacturing applications for air knives, the air knives are stationary while the product passes through the air velocity air stream. In other circumstances, the product is stationary and the air knives move (reciprocate or rotate) over the surface of the stationary product. Although there are very few applications where an air knife can actually cut a product (break mechanical bonds between two points), air knives are often the most efficient method of removing or controlling unwanted or foreign substances on any surface.

==History==
In the 1950s and 60s, the term "'''air doctor'''" was first used to refer to the non-contact method of debris blow-off using compressed air. The printing and textile industries were some of the largest users of air doctors at that time. They often needed wide paths of air from a compressed air system to control the thickness of liquids on a surface, or to blow debris off the surface of materials prior to the next process. Other terms used were air bar, air squeegee, air curtain, air jet, air blast, air blow off, air nozzle, air comb, air blade and air [[doctor blade]]. Today the most commonly used term is simply "air knife".

Although air knives powered by compressed plant air are used in a wide variety of industrial applications, industrial blower-powered air knives have proven to reduce the energy usage versus compressed air knives by 50–75% for most applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=VanderPyl|first1=Daniel J.|title=Advances in Blow-Off Drying Systems and Air Knives|journal=PCI Magazine|date=1 August 2007|url=http://www.pcimag.com/articles/95007-advances-in-blow-off-drying-systems-and-air-knives|accessdate=28 November 2016|publisher=BNP Media|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912091826/http://www.pcimag.com/articles/95007-advances-in-blow-off-drying-systems-and-air-knives|archive-date=2015-09-12|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blower-powered air knife systems came of age with the advent of the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], which started the clock on the worldwide phase-out of atmospheric ozone depleting CFC’s ([[chlorofluorocarbons]]) then used as cleaning agents in many industries.

Most of these solvent-based cleaning agents simply evaporated which required no blow-off or other drying methods. Although the printed circuit board industry was still in its infancy, it was among the first to initiate the conversion to aqueous and semi-aqueous-based parts cleaning systems.

With nearly every existing and all future circuit board factories using the new environmentally friendly cleaning technology, they also needed a new method of drying the p.c. boards following their water-based cleaning to remove solder fluxes and other contaminants. The trend away from other types of solvent-based parts cleaning to water-based cleaning for other industries began soon thereafter. Additionally, the conversion to water-based inks, paints, coatings, adhesives and other solutions used in various manufacturing sectors has resulted in the need for air knife dryers where none had previously existed. As a result of the Montreal Protocol and worldwide industry compliance with environmental stewardship mandates, the former niche business of air knives became an industry.

==Description of operation==
Air knives on a production line commonly range from {{convert|0.25|to|200|in}} in length with a discharge air slot or holes ranging from {{convert|0.001|to|0.25|in|abbr=on}}. A stationary air knife configuration can require from one to a dozen air knives depending on the application criteria. Air is blasted through the air knife slots via an air generator, either an industrial blower or air compressor, to deliver the predetermined exit air volume and velocity needed.

There are many application, environmental, efficiency and duty cycle aspects to consider when choosing between compressors and blowers. Compressed air, which is least efficient when used for air knives discharging into free air, allows for use of primary plant air. The piping sizes supplying the air knives can be as little as {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter, so they are ideal for confined spaces. Blower-powered air knives must be larger in size along with larger diameter supply piping, but the efficiency improvement over compressed air is easily justified with the electrical power cost savings.

Air knife designs today have evolved to where some manufacturers produce a very efficient “teardrop” shape with a .95 coefficient of discharge. These blower-powered air knife designs typically have a profile of approximately {{convert|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide x {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} tall x any length, but the teardrop profile can range from {{convert|1.5|to|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} tall depending on the criteria of the product for which the impact air velocity must be engineered. With construction ranging from {{convert|1/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick aluminum extrusion to 11 gauge fabricated stainless steel, air knives can weigh 1&amp;nbsp;lb/ft to 25&amp;nbsp;lbs/ft. Depending on the width and speed of the product, the air knife can provide effective blow-off performance from {{convert|0.5|to|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} or more away from the surface of the product. Round air nozzles of {{convert|1|to|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter can be effective against surfaces which are up to several feet (1 to 2 meters) from the product surface when engineered for such applications.

==Types and applications==
The most common use of air knives is to contain or remove free-standing materials (liquids or solids) from the surface of material. The applications include drying bottles and cans after filling and rinsing, printed circuit boards following the conveyorized wash to remove solder paste and flux, metals castings after automatic machining and many more. They can also deliver heated or cooled air to a surface, or create an invisible air barrier to separate heated or cooled environments from one another in industrial applications such as continuous metal heat treating ovens, cold process or storage areas in food processing or dust containment for the entrance to clean rooms.

There is a variety of uses for air knives in many different industries, applications and environments. The invisible-high velocity air streams can be discharged by air knife designs of numerous shapes and sizes. These range from “garage built” devices with a low level of precision to the most exotic metals of construction used in air knives for class 100 clean rooms.

In instances where noise reduction and moisture containment around a conveyorized air knife installation becomes important, some manufacturing facilities have installed air knives within an enclosure. These enclosures keep water contained, reduce the amount of air knife noise and even eliminate any liquid that could create safety concerns.

==Basic design features==
===Compressed air-powered air knives===

There has always been a wide assortment of blow-off appliances. Air knives and nozzles for compressed air blow-off range from home made round pipes with holes to engineered high pressure air knives. In order to achieve the highest efficiency using compressed air, many manufacturers of compressed air knives utilize the [[Coandă effect]] to improve compressed air knife design over other types of knives and nozzles. Although the efficiency of compressed air for low-pressure blow-off air is much lower than blowers, the Coanda-inspired air knives entrain ambient air into the high-velocity stream to enhance the blow off effect.

===Blower-powered air knives===
The teardrop-shaped air knife has a bulbous plenum which tapers down to a precise air discharge slot as the standard of the blower driven air knife industry. Whereas a round pipe with holes drilled has an average coefficient of discharge of 0.6 (60% efficient), the teardrop-shaped air knife is commonly 0.95 (95% efficient), which provides much higher-impact air velocity to the surface at which the air is directed with the lowest blower motor power demand. These teardrop designs are available in extruded aluminum shapes as well as fabricated carbon and stainless steels.

===OSHA compliance===

Information is needed regarding the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and their standards and directives on Compressed Air, especially when used for cleaning.

'''Alberto José Armando''' (February 4, 1910 – December 28, 1988) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] businessman and football manager. He was the president of club [[Boca Juniors]] from 1954 to 1955, and from 1960 to 1980.&lt;ref name=informe&gt;[http://www.informexeneize.com.ar/historia_1.htm Informe Xeneize: Historia]&lt;/ref&gt; With Armando as president, Boca Juniors gained international recognition after winning its first [[Copa Libertadores]] (1977 and 1978) and the first [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] in [[1977 Intercontinental Cup|1977]].

The [[La Bombonera|Boca Juniors stadium]] was renamed in his honour in December 2000 by then President [[Mauricio Macri]].

==Life and career==
Armando was born in [[Santa Fe, Argentina]], in 1910, and raised in nearby [[San Francisco, Córdoba]]. He married María Mercedes Crespo and became affiliated with the Boca Juniors football club in the 1940s, when he became known as ''El Puma''. Armando was elected president of Boca Juniors in early 1954, succeeding Daniel Gil. The team had struggled since its last [[Primera División Argentina|First Division title]], in 1944, though Gil's tenure could boast the enlargement and modernization of the [[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|La Bombonera]] stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bocajuniors.yaia.com/historia.html Boca Juniors: Historia] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armando's brief first turn as president during 1954–55 was marked by the team's first title in a decade, the [[1954 Argentine Primera División|1954 Primera División]] championship. However, his occupation as the proprietor of an [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[car dealership|dealership]] prompted him to resign.&lt;ref name=negocio/&gt; He diversified his business interests in 1960, when he entered into a partnership with developer [[Francisco Macri]] to establish Tutora Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Ale, Ana. ''La Dinastía''. Editorial Planeta, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RomaDelem-1962.jpg|left|thumb|210px|One of Armando's first drafts, [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Antonio Roma]], deflects a River Plate goal in [[1962 Argentine Primea División|1962]], resulting in Boca's first championship in eight years.]]

Later in 1960, Armando won the election and returned as president of Boca Juniors. He undertook an ambitious program of acquiring new players. Some of them would become notable footballers in the 1960s and 1970s, such as [[Antonio Roma]], [[Silvio Marzolini]], [[Ernesto Grillo]], Dante Lugo, and Antonio Garabal (the latter three were Argentine expatriates brought back from European teams).&lt;ref name=negocio/&gt; The squad victory over arch-rival [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] in [[1962 Argentine Primera División|1962]] was the first major title since 1954, and was followed by the [[1964 Argentine Primera División|1964]] and [[1965 Argentine Primera División|1965]], and the [[Nacional championship]]s in [[1969_Argentine_Primera_División#Campeonato_Nacional|1969]], [[1970_Argentine_Primera_División#Campeonato_Nacional|1970]], and [[1976_Argentine_Primera_División#Campeonato_Nacional|1976]], totalizing 7 league titles.&lt;ref name=informe/&gt;

Armando was also the ''father'' of the [[Torneos de Verano (Argentina)|Torneos de Verano]], a series of short friendly pre-season tournaments held during the southern summer in Argentina every year, usually in January and February. The competition was held for the first time in 1968, with the games played at "General San martín" stadium of [[Mar del Plata]], the biggest seaside [[balneario|beach resort]] in Argentina.&lt;ref name=negocio/&gt; Since the first edition in 1968, the Torneos de Verano have been uninterruptedly played, then being expanded to other cities of Argentina such as [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] and [[Tandil]] among others.

Armando's administration in Boca Juniors also invested heavily in improving facilities. La Bombonera was modernized, and bucket seats were added. A 5-hectare (13 acre) property in suburban [[San Justo, Buenos Aires]], was purchased in 1963 for use as ''La Candela'', the team's training grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=743281 ''La Nación'': Adiós a La Candela] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aging football field was leased in [[Mar del Plata]] in 1969 for additional use during the summer months, when weather in the Buenos Aires area is least propitious for training.&lt;ref name=negocio/&gt;

[[File:Toto lorenzo armando.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Armando (right) with manager "Toto" Lorenzo. Under his administration the club won the first international titles.]]
Armando's ambitious works program also included plans for a new stadium, for which the [[Argentine Congress]] passed a bill in 1965 donating a {{convert|40|ha|acre|abbr=off}} waterfront lot south of the ''Costanera Sur'' (the abandoned former municipal beach along the [[Río de la Plata]] in what today is the tony [[Puerto Madero]] ward). He lobbied successfully for the concession by presenting plans for a new, 140,000 seat stadium, as well as other improvements, notably a sports complex. Construction began on the mammoth ''Ciudad Deportiva'' project, and a recreational area consisting of a network of round islands connected by bridges was completed. Ultimately, however, the stadium was never built, and much of the land earmarked for the sports complex was leased to private installations, notably a restaurant and a [[drive-in cinema]].&lt;ref name=reserva&gt;[http://www.porlareserva.org.ar/CiudadDeportivaHistoria.htm Historia de la Ciudad Deportiva] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419030532/http://www.porlareserva.org.ar/CiudadDeportivaHistoria.htm |date=2010-04-19 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These setbacks were accompanied by a dearth in new titles for the team lasting from 1971 to 1975. The hiring of [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] as head coach, however, helped revert the rut, and a national title in 1976 was followed by the team's first international title, the 1977 [[Copa Intercontinental]]. This was followed by [[Copa Libertadores de América]] titles in 1977 and 1978.&lt;ref name=informe/&gt;

The Ciudad Deportiva project continued to burden the team's finances, and in 1979, Mayor [[Osvaldo Cacciatore]] declared Boca Juniors to be in non-compliance with the 1965 deed. Following negotiations, the mayor relieved the team from nearly all further construction obligations, and in 1980 Armando retired.&lt;ref name=reserva/&gt;

His successor, Martín Noel, stopped all new construction on the project, and the rapid deterioration in the team's finances after 1981 ultimately led [[Antonio Alegre]], the team president elected in 1985, to sell the land as a means of rescuing Boca Juniors from [[bankruptcy]]. Armando, who objected to the sale, challenged Alegre in a December 1986 team election, losing narrowly; he died on December 28, 1988.&lt;ref name=negocio&gt;[http://nacionalypopular.com/2007/01/07/torneo-de-verano-alberto-j-armando-vio-el-negocio-en-1968/ Torneo de verano: Alberto J.

[[Mauricio Macri]], who was elected president of the club in 1995, and whose father was Armando's erstwhile business partner (Francisco Macri), renamed La Bombonera (officially known as the "Camilo Cichero" Stadium until then) in honor of former club president Alberto J.

[[File:Archibald Constable.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of Archibald Constable published in ''A History of Booksellers, the Old and the New''.]]
'''Archibald David Constable''' (24 February 1774 – 21 July 1827) was a Scottish publisher, bookseller and stationer.

==Life==
Constable was born at [[Carnbee Parish, Scotland|Carnbee]], [[Fife]], son of the land steward to the [[Earl of Kellie]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

In 1788 Archibald was apprenticed to Peter Hill, an [[Edinburgh]] bookseller, but in 1795 he started in business for himself as a dealer in rare books. He bought the ''Scots Magazine'' in 1801, and [[John Leyden]], the orientalist, became its editor. In 1800 Constable began the ''Farmer's Magazine'', and in November 1802 he issued the first number of the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'', under the nominal editorship of [[Sydney Smith]]; Lord Jeffrey, was, however, the guiding spirit of the review, having as his associates [[Henry Peter Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]], Sir [[Walter Scott]], [[Henry Hallam]], [[John Playfair]] and afterwards [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

Constable made a new departure in publishing by the generosity of his terms to authors. Writers for the ''Edinburgh Review'' were paid at an unprecedented rate, and Constable offered Scott 1000 guineas in advance for ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]''. In 1804 [[A. G. Hunter]] joined Constable as partner, bringing considerable capital into the firm, styled from that time Archibald Constable &amp; Co. In 1805, jointly with [[Longman &amp; Co.]], Constable published Scott's ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel|Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'', and in 1807 ''Marmion''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

In 1808 a split took place between Constable and Sir Walter Scott, who transferred his business to the publishing firm of [[John Ballantyne (publisher)|John Ballantyne]] &amp; Co., for which he supplied most of the capital. In 1813, however, a reconciliation took place. Ballantyne was in difficulties, and Constable again became Scott's publisher, a condition being that the firm of John Ballantyne &amp; Co. should be wound up at an early date, though Scott retained his interest in the printing business of James Ballantyne &amp; Co.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

In 1808 he served as Moderator of the High Constables of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;List of Moderators of the High Constables of Edonburgh, Edinburgh City Chambers&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 Constable, who had admitted [[Robert Cathcart]] and [[Robert Cadell]] as partners on Hunter's retirement, purchased the [[copyright]] of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', adding the supplement (6 vols, 1816-1824) to the 4th, 5th and 6th editions. In 1814 he bought the copyright of ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]''. This was issued anonymously; but in a short time 12,000&lt;!--Gutenburg edition states 12,200 but the internet archive OCR and the different Wikisource OCR indicate that it is 12,000--&gt;  copies were disposed of, Scott's other novels following in quick succession.  The firm also published the ''Annual Register''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

Through over-speculation, complications arose, and in 1826 a crash came. Constable's London agents stopped payment, and he failed for over £250,000, while James Ballantyne &amp; Co. also went bankrupt for nearly £90,000. [[Sir Walter Scott]] was affected by the failure of both firms.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

Constable started business afresh, and began in 1827 ''[[Constable's Miscellany of Original and Selected Works]]'' consisting of a series of original works, and of standard books republished in a cheap form, thus making one of the earliest and most famous attempts to popularize high-quality literature. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}}

[[File:Grave of Archibald Constable, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Constable's grave in the [[Old Calton Burying Ground]] in Edinburgh]]
Constable died at home, 3 Park Place&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office directory 1827&lt;/ref&gt; in Edinburgh, on 21 July 1827,&lt;ref&gt;''Archibald Constable and his Literary Correspondents'', by his son Thomas Constable (3 vols., 1873). This book contains numerous contemporary notices of Archibald Constable, and vindicates him from the exaggeration of J. G. Lockhart and others {{harv|Chisholm|1911|p=982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but his firm survived,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=981}} and the Constable publishing business continued in the twentieth century, issuing a wide range of fiction and non-fiction books. It continues today as [[Constable &amp; Robinson]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Park Place was a small square north of [[George Square, Edinburgh|Geoge Square]] which was demolished later in the 19th century to build the new medical buildings for [[Edinburgh University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://maps.nls.uk/view/74415500&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Constable was married to Mary Willison. They lived in Craigcrook House in western Edinburgh.{{sfn|Waterston|Shearer|2010|p=200}}

Their son, [[Thomas Constable]] [[FRSE]] (1812-1881) took over his printing business on his father's death. In 1839 he was appointed printer and publisher in Edinburgh to [[Queen Victoria]], and issued, among other notable series, ''Constable's Educational Series'', and ''Constable's Foreign Miscellany''. In 1865 his son Archibald David Constable (died 1915) became a partner, and when Thomas retired in 1893 the firm continued under the name of T. &amp; A. Constable.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=982}}{{sfn|Waterston|Shearer|2010|pp=199–200}}

Thomas married Lucia Anne Cowan, daughter of [[Alexander Cowan]] paper-maker (who clearly would have had business links with a major publishing firm such as Constables).&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of National Biography: Thomas Constable&lt;/ref&gt; They lived at 11 Thistle Street in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's First New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S008045680002648X|title=List of the Ordinary Fellows of the Society|date=1 January 1870|publisher=|volume=26|issue=01|pages=xi–xiii|via=Cambridge Journals Online|doi=10.1017/S008045680002648X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son was also Archibald David Constable [[FRSE]] LLD (1843-1915), named after his grandfather, and followed in the family tradition as a printer.

His daughter, Elizabeth Constable (d.1818) married his junior publishing partner, [[Robert Cadell]] of [[Ratho]].&lt;ref&gt;Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''asset-protection trust''' is any form of trust which provides for funds to be held on a [[discretionary trust|discretionary basis]]. Such trusts are set up in an attempt to avoid or mitigate the effects of [[taxation]], [[divorce]] and [[bankruptcy]] on the beneficiary. Such trusts are therefore frequently proscribed or limited in their effects by governments and the courts.

The asset-protection trust is a trust that splits the beneficial enjoyment of trust assets from their legal ownership. The beneficiaries of a trust are the beneficial owners of equitable interests in the trust assets, but they do not hold legal title to the assets. Thus this kind of trust fulfills the goal of [[asset protection]] planning, i.e. to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or [[tax evasion]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} A creditor's ability to satisfy a judgment against a beneficiary's interest in a trust is limited to the beneficiary's interest in such trust. Consequently, the common goal of asset protection trusts is to limit the interests of beneficiaries in such a way so as to preclude creditors from collecting against trust assets.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Such trusts must be irrevocable (a revocable trust will not provide asset protection because and to the extent of the settlor's power to revoke). Most of them contain a spendthrift clause preventing a trust beneficiary from alienating his or her expected interest in favor of a creditor. The spendthrift clause has three general exceptions to the protection afforded: the self-settled trusts (if the settlor of a trust is also a beneficiary of a trust), the case when a debtor is the sole beneficiary and the sole trustee of a trust, and the support payments (a court may order the trustee to satisfy a beneficiary's support obligation to a former spouse or minor child). The first general exception, which accounts for the majority of asset protection trusts, no longer applies in several jurisdictions. The laws of certain jurisdictions including Alaska, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands allow self-settled trusts to afford their settlors the protection of the spendthrift clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1163&amp;context=alr|first=Jeremy M.|last=Veit|title=Self-Settled Spendthrift Trusts and the Alaska Trust Act: Has Alaska Moved Offshore?|journal=Alaska Law Review|volume=16|issue=2|page=269}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of trusts==
{{main|Trust law}}

Trusts were developed at common law in England originally to minimize the impact of inheritance taxes arising from transfers at death.  The essence of the trust was to separate "legal" title, which was given to someone to hold as "trustee", from "equitable title", which was to be retained by the trust beneficiaries.

In the United States and England, a practice developed whereby trust [[settlor]]s began to use "[[Spendthrift trust|spendthrift]]" clauses to prevent trust beneficiaries from alienating their beneficial interests to creditors.  Over time, courts were asked to determine the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against the trust beneficiaries seeking to engage in such assignments, and the creditors of those beneficiaries seeking to reach trust assets. A case law doctrine developed whereby courts may generally recognize the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against trust beneficiaries and their creditors, but not against creditors of a settlor.

==Domestic asset protection trust==

Alaska was the first US jurisdiction to enact laws allowing protection for self-settled trusts (in 1997) and was shortly followed by Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and a few others. These trusts are known as ''Domestic Asset Protection Trusts'' (DAPTs). Usually, a DAPT must comply with the following requirements:
* the trust must be irrevocable and spendthrift;
* at least one resident trustee must be appointed;
* some administration of the trust must be conducted in respective state;
* the settlor cannot act as a trustee.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Trusts are generally governed by the laws of the jurisdiction that is designated by the settlor as the governing jurisdiction. There are two exceptions to the general rule, which may create conflicts of law: (i) states will not recognize laws of sister states that violate their own public policy, and (ii) if the trust owns real property, such property will be governed by the law of jurisdiction that is the property's situs. Additionally, the [[Full Faith and Credit clause]] of the Constitution provides that each state must give full faith and credit to the laws of every other state. This means that if a court from another state refuses to recognize the protection of a DAPT and enters a judgment for the creditor, the creditor may be able to enforce the judgment against the trustee of the DAPT, even if that trustee was located in the DAPT jurisdiction. The efficacy of a DAPT may also be challenged under the Supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, under the applicable [[fraudulent conveyance|fraudulent transfer]] statute, or because the settlor retained some prohibited control over the trust.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

These jurisdictions are also known as ''United States Asset Protection Trusts'' (USAPTs), from the point of view of the non-US settlors. The issues that would seem to apply on a USAPT established by a non-US settlor are: 1) whether a non-US court has jurisdiction over the USAPT; 2) the conflict of US versus non-US laws (i.e., which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the trust and the protection it purports to offer); 3) which fraudulent transfer law would apply; and 4) whether the US state court will recognize the non-US judgment.&lt;ref name="USAPT"&gt;{{cite web|title=The United States As An Offshore Asset Protection Trust Jurisdiction – The World’s Best Kept Secret |author=Alexander A. Bove, Jr. |publisher=Trusts &amp; Trustees, Vol. 14 Issue 1 (Oxford Journals, 2008) |url=http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708085701/http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context of a non-US settlor has a few advantages over that of a US settlor. The issue of the Full Faith and Credit clause doctrine of the US Constitution would not apply to a non-US settlor facing a non-US judgment. Creditors of non-US settlors would have to first obtain a judgment in their home jurisdiction and then attempt to enforce that "foreign" judgment in the US against the trustee of the USAPT, who was not a party to the original action. Therefore, except in unusual cases, this would mean that the only issues to litigate would be whether a fraudulent transfer has taken place, and in turn, which jurisdiction's fraudulent transfer laws would apply. Despite that, the non-US creditor must still seek to first have the foreign judgment recognized, because without formal legal acknowledgment of the judgment in the US court, there would be no basis on which to question the transfer.&lt;ref name="USAPT"/&gt;

==U.S. jurisdictions==

===South Dakota===

South Dakota was one of the first states (1983) to allow a trust to endure perpetually, essentially jumping outside the onerous federal transfer (gift, estate and generation-skipping) tax system theoretically forever. Currently, twenty-four other states have joined the ranks of offering a long-term trust. Nineteen of these states, including South Dakota, allow a trust to continue in perpetuity.

South Dakota does not impose any form of state taxation on the assets that comprise a trust located there. This includes, but is not limited to: no state income, capital gains, dividend/interest and/or intangible's taxes. Additionally, South Dakota has the lowest insurance premium tax of any state (i.e., 8 basis points or 8/100ths of 1%) and also offers other very favorable insurance legislation. South Dakota also has both excellent self-settled trust as well as third party discretionary trust statutes, both allowing for domestic asset protection planning with trusts.

South Dakota is the first and only state in the US with a third party discretionary trust statute for asset protection, which states that a discretionary interest in third party trust, limited power of appointments, and remainder interests are not considered property interests. This statute is extremely important to properly asset protect trusts set up to benefit one's family. South Dakota also has some of the top-rated Asset Protection statutes for LLCs and LPs based upon a powerful "sole remedy charging order statute". Consequently, most of the unique and creative trust strategies for the wealthy involve trust administration in South Dakota without the necessity of having the trust's family reside there.

==Offshore jurisdictions==

The trust laws of the offshore world are typically founded on the trust laws of the onshore world. For those jurisdictions which are currently possessions of the UK, or were former possessions of the UK, typically the UK Trustee Act of 1925 is the common starting point. From there, each jurisdiction has sought to develop and evolve the law in a race to develop the most attractive trust environment which maintains acceptable standards, preserves the concepts of a trust, yet is attractive to potential users. Many of these jurisdictions share similar characteristics.

===Bahamas===

The Commonwealth of the Bahamas have traditionally been associated with offshore planning.  However, the Bahamas are probably more noteworthy for offshore banking.  The Bahamas do not recognize self-settled spendthrift trusts, unlike the Cook Islands, Nevis, or Belize.

The burden of proof for a claimant to challenge a transfer into a Bahamian Trust has a limitation period of two years, the same as Cook Islands.

The quality of the banking and investment services is reasonable for the uses of a Trustee of an asset protection trust, however, the quality of the judiciary is considered low, as the legal profession is generally closed to the entry of non-Bahamians, and it is therefore difficult bring the knowledge of a specialised trust lawyer to the jurisdiction when needed.

===Belize===

[[Belize]], offers immediate protection from court action initiated by creditors which challenges the settlor's transfer of property into the trust.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, due to the paucity of credible offshore banks in Belize, many trusts established in Belize hold assets with a second trustee or third-party financial institution in another country.

===Bermuda===

[[Bermuda]], entry to follow

===Cayman Islands===

[[Cayman Islands]] trusts are governed principally by the Cayman Islands Trusts Law (2009 Revision), however elements of the Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989 are relevant when considering the asset protection benefits of Cayman Trusts.

A number of offshore jurisdictions have enacted modern asset protection legislation based on the Cayman Island's Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989 (the "FDL").&lt;ref&gt;Cayman Islands Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Cayman Islands FDL states "Every disposition of property made with an intention to defraud, and at undervalue, shall be voidable at the insistence of an eligible creditor thereby prejudiced".&lt;ref&gt;STEP Diploma in International Trust Management Course Notes Module 11&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of proof is borne by the creditor applying to set aside the trust, and in the case of the Cayman Islands, the creditor/claimant must bring an action in the Cayman Islands courts (not in their home jurisdiction). The bar is set high for a potential claimant to successfully challenge a transfer. They must demonstrate an intention to defraud on behalf of the Settlor, and they must demonstrate they are an "eligible creditor" - meaning that at the date of the transfer, the transferor owes an obligation to the claimant. They must also be willing to bring an action in the Cayman Islands, which by itself is an expensive proposition.

The burden of proof for a claimant to challenge a transfer into a Cayman Trust has a limitation period of six years.

In Cayman it is possible to register a trust as an Exempt Trust &lt;ref&gt;Cayman Trusts Law (2009 Revision - Part VI - Section 74(1))&lt;/ref&gt; however it is voluntary registration regime only, so most trusts remain unregistered. As most Cayman trusts are therefore private arrangements, it is hard to give exact figures for the popularity of AP Trusts governed by Cayman law. However the number of licensed trust companies give us some indication of how the jurisdiction is viewed. As of 30 September 2012 the Fiduciary Services Division of CIMA, the body responsible for licensing and regulating trust companies in the Cayman Islands has supervisory responsibility for 146 active trust licences.&lt;ref&gt;CIMA website: http://www.cimoney.com.ky/Stats_Reg_Ent/stats_reg_ent.aspx?id=298&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Dependent Territory, the quality of the judiciary is considered excellent, with the islands able to draw on the services of UK lawyers and solicitors when contentious cases arise and expert lawyers with appropriate experience are required. The quality of banking and investment services are reasonably good.

===Cook Islands===

The Cook Islands claims to be the first country to have enacted an explicit asset protection law, implementing particular provisions in 1989 to its International Trusts Act.&lt;ref name="Howard Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Jurisdictions: Cook Islands|url=http://protectyou.com/1996/01/review-of-offshore-jurisdictions-part-1/|publisher=The Asset Protection News|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these changes have been adopted in one form or another in several other countries and a handful of a U.S. states.  The most important of these changes permits the settlor of a trust to be named as a spendthrift beneficiary.

The trust laws of the Cook Islands provide a shortened statute of limitations on fraudulent transfer claims.  While most U.S. states have a four-year statute of limitations (and the Statute of Elizabeth in some common law jurisdictions has no statute of limitations), the general statute of limitations in the Cook Islands is reduced to two years for fraudulent transfers; in certain circumstances, it may be as short as one year.  If the trust is funded while the settlor is solvent, then the transfer cannot be challenged.(i.e., there is no time period for the creditor to challenge the transfer)&lt;ref name="Howard Rosen"/&gt;

Several provisions of the Cook Islands law specify the form of pleading that a creditor must establish in order for its claim to be heard in a Cook Islands court.  The effect of these provisions is to raise the burden of proof to "beyond a reasonable doubt," something akin to a criminal law standard, in order for a creditor to establish a fraudulent transfer.  The "constructive" fraudulent transfer theories are eliminated under Cook Islands law, requiring the creditor to prove that the transfer was made with specific intent to avoid the creditor's claim.

It is believed that the Cook Islands now has more registered asset protection trusts than any other country, although it should be noted that in most jurisdictions a Trust is considered a private arrangement and it is not a requirement to register a Trust.  Case law is somewhat lacking in the Cook Islands. However, some landmark decisions show that the Cook Islands Court intends to uphold the asset protection trust law.  In 1999, the Federal Trade Commission attempted to recover assets from a Cook Islands Trust.&lt;ref name="protectyou.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Titling Assets: Pitfalls to be Avoided - Part I|url=http://protectyou.com/2007/06/titling-assets-pitfalls-to-avoid/|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suit filed by the FTC against a trust company was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="protectyou.com"/&gt; The quality of the judiciary and the associated banking and investment services offered from the Cook Islands are considered poor.

===Nevis===

Nevis was one of the first countries to follow the Cook Islands, duplicating an older version of the Cook Islands law and naming it the Nevis International Exempt Trust Ordinance, 1994.  One distinguishing feature of the Nevis legislation is that a creditor must post a bond of ECB 25,000 (roughly USD 13,000) to lodge a complaint against a trust registered in Nevis.

Very little case law exists in Nevis, which many attorneys interpret to mean that creditors are effectively deterred from bringing suit in Nevis.  It has a small offshore banking industry, with St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Bank and Bank of Nevis International as the only licensed offshore banks.

LLC legislation modeled after the Delaware LLC Act was passed in 1996.  This has enabled Nevis to distinguish itself as a primary offshore jurisdiction for LLC formations, as opposed to other countries that are well known for IBC formations (British Virgin Islands) or trust formations (Cayman Islands).  A Nevis LLC is often used in conjunction with an asset protection trust because it gives the creator of the trust direct control over the assets if the creator is listed as the manager of the Nevis LLC.  This gives the creator added security in that it keeps the assets one step removed from the trustee of the asset protection trust.  Because the managers and members of a Nevis LLC are not public information, the creator of the trust is able to assume control over the assets without disclosing his control on any public records.

===Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey)===

The Channel Islands have been long regarded as being the first jurisdictions to develop an offshore finance industry, each is often regarded as being one of the best quality jurisdictions to use.  Fully compliant with anti money laundering laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bedellgroup.com/siteFiles/resources/docs/insights/Briefings/Money%20Laundering%20-%20Jersey%20Briefings/TheAnti-MoneyLaunderingRegime-AJerseyOverview.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208054208/https://www.bedellgroup.com/siteFiles/resources/docs/insights/Briefings/Money%20Laundering%20-%20Jersey%20Briefings/TheAnti-MoneyLaunderingRegime-AJerseyOverview.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-12-08 |title=The Anti-Money Laundering Regime: A Jersey Overview |publisher=Bedell Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; sharing taxation information with an increasing number of countries, modern case law indicate that creditors, who have a rightful claim, are able to freeze trust assets in the Channel Islands.  Tax law initiatives in the UK have largely eliminated the tax advantages of UK citizens placing assets in trust in the Channel Islands, which in the early years had been a source of business.  While the Channel Islands enjoys a modern banking sector, most attorneys do not regard the Channel Islands as appropriate for asset protection planning.

The judicial systems of the Channel Islands are split into two distinct Bailiwicks. The [[Bailiwick of Jersey]], and the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] (which includes the islands of Guernsey, Alderney Sark, and Herm). The legal systems in each island follows a dual system based on Norman-French codified law overlaid with elements of English common law. Whilst specialised training is required in order to practice law in each of the Bailiwicks, the Bar is not open to everyone, the quality of the judiciary is generally considered very good, if not very expensive. Regulation of Fiduciary companies and the related banking and investment services offered in the Channel Islands is also considered good to excellent.

===Switzerland and Liechtenstein===

Switzerland and Liechtenstein are noteworthy for large banking sectors and sophisticated wealth management services.  While both countries now recognize trusts (particularly trusts established under the laws of another jurisdiction, such as Nevis), there is no available case law yet which indicates how the courts of those two countries will enforce offshore asset protection trust laws.

Many attorneys establish asset protection trusts under the laws of another country and deposit the trust assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein.  One question raised by this approach is whether a creditor can seize assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein without having to bring a claim in the trust-protective jurisdiction.  Again, a lack of precedent suggests that this is an open issue in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Both countries are also known for offering asset protection annuities, with a six-month statute of limitations on fraudulent transfers into an annuity.  Unfortunately for most Americans, these annuities cannot invest in US securities without punitive taxation due to the offshore status of the insurance carriers that offer these annuity products.  Furthermore, many lawyers peddling these annuity products to their clients collect commissions from the insurance carriers.  These reasons, among others, may help explain why annuities offered in these two countries are not particularly popular with U.S. persons.  This does not mean that taxpayers of other jurisdictions may not significantly benefit from holding a Swiss or Liechtenstein annuity.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to: How [http://www.swissannuity.ch Asset protection with Swiss/Liechtenstein annuity works]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, U.S. persons may benefit from holding an annuity issued by a carrier in an asset-protective jurisdiction (such as the Cook Islands), particularly if the carrier is an electing 953(d) carrier (a reference to a provision of US tax law).&lt;ref&gt;See Section 953(d) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

Whether such a trust is a [[spendthrift trust]] on the U.S. model, a [[protective trust]] on the Commonwealth model or another form of discretionary trust, it is more likely to be subject to challenge under the [[common law]] doctrine of sham or under specific statutory provisions if any person setting up the trust (or their spouse and their spouse in turn as in a [[reciprocal trust]]):
*can benefit under its provisions;
*is the person under risk financially;
*benefits (whether permitted or not) from the trust; or
*if the person setting up the trust is at risk financially, if bankruptcy or divorce occurs soon after the establishment of the trust ([[fraudulent conveyance]]).

[[Offshore trust]]s and other asset protection vehicles typically do not prevent action against the individual concerned in his or her home country. Orders under divorce and creditor protection laws can typically be made against that individual notwithstanding the alleged independence of such trustees. If a judge determines that the trust settlor controls the assets of the offshore trust, the judge may order the settlor to repatriate the trust assets.  Failure to comply with the court's order may lead to a finding of contempt of court and imprisonment.  For this reason, a properly established asset protection trust should provide a clear separation between the settlor and those who exercise control over the trust assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Importance of Proper APT Design &amp; Counsel|url=http://www.protectyou.com/newsletters/apn7-2.htm|publisher=The Asset Protection News|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US v. Grant ===
The most recent case to rule on the merits of a contempt order is ''US v. Grant''.  In 2005, a federal district court in Miami ordered a domestic protector of an offshore asset protection trust, under threat of contempt, to exercise her power to replace the foreign trustee with a domestic trustee chosen by the court. The ruling, ''U.S. v. Grant'' Case No. 00-08986-Civ-Jordan (D.C. So. Fla. 2005), threatened to draw into question the viability of an asset-protection trust if a domestic protector could be compelled to appoint a domestic trustee to marshal the assets and bring them within the purview of the domestic court proceedings.

In May 2008, the U.S. government sought to hold the domestic protector in contempt of court for failing to secure the cooperation of the foreign trustee to resign and repatriate the trust assets. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled against the government, finding that the domestic protector could not be held in contempt for failure to gain the cooperation of the offshore trustee. In denying the government's contempt motion, the judge observed:

"I understand that it has been more than two years since the repatriation order was issued and that the funds had not yet been repatriated. But this failure is not for a lack of effort. I am reluctant to fault Mrs. Grant for her trustees' denial of her requests to repatriate the funds." ''U.S. v. Grant'', 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51332, 101 A.F. T.R.2d (RIA) 2676 (D.C. So. Fla. 2008).

For years, lawyers have vigorously debated the vulnerability of an asset protection trust with a domestic protector. The Grant case stands for the proposition that no vulnerability exists if the domestic protector complies with the court's orders. While a domestic protector may be required to make an effort to repatriate trust assets, failure to achieve repatriation should not entail any dire consequences to the trust or to the domestic protector. As long as a duress clause permits the foreign trustee to ignore the pleas of a domestic protector acting under threat of a contempt order, the selection of a domestic protector should not jeopardize the integrity of the offshore asset protection trust.

While most attorneys draft trust agreements to limit the domestic protector's powers to those of a negative nature (i.e., the domestic protector may veto trustee decisions, but a domestic protector cannot order a trustee to do anything), the ruling in ''Grant'' implies that even positive powers exercisable by a domestic protector may not jeopardize an offshore asset protection trust containing a duress clause. Whether this leads attorneys to be more cavalier in their trust drafting remains to be seen. At least we know that traditional offshore asset protection trust planning works as anticipated.

== Taxation ==

There are rigorous US tax reporting requirements that apply to taxpayers who establish offshore trusts.  While no additional tax is usually imposed, certain forms of asset protection trusts require full disclosure of all trust assets and activities on the U.S. contributor's tax returns.  Confidentiality is usually not enjoyed under these arrangements.

Most asset protection trusts established by U.S. settlors are considered "grantor trusts" under U.S. income tax law, meaning that all income of the trust is reportable on the grantor's (i.e., the settlor's) individual income tax return.  Asset-protection trusts do not, in and of themselves, offer any tax advantages under U.S. income tax law.

The '''Australian Logistics Council''' (ALC) is an [[industry association]] for the [[freight transport]] and [[supply chain]] logistics industry in Australia. ALC members span the entire supply chain, including the road, rail, sea and [[air freight]] sectors.

ALC supports appropriate national regulation and infrastructure to ensure Australia enjoys the full benefits of freight transport and logistics policy development and reform. It focuses its advocacy efforts on practical measures that will boost productivity, increase efficiency and improve safety in the freight logistics industry.&lt;ref&gt;ALC Strategic Plan 2011-2013 - http://austlogistics.com.au/about-us/alc-strategic-plan/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board and Governance==
ALC is governed by a Board which comprises senior executives from ALC member organisations.&lt;ref&gt;ALC Board and Governance Manual - http://austlogistics.com.au/about-us/alc-strategic-plan/&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy committees inform the development of ALC's position on key freight logistics issues.  These include an [[infrastructure]] policy committee, regulation policy committee and safety policy committee.  ALC has also established a number of working groups involving industry to progress issues of importance to the freight logistics industry.

ALC is based in [[Canberra]] at the [[National Press Club (Australia)|National Press Club]].

==ALC Safety Codes==
ALC has established a National Logistics Safety Code (NLSC) which clearly sets out all participants' responsibilities when they control or influence the movement of freight in the supply chain. There are three signatories to the NLSC - the Retail Logistics Supply Chain Code of Practice (RLSC), the Steel Code and the Coal Seam Gas Logistics Safety Code.

==ALC Events==
ALC holds an annual forum to discuss the critical issues facing the freight transport and logistics industry. Held annually, this two-day event involves 300 senior leaders from industry and government and also includes the ALC Annual Dinner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="950">{{Unreferenced|date=November 2008}}'''Captive supply''' is a term for that part of the supply that is not owned by a [[company]] but is used by the company to maximize its own [[Profit (economics)|profits]] often at the unknowing expense of those who actually own those supplies. This is usually a characteristic of a market that is dominated by one firm or a few firms and implicit collusion between those firms.  Often captive supply is called a beneficial market agreement by those controlling the supply but the actions of those controlling that supply reveal otherwise.  Captive supply is used to subvert the natural forces of market price determination to accrue more economic benefits to those who control it.  It circumvents the typically price-moderating [[market force]] of [[supply and demand]] by artificially restricting the supply. Example: American Bar Association Over Legal Industry.

A '''continuing education unit''' ('''CEU''') or '''continuing education credit''' ('''CEC''') is a measure used in [[continuing education]] programs to assist the professional to maintain his or her license in their profession.  Continuing education or professional development is required in many fields, including teachers, insurance professionals, interior designers/interior architects, lighting designers, architects, engineers, [[Emergency management|emergency management professionals]], school administrators, educators, nurses, mental health professionals, psychologists and social workers.  The continuing education unit is described as ten hours of participation in an education program.  

The term CEU is not a trademarked term; therefore, any educational institution may use it to describe their courses.  In this regard, there are no requirements for educator qualifications that are attached to each institutions courses when offering CEUs.  There have been some bodies created which are attempting to standardize and accredit institutions using the term CEU, the International Association for Continuing Education and Training being one of them; however, professions and industries usually regulate their approved continuing education within their bylaws and not one institute or accrediting body has become a standard to accept in this regard.  Professionals should always consult their Association or regulating body prior to embarking on continuing education and not assume a CEU will be accepted as part of their professional development.

Female participation and advancement in majority [[Muslim countries]], or nations in which more than 50% of the population identifies as an adherent of the Islamic faith, has traditionally been areas of controversy. Several Western nations&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, William; Joseph Hickey (2005). Society in Focus. Boston, MA: Pearson. 0-205-41365-X.&lt;/ref&gt;  such as the United States and Western Europe have criticised majority Muslim nations for the lack of involvement and opportunity for women in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/john_esposito/2010/08/why_dont_women_have_more_rights_in_muslim_countries.html|title=Millennial Christians' Top 25 Worst Fears - OnFaith|work=OnFaith|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waterandgender.net/share/img_documents/15_rep_so1.pdf.

Low levels of female labor participation, large wage gaps by gender, and few female executives in large companies in majority Muslim nations are common criticisms of these nations.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt; Accordingly, significant data has been gathered by global institutions about female workers in majority Muslim nations to test these cultural beliefs. Development economists and multinational organizations such as the [[United Nations]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Labour Organization]], have gathered significant amounts of data to study the labor contributions of and commercial opportunities for women.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ILO" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development.

==Majority Muslim nations==
{{see also|Muslim World}}

[[File:World Muslim Population (Pew Forum).svg|450px|thumb|A map of the Muslim population of the world, by percentage of each country, according to the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum]] 2009 report on world Muslim populations.]]
There are fifty-one countries in the world in which more than 50% of the population identify as Muslims.&lt;ref name = "Muslim World"&gt;"Muslim Population by Country". The Future of the Global Muslim Population. Pew Research Center. Retrieved 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These countries spread from [[North Africa]], to the [[Middle East]], to the [[Balkans]] and [[Central Asia]], to [[Southeast Asia]]. While many nations contain a strong Muslim presence, majority Muslim nations, by definition, have more Muslims as citizens than non-Muslims. Not all majority Muslim states, however, have Islam as their established religion. Turkey, for example, is a prominent Muslim country in which 99% of the population follows some form of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no official religion. The state is secular. Nigeria is also a majority Muslim country which is officially secular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html CIA Factbook -Nigeria].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most majority Muslim nations, however, recognize Islam as the official state religion. Furthermore, many states identify a specific derivative of the Islamic faith as their official religion. For example, [[sunni]] Islam is the official state religion of: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Jordan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Somalia, and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html CIA Factbook].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shia]] Islam is the official religion of Iran, which is a theocracy. Some minority Islamic sects are official state religions as well.[[Ibadi]], a minority school within Islam, is the official religion of Oman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html CIA Factbook -Oman].&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all states in the [[Muslim World]] institutionalize a distinction between the sects of Islam. In Pakistan and Iraq, Islam as a faith, is recognized as the official religion.&lt;ref&gt;"Population: 190,291,129 (July 2012 est.)" Central Intelligence Agency. The World Factbook on Pakistan. 2012. Retrieved 2012-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt; All sects or schools are included. In Egypt, freedom of religion is extended to the [[Abrahamic religions]] even though Sunni Islam is the state-sponsored religion. Similarly, Indonesia, which is the world's largest Muslim country, guarantees freedom of religion but only recognizes six official religions. Islam is one of and the most prominent of the six. Despite a common religion, majority Muslim nations are quite disparate in terms of size, population, demographic composition, and the legal framework of religion.

A basic indicator of women's involvement in the formal economy is a statistic known as the [[labor force participation rate]]. This data point shows the percentage of women in a country who are either employed in full or part-time labor. According to the [[International Labour Organization]], the labor force participation rate is defined as "the proportion of the population ages 15 and older that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period."&lt;ref name = "ILO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/resource/subject/labourstat.htm|title=Research guides|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Table 2 lists the labor force participation rates of women in eleven majority [[Muslim]] countries. Majority Muslim countries are defined as states in which more than 50% of the population identifies with the Islamic faith.

Of these eleven countries, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Indonesia]] had the highest rates of female participation in the labor force in 2010 with 57% and 51%, respectively. [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], and [[Afghanistan]] have the lowest rates of female labor force participation among these eleven nations with 13%, 14%, and 15%, respectively. However, numerically large discrepancies exist in the data for a couple of nations when drawn from different sources. Afghanistan's female labor force participation rate, for example, was 15% in 2010 according to World Bank figures.&lt;ref name = "World Bank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/topic/gender|title=Gender|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That percentage nearly doubles to 28.9% if data from [[UNESCAP]] is cited.&lt;ref name="unescap.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescap.org/stat/data/syb2011/III-Economy/Employment.asp|title=Employment, Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific 2011|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same discrepancy is true for figures for Iran for which the World Bank lists its female participation rate at 16% in 2010 and UNESCAP lists it as 26.9%.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unescap.org"/&gt; It is unclear why these two sources give significantly different numbers as their methodology and definitions of labor force participation were similar.

[[File:Female Employment to Female Population in 11 Muslim Majority Countries.png|thumb|450px|A graph of the percentage of women in 11 Muslim majority populations who are in the labor force relative to the entire population of women in those countries.]]

=== Female-to-male workers ratio ===

Another statistic indicative of female participation in the formal economy of a country is the ratio of female to male workers. As nations develop and their economies both expand and diversify, the expansion of jobs and industries increases this ratio, pushing it toward 1, provided female workers have access to job opportunities and firms, collectively, do not systematically discriminate against female candidates.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Dwight H. 2006"/&gt;

Generally speaking, the closer the ratio is to 1, the more gender equal an economy is because neither sex has a disproportionate share of jobs. Bangladesh and Indonesia have the largest ratio of these eleven countries with scores of 0.73 and 0.61, respectively. [[Nigeria]] also has a relatively large ratio of female to male workers of 0.51. Despite having twice the percentage of females in the actual labor force, [[Turkey]]'s female to male laborer ratio is far lower than Iran's, 0.35 to 0.44. Similarly, Syria's ratio is barely smaller than [[Egypt]]'s (0.27 as compared to 0.30) whereas Egypt's female population has twice the percentage size of formal economic workers as Syria's female labor force. These ratios are compiled and published by the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum"&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2012.pdf The Global Gender Gap Report 2012], World Economic Forum. By Ricardo Hausmann, Laura D. Tyson and Saadia Zahidi&lt;/ref&gt; The median annual income for female workers in the United States was $36,931 in 2010.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/womens-earnings-and-income|title=Knowledge Center|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forum did not, however, list this information for Afghanistan, Iraq, or [[Tunisia]]. It is probable that the ratios are small given the low labor force participation rate of women in these countries and high unemployment rates, but given the uncertain correlation between female labor force participation rate and the ratio of male to female workers, this cannot be stated with any certainty. One possible explanation for the seeming discrepancy is the ratio of females to males in the population. In Syria, for every woman between the ages of 15 and 65, there are 1.03 males.&lt;ref&gt;"Syria." CIA World Fact Book. Central Intelligence Agency, n.d. Web. 21 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since there are more men than women for a limited number of jobs, more men, in absolute terms, are excluded from [[informal sector|formal employment]]. Consequently, the ratio of female to male workers increases because women represent a larger percentage of those who work than they represent the entire labor force. Therefore, women would have a relatively higher ratio of female to male workers than its female labor force participation rate may suggest. The sheer size of the male component of the workforce may be sufficient to create a small ratio of female to male workers.

Similar to the ratio of female to male workers in the labor force is the percentage of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers as a percentage of the total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Dwight H. 2006"/&gt;

However, as one is a subsect of the other, the two figures generally move collinearly. Despite a lower female labor force participation rate and a smaller female to male worker ratio, Nigeria's female workers represent the largest component, in terms of percentage, of a nation's labor force when compared to the other ten countries.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/|title=Country Facts Explorer - IndexMundi|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Labour Organization]], 42.84% of the Nigerian labor force is composed of women. Bangladesh and Indonesia are a close second and third with 39.87% and 38.23%, respectively. Iraq, Syria, and Turkey's labor force's female composition rates (14.30%, 15.20%, and 28.69%, respectively) are quite close to their female labor force participation rates which suggests a population parity between men and women. This is interesting as many other Developing countries do not have population parity by gender.&lt;ref&gt;"Sex Ratio". The World Factbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female employment characteristics==
There are a variety of characteristics of female employment such as salary and employment type which are meaningful indicators of female economic participation and female economic stability. These indicators help clarify the economic status women hold in some majority Muslim nations and the permanence of their involvement in the economy. In development economics, great emphasis has been placed on salaried work because it provides a stable source of income.&lt;ref name="Perkins, Dwight H. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chen"&gt;Chen, Martha, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz, Renana Jhabvala, and Christine Bonner. Women, Work, and Poverty. Rep. New York: United Nations Development Fund for Women, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salaried work===

''Salaried worker'', as defined by the [[International Labour Organization]], are "workers who hold the type of jobs defined as 'paid employment job' where the incumbents hold explicit (written or oral), or implicit employment contracts that give them a basic remuneration that is not directly dependent upon the revenue of the unit for which they work."&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Fundamentally, salaried workers are more likely to be full-time or, even permanent workers.&lt;ref name = "Chen" /&gt; Thus, they are staples of the formal market whereas non-salaried workers are more or less on the fringe of economic activity which relegates them to limited participation in the formal market.&lt;ref name = "Chen" /&gt;

While labor force participation rate sheds light on how many women work in the formal sectors of the economy, it says nothing about the type of work or the stable presence of women in the labor force. Countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia, when female labor force participation rate or the ratio of male to female workers or similar indicators are considered, appear to have substantial female involvement in their economies. However, very few of the women in these nations have salaried work which means they may go through cycles of short periods of work punctuated by long periods of unemployment. Alternatively, these women may be shuffled from task to task for different employers and never develop a stable basis at a particular firm or within a particular field.

In Bangladesh and Indonesia, two majority Muslim countries with high female labor force participation rates, 11.70% and 31.70% of female workers are salaried, respectively.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Perhaps counter intuitively, majority Muslim countries such as Egypt, Iran, Syria, and Tunisia which have low rates of female labor force participation and a relatively small number of actual female laborers have high rates of female salaried employees. In Egypt, 47.9% of employed females have salaried jobs.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

In Iran, 46.8% of female workers are salaried and in Tunisia the percentage is 69.1%. Perhaps the most surprising case is Syria where 74.30% of women are salaried.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; This is the largest percentage in the Middle East and one of the highest in the entire Muslim world.

It is unclear why several nations with few female workers have such a high percentage of salaried women. One possible explanation is that so few women are active in the labor market because the demand for female employment is restricted to a few higher-paying, low-labor-intensive industries. If only a few women are needed but they need to have above-average skills, then these laborers' marginal value may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages. This information has not been provided by the ILO for Iraq, Saudi Arabia, or Afghanistan.

===Employers, employees, self-employed===
'''Employees and self-employed'''

Women's role in the economy as employees, employers, or as self-employed labor units is another important characteristic of female labor force participation. In patriarchal societies or rigid(high degree of difficulty for workers to move between industries)  labor markets, women are more likely to be employees than employers because they do not have the resources, skills, networks, or opportunities to either be promoted within a firm or to be owners of small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).&lt;ref&gt;Bernasek, Alexandra.

There are, however, dozens of reasons why women may be employees, employers, or self-employed that reach beyond basic macroeconomic forces or social norms and conventions. According to the ILO, more than half, 53% of all female workers in Iran are self-employed. In Egypt, slightly fewer women are self-employed than are in Iran. Fifty-two percent of Egyptian female workers have their own business ventures. Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia have the highest rates of female self-employment with 86.7%, 77.9%, and 68.3%, respectively.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Very few women are involved in the formal labor market in Pakistan but more than three fourths of them are self-employed. Nearly half of working women in Turkey are self-employers with 49% of female workers operating their own private enterprise or services.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Female economic activity and participation is widely distributed across the Muslim world.

==== Female employers ====

The female labor force participation rate, the ratio of female workers to male workers, the wage security of women, and other elements of formal economic activity cover a large interval across predominantly Muslim nations. However, across most majority Muslim nations, there is a sharp convergence on female employers. With the exception of Turkey, hardly any women are employers in many majority Muslim nations.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

In Turkey, 48% of female workers are employers. This statistic suggests that Turkish women hire at least one additional worker for their self-employed commercial enterprises considering that self-employment is the most common form of employment among this demographic group. The second largest percentage of female employers as a percentage of female workers is 3% in Egypt. In Indonesia where 68% of women are self-employed and 38% of the labor force is composed of women, only 1% of these individuals are employers.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

One tenth of one percent of female workers in Bangladesh are employers despite the nation's sizable female labor pool. This number is one eighth of the percentage of Syrian women who are employers. Syria has, of course, only one eighth the population of Bangladesh. In majority Muslim countries, very few women and a small percentage of women who do work are employers.

==== Limited economic opportunities ====

Such high rates of self-employment and low rates of females as employers suggest that the economies of Muslim nations provide few formal opportunities for females to work in the private sector. Furthermore, it suggests that even fewer women have the ability to advance within their organization when they do earn work with an established business. High rates of self-employment can be indicative of a gender biased economic system but it can also simply indicate a poorly developed system.

The wide gap between male and female labor force participation rates and ratios, and the gap between male and female employers is indicative of gender inequality within the private sector of majority Muslim countries. However, numerous reasons may account for these outcomes such as weak education infrastructure for women, low levels of economic development, or simply capital-intensive resource development. The latter characteristic is probably given how many majority Muslim nations are net oil exporters.&lt;ref&gt; Note, however, that a direct test of this hypothesis by Korotayev et al. has yielded negative results ([https://www.academia.edu/9919252/Female_Labor_Force_Participation_Rate_Islam_and_Arab_Culture_in_Cross-Cultural_Perspective Korotayev, A. V., Issaev, L. M., &amp; Shishkina, A. R. (2015). Female Labor Force Participation Rate, Islam, and Arab Culture in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Cross-Cultural Research, 49(1), 3-19].). &lt;/ref&gt;

===Female unemployment===

Unemployment rates among women in majority Muslim countries are high.&lt;ref&gt;Global Employment Trend 2011. Rep. Geneva: International Labour Organization, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; When aggregated by region, North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, the three regions with the most and highest density of Muslims in the world, have the highest rates of female unemployment in the world.&lt;ref name = "Seager"&gt;Seager, Joni. "The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World: Completely Revised and Updated (Reference) [Paperback]." The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World: Completely Revised and Updated (Reference): Joni Seager: 9780142002414: Amazon.com: Books. N.p., n.d. Web. 01 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In North Africa, 17% of females are unemployed and 16% of women in the Middle East are unemployed.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt;

In both these regions, male unemployment was only 10%. Only Sub-Saharan Africa had a male unemployment rate as high as 10%.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt; Seven percent of women are unemployed in Southeast Asia as compared to 6% of men. South Asia, which contains a few majority Muslim nations such as Bangladesh, has a higher female unemployment rate, 6%, than a male unemployment rate which is 5%. However, non-Muslim regions of the world also demonstrate disproportional employment figures. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the female unemployment rate was 11% in 2006 while the male unemployment rate was only 7%.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt;

In the European Union and other Developed countries such as the United States, female unemployment is higher than male unemployment. In 2006, Seven percent of women in the Developed World were unemployed as compared to 6% of men. Both rates have increased dramatically since the Great Recession but more women are still unemployed than men in these countries.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Data demonstrates that a greater proportion of women are unemployed relative to men in majority Muslim countries but that trend is true of several non-Muslim majority regions as well.

[[File:Shows the female unemployment rate in eleven majority Muslim countries from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s.png|450px|thumb]]

Structural unemployment in Muslim countries seems to be high for women and economic opportunities are limited. Possible explanations for this phenomenon could the same determinants of high self-employment among females and low rates of female employers: low levels of economic development, gendered employment social norms, or capital-intensive industry. This last explanation may be particularly salient in the oil-rich Muslim nations because petroleum exports are capital-intensive and require very high skilled labor which most Muslim women are incapable of providing given low levels of education. The Great Recession has increased unemployment across the board in many Muslim nations and female workers were not left unaffected. According to the World Bank, in 2009, 22.9% of women were unemployed in Egypt.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt;

In Syria in 2010, 22.5% of women were unemployed.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; This figure has probably increased significantly due to the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh all had female unemployment levels below 10% which is similar to female unemployment rates in many Developed countries such as the United States. Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Iran all have female unemployment rates ranging from 15% to 17%.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Female unemployment in Iran may be exacerbated by the collateral effects US, UN, and European sanctions. To what extent this is true is uncertain.

Turkey has a moderate level of female unemployment relative to other Muslim countries. In 2008, 11.6% of women were unemployed.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; By 2010, this number crept up to 13.0%. However, long-term employment is a significant portion of female unemployment. In 2010, according to World Bank statistics, 37% of all unemployed women were long-run unemployed workers, or workers who have been out of work for more than one year.&lt;ref name = "World Bank" /&gt; Very little data exists on the long-term unemployment rates of women for most nations and for Middle Eastern nations in particular.

==Occupations, opportunities, and wages==

===Female employment by economic sector===
In many economies, women are traditionally funneled into specific occupations or employment fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacobsen | first1 = Joyce P. | last2 = Baker | first2 = Matthew J. | author-link1 = Joyce P. Jacobsen | title = Marriage, specialization, and the gender division of labor | journal = [[Journal of Labor Economics]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 763–793 | publisher = [[Chicago University Press|Chicago Journals]] via [[JSTOR]] | doi = 10.1086/522907 | jstor = 10.1086/522907 | date = October 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/522907 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [ftp://dlib.info/opt/ReDIF/RePEc/usn/wp/usnawp1.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar trend is also present in the economies of many majority Muslim nation's economies as well. The International Labour Organization, the World Bank, and the UN divide a national economy into three broad categories: agriculture, industry, and services. Agriculture is any work which relates to the primary development of resources for nutritious consumption. According to the UN, whose definitions the ILO, World Bank, and other data collection bases use, agricultural work includes forestry, hunting, and fishing in addition to land cultivation.&lt;ref name = "UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?cl=2|title=United Nations Statistics Division - Classifications Registry: International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Rev.3 | website = unstats.un.org/unsd |publisher= [[United Nations Statistics Division]] |accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial employment is involvement in the manufacturing of products from raw materials or work for the purpose of extracting raw materials. This includes mining, quarrying, oil and gas production, construction, and public utilities.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

Services-oriented labor revolves around the provision of consumable, non-durable goods and the fulfillment of tasks by an external source for the consumer. This includes wholesale and retail trade and restaurants and hotels; transport, storage, and communications; financing, insurance, real estate, and business services; and community, social, and personal services.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; Most female laborers in Muslim majority countries work in the agriculture sector but many also work in private service jobs. Few, though some, women are employed in industrial-oriented labor.

In four of the eleven nations for which there is data, the percentage of female workers who are in the agricultural sector as compared to the percentage of female workers in the services sector. In Turkey, for example, 42% of female workers are employed in the agricultural sector and 42% work in some form of services enterprise.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Forty-nine percent of female employees work in agriculture in Egypt as compared to 46% of women who work in the services industry. Saudi Arabia is the only nation in which women play a negligible role agriculture.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Tunisian, Nigerian, and Iranian women are more evenly distributed across the economic sectors. Iranian female workers are particularly evenly distributed across all three divisions with 3 of 10 women in agriculture, 4 of 10 in services, and just over one quarter in industry. Saudi Arabian women, on the other hand, are entirely concentrated in the services industry.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

==== Agriculture ====

Employment in agriculture is lower-paying and lower-skilled than so called "white collared" jobs. Agriculture is also incredibly labor-intensive. The combination of these characteristics may explain why so many women in majority Muslim countries work in agriculture. Female workers generally have fewer skills than male workers in Developing nations. Literacy rates and school enrollment rate of females are generally low and low relative to men in developing countries of which many majority countries are.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

Accordingly, they are not hired for high skill work but they provide an abundant labor source for physical work such as agriculture. However, many majority Muslim nations, including Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, all of which have varying levels of female participation within their economies, have more than 80% of their female citizens enrolled in secondary education.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt; Nearly all of them are literate as well.&lt;ref name = "Index Mundi" /&gt;

This data somewhat undermines the traditional economic explanation of the concentration of female labor in agriculture. Regardless of the underlying reason for high female participation in agriculture, these workers earn a lower wage than their male counterparts both within this sector and relative to workers in other sectors. This may be one reason for the wide wage gap in some majority Muslim countries.

Female workers in majority Muslim nations are more concentrated in agricultural work than their counterparts in non-majority Muslim nations as well. For nations where data is available, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Iran, Indonesia, and Egypt had the highest percentage of female workers involved in agricultural labor than almost every other country.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt; In these nations, anywhere from 20-49% of farm workers were female from 1995 to 2005. Over this time period, 50%-69% of farm workers in Turkey, Syria, and Pakistan were women. Only Cambodia, Laos, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Madagascar had higher percentages of female agricultural workers.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt;

==== Services and industry ====

The services sector also employs a significant percentage of females and, possibly, for similar reasons. Service jobs such as culinary arts, retail, and administrative work, similar to agriculture, is low-skill, low-paying labor-intensive work. Many bodies are needed to complete generally basic routine tasks. Accordingly, they are more suited to women in developing countries as higher-paying jobs may require a specificity of skills beyond those of the general female laborer and in countries with gender biases.

While the percentage of women working low-skill agriculture and services work is compatible with the notion that women face limited economic opportunities in Muslim nations, data from the ILO does not support or refute that conclusion. Industrial work attracts few women which may be accounted for the physical nature of much industrial work. Furthermore, if women in majority Muslim countries are funneled into agriculture and service-oriented work due to a weak skill set, then it follows that they would not be hired for industrial work as some of it, such as smelting, requires specific vocational skills.

===Executive positions===
{{see also|Glass ceiling}}

The [[glass ceiling]] is one prevalent concern about the quality of economic opportunity available to women involved in the formal labor market. This phenomenon is the de facto limitation of females' ability to achieve the top levels of leadership in an organization. While the concept is not restricted to the market, it is prevalent in profit-based institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Toussaint, Johanne. "The Glass Ceiling." Feminism and Women's Studies (1993). Web. 22 Mar 2011.&lt; http://feminism.eserver.org/the-glass-ceiling.txt&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, David A., Joan M. Hermsen, Seth Ovadia, and Reece Vanneman (2001). The glass ceiling effect. Social Forces, Vol. 80 No. 2, pp. 655–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies-Netzley, Sally A. (1998). Women above the Glass Ceiling: Perceptions on Corporate Mobility and Strategies for Success Gender and Society, Vol. 12, No. 3, p. 340, doi:10.1177/0891243298012003006.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to female workers in majority Muslim countries, women are not evenly represented on the board of directors or among the senior management positions of most of the 100 most lucrative companies in the Arab World.&lt;ref name = "Muslim Companies"&gt;http://www.middleeastdirectory.com/top-companies-arab-world.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, for example, there is only one female senior executive among its five largest commercial enterprises. Orascom Telecom Holding Company, which is the 62nd largest company in the Muslim World&lt;ref name = "Muslim Companies" /&gt; (nations whose populations are predominantly Islamic), has one female member of its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orascomtelecom.com/about/board.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This woman, Elena Shmatova, however, is neither Egyptian nor Muslim which does not suggest opportunity for female advancement. Egypt's other largest firms by revenue, Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, Suez Canal Authority, Orascom Construction Industries, and Telekom Egypt, do not have a single female member of their board of directors or among their senior management teams.

No women occupy the top leadership positions in the most profitable Iranian businesses either.&lt;ref name="payvand.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/feb/1110.html|title=Where Are Iran's Working Women?|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's three largest companies-National Iranian Oil Company (the second largest in the Muslim World), Iran Khodro, and National Petrochemical Company-also do not have any women in senior leadership positions. This is not surprising as the 2006 Iranian census showed that only 4% of women are in senior executive or management positions.&lt;ref name="payvand.com"/&gt; Critics of Iran's radical shia theocratic government may attribute this evidence of limited female economic mobility as a critique of the government's ideology. However, in Turkey, which is a secular state governed by a moderate Islamic party, women comprised only 8% of managers in the labor force in 2007.&lt;ref name = "Seager" /&gt; Regardless of the official status of Islam or the ideology of the ruling party, there exists some evidence of a glass ceiling for women in the private sector.

Eleven of the Muslim world's largest businesses are located in Indonesia. These firms include automotive giant Astra International, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, and electric service provider Perusahaan Listrik Negara. Of these eleven firms, seven of them have at least one female member of the board of directors or a female in a senior executive management position. However, only Gudang Garam, a massive cigarette manufacturer, and Pertamina, the largest company in Indonesia, have 2 female members on the board of commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gudanggaramtbk.com/ina/directors/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pertamina.com|title=Pertamina|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pertamina is owned and operated by Japanese, not Indonesian, executives, however, and none of its female leaders are Muslim or Indonesian.

==Claims of gender inequality in the Muslim world==
Majority Muslim countries have been criticized for implementing policies which perpetuate gender inequality. Limits on the economic rights of women under the rule of law are present in several Muslim nations.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt; In Saudi Arabia, for example, women are allowed to work but their formal employment cannot interfere with her duties as a homemaker.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;International Management: Explorations Across Cultures - Page 74, Elizabeth M Christopher - 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi female workers must also travel with male companions, and they cannot work unless their husbands or guardians approve.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Claims that Islam promotes gender inequality ===

Sociologists Helen Rizzo, Abdel-Hamid Abdel-Latif, and Katherine Meyer explored cultural attitudes in majority Muslim countries subdivided by Arab and non-Arab.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo"&gt;Rizzo, Helen, Katherine Meyere, and Abdel-Hamid Abdel-Latif. "The Relationship Between Gender Equality and Democracy: A Comparison of Arab vs. Non-Arab Muslim Societies." Sociology 41 (2007): 1151-170. SAGE. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab states studied were Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Morocco, and Jordan while the non-Arab nations were Turkey, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Indonesia. To be Arab nations, states had to be members of the Arab League and recognize Arabic as the official language. Of these states, Rizzo et al. found that the Arab states were significantly less pro-gender equality and opportunity for women than the non-Arab states despite their shared Islamic faith.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These results were further supported by Korotayev et al. ([https://www.academia.edu/9919252/Female_Labor_Force_Participation_Rate_Islam_and_Arab_Culture_in_Cross-Cultural_Perspective Korotayev, A. V., Issaev, L. M., &amp; Shishkina, A. R. (2015). Female Labor Force Participation Rate, Islam, and Arab Culture in Cross-Cultural Perspective. Cross-Cultural Research, 49(1), 3-19].). &lt;/ref&gt;

However, neither group of countries was pro-gender equality in the sense that policies aimed at equal rights between the sexes are popular. In Arab countries, 82% of survey respondents believe that a man has more right to a job than a woman while 63% of respondents from the non-Arab countries felt the same way.&lt;ref name = "Rizzo" /&gt; These researchers attributed these attitudes to the strong religious identity and adherence of respondents thus implicating Islam in promoting gender inequality in majority Muslim nations.

=== Denials that Islam promotes gender inequality ===

Academic literature is mixed on this subject, however. Some scholars do not believe that gender inequality in majority Muslim states is a product of Islam. Feminist sociologist [[Valentine Moghadam]] has written extensively on gender inequality, including employment inequality, in the Muslim World.&lt;ref name = "Moghadam"&gt;Moghadam, Valentine M. "The Reproduction of Gender Inequality in Muslim Societies: A Case Study of Iran in the 1980s." World Development 19.10 (1991): 1335-349. Science Direct. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Moghadam, women are victims of clear political, economic, and social disparities in many Islamic countries which create gender distinctions within the public and private spheres. This inhibits the ability of women to participate in the government or to advance in the private sector. Moghadam specifically points to low female labor force participation across the board in Muslim states as a sign of gender inequality as do other scholars (Youseff 1978, Sivard 1985).&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt;

However, she does not believe that Islam is the root cause of gender inequality in the Muslim World because it is implemented differently in different countries, the status of women in the Muslim World is varied, and numerous other factors (state ideology, economic development, urbanization, etc.) affect gender equality. She points at that certain views which are considered by critics of Islam to be indicative of a gender-biased theology are present in other religions. Viewing women as mothers and daughters first and foremost, for example, is also a common belief among Orthodox Jews according to Moghadam.&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt;

Many cultures divide occupations along gender lines such as teaching and education administration or nursing and doctors. Why are Muslim nations singled out for holding similar gender biases as non-Muslim nations, asks Moghadam. She does state, however, that the presence of fundamentalist Islamic voices in influential positions in states such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan has helped perpetuate institutionalized gender disparities. Iran, in particular, provides little economic opportunity for women which has resulted in limited participation in the formal economy. In 1986, for example, 11 million women were not counted in the labor force because the Iranian regime deemed them to be "homemakers."&lt;ref name = "Moghadam" /&gt; Many women, particularly agricultural workers, do not receive wages frequently, which marginalizes them as economic actors.

=== Claims that Radical Islam promotes gender inequality ===

[[Ziba Mir-Hosseini]] takes a middle path on the question of Islam and gender equality as do many other theorists. Hosseieni is a visiting school at New York University Law school. Hosseini argues that the faith of Islamic and general principles promote gender equality.&lt;ref name = "Hosseini"&gt;Mir-Hosseini, Ziba. "Muslim Women’s Quest for Equality: Between Islamic Law and Feminism." Critical Inquiry 32 (2006): n. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hosseini, theocratic Islamic regimes which conflate theocracy with democracy, such as Iran or Afghanistan under the Taliban, create a tension which reinforces fundamentalist, reactionary thinking. This in turn leads to the repression of women.&lt;ref name = "Hosseini" /&gt; She argues that it is not that majority Muslim nations are intrinsically predisposed to gender inequality, it is that ultra conservative regimes are. This is also occurring in Iraq under Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]]. Hosseini points to "Islamic feminism" as proof of Islam's inherent compatibility with gender equality and a sign that Muslim states will progress toward gender equality while remaining Islamic in character.&lt;ref name = "Hosseini" /&gt; A patriarchal interpretation of Islam must be defeated, not Islam itself, argues Hosseini.

==Gender equality and the formal labor market==
{{see also| Gender inequality}}

=== Estimated earned income ===

Gender equality in the workplace is a major concern of many social activists, public officials, and academics, among others. Even in Developed Countries and wealthy democracies such as the United States there is concern of gender inequities in economic mobility for women. [[President of usa|American President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]] was passed in response to concerns among Americans that women were receiving lower wages for equal work. Wages and wage equality with men are two common indicators of gender equality and opportunity within a formal market. Higher aggregate wages indicate that females are holding more productive, valued jobs which is considered indicative of social progress. Equal pay with men demonstrates a neutrality to gender within the workplace and may suggest functional fairness between female workers  and their male counterparts. Given these two indicators, wage statistics suggest that gender equality in terms of economic participation and the quality of formal economic opportunities are not high in many predominantly Muslim nations. In 2011, the World Economic Forum gathered information about the estimated earned income of women in 135 countries. Of these countries, Syria placed 134th in terms of earned annual income for women.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

Egypt finished 126th, Iran was 130th, Pakistan was 131st, and Saudi Arabia was 132nd.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  Even countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey, which have substantially larger and higher-status female participation in their economies, placed 90th, 112th, and 121st, respectively, in terms of earned annual income for female laborers.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  Several poorer and more volatile states in Sub-Saharan Africa outperformed these nations. The estimated annual income of these women were, in terms of U.S. dollars' [[purchasing power parity]], quite low and only a fraction of their male counterparts' wages.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

[[File:Estimated Earned Annual Income of Women in 11 Majority Muslim Nations and the Female-to-Male Ratio of Workers.png|thumb|550px|The Estimated Earned Income of Women in 11 Muslim Majority Countries.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;]]

Turkey and Saudi Arabia award women the highest annual incomes when adjusted for purchasing power parity in terms of U.S. dollars. Female workers in Turkey are estimated by the World Economic Forum to earn $7,813 while Saudi female workers earn $6,652.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  Women in Pakistan don't even earn $1,000 for a year's worth of labor ($940) Egyptian, Syrian, Indonesian, Nigerian, and Bangladeshi women earn less, far less for some countries (Syria, Bangladesh, Nigeria), than $3,000 annually.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  The median annual income for female workers in the United States was $36,931 in 2010.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt;

Women in these countries earn very low wages when compared to men from the same country. Out of 11 of the most populated and economically significant Muslim majority nations (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Tunisia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) only two nations, Bangladesh and Nigeria have a gender wage gap below 50%. In Nigeria, women earn 57 cents to the dollar of a man, according to the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Report 2012. Women in Bangladesh earn 52% of their males counterparts' wage. In Syria, women only earn 15% of a man's wage.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

These large disparities in income size and relative size to men in addition to low overall labor involvement, few salaried positions, and high levels of unemployment suggest that these nations' economies perpetuate significant gender disparities. However, low wages and large wage gaps can be explained by the different types of work men and women perform in these countries. If women are hired for mostly low-skill, low-wage work which is less productive and less elastic in demand than the work of most men, then their wages should be low and be significantly smaller than men's wages. Furthermore, a large supply of female labor for the few jobs women do work in these various economies may be depressing wages.

=== Wage gap ===

Low wages in absolute terms and low wages relative to men's wages in the aggregate, however, do not provide a full picture of gender economic equity. The ratio of income for women to men for equal work is another significant financial indicator of economic gender equality. Using this metric, these countries, collectively, are moderately equal relative to the majority of the world. The World Economic Forum's 2012 Gender Report found that women in Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia all received approximately 60% of the wages of a male for the same work.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

Respectively, these nations were ranked 87th, 85th, 58th, and 94th in the world out of 135. While not terribly equal, these nations were not too far behind the median nation. Egypt, however, is the most gender equal country in terms of equal pay. The World Economic Forum found that Egyptian women receive 82% of the income of their true male counterparts, not of men in general.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt; No other nation's women earn as high an income percentage as that.

===World Economic Forum economic participation and Opportunity subindex===
{{see also|Global Gender Gap Report}}
''''Global Gender Gap Index'''

An additional measurement of gender inequality is the World Economic Forum global gender gap index which it measures for 135 countries each year and publishes its results in its ''Gender Gap Report.'' Its statistic is known as the ''Global Gender Gap Index.'' The index measures gender disparities in economic, political, health, and educational spheres and uses corresponding criteria.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

The GGGI utilizes four sub-indices to measure these four spheres of inequality and to create a composite metric of gender inequality. The four sub-indices are: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. The economic participation and opportunity subindex "is captured through three concepts: the participation gap, the remuneration gap and the advancement gap. The participation gap is captured  using the difference in labour force participation rates. The remuneration gap is captured through a hard data indicator (ratio of estimated female-to-male earned income) and a qualitative variable calculated through the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey (wage equality for similar work). Finally, the gap between the advancement of women and men is captured through two hard data statistics (the ratio of women to men among legislators, senior officials and managers, and the ratio of women to men among technical and professional workers)."&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

The index is measured on a scale of 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a perfectly equal level of participation in the labor market between men and women and equal economic opportunities and o indicating complete inequality. Of the 135 nations analyzed, Pakistan (134), Syria (132), and Saudi Arabia (131) are in the bottom five countries for female labor force participation and for the provision of labor opportunities for women.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

The GGGI is a comprehensive index relative to other measures of gender inequality such as the [[Gender Inequality Index]] produced by the United Nations. One serious critique of the index, however, is that the measurement of a country's gender equality is too dependent on income.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;  While the ratio of income between men and women is taken into account, over reliance on financial data may benefit more Developed countries by virtue of having larger economies which can accommodate higher wages. The multiple subsections of the index, however, aim to condition the final measurement of economic participation and opportunity with emphasis on the ratio of wages, job advancement, and other metrics of females to males. This methodology quantifies gender inequality by analyzing the gap between males and females instead of absolute measurements.&lt;ref name = "World Economic Forum" /&gt;

===UN Gender Inequality Index===
{{see also|Gender Inequality Index}}

The most frequently cited indicator of gender inequality is the [[United Nation]]'s [[Gender Inequality Index]], or GII. It was adopted in 2010 because the Gender Development Index did not measure gender inequality directly. It measured female development.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; The Gender Empowerment Measurement was replaced as well due to its overemphasis of income. As a consequence of this methodological construction, the GEM over estimated gender inequality in poor countries. Consequently, the GII was adopted to address these flaws and to be a true measure of inequality and not a proxy indicator. Income is not a component of the GII and the three categories are weighed equally to present a balance assessment of gender equality. The GII covers three broad categories of female disadvantage: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market status.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

The purpose of the index is to demonstrate the loss of human development due to inequalities between men and women. The three categories are measured with the following metrics. Reproductive health is measured by the maternal mortality rate and the adolescent fertility rate. Empowerment is indicated by the share of parliamentary seats held by each sex and secondary and higher education levels of each sex. Finally, the labor market aspect of the GII is measured by women's participation rate in the workforce. Mathematically, it is the approximated loss of human development to women due to inequality.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

Philosophically and methodologically, the GII is based on and, in some sense, a subindicator of the [[Human Development Index]]. Scores for nations are on a scale of 0 to 1 where 0 is pure gender equality and 1 is pure gender inequality. GII is measured in a similar manner as the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. According to the UN, IHDI is "based on a distribution-sensitive class of composite indices proposed by Foster, Lopez-Calva, and Szekely (2005), which draws on the Atkinson (1970) family of inequality measures. It is computed as the geometric mean of dimension indices adjusted for inequality. The inequality in each dimension is estimated by the Atkinson inequality measure, which is based on the assumption that a society has a certain level of aversion to inequality." &lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

The median GII score for the global community is 0.463. When divided by regions, the Arab States have the third worst GII score of 0.555.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; This score is only superior to the scores of Sub-Saharan Africa (0.577) and South Asia (0.568). While not all encompassing and inclusive of other religious and cultural groups, these three regions, particularly the Arab States and South Asia, are inhabited by large Muslim populations. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, and Bangladesh all have GII scores above the median. Only Tunisia's score (0.293) is below the median.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; However, it is significantly below the median.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt;

Gender inequality, however, is not increasing or decreasing in a collinear fashion among these predominantly Muslim states. In Afghanistan, for example, gender inequality, as measured by the index, improved by 2% from 2005 to 2008 but then declined by 2% from 2008 to 2011. In Iraq, the GII score jumped by 9% from 2005 to 2008 but then leveled off in 2011. Turkey, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Pakistan have seen consistent improves to gender equality since 2005.&lt;ref name = "UN" /&gt; Due to the broad, general nature of the indicators, the minimal and narrow data used to compile the three categories which compose the indicator, and innumerable political and socio-economic issues which may increase or decrease gender inequality, nothing definitive can be said about the level of gender inequality or its growth trend in many predominantly Muslim nations.

In an organization, the hierarchy usually consists of a singular/group of [[Power (social and political)|power]] at the top with subsequent levels of power beneath them. This is the dominant mode of organization among large organizations; most [[corporation]]s, [[Forms of government|governments]], and [[organized religion]]s are hierarchical organizations with different levels of [[management]], power or [[authority]]. For example, the broad, top-level overview of the general organization of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic Church]] consists of the [[Pope]], then the [[Cardinal (Catholic)|Cardinals]], then the [[Archbishop]]s, and so on. 

Members of hierarchical organizational structures chiefly communicate with their immediate superior and with their immediate subordinates. Structuring organizations in this way is useful partly because it can reduce the communication overhead by limiting information flow; this is also its major limitation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Visualization==
A hierarchy is typically visualized as a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], where the height of the ranking or person depicts their power status and the width of that level represents how many people or business divisions are at that level relative to the whole—the highest-ranking people are at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]], and there are very few of them; the [[Base (geometry)|base]] may include thousands of people who have no subordinates. These hierarchies are typically depicted with a [[tree structure|tree]] or [[triangle]] [[diagram]], creating an [[organizational chart]] or organigram. Those nearest the top have more power than those nearest the bottom, and there being fewer people at the top than at the bottom. As a result, superiors in a hierarchy generally have higher status and command greater rewards than their subordinates.

==Common models==
All governments and most companies have similar structures. Traditionally, the [[monarch]] was the pinnacle of the [[State (polity)|state]]. In many countries, [[feudalism]] and [[manorialism]] provided a formal [[social structure]] that established hierarchical links at every level of society, with the monarch at the top. 

In modern post-feudal states the nominal top of the hierarchy still remains the [[head of state]], which may be a [[president]] or a [[constitutional monarch]], although in many modern states the powers of the head of state are delegated among different bodies. Below the head, there is commonly a [[senate]], [[parliament]] or [[congress]], which in turn often delegate the day-to-day running of the country to a [[prime minister]]. In many [[democracies]], the people are considered to be the notional top of the hierarchy, over the head of state; in reality, the people's power is restricted to voting in elections.

In business, the business owner traditionally occupied the pinnacle of the [[organization]]. In most modern large companies, there is now no longer a single dominant shareholder, and the collective power of the business owners is for most purposes delegated to a [[board of directors]], which in turn delegates the day-to-day running of the company to a [[managing director]] or [[CEO]]. Again, although the shareholders of the company are the nominal top of the hierarchy, in reality many companies are run at least in part as personal fiefdoms by their management; [[corporate governance]] rules are an attempt to mitigate this tendency.

== Studies ==
The [[organizational development]] theorist [[Elliott Jacques]] identified a special role for hierarchy in his concept of [[requisite organization]]. 
 
The [[iron law of oligarchy]], introduced by [[Robert Michels]], describes the inevitable tendency of hierarchical organizations to become [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] in their decision making.

The [[Peter principle|Peter Principle]] is a term coined by [[Laurence J. Peter]] in which the selection of a candidate for a position in an  hierarchical organization is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and managers in an hierarchical organization "rise to the level of their incompetence." 

[[Hierarchiology]] is another term coined by Laurence J. Peter, described in his humorous book of the same name, to refer to the study of hierarchical organizations and the behavior of their members.

{{quote|Having formulated the Principle, I discovered that I had inadvertently founded a new science, hierarchiology, the study of hierarchies. The term hierarchy was originally used to describe the system of church government by priests graded into ranks. The contemporary meaning includes any organization whose members or employees are arranged in order of rank, grade or class. Hierarchiology, although a relatively recent discipline, appears to have great applicability to the fields of public and private administration.|Dr. [[Laurence J. Peter]] and [[Raymond Hull]]|''[[The Peter Principle]]: Why Things Always Go Wrong''}}

[[The IRG Solution – hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it]] argued that hierarchies were inherently incompetent, and were only able to function due to large amounts of informal [[lateral communication]] fostered by private informal networks.

==Criticism and alternatives==
In the work of diverse theorists such as [[William James]] (1842–1910), [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) and [[Hayden White]], important critiques of hierarchical epistemology are advanced. James famously asserts in his work "Radical Empiricism" that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning, so that when they are discovered, success is declared. But if aspects of the world are organized differently, involving inherent and intractable ambiguities, then scientific questions are often considered unresolved. A hesitation to declare success upon the discovery of ambiguities leaves heterarchy at an artificial and subjective disadvantage in the scope of human knowledge. This bias is an artifact of an aesthetic or pedagogical preference for hierarchy, and not necessarily an expression of objective observation.

Hierarchies and hierarchical thinking has been criticized by many people, including [[Susan McClary]] and one political philosophy which is vehemently opposed to hierarchical organization: [[anarchism]]. [[Heterarchy]] is the most commonly proposed alternative to hierarchy and this has been combined with [[responsible autonomy]] by [[Gerard Fairtlough]] in his work on [[Triarchy]] theory. The most beneficial aspect of a hierarchical organization is the clear command that is established. However, hierarchy may become dismantled by abuse of power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Amidst constant innovation in information and communication technologies, hierarchical authority structures are giving way to greater decision-making latitude for individuals and more flexible definitions of job activities and this new style of work presents a challenge to existing organizational forms, with some research studies contrasting traditional organizational forms against groups that operate as online communities that are characterized by personal motivation and the satisfaction of making one's own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Rosson, Rosson (2007). The Future of Work: What Does Online Community Have to Do with It? 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)&lt;/ref&gt;  With all levels of an organization having access to information and communication via digital means, power structures align more as a [[wirearchy]], enabling the flow of power and authority to be based not on hierarchical levels, but on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6872">There are many uses of water in industry and, in most cases, the used water also needs treatment to render it fit for re-use or disposal. Raw water entering an industrial plant often needs treatment to meet tight quality specifications to be of use in specific industrial processes. '''Industrial water treatment''' encompasses all these aspects which include [[industrial wastewater treatment]], [[boiler water]] treatment and [[Cooling tower|cooling water]] treatment.

==Overview==
Water treatment is used to optimize most water-based industrial processes, such as heating, cooling, processing, cleaning, and rinsing so that operating costs and risks are reduced. Poor water treatment lets water interact with the surfaces of pipes and vessels which contain it. Steam [[boiler]]s can scale up or corrode, and these deposits will mean more fuel is needed to heat the same amount of water. [[Cooling tower]]s can also scale up and corrode, but left untreated, the warm, dirty water they can contain will encourage bacteria to grow, and [[Legionnaires' disease]] can be the fatal consequence. Water treatment is also used to improve the quality of water contacting the manufactured product e.g. semiconductors, and/or can be part of the product e.g. beverages, pharmaceuticals, etc.  In these instances, poor water treatment can cause defective products.  

In many cases, effluent water from one process can be suitable for reuse in another process if given suitable treatment. This can reduce costs by lowering charges for  water consumption, reduce the costs of effluent disposal because of reduced volume and lower energy costs due to the recovery of heat in recycled wastewater.

== Objectives ==
Industrial water treatment seeks to manage four main problem areas: [[fouling|scaling]], [[corrosion]], microbiological activity and disposal of residual wastewater. Boilers do not have many problems with microbes as the high temperatures prevent their growth.

[[fouling|Scaling]] occurs when the chemistry and temperature conditions are such that the dissolved mineral salts in the water are caused to  precipitate and form solid deposits. These can be mobile, like a fine silt, or can build up in layers on the metal surfaces of the systems. Scale is a problem because it insulates and heat exchange becomes less efficient as the scale thickens, which wastes energy. Scale also narrows pipe widths and therefore increases the energy used in pumping the water through the pipes.

[[Corrosion]] occurs when the parent metal oxidises (as iron rusts, for example) and gradually the integrity of the plant equipment is compromised. The corrosion products can cause similar problems to scale, but corrosion can also lead to leaks, which in a pressurised system can lead to catastrophic failures.

Microbes can thrive in untreated cooling water, which is warm and sometimes full of organic nutrients as wet cooling towers are very efficient air scrubbers. Dust, flies, grass, fungal spores, and others collect in the water and create a sort of "microbial soup" if not treated with biocides. Many outbreaks of the deadly Legionnaires' Disease have been traced to unmanaged cooling towers, and the UK has had stringent Health &amp; Safety guidelines concerning cooling tower operations for many years as have had governmental agencies in other countries. 
{{Heavy metal removal}} certian processes like tanning and paper making use heavy metals such as Chrome for tanning.Although most is used up but some amount remains and gets carried away with water.The presence in drinking water is toxic when consumed so even the smallest amount must be removed.

== Disposal of residual industrial wastewaters ==
{{Main|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
Disposal of residual wastewaters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tchobanoglous, G., Burton, F.L., and Stensel, H.D.|title=Wastewater Engineering (Treatment Disposal Reuse) / Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.|edition=4th |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |year=2003 |isbn=0-07-041878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; from an industrial plant is a difficult and costly problem. Most petroleum refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]|edition=1st|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1967|id= [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt; have onsite facilities to treat their wastewaters so that the pollutant concentrations in the treated wastewater comply with the local and/or national regulations regarding disposal of wastewaters into [[sewage treatment]] plants or into rivers, lakes or oceans.

==Technologies==
Advancements in [[water treatment]] technology have affected all areas of industrial water treatment. Although mechanical filtration, such as [[reverse osmosis]], is widely employed to filter contaminants, other technologies including the use of ozone generators, wastewater evaporation, [[electrodeionization]] and [[bioremediation]] are also able to address the challenges of industrial water treatment.

Ozone treatment is a process in which ozone gas is injected into waste streams as a means to reduce or eliminate the need for water treatment chemicals or sanitizers that may be hazardous, including chlorine.

===Ultraviolet irradiation===
{{Main|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}
[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|Ultraviolet]] (UV) disinfection technology has been a common water treatment technology in the past two decades due to its ability to provide disinfected water without the use of harmful chemicals.  The UV-C portion represents wavelengths from 200 nm - 280 nm which is used for disinfection. UV-C photons penetrate cells and damage the nucleic acid, rendering them incapable of reproduction, or microbiologically inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meulemans|first=C. C. E.|date=1987-09-01|title=The Basic Principles of UV–Disinfection of Water|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01919518708552146|journal=Ozone: Science &amp; Engineering|volume=9|issue=4|pages=299–313|doi=10.1080/01919518708552146|issn=0191-9512}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Process Water Treatment Technology===
Process water is water that is used in a variety of manufacturing operations, such as: coating and plating; rinsing and spraying; washing and etc. Municipal and ground water often contain dissolved minerals which make it unsuitable for these processes because it would affect product quality and/or increase manufacturing costs. A proper incoming water treatment system can remedy these issues and create the right water conditions for specific industrial processes.

General '''Kim Kyong-hui''' ({{korean|hangul=김경희|hanja=金敬姬}}; born 30 May 1946) is the aunt of current [[North Korea]]n leader, [[Kim Jong-un]].  She is the daughter of the founding North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] and the sister of the late leader [[Kim Jong-il]]. She currently serves as Secretary for Organization of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]]. An important member of Kim Jong-il's inner circle of trusted friends and advisors,&lt;ref name="Mansourov"&gt;Mansourov (2004), p. IV-17&lt;/ref&gt; she was director of the WPK Light Industry Department from 1988 to 2012.&lt;ref name="baird"&gt;Baird (2003), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was [[Jang Sung-taek]], who was executed in December 2013 in [[Pyongyang]], after being charged with treason and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25359939|title=North Korean leader's uncle 'executed over corruption'|date=12 December 2013|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
[[File:Fahey DSCF3023 (6074798813).jpg|thumb|An idealized portrait of Kim Kyong-hui with her mother [[Kim Jong-suk]], father [[Kim Il-sung]] and brother [[Kim Jong-il]]]]
Kim Kyong-hui was born in [[Pyongyang]] on 30 May 1946, the youngest child of [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Kim Jong-suk]]. Her birth mother died when she was four. After her father remarried, she was raised by various surrogates away from the family.&lt;ref&gt;Koike, Yuriko. (2010) [http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=5&amp;article_id=119330#axzz0zwdV6uYa "A ruthless sister risks becoming North Korea's next ruler"]. ''The Daily Star''; retrieved 19 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief period spent in [[Jilin Province]], [[China]] due to the [[Korean War]], she returned to Pyongyang with her brother, [[Kim Jong-il]]. She entered [[Kim Il-sung University]] in 1963, studying [[political economy]], where she met [[Jang Sung-taek|her future husband]]. The couple continued dating {{clarify|date=December 2011}} after he relocated to [[Wonsan]], allegedly because the Kim family opposed their relationship.&lt;ref name="NKLW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kji-2/kim-kyong-hui|title=Kim Kyong Hui|publisher=North Korea Leadership Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two eventually married in 1972. She attended the Kim Il-sung Higher Party School in 1966, and went to study at [[Moscow State University]] in 1968. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Personal life==
Kim and Jang had a daughter, Jang Kum-song (1977–2006), who lived overseas in Paris as an international student; she refused an order to return to Pyongyang and then reportedly committed suicide in September 2006 due to her parents' opposition to her relationship with her boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.joins.com/article/2450717.html?ctg=1000|title=파리의 김정일 조카 장금송 비운의 러브스토리 (Unlucky love story of Kim Jong-il's niece in Paris)|language=Korean|publisher=JoongAng Ilbo|date=18 September 2006|accessdate=30 May 2007|last=Yi|first=Yeong-jong|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233252/http://www.joins.com/article/2450717.html?ctg=1000 |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kim Kyong-hui's political career began in 1971 with a position in the [[Korean Democratic Women's Union]], and in 1975 she was transferred to the post of vice-director of the International Liaison Department of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]], promoted to first vice-director in 1976. It was the period when North Korea was establishing diplomatic relations with a number of capitalist countries, like [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]], as well as the United Nations. She oversaw the placement of qualified diplomatic personnel during her tenure as International Department vice-director.&lt;ref name="NKLW"/&gt;

In 1988, she was promoted to [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Central Committee]] member and director of the Light Industry Department. In 1990, she was elected deputy to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] for the first time. Her role was particularly significant as she led the Economic Policy Inspection Department, then again the Light Industry Department during the "[[Arduous March]]" period after [[Death of Kim Il-sung|Kim Il-sung's death]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Kim Kyong-hui disappeared from the limelight in 2003, in the same period when Jang Sung-taek was apparently purged as well.&lt;ref name="NKLW"/&gt; However, while her husband resurfaced with a high-level position in 2007, she did not appear in public until 2009, playing a more and more prominent role, accompanying Kim Jong-il to several inspection tours and attending official events. On 27 September 2010, it was announced that she was made a general in the [[Korean People's Army]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/world/asia/28korea.html|title=Kim's Son Elevated Before Meeting|last=McDonald|first=Mark|date=27 September 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first woman in North Korea to achieve this military rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11297747|title=North Korea's secretive 'first family'|date=2013-12-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This coincided with her nephew [[Kim Jong-un]]'s promotion to the same rank. A day later, the 3rd Conference of the Workers’ Party elected her as a member of the Political Bureau, which is the central organization of the party. Kim Kyong-hui later continued to pose as a prominent member of the North Korean leadership under Kim Jong-un. She was elected member of the WPK Secretariat and a leading figure of the [[Organization and Guidance Department of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Organization and Guidance Department]] (the foremost party department led by her uncle [[Kim Yong-ju]] until 1974, and by Kim Jong-il himself from 1974 till [[Death of Kim Jong-il|his death]]) at the 4th Party Conference in April 2012. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

According to [[South Korea]]n sources, she also worked as Kim Jong-il's personal aide.&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;''Chosun Ilbo'', dated 11 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Her influential position in North Korean echelons (also confirmed by [[Kenji Fujimoto]]) allowed her to maintain close relations with president [[Kim Yong-nam]] of the [[Supreme People's Assembly|SPA Presidium]], WPK Secretaries [[Choe Thae-bok]] and [[Kim Ki Nam]], and Director [[Kim Yang-gon]] of the WPK United Front Department.&lt;ref name="NKLW"/&gt; Her post as head of the Light Industry Department gave her a prominent role in shaping North Korean economic policy as it was shifting its focus on developing light industry.&lt;ref name="Editorials"&gt;2010, 2011 New Year editorials by ''Rodong Sinmun'', ''Joson Inmingun'', and ''Chongnyon Jonwi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Kim Kyong-hui opened the first hamburger restaurant in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/burger-10152010151052.html|title=Happy Meals in Pyongyang?|publisher=Radio Free Asia|date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution of Jang Sung-taek==

On 8 December 2013, her husband, [[Jang Sung-taek]] was publicly expelled from the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]]. Jang was accused of factionalism, corruption, and a range of misbehaviour that included affairs with other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nknews.org/2013/12/jang-song-thaek-purge-confirmed-amid-rumors-of-his-execution|title=Jang Song Thaek purge confirmed amid rumors of his execution|work=NK News|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|location=South Korea|url=http://renewal.dailynk.com/english/read_photo.php?num=11248&amp;cataId=nk03100|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213001111/http://renewal.dailynk.com/english/read_photo.php?num=11248&amp;cataId=nk03100|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 December 2013|title=Jang Arrested on State Television|work=Daily NK|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December, it was reported that he had been executed for treason.&lt;ref name="Means"&gt;Alexandre Mansourov, [http://38north.org/2013/12/amansourov121313 "North Korea: What Jang's Execution Means for the Future"], 38north.org; 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Gale, [https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/12/13/what-north-korea-said-about-jang-song-thaek "What North Korea Said About Jang Song Thaek"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December, the [[Korean Central News Agency]] released a roster of six top officials appointed to a national committee in charge of organizing a [[state funeral]] for [[Kim Kuk-tae]], a former Workers' Party official. The roster included the name of Kim Kyong-hui, indicating she had survived the purge and remained in favour.&lt;ref name="Choe"&gt;Choe Sang-hun, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/world/asia/kim-jong-uns-aunt-appears-to-survive-husbands-purge.html "Kim Jong-un's Aunt Appears to Survive Husband's Purge"], ''The New York Times'', 15 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/kim-jong-un-aunt-position-influence-husband "Kim Jong-un's aunt retains position of influence after husband's downfall"], 15 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25391160 | work=BBC News | title=North Korean execution 'will not alter trade goals' | date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/15/us-korea-north-idUSBRE9BE01T20131215 | work=Reuters | title=North Korean leader's influential aunt remains in power after uncle Jang's execution | date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of Kim Kyong-hui's relationship with Jang had been a subject of frequent speculation. Analysts believe that Jang and Kim Kyong-hui had been estranged.&lt;ref name="Choe"/&gt; Yoon Sang-hyun, a [[National Assembly of South Korea]] deputy floor leader of the governing [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]], said that Kim had been "separated" from Jang and did not oppose his purge.&lt;ref name="Choe"/&gt;

==Rumours about ill health and death==

'''Leeds city centre''' is the city centre of [[Leeds]], England. It is within the [[Leeds Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds Central]] parliamentary constituency, represented by [[Hilary Benn]] as MP since a [[Leeds Central by-election, 1999|by-election in 1999]]. The term '''central Leeds''' is often used to describe the city centre, although it refers to a wider area within the [[Leeds Inner Ring Road|Inner Ring Road]]. While the city centre has no formal definition, it is roughly bounded by the Inner Ring Road to the north and the [[River Aire]] to the south and can be divided into four-quarters.

== Central districts ==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2018}}
===Arena Quarter===
{{Main|Arena Quarter}}

[[File:First Direct Arena, Leeds 24 October 2018 1.jpg|thumb|right|Leeds Arena]]
Arena Quarter (sometimes referred to as Arena Qtr) is a mixed city centre development with residential, retail and office developments in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]]. It is located in Leeds city centre and the area is best known for housing [[Leeds Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vision for new hotel and restaurant in Leeds’s booming Arena Quarter |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/exclusive-vision-for-new-hotel-and-restaurant-in-leeds-s-booming-arena-quarter-1-7933978 |publisher=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its location is directly north of [[Merrion Street]] in Leeds city centre. The inner ring road borders the district on both the east and north boundary, with Woodhouse Lane acting as the district's western boundary. It is mainly made up of residential properties and developments, including [[Sky Plaza]] and [[Opal 3]]. Other major institutions are located within the Quarter, including the Yorkshire Bank HQ and also the [[Merrion Centre, Leeds|Merrion Centre]]. Recently it was announced that [[Hume House]] would be built within the Quarter, the tallest building in [[Yorkshire]].

===The Calls===
The Calls is an area of Leeds city centre close to the [[River Aire]]. It is directly south of the Victorian District and to the west of Crown Point Road. The area's decline began in the early 20th century when Leeds' industry moved away from the centre out towards [[Hunslet]], [[Holbeck]], [[Armley]] and [[Kirkstall]].  From 1985 to 1995 [[Leeds Corporation]] carried out a major regeneration with a careful conversion of listed building warehouses and new build in sympathetic style for a mixed-use area. 

Many of the area's old industrial buildings have now been converted into modern flats and commercial buildings. The lower end of The Calls has a number of [[LGBT community]] friendly businesses and bars. 

===Civic Quarter===
[[File:Leeds Rathaus.jpg|thumb|Leeds Town Hall]]
The Civic Quarter is the area roughly north of [[The Headrow, Leeds|the Headrow]] and is predominantly home to a number of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian buildings]]. Prominent landmarks include the Leeds Magistrates' and Crown Courts, the City Library and City Gallery, and [[Leeds Town Hall]], which was completed in 1858 and opened by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. Queen Square is also found here. The city's largest hospital, the [[Leeds General Infirmary]], has been operating here since 1869.

Behind Leeds Town Hall are [[Millennium Square (Leeds)|Millennium Square]] and [[Leeds Civic Hall]]. Millennium Square was a flagship project to mark the year 2000 and hosts regular concerts, with past performers including the [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Bridewell Taxis]], [[HARD-Fi]], [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Embrace (English band)|Embrace]]. Leeds Civic Hall was opened in 1933 by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and is home to the Lord Mayor's Room and the council chambers. Many [[barrister]]s' chambers and solicitors' offices are found here because of the close proximity to the courts. Also nearby are [[Leeds Metropolitan University]], the [[University of Leeds]], [[Leeds College of Art]] and the Park Lane and Technology campuses of [[Leeds City College]].

===Cultural Quarter===
{{main article|Leeds Dock}}
[[File:Leeds-RA-01.jpg|right|thumb|Inside the Royal Armouries main stairwell]]
The '''Cultural Quarter''' is situated in the east of the city centre. Landmarks here include the [[BBC]] building, which moved from Woodhouse Lane just north of the city centre in August 2004, the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]], which opened in March 1990, [[Leeds College of Music]], which moved to its current location in 1997, and [[Northern Ballet]] which moved to the area in 2010.

The Cultural Quarter is also where the [[Royal Armouries|Royal Armouries Museum]] (opened in 1996 when the collection was transferred north from its previous location, the [[Tower of London]]) can be found, although it is more in the south of the city centre than it is the east. The building, designed by architect Derek Walker, was built at a cost of £42.5&amp;nbsp;million and completed in two years, and has since become one of the city's major tourist attractions.

[[Leeds Dock]] also lies on the fringes of the Cultural Quarter.

===Financial Quarter===

[[File:Park Square and Leeds Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 183544.jpg|thumb|right|[[Park Square, Leeds|Park Square]] in the financial quarter]]
[[File:Bank of England.jpg|right|thumb|Bank House, the [[Bank of England]] offices on King Street in Leeds.]]
The '''Financial Quarter''' is bounded by Park Row to the East, [[Leeds Inner Ring Road]] to the west, The Headrow to the north and Wellington Street to the south. It is centred on the Georgian [[Park Square, Leeds|Park Square]], one of the green spaces in Leeds city centre. The City Centre Loop passes through the quarter, using [[Leeds City Square|City Square]], Quebec Street, King Street and East Parade. Leeds Law School is located at Cloth Hall Court. Major names can be found in the financial quarter such as [[Aviva]] and [[The Bank of England]].

In recent years, the district has grown out towards the west of the city. The recent Wellington Place development and the wider Wellington Gardens area of the city contain a number of international corporations. Wellington Place is currently under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Big names sign up to Leeds’s Wellington Place development |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/big-names-sign-up-to-leeds-s-wellington-place-development-1-9194864 |publisher=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]] |date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holbeck Urban Village===
{{main article|Holbeck Urban Village}}
Historically, Holbeck Urban Village was [[Holbeck]]'s closest area to the centre of [[Leeds]]. Due to the expansion of the city, it is now considered part of the city centre and was rezoned as [[Holbeck Urban Village]], following the completion of a number of developments. is the name given by local government and planning agencies to a mixed-use [[urban renewal]] area south of [[Leeds railway station]] in [[Holbeck]], [[West Yorkshire]], England.

[[Bridgewater Place]] and also [[Granary Wharf ]] are located within [[Holbeck Urban Village]]. The new [[HS2]] station will border this area of Leeds, which is why much of the area is considered prime location for development.

===Victorian District===
[[File:Victoria Quarter from Briggate.jpg|thumb|Victoria Quarter]]

The Victorian District, also known as the Shopping Quarter, extends south from the Headrow and includes Leeds' major shopping locations. It is considered the retail core of Leeds, containing [[Leeds Corn Exchange|Corn Exchange]], [[Leeds Kirkgate Market]], [[Trinity Leeds]] and also both Victoria Gate and Victoria Quarter. The naming of the district is due to the number of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings in the district, but also the historical [[Briggate]], which is one of the oldest shopping streets in Leeds. Two main shopping locations also carry the "Victoria" name in the district, Victoria Quarter and also Victoria Gate. [[Victoria Quarter]] is one of the oldest buildings in central Leeds and houses one of the UK's only [[Harvey Nichols]] stores. 

The recent development of the area has seen two new additional indoor [[Shopping mall|mall]]s, Victoria Gate and also [[Trinity Leeds]]. [[File:Trinity Leeds opening day (Taken by Flickr user 21st March 2013) 002.jpg|thumb|left|Trinity Leeds opening day]]

It houses the city centre's [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] department store, along with many other flagship stores of premium brands. Older parts of the Victorian District include department stores in Leeds which have historically included [[Lewis's]], which became [[Allders]] in 1996 and latterly closed in 2005, [[Schofields (department store)|Schofields]] which was taken over by House of Fraser in 1988 and closed in 1996, the [[Co-op]] which closed in the mid 1990s, [[Littlewoods]] which closed in the late 1990s and is now occupied by Zara and [[H&amp;M]], [[C&amp;A]] which closed in 2001 and is currently occupied by [[Next Clearance]] (until demolition for construction of the Trinity Quarter) and [[Marshall &amp; Snelgrove]] which became part of Debenhams and closed in the 1970s and lies of the site of [[Lloyds TSB]] on [[Park Row, Leeds|Park Row]] have disappeared but currently department stores include [[Debenhams]] (historically known as Matthias Robinson), [[Harvey Nichols]] (which when opened in 1996 became the first branch outside London), [[Marks and Spencer]], [[British Home Stores|BHS]] and [[House of Fraser]] (formerly a [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]], it temporarily became premises for Schofields and latterly became [[Rackhams]] before becoming House of Fraser in 1996).

== Leeds Lights ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
Each Christmas the streets of Leeds city centre are decorated with a variety of [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]]. The widely publicised switch-on' ceremony is in early November, when a celebrity flicks the switch to illuminate the decorations at Victoria Gardens and usually attracts tens-of-thousands of people to the turning on ceremony. When Leeds Lights were first established in 1983, the switch on was held on the 4th Thursday of November, however it has since been brought forward. The illuminations are renowned as being the largest display in the United Kingdom, spanning over 13 miles of city centre streets and using over 2&amp;nbsp;million low energy light bulbs.

Leeds is notable for designing, manufacturing and maintaining its own Christmas Light motifs. Its workshop began as a place to provide people with disabilities some employment opportunities. Its workshop has had several locations, beginning in a temporary location near Chapeltown Road, then to the old disused Whitbread Brewery site at Kirkstall and from 1993 to the present Seacroft location. Leeds City Council was the only local authority to do this for some years but now a small number have followed Leeds Lights example in preparing their own displays where as most other councils buy in their lights and services. The lights are repaired and pressure cleaned annually at the Leeds Lights workshop in Seacroft throughout the year. 80,000 coloured lamps are stored at the workshop, and 2000m of coloured rope light are used. A team of 14 works all year round producing the display. From October–January, a team of 9 works to erect the lights ready for the switch on in early November, before removing the lights after Christmas.

In recent years, commercial advertising has been permitted on some of the lights, such as The Headrow's champagne bottle lights.

== Transport ==

===Rail===
[[File:Overview of Leeds City railway station 04.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leeds railway station]]
[[File:Leeds-OpenStreetMap-2009-02-25.svg|thumb|right|200px|Street map]]

Leeds city centre is served by [[Leeds railway station]].  The station is one of 17 in Great Britain to be managed by [[Network Rail]]. It is the busiest English station outside London, and the UK's second busiest station outside London after Glasgow Central.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/xls/station-usage-2006-07.xls&lt;/ref&gt; The station serves national, regional and suburban railway services.

===Air===
The city centre is served by [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]].  This is situated in [[Yeadon, West Yorkshire|Yeadon]] approximately seven miles North West of the city centre.  The city centre is linked to the airport by the 757 [[WYMetro|Metro]] bus service. The airport serves major European destinations as well as many further afield.

===Road===
Traffic passing past Leeds city centre is diverted away from the main areas by the [[Leeds Inner Ring Road]], an urban motorway passing the East, North and West of the city centre.  Much of the Inner Ring Road is in tunnels so not visible to passing pedestrians. All major routes into Leeds head towards the city centre. The city centre is served by the [[M621 motorway]].

===Buses===
The most notable bus service within central Leeds is the FreeCityBus service operated by [[First Leeds]] and funded by [[West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive|Metro]]. This service runs every few minutes in a clockwise direction around the city centre. It serves major transport interchanges and both universities as well as the main shopping and financial districts. There have been calls for a second FreeCityBus to serve emerging business, leisure and residential districts in the southern part of central Leeds.

Leeds city centre has its main [[Leeds City bus station|bus station]] in the east of the city.  However, as a rule only buses heading out of the [[City of Leeds]] and [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] services use it. Local [[First Leeds]] buses use stops on the city streets, or a number of smaller bus stations, referred to as bus points, at Bond Street, Infirmary Street, [[Leeds railway station]] and the Corn Exchange.

'''Life Sciences Foundation (LSF)''' was a San Francisco-based [[nonprofit organization]] that was established in 2011 to collect, preserve, interpret, and promote the history of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phrma_2013"&gt;{{citation |title=Life Sciences Foundation Tells the Story of Biotechnology |date=March 6, 2013|author=Stephanie Fischer |url=http://www.phrma.org/life-sciences-foundation-tells-the-story-of-biotechnology#sthash.1cg0P5hW.dpuf |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |publisher=[[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; LSF conducted historical research,  maintained archives and published  historically relevant materials and information.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012"&gt;{{citation |date=May 1, 2012 |volume=32 |number=9 |title=Telling the Story of Biotechnology: Life Sciences Foundation Formed to Help People Understand Why Biotech History Matters |author=Donna Loc |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/telling-the-story-of-biotechnology/4087/ |publisher=Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their public support of climate-science denier Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in 2018 caused a backlash against the foundation and eroded their scientific credibility.

On December 1, 2015, the LSF and the '''Chemical Heritage Foundation''' finalized a merger, creating one organization that covers "the history of the life sciences and biotechnology together with the history of the chemical sciences and engineering."&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/history|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merger"&gt;{{cite news|title=CHF and LSF Announce Merger|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chf-and-lsf-announce-merger-300159747.html|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=PR Newswire|date=Oct 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the '''[[Science History Institute]]''', to reflect its wider range of historical interests, from chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salisbury|first1=Stephan|title=Chemical Heritage Foundation is morphing into the Science History Institute|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/chemical-heritage-foundation-science-history-institute-philadelphia-20180103.html|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization is headquartered in [[Philadelphia]] but retains offices in the San Francisco Bay area.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

==Mandate==

The LSF mandate was to collect and promote the history of biotechnology. This includes telling the stories of "scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, managers, executives, and financiers" in order to "humanize" biotechnology to a lay audience.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phrma_2013" /&gt; The history of the biotechnology industry includes examining the complex relationships and socio-political dynamics that occur when science and entrepreneurship come together.&lt;ref name="BIO"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.bio.org/node/3423 |publisher= [[Biotechnology Industry Organization]] (BIO) |date=nd |title=Related Organizations &amp; State Affiliates |accessdate=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The idea for a foundation that would collect and share the history of biotechnology came about at a meeting in early January 2009 in San Francisco attended by G. Steven Burrill of Burrill &amp; Company, [[Dennis Gillings]] of [[Quintiles]] in Durham, NC,, John Lechleiter of [[Eli Lilly &amp; Co.]], [[Henri Termeer]], then CEO of [[Genzyme]] and Arnold Thackray, founding President and CEO of the [[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] (CHF)&lt;ref name="LSF_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LSF_about"&gt;{{citation |url=http://biotechhistory.org/about/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021014715/http://biotechhistory.org/about/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-21 |date=nd |accessdate=July 19, 2015 |title=About |work=Life Sciences Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Five years ago, G. Steven Burrill was part of a small group of biotech leaders who came together to discuss the importance of capturing the great stories and lessons of the biotech pioneers for future generations. From this meeting, the Life Sciences Foundation was formed in 2010.|Life Sciences Foundation 2014}}

Thackray had shaped Chemical Heritage Foundation—"the premier institution preserving the history of chemistry, chemical engineering, and related sciences and technologies." Oral history was one component of the CHF mandate of preserving interpreting, and promoting the history of science.&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COH"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/center-for-oral-history |title=Center for Oral History |work= [[Science History Institute]] |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[American Chemical Society]] had launched the Center for the History of Chemistry which was renamed the Chemical Heritage Foundation (CHF) in 1992.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Thackray, a Fellow of [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Royal Historical Society]] and the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]],&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceHistory_2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/profile/arnold-thackray |title=Arnold Thackray |website= Science History Institute |date=February 16, 2012 |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thackray received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in the history of science from Cambridge University.&lt;ref name="ScienceHistory_2012" /&gt;

Thackray argued that before LSF was founded, the recorded history of biotechnology was "fragmented, uneven, and rather paltry." He observed that, "If you don't write your own history, somebody else will do it for you, and they may be hostile."&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;

{{quote|There is a valuable heritage here. The life sciences will shape the course of the 21st century. We need to preserve their history. We need to teach young people about the world in which they live ... Records are being scattered, memories are fading, stories are disappearing. Once lost, they're gone forever.|Arnold Thackray}}

By the end of 2011, LSF's steering committee of industry leaders— [[Joshua Boger]], Robert Carpenter, Bob Coughlin, [[Henri Termeer]] and Peter Wirth— were promoting the foundation's work by encouraging scientists and industrialists who were members of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, to contribute potential stories and materials to the archival record of the history of biotechnology in Boston and the surrounding region.&lt;ref name="MassBio_2012" /&gt;

== Oral History Program ==

The Life Sciences Foundation conducted [[oral history]] interviews with scientists, entrepreneurs, executives, policy makers, and leaders of thought in the biotechnology industry.&lt;ref name="Phrma_2013" /&gt; LSF's hosts timelines, transcripts and audio recordings and provides links to existing oral histories housed at institutions across the globe.&lt;ref name="MassBio_2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massbio.org/news/248-q_a_with_arnold_thackray_president_ceo_of_the/news_detail |title=Q&amp;A with Arnold Thackray, President &amp; CEO of the Life Sciences Foundation - News - |work=[[Massachusetts Biotechnology Council]] MassBio (MBC) |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111073955/http://www.massbio.org/news/248-q_a_with_arnold_thackray_president_ceo_of_the/news_detail |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archives ==

Original documentary materials pertinent to the history of biotechnology and the life sciences are being collected. The materials include personal papers and correspondence, donated company records, laboratory notebooks, photographs, video and audio recordings. Collected materials will be guided to permanent repositories in appropriate institutional settings.  Electronic reproductions will be made available to scholars, journalists, educators, and the general public in a digital archive.&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/life-sciences-foundation-looks-capture-history-biotech |work=Bioworld |date=February 2, 2012 |author=Morrison, Trista |accessdate= July 19, 2015 |title=Life Sciences Foundation Looks to Capture History of Biotech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

LSF historians work on a range of publications including a quarterly magazine, scholarly articles, white papers, and books. These works are intended for multiple audiences and focused on the emergence and evolution of biotechnologies in pharmaceutical discovery and development, agriculture, energy production, and [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="Bioworld_2012" /&gt; In October 2011, the [[University of Chicago Press]] released ''Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech'' by Life Sciences Foundation historian Sally Smith Hughes.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes_2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech |author=Sally Smith Hughes |pages=232 |date=2011 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==

Founding partners of the Life Sciences Foundation include Burrill, [[Celgene]], John Lechleiter, [[Genentech]], Henri Termeer, [[Merck &amp; Co.]], Millennium, [[Pfizer]], [[Quintiles]], and [[Thermo Fisher Scientific|Thermo Fisher]].&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt; [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] professor, [[Phillip Allen Sharp|Phillip Sharp]], serves as LSF's academic advisor.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt; Its executive and advisory board members are leaders from biotech, venture capital, academic institutions and trade associations.&lt;ref name="genetic_engineering_2012" /&gt;

When Thackray retired in 2012, Heather R. Erickson, 34, was appointed as LSF President and CEO and member of the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="CEO_2012"&gt;{{citation |title=Life Sciences Foundation Names Heather R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3173">A '''Material transfer agreement''' (MTA) is a [[contract]] that governs the transfer of tangible research materials between two organizations, when the recipient intends to use it for his or her own research purposes. The MTA defines the rights of the provider and the recipient with respect to the materials and any derivatives. Biological materials, such as [[reagent]]s, [[cell line]]s, [[plasmid]]s, and vectors, are the most frequently transferred materials, but MTAs may also be used for other types of materials, such as chemical compounds and even some types of software.

==MTA types==
Three types of MTAs are most common at academic institutions: transfer between academic or research institutions, transfer from academia to industry, and transfer from industry to academia. Each call for different terms and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spo.berkeley.edu/guide/mtaquick.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An example was the Biological Materials Transfer Project, part of the [[Science Commons]] project, that facilitated transfers between non-profit institutions, integrating existing standard agreements and new Science Commons contracts.

'''Peter Philip Carey''' [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]] (born 7 May 1943) is an Australian novelist. Carey has won the [[Miles Franklin Award]] three times and is frequently named as Australia's next contender for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Alison Flood, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/17/peter-carey-booker-prize-longlist "Peter Carey: Parrot and Olivier in America Could Be My Best Book"].

==Early life and career: 1943–1970==
Peter Carey was born in [[Bacchus Marsh]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in 1943. His parents ran a [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] dealership, Carey Motors. He attended Bacchus Marsh State School from 1948 to 1953, then boarded at [[Geelong Grammar School]] between 1954 and 1960. In 1961, Carey enrolled in a science degree at the new [[Monash University]] in Melbourne, majoring in chemistry and zoology, but cut his studies short because of a car accident and a lack of interest. It was at university that he met his first wife, Leigh Weetman, who was studying German and philosophy, and who also dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen Snodgrass, ''Peter Carey: A Literary Companion'' (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2010), pp. 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, he began to work in advertising. He was employed by various Melbourne agencies between 1962 and 1967, including on campaigns for [[Volkswagen]] and [[Lindemans (wine)|Lindeman's Wine]].&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His advertising work brought him into contact with older writers who introduced him to recent European and American fiction: "I didn't really start getting an education until I worked in advertising with people like Barry Oakley and [[Morris Lurie]]—and [[Bruce Petty]] had an office next door."&lt;ref&gt;Candida Baker, ''Yacker: Australian Writers Talk about Their Work'' (Sydney: Picador, 1986), pp. 54-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, he read widely, particularly the works of [[Samuel Beckett]], [[William Faulkner]], [[James Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Gabriel García Márquez]], and began writing on his own, receiving his first rejection slip in 1964, the same year he married Weetman.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, pp. 9-10.

Retrieved 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years he wrote five novels—''Contacts'' (1964–1965), ''Starts Here, Ends Here'' (1965–1967), ''The Futility Machine'' (1966–1967), ''Wog'' (1969), and ''Adventures on Board the Marie'' [sic] ''Celeste'' (1971). None of them were published. Sun Books accepted ''The Futility Machine'' but did not proceed with publication, and ''Adventures on Board the Marie Celeste'' was accepted by Outback Press before being withdrawn by Carey himself.&lt;ref&gt;Carey Papers, Fryer Library, University of Queensland, [https://archive.is/20120711102735/http://findaid.library.uwa.edu.au/dynaweb/findaid/carey1/@Generic__BookTextView/292;cs=default;ts=default;pt=851 Series A: Novels], A.1: Unpublished Novels.

''Fabulating Beauty: Perspectives on the Fiction of Peter Carey'' (Amsterdam and New York: Rodopi, 2005). Retrieved 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey's only publications during the 1960s were "Contacts" (a short extract from the unpublished novel of the same name, in ''Under Twenty-Five: An Anthology'', 1966) and "She Wakes" (a short story, in ''Australian Letters'', 1967). Towards the end of the decade, Carey and Weetman abandoned Australia with "a certain degree of self-hatred",&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Harford, ''Leaving Paradise: My Expat Adventure and Other Stories'' (Melbourne: Melbourne University Publishing, 2006), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; travelling through Europe and Iran before settling in London in 1968, where Carey continued to write highly regarded advertising copy and unpublished fiction.

==Middle career: 1970–1990==
Returning to Australia in 1970, Carey once again did advertising work in Melbourne and Sydney. He also kept writing, and gradually broke through with editors, publishing short stories in magazines and newspapers such as ''[[Meanjin]]'' and ''[[Nation Review]]''. Most of these were collected in his first book, ''The Fat Man In History'', which appeared in 1974. In the same year Carey moved to [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] in Sydney to work for [[Grey Global Group|Grey Advertising]].

In 1976, Carey moved to [[Queensland]] and joined an alternative community named Starlight in [[Yandina, Queensland|Yandina]], north of [[Brisbane]], with his new partner, the painter [[Margot Hutcheson]], with whom he lived in the 1970s and 1980s. He remained with Grey, writing in Yandina for three weeks, then spending the fourth week at the agency in Sydney. It was during this time that he produced most of the stories collected in ''War Crimes'' (1979), as well as ''[[Bliss (novel)|Bliss]]'' (1981), his first published novel.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Wroe, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/06/fiction.petercarey "Fiction's Great Outlaw",] ''The Guardian'', 5 January 2001. Retrieved 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey started his own advertising agency in 1980, the Sydney-based McSpedden Carey Advertising Consultants, in partnership with Bani McSpedden. After many years of separation, Leigh Weetman asked for a divorce in 1980 so that she could remarry and Peter agreed. In 1981, he moved to [[Bellingen, New South Wales|Bellingen]] in northern [[New South Wales]]. There he wrote ''[[Illywhacker]]'', published in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Vaughan [http://ehlt.flinders.edu.au/english/PeterCarey/Biography.html "Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116101229/http://ehlt.flinders.edu.au/english/PeterCarey/Biography.html |date=16 January 2013 }}, Peter Carey Website, 11 November 1997. Retrieved 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he married theatre director Alison Summers.  ''[[Illusion (musical)|Illusion]]'', a stage musical Carey wrote with Mike Mullins and composer [[Martin Armiger]], was performed at the 1986 [[Adelaide Festival of the Arts]] and a studio cast recording of the musical was nominated for a 1987 [[ARIA Award for Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album|ARIA Award]] (for which Carey as lyricist was nominated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawley|first1=Janet|title=In search of the truth and an entrepreneur|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ymtWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4001%2C5664924|accessdate=8 August 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 February 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQnfp4K4G4o | title = ARIA Awards 1987.mov | publisher = [[YouTube]].

The decade—and the Australian phase of Carey's career—culminated with the publication of ''[[Oscar and Lucinda]]'' (1988), which won the [[Booker Prize|Booker McConnell Prize]] (as it was then known) and brought the author international recognition. Carey explained that the novel was inspired, in part, by his time in Bellingen:

{{quote|I was living in Bellingen in the country. And the little church was down the road, and they wanted to take it away, zip: and I looked at that landscape and I thought – only 200 years ago this was a landscape that was full of Aboriginal stories. So I thought about a moment when that church that I knew, which was being removed from my landscape, might have arrived. I wanted it to arrive intact, whole. And I thought it would come on a barge. And, this is a totally irrational thought, it’s like a dream. I wanted this church, a wooden church, just what I saw, a church in that valley, to come along the Bellingen River on a barge gliding like a dream into the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sue Gillett, "''Oscar and Lucinda'': Shattering History’s Self-reflection", in Patrick Fuery (ed.), ''Representation, Discourse and Desire: Contemporary Australian Culture and Critical Theory'' (Melbourne: Longman Cheshire, 1994), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Move to New York: 1990–present==
Carey sold his share of McSpedden Carey and in 1990 moved with Alison Summers and their son to New York, where he took a job teaching creative writing at [[New York University]]. He later said that New York would not have been his first choice of place to live, and that moving there was his wife's idea.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Moore, [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2005/mar/17/wrong-about-japan-fathers-journey-his-son/ "Wrong About Japan: A Father's Journey with His Son",] ''San Diego Reader'', 17 March 2005.

''[[The Tax Inspector]]'' (1991), begun in Australia, was the first book he completed in the United States. It was followed by ''[[The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith]]'' (1994), a fable in which he explored the relationship between Australia and America, disguised in the novel as "Efica" and "Voorstand". This is a relationship that has preoccupied him throughout his career, going back to ''[[Bliss (novel)|Bliss]]'' (1981), ''[[Illywhacker]]'' (1985), and the early short stories. Nevertheless, Carey continued to set his fiction primarily in Australia and remained diffident about writing explicitly on American themes. In a piece on ''[[True History of the Kelly Gang]]'' (2001), Mel Gussow reported that:

{{quote|Periodically he has thought about writing an American-based novel, and he had started one dealing with litigation. But he put it aside for [[Ned Kelly]]. Explaining why he continues to set most of his books in Australia, he recalled that one of his students said, "When you change countries you lose your peripheral vision." In that sense, his view of America is still limited. Writing about Australia—its history and its heroes—his perspective is wide and deep.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/15/books/championing-fabled-bandit-for-novelist-rogue-australian-sums-up-his-underdog.html "Championing a Fabled Bandit; For Novelist, a Rogue Australian Sums Up His Underdog Culture",] ''New York Times'',
15 February 2001. Retrieved 29 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was only after nearly two decades in the United States that he embarked on ''[[Parrot and Olivier in America]]'' (2010), loosely based on events in the life of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. Carey says "Tocqueville opened a door I could enter. I saw the present in the past. It was accessible, imaginable."&lt;ref&gt;Charles McGrath, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/books/27carey.html "Peter Carey: At Home in Australia, New York and Writing",] ''New York Times'', 26 April 2010. Retrieved 29 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Carey continues to extend his canvas; in his most recent novel, ''The Chemistry of Tears'' (2012), "contemporary London is brought intimately in touch with ... a 19th-century Germany redolent of the Brothers Grimm".&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca K. Morrison, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-chemistry-of-tears-by-peter-carey-7600562.html "The Chemistry of Tears, by Peter Carey",] ''The Independent'', 30 March 2012. Retrieved 30 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 1998, Carey was accused of snubbing [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] by declining an invitation to meet her after winning the [[Commonwealth Writers Prize]] for ''[[Jack Maggs]]'' (1997). While Carey is a [[Australian republicanism|republican, in the Australian sense,]] he insists that no offence was intended:

{{quote|What happened, he explains, was that he had already been in England recently for a literary festival; he is booked for another trip soon, and had been travelling so much that he asked the prize organisers, "Would it be possible to see Her Majesty when I was actually in London?" "They thought it would be better just to cancel than for me to ask Her Majesty to do that. Then all this stuff started going out in English tabloids."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Attwood, "Carey on Dickens, the Queen and Ned Kelly", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 5 June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The meeting did eventually take place, with the Queen remarking, according to Carey, "I believe you had a little trouble getting here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/18542/ "The Great Australian Story is of Loss, Death",] ''Indian Express'', 17 February 2003. Retrieved 29 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The unhappy circumstances of Carey's break-up with Alison Summers received publicity (largely in Australia) in 2006 when ''[[Theft: A Love Story]]'' appeared, depicting the toxic relationship between its protagonist, Butcher Bones, and his ex-wife, known only as "the Plaintiff".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Wyndham, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/a-lovehate-story/2006/03/30/1143441267032.html "A Love–Hate Story",] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 1 April 2006.

Retrieved 30 March 2012. See also  Wyndham, "Ex-wife Comes Out Swinging", and Goldenberg, "Two Scribes Go to War".&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 he, alongside [[Michael Ondaatje]], [[Francine Prose]], [[Teju Cole]], [[Rachel Kushner]] and [[Taiye Selasi]], withdrew from the PEN American Center gala honouring the French satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' with its "Freedom of Expression Courage" award.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/27/peter-carey-among-writers-to-protest-pen-honour-for-charlie-hebdo&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that one of his reasons for doing so was "PEN’s seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population.".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/nyregion/six-pen-members-decline-gala-after-award-for-charlie-hebdo.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 204&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2015/04/30/145-pen-writers-thus-far-objected-charlie-hedbo-award-6/&lt;/ref&gt; PEN members, including Teju Cole and Deborah Eisenberg,&lt;ref&gt;https://theintercept.com/2015/04/27/read-letters-comments-pen-writers-protesting-charlie-hebdo-award/&lt;/ref&gt; wrote to PEN, objecting to its decision to give the award to Charlie Hebdo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14324">'''Produce traceability''' makes it possible to track produce from its point of origin to a retail location where it is purchased by consumers.

Produce [[traceability]] is an important link in protecting public health since it allows health agencies to more quickly and accurately identify the source of [[contamination|contaminated]] fruit or vegetables believed to be the cause of an [[outbreak]] of [[foodborne illness]], remove them from the marketplace, and communicate to the supply chain.

Since many fruits and vegetables are eaten raw, the produce industry‚ from farmer to retailer, works diligently to protect these foods from contamination. Despite their best efforts, foreign matter can occasionally contaminate produce in the [[field (agriculture)|field]] or [[orchard]], in packing or [[food processing|processing]], in transit or [[food storage|storage]].

Because traceability systems can provide information on the source, location, movement and storage conditions of produce, they also allow growers, packers, processors and distributors to identify factors affecting quality and delivery.

Beginning in 2008, an industry-led effort to enhance traceability throughout the entire produce supply chain was launched as the Produce Traceability Initiative.

== Trends in outbreaks of produce-related illness ==

An analysis of 3,500 [[food poisoning|food-poisoning]] outbreaks between 1990 and 2003 found that contaminated produce was responsible for the greatest number of individual foodborne illnesses. The study, by the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]], found that produce caused 428 outbreaks and 23,857 cases of illness.&lt;ref&gt;Contaminated Produce Top Food Poisoning Culprit, http://www.cspinet.org/new/200404011.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities note that several factors have contributed to the rise in outbreaks:
*Great consumption of fresh produce, especially cut fruits and vegetables.
*Wider distribution.
*Improved electronic reporting of outbreaks.
*An aging population more susceptible to foodborne illness.
*Unlike meat, which can be rid of bacteria through proper cooking, fresh produce is often meant to be consumed raw.&lt;ref&gt;E. Coli Outbreaks Reveal Food Safety Holes, The Washington Post, 12/11/2006, https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/10/AR2006121000903_pf.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SalmonellaNIAID.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Salmonella]]'' is a common source of [[foodborne illness]].]]

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration noted in 2007 that fruit and vegetable-related outbreaks of food poisoning are on the rise and had struck in spinach, tomatoes, lettuce and cantaloupes. The agency urged fruit and vegetable processors to adopt food safety plans similar to those in the meat industry.&lt;ref&gt;FDA Announces New Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable Growers, http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_story/0,3566,258356,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An outbreak of [[Salmonella Saintpaul|''Salmonella'' Saintpaul]] in 2008 was characterized by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|US Center for Disease Control]] as the largest foodborne outbreak in a decade. Some 1304 infected persons were identified in 43 states, at least 252 were hospitalized and two deaths were possibly linked to the outbreak. CDC noted that the trace back of fresh produce, such as tomatoes, through the supply chain could be very difficult and labor-intensive.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Lonnie J. King, D.V.M., CDC, 7/30/2008, https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2008/07/t20080730g.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the carrier item was ultimately determined to be jalapeño peppers, not tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;Salmonella found on pepper; FDA strengthens warning, http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/07/21/fda.salmonella/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==

Tracing of an item through various stages of production, manufacturing, processing, handling, transportation, sales and consumption is a widespread practice in today's world. Manufacturers may require purchasers to register ownership of a product to facilitate possible future recall for safety reasons or warranty fulfillment. The Post Office and package delivery companies make widespread use of tracking packages from pickup to delivery, even to destinations on the other side of the world.

Some often-recognized benefits of traceability include:
*Ability to determine the origin of a product, ingredient or component.
*Simplifies problem-solving in event of defective or contaminated product, ingredient or component.
*Allows issues to be more quickly identified, contained and resolved.
*Limits losses and lowers costs.
*Protects public health and safety.
*Builds trust and confidence in affected products, businesses or systems.
*Verifies that produce is locally grown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Top 10 Produce#cite note-0]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improves operating efficiencies for growers, packers and shippers.&lt;ref&gt;Produce Packing, http://www.redlineforproduce.com/main-solutions/redline-packing.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voluntary industry initiatives ==

In 1930, produce industry leaders sponsored legislation to require an internal trail of accounting between buyers and sellers along the entire produce marketing chain. This law, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) of 1930, set the foundation for basic traceability.&lt;ref&gt;Continuous Improvement Trends in Produce Traceability, http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/article.asp?id=2909&amp;sub=sub1&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the Bioterrorism Act of 2002 required food companies to keep records that could be traced in the produce supply chain (i.e.one step up and one step back).&lt;ref&gt;US Bioterrorism Act, 2002 Title III -- Protecting Safety and Security of Food and Drug Supply, http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm155769.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these records, many organizations in the fresh produce distribution chain have long maintained the ability to trace products inside their enterprise. In simple terms, they know where they got it and where they sent it, but with products that may move through multiple parties who may transform or comingle them, trying to connect many links quickly in time of crisis is a challenge.

Some 30 years ago, manufacturers and retailers created an organization called GS1 to improve the efficiency of the distribution of food and consumer goods to supermarkets. Today GS1 is a leading global organization dedicated to the design and implementation of global standards and solutions to improve the efficiency and visibility of supply and demand chains globally and across sectors.&lt;ref&gt;About GS1, http://www.gs1.org/about/overview&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GS1 Global Traceability Standard, {{cite web |url=http://www.gs1.org/traceability/gts |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105041335/http://www.gs1.org/traceability/gts |archivedate=2009-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its many programs was to develop the now-familiar bar code on products that can be scanned at checkout by retailers. GS1‚international standards will provide the foundation for the PTI.

Multiple shippers, distributors and retailers in the produce industry have endorsed the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI) to encourage adoption of whole chain traceability. The initiative's sponsor associations include United Fresh Produce Association (United Fresh), Canadian Produce Marketing Association (CPMA) and Produce Marketing Association (PMA).&lt;ref&gt;Produce Traceability Initiative, http://www.producetraceability.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Both internal and external traceability programs are needed in order to effectively track and trace product up and down the supply chain, achieving whole-chain traceability. At present, most companies have internal traceability programs but not external traceability. The PTI outlines a six-step course of action to achieve chain-wide adoption of electronic traceability of every case produce by the year 2012. Meanwhile, companies are putting into operation technologies that will support the PTI.

== Legislative and regulatory matters ==
Traceability of food is legally required in the European Union (Regulation 178/2002)with dedicated initiatives in EU countries like the UK&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/policy/quality-package-2010/certification-guidelines_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lmcni.com/farm-quality-assurance/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, various government agencies have oversight or regulatory control over different aspects of fresh fruit and produce production, processing and distribution. These include the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]]. Some groups have pushed for a single food-safety agency, on-farm improvements and improved reporting and surveillance of foodborne illness outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;More Food Safety Measures Needed on Farms, Says CSPI, http://www.cspinet.org/new/200404011.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft [[Food Safety Enhancement Act]] of 2009 was introduced May 27, 2009, in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. It would expand FDA authority, require registration of food manufacturers and processors, regulate crop cultivation and harvesting and other measures. After committee hearings and extensive amendment, the bill (HR2749) passed the House on July 30, 2009. HR2749 does not specifically endorse the PTI, or prescribe a traceability method or methodology, but instead Section 107 calls for regulations establishing a tracing system that includes:
#the establishment and maintenance of lot numbers;
#a standardized format for pedigree information; and
#the use of a common nomenclature for food

with a goal of identifying each person who grows, produces, manufactures, processes, packs, transports, holds, or sells food in as short a timeframe as practicable but no longer than 2 business days.  The measure has since died in the Senate. &lt;ref&gt;Text of H.R. 2749: Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009, http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2749&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, the White House created a Food Safety Working Group&lt;ref&gt;Report of President‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Food Safety Working Group, http://www.foodsafetyworkinggroup.gov/FSWG_Fact_Sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which has issued statements calling for a national traceability system that would enhance traceability of all food, but without specifically endorsing a particular approach.

== Technology ==

[[RFID|Radio-frequency identification]] and [[barcode]]s are two common technology methods used to deliver traceability.

[[File:RFID Chip 004.JPG|right|thumb|An example of a generic [[RFID]] chip.]]

RFID is often used with track-and-trace solutions, and has a critical role to play in supply chains. RFID is a code-carrying technology, and can be used in place of a barcode to enable non-line of sight-reading. Widespread deployment of RFID has been inhibited by certain limitations of the technology:   tag cost, tag readability and privacy issues. The cost of RFID tags currently limits their economic justification for item level tagging or case-level tagging in the produce industry. Reading RFID tags requires specialized equipment limiting their usefulness for consumers today. Product orientation, packing density and materials (in particular water, which is predominant in produce) can have a significant detrimental effect on read reliability of passive tags. Finally, the widespread use of RFID tags on consumer goods is anticipated to be contentious until privacy concerns can be satisfied.

[[File:Semacode-fr-wikipedia-org-wiki-pomme.png|right|thumb|Some produce traceability makers use [[Barcode#Matrix .282D.29 barcodes|matrix barcodes]] to record data on specific produce.]]

Barcoding is a common and cost-effective method used to implement traceability at both the item and case-level. Variable data in a barcode or a numeric or alphanumeric code format can be applied to the packaging or label. The secure data can be used as a pointer to traceability information and can also correlate with production data such as time to market and product quality.&lt;ref&gt;Traceability: Giving every product an authentic identity, Package Printing, June 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Packaging]] converters have a choice of three different classes of technology to print barcodes:
*[[Inkjet]] (dot on demand or continuous) systems are capable of printing high resolution (300 dpi or higher for dot on demand) images at press speed (up to 1000fpm). These solutions can be deployed either on-press or off-line.
*[[Laser printer|Laser]] marking can be employed to ablate a coating or to cause a color change in certain materials. The advantage of laser is fine detail and high speed for character printing, and no consumables. Not all substrates accept a laser mark, and certain colors (e.g. red) are not suitable for barcode reading. 
Thermal Transfer and Direct Thermal. For lower speed off-press applications, thermal transfer and direct thermal printers are ideal for printing variable data on labels.  

Software systems are available for managing traceability throughout the entire production, processing, marketing and distribution system.  Some of these software systems  combine multiple software modules allowing the producer to capture traceability information from all farming, processing and packing activities. Others,  capture data in the field and packing operations to integrate with retail buying platforms and carry data all the way to the end consumer.
Leveraging new advancements in mobile technology, food brands are now incorporating mobile messaging and QR codes on product labels. Consumers can text or scan the barcode with smartphones for immediate retrieval of product information.

Consumers can also trace the origins of their purchased produce at websites. Consumers can type a code found on a produce item into a search box at the tracing website and view information about the grower, field, and packing operation that the produce came from.

'''Richard Earl Caves''' (born 1 November 1931, [[Akron, Ohio]]) is an American economist, and Emeritus Professor of Economics at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| URL=http://economics.harvard.edu/people/richard-caves |title=Richard E Caves |publisher=Harvard.edu |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his work on Multinational enterprises,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lundvall, Bengt-Åke]], ed. ''National systems of innovation: Toward a theory of innovation and interactive learning.'' Vol. 2. Anthem Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; on industrial organization,&lt;ref&gt;Shane, Scott, and Sankaran Venkataraman. "The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research." ''Academy of management review'' 25.1 (2000): 217-226.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the creative industries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott, W. Richard]]. ''Institutions and organizations: Ideas and interests.'' Sage, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known within the motion pictures economics field as the author of a definitive book on the organization of the creative industries titled, ''Creative Industries: Contracts Between Art and Commerce.''{{cn|date=January 2017}}

== Education and academic career ==
Caves obtained his BA in economics at [[Oberlin College]] in 1953. He continued his studies at [[Harvard University]], where he obtained his MA in economics in 1956, and his PhD in 1958.&lt;ref name="CR 1974"&gt;Richard E. Caves, Marc J. Roberts, Brookings Institution (1974). ''Regulating the product: quality and variety.'' p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JS 2007"&gt;H. W. de Jong, William G. Shepherd (2007) ''Pioneers of Industrial Organization: How the Economics of Competition and Monopoly Took Shape.'' p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Caves started his academic career at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in the department of [[Joe S. Bain]]. In 1962 he moved back to Harvard University, where he was appointed Professor of Economics and lectured in industrial organization and international trade.&lt;ref name="CR 1974"/&gt; He served as Department Chairman from 1966 to 1969 and Chairman of the Ph.D in Business Economics from 1984 to 1997, and was also the George Gund Professor of Economics and Business Administration from 1986 to 1997, and subsequently the Nathaniel Ropes Research Professor of Political Economy, from 1997 on. He retired at Harvard in 2003, and became Emeritus Professor of Economics.&lt;ref name="JS 2007"/&gt; He also sat on the editorial board of the ''[[Review of Economics and Statistics]]'' from 1992 to 1996.

==Consulting work==
Caves has acted as a Consultant on various topics to various bodies. He was an adviser on international monetary problems for the [[US Council of Economic Advisers]] in 1961, and deputy to the Special Assistant to the President on foreign trade policy in the same year. From 1963-4 he was a member of the Review Committee for Balance of Payments Statistics at the US Bureau of the Budget, (also known as the Bernstein Committee). In 1964 he was also a member of the White House Task Force on Foreign Economic Policy. From 1972-3 he acted as a consultant to the [[Council of Ontario Universities]], and from 1975-6 he was a consultant to the [[Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration]].{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Contributions to Creative Industries==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2017}}
Caves specializes in industrial and political economics, having authored several books on industrial efficiency, productivity, and competition. Using this background, Caves provides new insight into the economics of the artistic and creative endeavor. In his book, ''Creative Industries:  Contracts Between Art and Commerce'', Caves looks at the visual and performing arts, cinema and television, sound recordings, book publishing, and toys and games to investigate how the theory of contracts and the logic of economic organization affect the production of "simple creative goods" and more "complex goods" like plays or motion pictures, which require teams of artists with diverse talents.

Under Caves' scrutiny, art collectors and moviegoers are consumers; gallery owners are "gatekeepers"; and critics are "certifiers."

Sociologist [[Paul DiMaggio]] commented that the book:

::promises to be a much-needed touchstone for work in cultural economics, the sociology of art and culture, and the interdisciplinary field of arts and cultural policy analysis.::

'''Richard "Rick" Crouch''' (born 6 September 1960) was a [[South Africa]]n politician and [[City Councillor]] in the [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] representing the official opposition [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]. Aside from being a former politician Crouch is a private investigator and a qualified commercial pilot.&lt;ref name="A Man For All Seasons"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.famouspublishing.co.za/crest/rick-crouch-8/|publisher=The Crest Magazine|title=A Man For All Seasons |date=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Crouch matriculated from Mansfield High School in 1979. He joined the Democratic Alliance's predecessor, the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]], in 1980 as a student activist. In 1986, Crouch was forced to leave South Africa because of his opposition to the [[Apartheid]] System. Crouch went to the [[United States]] where he continued his education and activism against Apartheid.

There were three attempts on Crouch's life after which he decided to seek sanctuary in the United States.&lt;ref name="A Man For All Seasons"/&gt;

==Career==

===As a Politician In South Africa===

In 1980 at the age of 19 Crouch became a member of the [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]], one of the two opposition parties represented in parliament at the time. From the period 1982, until he was forced into self-exile in the United States, Crouch was among those white South Africans who opposed the Apartheid System; this was known as the [[White resistance to apartheid#White resistance|White Resistance]].

Crouch, along with his family, decided in 2005 that he would return to South Africa to pick up where he left off in 1986 and run for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=vn20091214042123427C803202|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|title=Fury over plan to alter ward boundaries |date=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to South Africa, Crouch was elected to the Chairmanship of the [[EThekwini Metropolitan Municipality|eThekwini]] Ward 10 Branch of the Democratic Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ward10.co.za/about.asp#executive|publisher=DA Ward 10|title=Elected Executive |date=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as chairman Crouch has been actively involved in the community and in [[Upper Highway Area|Ward 10]].&lt;ref&gt;Jason Van Der Venter: ''The Highway Mail'', 12 February 2010, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Van Der Venter: ''The Highway Mail'', 11 December 2009, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cate Rayner: ''The Sunday Tribune'', 13 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch also served on the Executive Committee of the [[Hillcrest, KwaZulu-Natal|Hillcrest]] [[Community Policing]] Forum (CPF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ward10.co.za/pdf/HM-122009.pdf Don't Attend, Don't Complain]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2010 Crouch was elected as a City Councilor to the [[Durban]] City Council representing the residents of Ward 99 for the Democratic Alliance in the ANC majority Council.

In May 2011 Crouch was re-elected to the Durban City Council with an 83.87% majority, this time as a Ward Councillor representing the residents of Ward 10,&lt;ref name="Independent Electoral Commission"&gt;{{cite news|title=Local Government Elections 2011|url=http://www.elections.org.za/content/LGEPublicReports/197/Ward%20Winners/KN/ETH.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the suburbs of [[Gillitts]], [[Hillcrest, KwaZulu-Natal|Hillcrest]], [[Winston Park, KwaZulu-Natal|Winston Park]] and [[Kloof]].

In December 2012 Crouch was elected Councillor of the Year for 2012 by his colleagues.&lt;ref name="COWRA Ratepayers Association"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chairman’s Annual Report|url=http://www.cowra.co.za/chairmans-report-2013/|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of one of the most horrific accidents in Durban, the [[2013 Pinetown crash]], Crouch has been vocal about the Provincial Government's failure in stopping the carnage on Fields Hill, going as far as accusing the KwaZulu-Natal MEC of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, [[Willies Mchunu]], of practicing tombstone legislation.&lt;ref name="East Coast Radio"&gt;{{cite news |title=VIDEO: Councillor on Fields Hill truck restrictions |url=http://www.ecr.co.za/post/video-councillor-on-fields-hill-truck-restrictions/ |accessdate=5 September 2014 |newspaper=East Coast Radio |date=5 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150119025514/http://www.ecr.co.za/post/video-councillor-on-fields-hill-truck-restrictions/ |archivedate=19 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch has been campaigning for stricter rules for trucks on Fields Hill.&lt;ref name="Independent on Saturday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hill of horrors claims more lives|url=http://www.iol.co.za/ios/news/hill-of-horrors-claims-more-lives-1.1788358#.VLpaekeUeAk|accessdate=29 November 2014|newspaper=Independent on Saturday|date=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 2018, Crouch resigned his council seat in order to concentrate more on his expanding private investigation business and to spend more time with his family. &lt;ref name="Highway Mail"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ward 10 Councillor resigns|url=https://highwaymail.co.za/284286/ward-10-councillor-resigns/|accessdate=9 February 2018|newspaper=Highway Mail|date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an Investigator In the United States===

As well as becoming a commercial pilot while in the United States, Crouch formed a private investigation and [[digital forensics]] company. Through his work with celebrities and their high-profile attorneys, Crouch became known as "PI to the stars".&lt;ref name="The Mercury"&gt;{{cite news|title=Durban councillor was 'PI to the stars'|url=http://www.ward10.co.za/media/rick-bountyhunter.pdf|accessdate=4 September 2014|newspaper=The Mercury|date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the celebrities Crouch worked for through their attorneys are; musician Michael Jackson, actress Winona Ryder, musician Chris Brown, and the wife of Fred Astaire, Robyn, to name a few.&lt;ref name="The Mercury"/&gt;

He also assisted local law enforcement and the FBI in locating and returning fugitives to justice. Crouch and his company also worked as [[bounty hunter]]s, tracking down fugitives who had decided to "[[jump bail]]" and fled the jurisdiction.

Crouch authored and published a training manual and reference guide titled Bail Investigator Training Manual (Become a bounty hunter now) for investigators interested in or currently in the field of Bail Enforcement (Bounty Hunting).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===As an Investigator In South Africa===

In South Africa Crouch has formed a private investigation&lt;ref name="The Bugle"&gt;{{cite news|title=California's 'Pi To The Stars' sets up shop in Durban|url=http://thebugle.co.za/whatshot.php?type=view&amp;id=13747|accessdate=27 March 2015|newspaper=The Bugle|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and digital forensics company Rick Crouch &amp; Associates&lt;ref name="Western Cape Business News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital Forensics Expert Warns About Dangerous Smartphone Apps|url=http://www.wcbn.co.za/dailynews/7447.html|accessdate=24 February 2015|newspaper=Western Cape Business News|date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="My Office Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|title=How Sony Pictures was hacked|url=http://myofficemagazine.co.za/how-sony-pictures-was-hacked/|accessdate=27 January 2015|newspaper=My Office Magazine|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he holds the position of Managing Director.

Crouch has been described in local media as having a "Chuck Norris-like past".&lt;ref name="The Mercury"&gt;{{cite news|title=Durban councillor was 'PI to the stars'|url=http://www.ward10.co.za/media/rick-bountyhunter.pdf|accessdate=4 September 2014|newspaper=The Mercury|date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rolled throughput yield''' ('''RTY''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rolled Throughput Yield|url=http://www.leansigmacorporation.com/rolled-throughput-yield|work=Lean Six Sigma Articles|publisher=Lean Sigma Corporation|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the probability that a [[Business process|process]] with more than one step will produce a defect free unit. It is the product of yields for each process step of the entire process. 

For any process, it is ideal for that process to produce its product without defects and without rework. Rolled throughput yield quantifies the cumulative effects of inefficiencies found throughout the process. Rolled throughput yield and '''rolled throughput yield loss''' ('''RTYL''') are often used in [[Six Sigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.six-sigma-material.com/Rolled-Throughput-Yield.html |title=Rolled Throughput Yield (RTY) |publisher=Six-sigma-material.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation ==
Rolled throughput yield is calculated by multiplying the yields of each process step. Calculations can become increasingly complicated as more parallel processes are introduced. It is first necessary to calculate the yield of each process step. We can estimate the yield of a process step by dividing units accepted by the number of units produced for that step. Suppose a process step produced 10 units and only 8 were good units. The yield of that step would be 8/10 or 0.80. 

RTY example:

RTY = yield of process step 1 * yield of process step 2 * ... * yield of process N

Suppose a process had 3 steps. Step 1 produced 10 units and 2 were defective, the yield of step 1 would be 8/10 or 0.80, Step 2 had a yield of 0.9 and step 3 had yield of 100%. The rolled throughput yield for this entire process would be:

RTY = 0.80 * 0.90 * 1.0 = 0.72

RTY = 72%

The probability of this 3 step process producing  a defect free product is 72%

Rolled throughput yield loss is the inverse of RTY, RTYL = 1 - RTY

Total number of audited samples are divided by total sample size. This gives the "first pass accuracy". When it is divided by total yield it gives the rolled throughput yield.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13519">The '''National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices''' ('''NREPP''') is an online, searchable database of interventions designed to promote mental health or to prevent or treat substance abuse and mental disorders. The registry is funded and administered by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), part of the [[Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]. The goal of the Registry is to encourage wider adoption of [[Evidence based practices|evidence-based]] interventions and to help those interested in implementing an evidence-based [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] to select one that best meets their needs.

== Overview ==
[[File:National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP) Logo.jpg|thumb|right|Logo: SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP), www.nrepp.samhsa.gov]]In the behavioral health field, there is an ongoing need for researchers, developers, evaluators, and practitioners to share information about what works to improve outcomes among individuals coping with, or at risk for, mental disorders and substance abuse. Discussing how this need led to the development of NREPP, Brounstein, Gardner, and Backer (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Brounstein, P. J., Gardner, S. E., &amp; Backer, T. (2006). "Research to practice: Efforts to bring effective prevention to every community". Journal of Primary Prevention, 27(1), 91-109. doi: 10.1007/s10935-005-0024-6. {{PMID|16421654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; write:

{{quotation|It is important to note that not all prevention programs work. Still other programs have no empirically based support regarding their effectiveness. […] Many others have empirical support, but the methods used to generate that support are suspect. This is another reason to highlight the need for and use of scientifically defensible, effective prevention programs. These are programs that clearly demonstrate that the program was well implemented, well evaluated, and produced a consistent pattern of positive results.}}

The focus of NREPP is on delivering an array of standardized, comparable information on interventions that are evidence based, as opposed to identifying programs that are “effective” or ranking them in effectiveness. Its peer reviewers use specific criteria to rate the quality of an intervention’s evidence base as well as the intervention’s suitability for broad adoption. In addition, NREPP provides contextual information about the intervention, such as the population served, implementation history, and cost data to encourage a realistic and holistic approach to selecting prevention interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, D. (2010). [http://www.cars-rp.org/publications/Prevention%20Tactics/PT09.06.10.pdf "A paradigm shift in selecting evidence-based approaches for substance abuse prevention”]. Prevention Tactics, 9(6), 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the interventions reviewed by NREPP have been implemented successfully in more than 229,000 sites, in all 50 States and more than 70 countries, and with more than 107 million clients.&lt;ref&gt;National Register of Health Service Providers in Psychology.

(2011). [https://archive.is/20140412210518/http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=62&amp;page=303 “A review of mental health interventions in SAMHSA’s National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices”].

== Submission process ==
NREPP holds an open submission period that runs November 1 through February 1. For an intervention to be eligible for a review, it must meet four minimum criteria:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?browsePath=2011%2F09%2F09-16%5C%2F6%2FHealth+and+Human+Services+Department&amp;granuleId=2011-23757&amp;packageId=FR-2011-09-16&amp;fromBrowse=true “National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices”], 76 FR 180, Sept. 16, 2011, 57742-57744&lt;/ref&gt;
# The intervention has produced one or more positive behavioral outcomes (p ≤ .05) in mental health, mental disorders, substance abuse, or substance use disorders use among individuals, communities, or populations.
# Evidence of these outcomes has been demonstrated in at least one study using an experimental or quasi-experimental design.
# The results of these studies have been published in a peer-reviewed journal or other professional publication, or documented in a comprehensive evaluation report.
# Implementation materials, training and support resources, and quality assurance procedures have been developed and are ready for use by the public.

Once reviewed and added to the Registry, interventions are invited to undergo a new review 4 or 5 years after their initial review.

== Review process ==
The NREPP review process consists of two parallel and simultaneous review tracks, one that looks at the intervention’s Quality of Research (QOR) and another that looks at the intervention’s Readiness for Dissemination (RFD). The materials used in a QOR review are generally published research articles, although unpublished final evaluation reports can also be included. The materials used in an RFD review include implementation materials and process documentation, such as manuals, curricula, training materials, and written quality assurance procedures.

The reviews are conducted by expert consultants who have received training on NREPP's review process and rating criteria. Two QOR and two RFD reviewers are assigned to each review. Reviewers work independently, rating the same materials. Their ratings are averaged to generate final scores.

While the review process is ongoing, NREPP staff work with the intervention’s representatives to collect descriptive information about the intervention, such as the program goals, types of populations served, and implementation history.

The QOR ratings, given on a scale of 0.0 to 4.0, indicate the strength of the evidence supporting the outcomes of the intervention. Higher scores indicate stronger, more compelling evidence. Each outcome is rated separately because interventions may target multiple outcomes (e.g., alcohol use, marijuana use, behavior problems in school), and the evidence supporting the different outcomes may vary. The QOR rating criteria are:

# Reliability of measures
# Validity of measures
# Intervention fidelity
# Missing data and attrition
# Potential confounding variables
# Appropriateness of analysis

The RFD ratings, also given on a scale of 0.0 to 4.0, indicate the amount and quality of the resources available to support the use of the intervention. Higher scores indicate that resources are readily available and of high quality. These ratings apply to the intervention as a whole. The RFD criteria are:

# Availability of implementation materials
# Availability of training and support resources
# Availability of quality assurance procedures

=== Reviewers ===
QOR reviewers are required to have a doctoral-level degree and a strong background and understanding of current methods of evaluating prevention and treatment interventions. RFD reviewers are selected from two categories: direct services experts (including both providers and consumers of services), or experts in the field of implementation. Direct services experts must have previous experience evaluating prevention or treatment interventions and knowledge of mental health or substance abuse prevention or treatment content areas.

=== Products and publications ===
NREPP publishes an intervention summary for each intervention it adds to the Registry. The summaries, which are accessed through the Registry’s search engine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/Search.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802021708/http://nrepp.samhsa.gov/Search.aspx |archivedate=2010-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; contain the following standardized information:

* A brief description of the reviewed intervention, including targeted goals and theoretical basis
* Study populations (age, gender, race/ethnicity)
* Study settings and geographical locations 
* Implementation history
* Funding information
* Comparative evaluation research conducted with the intervention
* Adaptations
* Adverse effects
* List of studies and materials reviewed
* List of outcomes
* Description of measures and key findings for each outcome
* Research design of the studies reviewed
* Quality of Research and Readiness for Dissemination ratings
* Reviewer comments (Strengths and Weaknesses)

NREPP also maintains an online Learning Center. Offerings include learning modules on implementation and preparing for NREPP submission; a research paper on evidence-based therapy relationships; and links to screening and assessment tools for mental health and substance use.

== Predecessor system ==
The registry originated in 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/pdfs/07bulletinnrepplegacy_final.pdf “National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices adds information on former model programs initiative to web site”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410180456/http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/pdfs/07bulletinnrepplegacy_final.pdf |date=2012-04-10 }} (Press release). SAMHSA. August 21, 2007. Retrieved 2012-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; and has gone through several changes since then. The predecessor to today's NREPP was the National Registry of Effective Prevention Programs (later renamed the National Registry of Effective Programs and Practices), which was developed by SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention as part of the Model Programs initiative. Procedures under this earlier registry were developed to review, rate, and designate programs as Model, Effective, or Promising.&lt;ref&gt;Brounstein, P. J., Gardner, S. E., &amp; Backer, T. (2006). “Research to practice: Efforts to bring effective prevention to every community”. Journal of Primary Prevention, 27(1), 91-109. doi: 10.1007/s10935-005-0024-6. {{PMID|16421654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on extensive input from scientific communities, service providers, expert panels, and the public, the procedures were revised. Reviews using the new NREPP system began in 2006, and the redesigned Web site debuted in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/advisories/0703013707.aspx “SAMHSA launches searchable database of evidence-based practices in prevention and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713043201/http://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/advisories/0703013707.aspx |date=2007-07-13 }} (Press release).

Story. Deloitte ME.&lt;/ref&gt; Saba &amp; Co., as the firm was previously known, began as an [[auditing]] firm based in Jaffa Street, [[Jerusalem]]. The ‘30s and ‘40s witnessed the expansion of Saba’s network of operation with the establishment of offices in [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], and [[Kuwait]]. In 1948, the Head Office was relocated to [[Beirut]], Lebanon, where it is still located today in the upscale suburbs of [[Hazmieh]].&lt;ref&gt; Maluf, Ramez. A Reflection of Choices: The Saba &amp; Co. Story. Deloitte ME.&lt;/ref&gt;
Alongside geographic expansions, the Firm also broadened its services. Fuad S. Saba, his partners, and their successors, introduced services such as tax consultation, and arbitrations, together with a trademark and patent department. The TMP department grew significantly over the years and resulted in the formation of Saba &amp; Co. Intellectual Property.&lt;ref&gt; Maluf, Ramez. A Reflection of Choices: The Saba &amp; Co. Story.

'''Sewa Haji Paroo''' (1851 in [[Bagamoyo]] – 10 February 1897 in [[Zanzibar]]) was a businessman of Indian origin. He was the main trader for the Sultan of Zanzibar. He also founded and financed the ''Sewa Haji Hospital'' which today is part of the [[Muhimbili Hospital]] in [[Dar es Salaam]]. Sewa Haji is considered the first philanthropist of East Africa. For example, he financed the building of a school, a mosque and several wells in his native Bagamoyo. Also he equipped the famous expedition of [[Henry Morton Stanley]].

'''Tacit Relocation''' in [[Scots Law]] is a principle whereby [[leasing|leases]] of land or buildings are renewed on the same conditions as previously existed if no notice of termination is given within the requisite period, subject to a minimum period of one year, applying in perpetuity until such notice is given. The concept is also known in the [[law of South Africa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8165">'''Uninsured employer''' in the United States is a term to identify an employer of workers under circumstances where there is no form of insurance in place to provide certain benefits to those workers.  More specifically, it is a term used in [[Workers' compensation|workers’ compensation]] law to identify an employer who does not have some form of worker’s compensation [[insurance]] or [[self-insurance]] coverage in effect at the time of, or during the time of, a claimed injury.

All States require that employers provide injury benefits coverage to their employees. These benefits are called workers’ compensation insurance coverage.  This kind of coverage is to be distinguished from [[Legal liability|liability]] coverage, which covers the premises and the owner/occupier of the space from claims made by non-employees for injuries on the premises. It is also to be distinguished from [[health insurance]], which covers only medical bills for non-work incurred conditions.

Protection can be accomplished through a traditional insurance policy for workers’ compensation coverage. Coverage can also be accomplished by way of compliance with various State self-insurance laws (usually reserved for larger employers) requiring substantial [[Surety bond|bonding]] and self-funding.  For example, public agencies are usually permissibly self-insured.

When the employer has no specific insurance, or arrangement for the provision of workers’ compensation benefits to injured employees, the employer is then referred to as an uninsured employer.

==Criminal law as per state ==
This status is highly negative one in most States and often deemed a crime under State law. When there are no funds available to cover the benefits, and resulting bills for such benefits, the State usually steps in and provides the funding; hence the State’s interest in making the failure to have coverage both legally and financially painful. Most often this involves complete repayment to the State, fines, penalties, business closure, and the loss of legal defenses.  The seriousness of the status by the uninsured employer is often underestimated due to unfamiliarity with the system and the belief that, like automobile uninsured motorist law, a quick settlement can be made by the uninsured for a modest amount to end the process.  This is contrary to State law and recent studies in California have shown that for 2009 average claim cost is upwards of $60,000 and continually rising.

==State-based uninsured employers fund==
Most often US states set aside fund to pay claims to injured workers under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/wc/insurance/uef_info_doc.htm | title = Worker's Compensation: Uninsured Employers Fund | publisher = Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples:

===California Uninsured Employers Fund===
Two special funds pay claims to injured workers under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/claims.html | title = Division of Workers' Compensation - Uninsured Employers Benefits Trust Fund (UEBTF) &amp; Subsequent Injuries Benefits Trust Fund (SIBTF) | publisher = California Department of Industrial Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Claims are paid from the Uninsured Employers Benefits Trust Fund (UEBTF) when illegally uninsured employers fail to pay workers' compensation benefits awarded to their injured employees by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. The UEBTF is funded by a small tax on every Workers' Compensation policy that is written, and the UEBTF typically places liens on assets of the uninsured employers until the debt is repaid.  To do so, a Special Notice of Lawsuit must be properly served upon the uninsured employer to give the UEBTF legal jurisdiction for the recovery.
* The Subsequent Injuries Benefits Trust Fund (SIBTF) is a source of additional compensation to injured workers who already had a disability or impairment at the time of injury. For benefits to be paid from the SIBTF, the combined effect of the injury and the previous disability or impairment must result in a permanent disability of at least 70 percent. The fund enables employers to hire disabled workers without fear of being held liable for the effects of previous disabilities or impairments. SIBTF benefit checks are issued to injured workers by the SIBTF Claims Unit after benefits are awarded by the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board.

===New York Uninsured Employers Fund===
* If an employee is hurt when there is no workers' compensation policy in effect and that employee chooses to file a workers' compensation claim, the employer will be liable for the actual cost of medical care and compensation payments, in addition to penalties. If a corporation has failed to secure workers' compensation coverage, the president, secretary and treasurer of a corporation are personally liable for the medical care, compensation payments, penalties and possible criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wcb.ny.gov/content/main/Employers/UEF.jsp | title = Workers' Compensation Coverage: Uninsured Employers Fund | publisher = New York State Workers' Compensation Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York State Workers' Compensation Board's Bureau of Compliance oversees uninsured claims. The Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF) is the funding mechanism for compensation and medical payments to injured employees whose employer was not properly insured at the time of the accident.

==Risks to an uninsured employer==
The risks to an uninsured employer are many, and can threaten the continued existence and viability of the firm. These risks include:

# Possibility of business closure
# Large fines imposed by the California Labor Commissioner ($2,000-$10,000 per Employee)
# Presumption of negligence
# Exposure to [[civil suit]]s by injured workers
# [[Criminal conviction]] and personal fines
# Imposition of a 10% surcharge in addition to the disability claim, plus attorney fees for the worker

==Dealing with problems==
While an uninsured employer does face a real problem, such as a prospective fine, prosecution, or employee injury, or is actually sued, there are steps the employer can take to minimize the consequences. Several established law firms can represent the employer in all administrative hearings and appeals, and advise the employer how to proceed. The goal for the uninsured employer is not only to achieve resolution to the immediate problem, but also to protect the assets of the firm, and to reach an accommodation with the regulatory agencies that enables the company to go forward in compliance with the law. The Uninsured Employer Benefit Trust Fund in CA does not have funding or staff to mitigate the value of an uninsured claim.  UEBTF merely pays the claim and all costs as claimed by the Applicant/Plaintiff, and assesses the cost against the uninsured employer.  If legal counsel is retained by the uninsured employer, there is at least opportunity to mitigate the value/reimbursement to UEBTF. Additionally, legal counsel can sometimes mitigate the administrative penalties, and negotiate repayment plans that allow the business to continue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5988">The '''union density''' or '''union membership rate''' is the ratio of the number of employees who are members of [[trade union]]s to all the employees in a country or population. This is lower than the [[collective agreement coverage]] rate, which refers to all people in work places where terms are collectively agreed. Trade unions [[collectively bargain]] with employers for improved pay, conditions, and voice at work by means of the increased [[bargaining power]] that employees have together compared to what they would have as individuals. The number of people who are covered by collective agreements is higher than the number of union members, and in many cases substantially higher, because when trade unions make collective agreements they aim to cover everyone at work, even those who have not joined a union.

==Causes==
The causes of higher or lower union membership are widely debated. Common causes are often identified as including the following:

*whether a jurisdiction encourages [[sectoral collective bargaining]] (higher coverage) or [[enterprise bargaining]] (lower coverage)
*whether collective agreements to create a [[closed shop]] or allow [[automatic enrollment]] in union membership are lawful
*whether the government, for instance through a [[Ministry of Labour|Ministry]] or [[Department of Labour]], actively promotes collective agreement coverage with a power to impose terms if employers refuse to bargain with the workforce
*whether a country enables collective agreements to be extended by government regulations to all workers when the coverage rate reaches a majority in a sector, or similar level
*whether laws on collective bargaining and strikes are more or less favourable

==By country==
In the United States in 2015 there were 14.8m union members, and 16.4m people covered by collective bargaining or union representation. Union membership was 7.4% in private sector, but 39% in the public sector. In the five largest states, [[California]] has 15.9% union membership, [[Texas]] 4.5%, [[Florida]] 6.8%, [[New York (state)|New York]] 24.7% (the highest in the country), and [[Illinois]] had 15.2%.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], ‘[http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf Union Members – 2015]’ (28 January 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden union density was 69% in 2015-2017.&lt;ref&gt;Excluding full-time students working part-time.

'''''Utenti Pubblicità Associati''''' (UPA) is the Italian Advertisers' Association, based in [[Milan]].

==History==
''Utenti Pubblicità Associati'' (UPA) was founded in 1948 to represent the interests of Italian advertisers. The association engages actively and proactively with industry, political, legislative and regulatory bodies, while helping its members enhance the effectiveness of their advertising through a range of services. These currently include free consultancy, market monitoring data and surveys from a variety of media research companies that are either owned or supported by UPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upa.it/eng/activitiesservices/advertising-media/index.html UPA website list of member services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association is a member of the [[World Federation of Advertisers]] (WFA), supports the [[Italian Advertising Self-Regulation Institute]] and sponsors the [[University Ca’ Foscari]] of Venice Master in Business Communications.

The UPA's Board and active members include the directors of many of Italy's leading companies and multinationals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upa.it/eng/profileandmission/boarddirections/index.html UPA Board of Directors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giulio Malgara presidency===
Much of the groundwork for the UPA's recent achievements was laid by Giulio Malgara, its President from 1984 to 2007 and currently President of Quaker Europe&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEED7103FF932A15755C0A967958260 New York Times: "Realignment At Quaker Oats"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Chairman and Managing Director of the bakery products company [[Malgara Chiari Forti SpA]]. Malgara was particularly influential in giving the UPA a strong research basis, founding the television audience research company [[Auditel]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2005/f/sezioni/politica/cdarai3/schedamalg/schedamalg.html La Repubblica: "Malgara, the man who invented Auditel"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2005/luglio/16/Bisio_alla_Gialappa_comici_sinistra_co_9_050716003.shtml Corriere della Sera article on TV advertising&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lorenzo Sassoli de Bianchi presidency===
[[Lorenzo Sassoli de Bianchi]], the founder of Italy's leading health food company, [[Valsoia]], and President of the [[Bologna Museum of Modern Art]] (MAMbo), took over from Malgara in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilvalore.leonardo.it/?sezione=8&amp;idnews=982&amp;ln=0 Il Valore: "Giulio Malgara succeeded by Sassoli de Bianchi as President of the UPA"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Widely respected by Italian industrialists for Valsoia's use of cross-media advertising and his personal skills as a communicator and consensus-builder, Sassoli de Bianchi was appointed President on a modernising agenda. Acting in the participative style for which he is renowned and applying the methodology he developed at Valsoia, Sassoli de Bianchi immediately worked with the organisation's active members to formulate a clear mission statement and objectives, as well as to restructure the governance of the association and to increase participation, accountability, innovation and transparency.

The projects launched under this programme include a research centre, initiatives to promote regional representation and national growth, and an extensive series of services and strategic partnerships to help members orient themselves with respect to the complex and rapidly changing social, regulatory and technological developments in modern advertising.

Lorenzo Sassoli de Bianchi was reappointed President of the UPA for a further 3 years in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primaonline.it/2009/07/01/72496/sassoli-de-bianchi-upa-le-aziende-per-vivere-hanno-bisogno-della-pubblicita Lorenzo Sassoli de Bianchi reappointed President of the UPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as playing a [[lobbying]] and educating role, the UPA adopts a proactive partnership approach in its dealings with the government, legal and regulatory authorities, advertising agencies and the media, supported by issuing regular trend reports and analyses. These initiatives have consolidated the already influential role, profile and authority of the UPA, which organised a large international conference held in Rome in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuttocambia.it/eng Website for the International Conference "Tutto cambia. Cambiamo tutto?"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Branding Awards''' is an international award presented to global and national brands for their work and achievements in [[brand management|branding]].&lt;ref name=TTR&gt;{{cite news|title=Taiwan’s Acer and Chatime Honoured at the 2014 World Branding Awards|url=http://taiwantradereview.com/taiwans-acer-and-chatime-honoured-at-the-2014-world-branding-awards/|accessdate=5 December 2014|publisher=Taiwan Trade Review|date=29 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Branding Forum]], a registered global non-profit organisation based in London, organises the awards.&lt;ref name=star-maybank&gt;{{cite news|title=Maybank awarded Brand of the Year at World Branding Forum|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Business/Business-News/2014/10/29/Maybank-awarded-Brand-of-the-Year-at-World-Branding-Forum/?style=biz|accessdate=5 December 2014|publisher=The Star|date=29 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three tiers of awards. A Global Award is presented to international brands, a Regional Award is presented to brands that are top in several countries in a particular geographic region, and a National Award is presented to brands from participating countries.&lt;ref name=wba-entry/&gt; The awards trophy is on display at the [[Museum of Brands, Packaging &amp; Advertising]] in London.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; The award's Brand of the Year logo is a [[trademark|registered trademark]].&lt;ref name="EUIPO"&gt;{{cite web|title=World branding Awards Brand Of The Year|url=https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/014433148|website=EUIPO|publisher=European Union Intellectual Property Office|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominations, judging and scoring==
Nominations for the awards can be made by brands owners, custodians, agencies or the public.&lt;ref name=wba-entry&gt;{{cite web|title=[edit] Nomination &amp; Voting Branding Entries &amp; Public Voting|url=https://awards.brandingforum.org/the-awards/|website=World Branding Awards|publisher=World Branding Forum|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three tiers of awards: a Global Award is presented to international brands that have a presence in ten or more countries, on three or more continents, limited to the top 100 global brands in any particular year; a Regional Award is presented to brands that are top in several countries in a particular geographic region; and a National Award which is presented to the top brands in participating countries at the awards. Brands that are global winners are not awarded again on a national level.&lt;ref name=wba-entry/&gt;

Winners of the awards are judged through three streams: brand valuation, consumer market research and public online voting. There are also other awards for individuals voted for by the World Branding Forum Advisory Council, which consists of luminaries from the world of branding.&lt;ref name=TTR/&gt; Winners go through a stringent assessment process to determine the level of work put in by a brand for their branding activities. The level of trust that the brands’ customers and the public have for the brand is also taken into account.&lt;ref name=borneo-post&gt;{{cite news|title=SEGi, sole winner of international education brand award for Malaysia|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/11/19/segi-sole-winner-of-international-education-brand-award-for-malaysia/|accessdate=13 February 2015|publisher=Borneo Post|date=19 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
