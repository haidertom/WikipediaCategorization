{{Years in film}}
The decade of the '''2000s in film''' involved many significant developments in the film industries around the world, especially in the technology used. Building on developments in the 1990s, [[computer]]s were used to create effects that would have previously been more expensive, from the subtle erasing of surrounding islands in ''[[Cast Away]]'' (leaving [[Tom Hanks]]' character stranded with no other land in sight) to the vast battle scenes such as those in ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]], ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[300 (film)|300]].

In addition, [[film genre]]s not known for their popular appeal in North America became increasingly attractive to filmgoers: films in foreign languages like ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''; and [[documentary film]]s like ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', ''[[Super Size Me]]'', and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', became very successful.

The 2000s saw the resurgence of several genres. [[Comic book]] [[superhero film]]s became a mainstream blockbuster genre following the releases of ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''. The film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' similarly sparked the revival of [[epic films]], while the [[Bollywood]]-inspired ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' sparked the revival of [[musical film]]s in the [[Western world]], where Bollywood musical films such as ''[[Lagaan]]'' and ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' also began gaining mainstream exposure. The [[battle royal|battle royale]] genre also began with the release of [[Japanese film]] ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]''.

Also gaining popularity was the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) to produce films.  These types of films were originally seen in the [[1990 in film|1990s]] with the likes of ''[[Toy Story]]'', and
''[[Antz]]'', but CGI films became more popular in 2001 with the release of ''[[Shrek]]''.  Other popular CGI films include ''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]'', ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'', ''[[Bee Movie]]'', ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]'', ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'', ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Chicken Little]],'' ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Flushed Away]]'', ''[[Happy Feet]]'', ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'', ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'', ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'', ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'', ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]'', ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'', ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'', ''[[Shark Tale]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]'', ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. In addition, ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' became the second animated feature ever to receive an Oscar nomination for The Best Picture.

The '''''Albani Torlonia Altarpiece''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Pietro Perugino]],  executed in 1491 and housed in the [[Torlonia Collection]], [[Rome]]. It was commissioned by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future [[pope Julius II]].

==Description==
The [[polyptych]] includes two levels: the lower one has at center a Nativity scene and, at the sides, two arched panels depicting [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Jerome]] and [[Saint George]], sharing the same background. The upper one as, in the center, a [[lunette]] with a ''Crucifixion'', flanked by two small panels, with the Annunciation Angel and the Annunciation to the Virgin, set in a double portico.

The main scene, that of the Nativity, is perhaps inspired by that painted by Perugino in the [[Sistine Chapel]], which is now lost. The Child is housed in the Virgin's dress, lying on a red cushion; [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph]] are adoring him, flanked by two kneeling angels and, behind, the ox and the donkey. The scene is set inside a perspective portico, while the background includes a series of hills.

He was a member of the [[Leningrad Union of Artists]], regarded as one of the founders of the [[Leningrad School of Painting|Leningrad School of painting]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.''- Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – pp.12-18, 22, 359, 363, 365, 368, 373, 378, 380-383, 390, 401, 439, 441, 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Boğdan Sarayi''''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for "Palace of Bogdania ([[Moldavia]])") was an [[Eastern Orthodox]] church in [[Turkey]]'s largest city, [[Istanbul]]. Erected in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]], its original dedication is unknown. In the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]] the small edifice, being dedicated to [[St. Nicholas]] of [[Myra]], was known as '''''Agios Nikólaos tou Bogdansarághi''''' ({{lang-gr|Ἅγιος Νικόλαος τοῦ Βογδανσαράγι}}).&lt;ref name=ja384&gt;Janin (1953), p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mw108&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the Istanbul residence of the Moldavian ''[[hospodar]]''′s legation to the [[Ottoman Porte]].&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt;&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; The building - whose parts above ground have almost completely disappeared - is a minor example of [[Byzantine architecture]] in [[Constantinople]].

==Location==
The remains of the church lie in [[Istanbul]], in the district of [[Fatih]], in the neighborhood ({{lang-tr|[[Mahalle]]}}) of Salmatomruk,  not far from [[Edirnekapı, Istanbul|Edirnekapı]] (the ancient [[Walls_of_Constantinople#Gate_of_Charisius|Gate of Charisius]]), 250 m. east of the [[Chora Church|museum of Chora]] and 100 m north of the [[Kefeli Mosque]], both former Byzantine religious buildings.&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt; The ruins of the edifice are hardly accessible, as of 2012, as they are enclosed in a tire shop at ''Draman Caddesi 32''.&lt;ref name=tayprojpg41&gt;{{Citation

==History==
===Byzantine Age===
[[File:Hagios Nikolaos.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The chapel viewed from northeast in a drawing of 1877, from A.G. Paspates' ''Byzantine topographical studies'']]
The building was erected on the slope of the [[Seven hills of Istanbul|sixth hill of Constantinople]] which overlooks the [[Golden Horn]]. Nothing is known about the edifice in the Byzantine Age, but due to its position it was likely an annex of the monastery of ''[[St. John the Baptist]] in the Rock'' ({{lang-gr|Ἅγιος Ιωάννης Πρόδρομος ἐν τῇ Πὲτρα}}, pr. "Hagios Ioannis Prodromos en ti Petra"), one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople, where, among other [[relics]], the [[Arma Christi|instruments]] of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of [[Christ]] were kept.&lt;ref name=ja385&gt;Janin (1953), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, due to its small dimensions it is not likely that the building was the ''[[katholikon]]'' (main church) of the monastery.&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt; According to some sources it was erected in twelfth century, during the [[Komnenoi|Komnenian]] age,&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt;&lt;ref name =ma255&gt;Mamboury (1953), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; while for others it is a [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] foundation of the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; Its north-south orientation shows that it was originally erected not as a church, but rather as a funerary chapel.&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt;&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt;

===Ottoman Age===
After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottomans in 1453, in sixteenth century the chapel became part of the large land estate bought by the ''[[hospodar]]'' of [[Moldavia]] to host his envoys in Istanbul, and named accordingly ''Boğdan [[Saray (building)|Saray]]i'' ("Moldavian Palace").&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt;&lt;ref name =ma255/&gt; In this respect, its usage as private chapel of a patrician house represents a rarity in the Ottoman city. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the complex - a coveted property because the high border wall protected it by fires - was leased by the [[Sultan]] as residence for several foreign envoys, among them the Swedish ambassadors to the Ottoman Porte P. Strasburg and C. Rolomb, who sojourned in Istanbul in 1634 and 1657/58 respectively.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; In June 1760 the [[Phanariote]] John Callimaches endowed it to the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] monastery of [[Agiou Panteleimonos monastery|St. Pantaleon]] on [[Mount Athos]].&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt; The complex burned down in the fire of 1784, and afterward the land was only used as a market garden.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt;  The possession of the church by the Athos monastery was confirmed again by relatives of Callimaches in January 1795 and August 1814, but the Russian monks showed little interest in the church's restoration, possibly because of the [[Russo-Turkish Wars|state of war]] between the [[Russian Empire]] and the Sublime Porte.&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt; In the nineteenth century the edifice steadily decayed and after the [[1894 Istanbul earthquake]] fell into ruin. In 1918 a German archaeologist pursued clandestine excavations and found in the crypt three unnamed tombs.&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt; In the second half of the 20th century the remains of the building were enclosed in a shanty ({{lang-tr|[[Gecekondu]]}}), and today—lying inside a tire shop—they are hardly accessible.&lt;ref name=ki17&gt;King (1999), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012 the parts above ground have almost disappeared, and only the crypt still exists.&lt;ref name=ja385/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Bogdan saray 01.jpg|right|250px|thumb|View of the building's remains in 1908, showing the brickwork pattern.]]
The edifice had a rectangular plan, with sides of 6.20 m and 3.50 m,&lt;ref name=ja384/&gt; and was originally composed of two storeys, consisting of an above ground chapel and a subterranean [[crypt]].&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; The chapel was surmounted by a dome with [[pendentive]]s insisting on two transverse arches across the walls, and ended towards North with a [[Bema]] and a polygonal [[apse]] adorned externally with niches, while the crypt was surmounted by a [[barrel vault]] and had also a simple apse.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt;  The edifice's  [[brickwork]] consisted of courses of three or four rows of white stones alternating with a row of red [[brick]]s, obtaining a chromatic effect typical of the late Byzantine period. Its north-south orientation suggests the building's use as a funerary chapel, rather than as a church, since churches in Constantinople were almost always oriented in east-west direction.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt; The attested past existence of remains of walls perpendicular to the structure indicates the possibility that this was part of a larger complex, most likely the monastery of St. John of Petra, one of the largest monasteries of Constantinople.&lt;ref name=mw108/&gt;

'''''Bords de la Marne''''', also called '''''Les Bords de la Marne''''' and '''''The Banks of the Marne''''', is a [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] oil painting on canvas created in 1909 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. In this work can be seen a departure from the representation of the observable world. The subject is treated neither as a confined symbolic allegory nor as a cultural background indicated by specific real appearance, but is instead presented in concrete and precise geometric terms. The development of [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[abstract art]] in the work of Gleizes was necessarily a transformation from the synthetic preoccupation with his subject matter. The passage of Gleizes' painting from an epic visionary figuration to total abstraction was foreshadowed during his proto-Cubist period. ''Bords de la Marne'' measures 54&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;65&amp;nbsp;cm, and is currently in the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon|Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]].

==History==
Gleizes' concern for construction, structural rhythms and simplification was dominant even through his short-lived Fauve-like period, when his color brightest and impasto thickest. By treating his subject matter in geometric terms and by modifying curves to become sharp, angled lines, Gleizes consistently held his compositions to the surface of the picture plane. He began to divide the surface into a series of interlocking angles and rectangles of contrasting forms. The overall rose tonality was employed by Gleizes to counter the illusion of depth. In the process Gleizes created some of his first [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] works. His awareness of [[Paul Cézanne]]—even in the handling of paint—is evident during this period that lasted roughly from 1907 to 1909, though the process of geometric simplification is more akin to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Pont-Aven School|Pont Aven]] and [[Les Nabis]] principles than to Cézanne. ''Bords de la Marne'' and other painting by Gleizes during this phase (e.g., ''Paysage dans les Pyrènnes (Landscape in the Pyrenees Mountains)'', 1908, and ''Paris, Les Quais'', 1908), also bear marked affinity to the work of [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], despite the fact that the two artists had not yet become friends or known about each other's work.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Robbins, Daniel, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abbaye de Créteil 1906.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Abbaye de Créteil]] 1906 : First row- Charles Vildrac, René Arcos, Albert Gleizes, Henri-Martin Barzun, Alexandre Mercereau. Second row- Georges Duhamel, Berthold Mahn, d'Otémar]]
Though the physical scope and appearance of the world at the time reflected the vast changes in progress, Gleizes expected much more. His vision responded to the conditions of modern life but he did not seek to imitate those conditions, as Gleizes later accused the [[Futurism|Futurist]] artists of doing.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Des 'ismes'; vers une Renaissance plastique, Tradition et Cubisme'', Paris, Povolovzky, 1927, p. 168 (first published in La Vie des Lettres et des Arts, 1921)&lt;/ref&gt; Gleizes and his former associates of the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] (notably [[Jules Romains]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]] and [[:fr:René Arcos|René Arcos]]) dreamed of a synthetic concept of the possibilities of the future, one of collectivity, multiplicity and simultaneity. "Their vision" writes art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "invariably encompassed broad subjects which, although dealing with reality, were restricted neither by the limitations of physical perception nor by a separation of scientific fact from intellectual meaning—even symbolic meaning. Even their images of simultaneity were synthetic because scope was too vast, both physically and symbolically, for one man's limited participation".&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

==Structural rhythms==
Gleizes' style changed rapidly between 1905 and 1909. From a paint application technique akin to [[Impressionism]] and a palette similar to [[Neo-Impressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], his painting became more robust. Color and brushwork became simpler, his structural rhythms more pronounced, though softened by curvilinear forms. A synthetic view of the world—presenting the remarkable properties of space, time, multiplicity and diversity—suddenly materialized. These paintings were a visual parallel to the ideals verbally realized in the Abbaye de Créteil poetry.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

:Experienced in the treatment of inclusive landscapes (writes Robbins), he nevertheless had to solve the problem of balancing many simultaneous visions on a painted surface. Gleizes mitigated the distortion of distance by linear perspective, by flattening the picture plane; his skies were on the same plane as the simple flat objects in front and, although scale was retained, a form in the distance would be brought to the foreground by making it bright. Every element of the painting had to be reduced to clear planes, treated as uniformly as possible, for attention lavished on any one part would jeopardize the whole dehcate balance. In 1908, although color range expanded in the winter river scenes and contracted in the summer landscapes, the horizon line consist ently crept higher and higher.

[[File:Henri le Fauconnier, 1908, Ploumanac'h.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Henri le Fauconnier]], 1908, ''Ploumanac'h'', Museum Kranenburgh, Bergen, the Netherlands]]
[[Henri Le Fauconnier]], living in Brittany in comparative isolation, was pursuing similar ends. A former student at the [[Académie Julian]] and a friend of [[Maurice Denis]] and [[Les Nabis]], he was painting rocks and seascapes in a progressively geometric fashion. He exhibited his seascapes at the 1909 [[Salon des Indépendants]] but Gleizes had not yet exhibited in that salon and appears not to have seen the work until they met through [[Alexandre Mercereau]] the same year. Mercereau, perhaps, realized the extent of their common interests.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1910-12, Les Arbres, oil on canvas, 41 x 27 cm. Reproduced in Du "Cubisme", 1912.jpg|thumb|Albert Gleizes, 1910, ''Les Arbres (The Trees)'', oil on canvas, 41&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;27&amp;nbsp;cm. Reproduced in Du "Cubisme", 1912]]
According to Gleizes, Mercereau is also responsible for having introduced him to [[Jean Metzinger]] in 1910—the same year that Mercereau included these three artists in a Moscow exhibition, probably the first [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] Exhibition. Prior to meeting, Gleizes and Metzinger had been linked by [[Louis Vauxcelles]]' disparaging comments on "des cubes Blafards"&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7527626n/f1.item Louis Vauxcelles, ''Gil Blas'', March 18, 1910]. Quoted in John Golding, ''Cubism'', London, 1959, p. 22. See ''Toison d'Or'', Moscow, 1908, nos. 7-10, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; which likely referred to Metzinger's ''Portrait of Apollinaire'' and Gleizes' ''[[L'Arbre, The Tree (Gleizes)|L'Arbre (The Tree)]]'' (1910) at the Salon des Indépendants. Mercereau had previously included Gleizes' ''Les Brumes du Matin sur la Marne'' in a Russian exhibition of 1908.

:"Given Mercereau's long standing delight in promoting group activity", writes Robbins, "it is easy to recognize his pleasure in having brought together three painters whose works exhibited similar interests and who could be identified with his own synthetic ideals, ideals which had been influential in the Abbaye's development". As organizer of the literary section of the Salon d'Automne of 1909, he was able to introduce Gleizes to painters exhibiting there and to introduce his own concepts to the world of painting".&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

In 1909 and 1910 a significant group of artists came together through Mercereau. The entire group—including [[:fr:Roger Allard|Allard]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Barzun]], Beauduin, [[Pierre Castiaux|Castiaux]], [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Jouve]], [[Fernand Divoire|Divoire]], [[Parmentier (Gleizes)|Parmentier]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]], [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuși]], [[:fr:Théo Varlet|Varlet]] and even [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Apollinaire]] and [[André Salmon|Salmon]]—became sympathetic to the ideas of the Abbaye. During the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organized a great ''Journée portes ouvertes'' at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, and soon principle theorist of [[Futurism]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1911"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Alexandre Mercereau'', Vers et Prose, Paris, no. 27, October–December, 1911, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''From Symbolism to Cubism: The Abbaye of Créteil", The Art Journal, 1963-64, XXIII 2. pp. 111-116&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon and Apollinaire were only peripheral members, participating in divers literary and artistic circles, but clearly Apollinaire's conception of Cubism was influenced by the epic notions found in the old Abbaye circle. In his preface to the 1911 Brussels Indépendants, Apollinaire wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...thus has come a simple and noble art, expressive and measured, eager to discover beauty, and entirely ready to tackle those vast subjects which the painters of yesterday did not dare to undertake, abandoning them to the presumptuous, old-fashioned and boring daubers of the official Salons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This conception is not based on the studies of Picasso and Braque (what became known years later as the analytical Cubism), which had annihilated subject matter almost entirely and confined it to exceedingly flat space. Instead, it suggests the broad concepts held by the Mercereau-Gleizes circle, concepts at that time visible only in the paintings of Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Fernand Léger]]. The subjects treated by these Cubists differed significantly from the isolated still lifes or figures chosen by Picasso and Braque.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

Allard wrote of Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Metzinger, in a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus is born at the antipodes of impressionism an art which cares little to imitate the occasional cosmic episode, but which offers to the intelligence of the spectator the essential elements of a synthesis in time, in all its pictorial fullness.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Allard, ''Au Salon d'Automne de Paris'', L'Art Libre, Lyon, October–November, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The development of abstract art in the work of Gleizes and Delaunay was necessarily a transformation from the synthetic preoccupation with epic themes. In order to understand the passage of Gleizes' painting from an epic visionary figuration to abstraction, it is important to understand his [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] period and its differences from the proto-Cubist works of Picasso and Braque.

If ''Bords de la Marne'' involved the interaction of vast space with geometry, Gleizes' work would soon project speed and action, with simultaneity, commerce, sport, and flight: with the modern city and the ancient country, with boats, the harbor and the bridge and, above all, with time. The dimension of time—involving memory, tradition and accumulated cultural thought—created the reality of the world.

"In poetry", writes Robbins, "this post-symbolist attempt to achieve new forms had to break decisively with the old unities of time, place and action. Unity of scene did not correspond with the reality of modem life; unity of time did not correspond with the culturally known and anticipated effects of change. That is why Mercereau (as Metzinger noted&lt;ref name="Metzinger, 1911" /&gt;) shifted his scenes so violently, why Barzun tried to solve the problem of simultaneously developing lines of action by choral chanting. Similarly Gleizes and his painter friends sought to create a vision free from introverted or obscure imagery which could treat collective and simultaneous factors. This necessitated a new kind of allegory opposed to the old meaning which presented one thing as the symbolic equivalent of another. A tentative precedent perhaps existed in Courbet's ''Real Allegory'' which, however, might have been considered an allegorical failure by Gleizes and Metzinger because Courbet "did not suspect that the visible world only became the real world by the operation of thought".&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', published by Eugène Figuière, Paris, 1912. The authors begin their work with a discussion of Courbet&lt;/ref&gt;

A departure from the representation of the observable world is quite apparent in ''Bords de la Marne''. This subject was treated neither as a confined symbolic allegory nor as a cultural background indicated by specific real appearance, but was instead presented in concrete and precise geometric terms. Gleizes' ''Bords de la Marne'' is not strictly an anecdotal scene. Rather, it represents a multiple panorama; the analysis of volume relationships in a departure from the grand principles of structure, color and inspiration, a permanently changing land. Gleizes confronts us not with one action or place, but with many: not with one time, but with past and future as well as present.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

The '''Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit''' or '''CAID''' is a community based non-profit organization. CAID fosters and promotes the link between [[contemporary art]]s and contemporary society through exhibitions, performances, critical and public discourse and the funding of contemporary arts and art related activities.

== History ==
CAID was founded in 1978 by a group of [[Detroit]] area artists, including Charles McGee and Jean Heilbrunn [http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=8694]. In the years since its inception, CAID has existed in several different forms, and has generated many events that have directly supported the arts in Detroit.

In 1980, CAID sponsored ''Exhibition Sites 1, 2, and 3''. This show included performance, conceptual and video art at [[Hart Plaza]] during the Republican Convention. In 1984, CAID crossed the border to work with Artcite in Windsor. In both 1984 and 1985, CAID sponsored ''A Road Show'', an exhibition that toured a number of Michigan cities, as well as Chicago. A four-part lecture series was held at the [[Detroit Institute of Art]] in 1989, and again in 1991. In that same year area artists were invited to create art for the ''Art Time Capsule'', buried in Harmonie Park, as well as a plethora of other visual, musical and performance art events throughout the past 26 years.

After little activity during the mid to late 1990s, CAID re-emerged on the Detroit art community in the fall of 2002 with the four-part series ''LINK''. ''LINK'' included an exhibition of Detroit-based artists at the Detroit Contemporary gallery, a symposium on Detroit music at [[Wayne State University]], an electronic-music party called ''Frequency'' at the Detroit Contemporary, and ''Motor City Breakdown'', a live-music show at the Magic Stick [http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=4326].

In the winter of 2004, CAID presented ''unCAGEd: the exploration of non-intention'', a mixed-medium event based on the theories of [[John Cage]], presented in collaboration with Ann Arbor's University Musical Society in celebration of a performance by New York's [[Merce Cunningham]] Dance Company. ''unCAGEd'' featured a varied group of Detroit and [[Ann Arbor]]-based exploratory artists, musicians and performers working/playing in the Cage frame of chance, reflecting the pure energy felt in Cunningham's guided improvisation.

In November 2004, after 25 years of nomadic existence, CAID took up residence at 5141 Rosa Parks Boulevard, in the space formerly occupied by the Detroit Contemporary [http://www.thedetroiter.com/nov04/caid.html]. The newly remodeled gallery serves as an exhibition and performance space, along with the administrative offices for the organization.

== Funk Night Raid ==
Early Saturday morning, May 31, 2008, a Detroit police [[SWAT]] team raided the museum during its monthly [http://www.funknight.com Funk Night], forced more than 130 people to the ground at gunpoint [http://www.freep.com/article/20080603/NEWS05/806030400/Detroit-police-raid-art-gallery-ticket-130][http://blogs.metrotimes.com/index.php/2008/09/detroit-drops-all-caid-raid-charges/][http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/08/swat-team-nation.html] citing "after-hours dancing and drinking" without proper permits [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/08/12/130812fa_fact_stillman?currentPage=10]
charged 116 people with loitering and impounded 44 cars [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/08/12/130812fa_fact_stillman?currentPage=10].  The raid was later ruled unconstitutional by a [[United States district court|United States District Court]] in a lawsuit by the [[ACLU]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20140319204827/http://www.aclumich.org/CAID][https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/federal-judge-rules-caid-raid-arrests-and-car-seizures-unconstitutional].

'''''Coucher de soleil no. 1''''' (also called '''''Landscape''''', '''''Paysage''''', '''''Landschap''''', or '''''Sunset No. 1''''') is an oil painting created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]] (1883–1956). ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'' is a work executed in a mosaic-like [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style with a [[Fauvism|Fauve]] palette. The reverberating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light at the core of [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory.

''Coucher de soleil'' was exhibited in Paris during the spring of 1907 at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] (n. 3457), along with ''[[La danse, Bacchante|Bacchante]]'' and four other works by Metzinger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16028coll4/id/16983 Jean Metzinger, ''Coucher de soleil'', Société des artistes indépendants: catalogue de la 23ème exposition, 1907, no. 3457, p. 225]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting had been in the collection of [[Helene Kröller-Müller]] since 1921 or prior,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogusvandesc00kr#page/154/mode/2up Catalogus van de schilderijen verzameling van Mevrouw H.

==Description==
''Coucher de soleil no. 1'' is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 72.5 x 100&amp;nbsp;cm (28.5 by 39.25 in), signed ''J.Metzinger'' (lower right), and titled on the verso "Coucher de soleil no. 1". Also on the verso is another painting by Metzinger representing a river scene with ships. The work represents two nude women relaxing in a lush Mediterranean landscape with semi-tropical vegetation, hills, trees, a body of water and a radiating setting sun beyond.&lt;ref name="Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R.

The two nudes appear to play a secondary role in the overall composition due to their small size. But their prominent location in the foreground and the provocative nature of [[public nudity]] propels them to a position that cannot be ignored.&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;

In this luscious setting—as in ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]'' by [[Henri Matisse]]—Metzinger makes use all the colors in the [[spectrum]] of visible [[light]]. Unlike Matisse's work, Metzinger's brushstrokes are large, forming a mosaic-like lattice of squares or cubes of similar size and shape throughout, juxtaposed in a wide variety of angles relative to one another, creating an overall rhythm that would otherwise not be present.&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;

Evidence suggests that this work was completed prior to Metzinger's paintings entitled ''[[La danse, Bacchante|La danse (Bacchante)]]'' or ''[[Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape]]'': (1) there exists an oil on canvas study of the latter dated circa 1905-1906, located at the University of Iowa with the title ''Two Nudes in a garden'', 91.4 x 63.8&amp;nbsp;cm with a similar radiating sun above the bathers. (2) The brushstrokes are smaller in size consistent with Metzinger's style of late 1905. (3) In 1906 and 1907 Metzinger's brushstrokes became larger and more organized, structured within a highly geometrized framework already [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] in appearance. (4) As its name implies, ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'' might have been the first in a series of sunsets. Though no other works by Metzinger are known by the titles ''Coucher de soleil no. 2'' or ''No. 3'', the artist did produce other works with sunsets during the same period: ''Landscape with Fountain'', for example, an oil on canvas measuring 53.3 x 73.6&amp;nbsp;cm; ''Paysage pointilliste'', 1906-07, an oil on canvas measuring 54.5 x 73&amp;nbsp;cm; ''Matin au Parc Montsouris'', ca. 1906, oil on canvas, 49.9 x 67.7&amp;nbsp;cm; or even ''La tour de Batz au coucher de soleil'', 54 x 73&amp;nbsp;cm, an oil on canvas ca. 1905.&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;

Indeed, these clues would seem to suggest ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'' was painted during the later months of 1905, or early 1906, just before Metzinger and [[Robert Delaunay]] began painting portraits of one another,&lt;ref&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985, pp. 34-42&lt;/ref&gt; rather than circa 1908 as indicated by the Kröller-Müller Museum.&lt;ref name="Kröller-Müller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;

==Neo-Impressionism, Divisionism==
[[File:Matisse-Luxe.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Henri Matisse]], 1904, ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]'', oil on canvas, 98.5 × 118.5 cm (37 x 46 in), [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]] 
The [[Fauvism|Fauves]] (many of whom would become [[Cubism|Cubists]]), were heavily influenced by [[Neo-Impressionism]], calling upon rational and scientific thought and creating highly abstract visions with the goal of producing the effects of real color-light. Mechanical brushwork suppressed the personality of the artist in an act of conspicuous defiance against the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt; The [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] too would strip away the casual and accidental features of reality, revealing the true 'essence of form.' Whether such a revelation could be backed up by a scientific theory or not, there were still examples that could be codified. The problem was that pigments ''reflect'' light, they are not a light source themselves. Colors in the spectra of light did not respond in the same way as color pigments painted on canvas. For example, red and blue light rays result in white light, but the same colors in pigments make violet.&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com.es/ Alexander Mittelmann., ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, in ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger's response in ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'', in addition to illustrating actual radiation emanating in concentric circles from the sun, was to separate colors in such a way as to avoid mixtures, leading to inert tones. Contrary to the Impressionists related hues, often placed on top of one another while still wet—leading to a result the Divisionists found dull—contrasting hues placed side by side for the effect or creating optical vibrations were essential to Divisionists.&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

The basic elements of art—the line, particle of color—like words could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, in addition to the particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting affect on the works produced in the coming years by [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Gino Severini]].&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1906-07, ''Paysage au disque'', oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]
[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1913, Premier Disque, 134 cm, 52.7 inches, Private collection.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1912-1913, ''Le Premier Disque'', 134 cm (52.7 in), Private collection]]
The impulse toward abstraction was a primary quality of the time, even prior to Metzinger's ''Sunset No. 1''. "Neo-Impressionism" wrote [[Paul Adam (French novelist)|Paul Adam]], "wants to reproduce the pure phenomenon, the subjective appearance of things. It is a school of abstraction."&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

By "abstract," writes Robert Herbert, "writers and painters of the period did not mean "devoid of reference to the real world", as we now use the term. They meant to draw away from nature, in the sense of disdaining imitation in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of ''idea'', and represented the dominance of the artist over the mere stuff of nature. In embryo, the Symbolists and Neo-Impressionists did establish the philosophical defense of pure abstraction, but nature still formed part of the basic dialogue."&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

By 1905 Metzinger began to favor the abstract qualities of larger brushstrokes and luminous colors. Following the lead of [[Georges Seurat]], [[Henri-Edmond Cross]] and [[Paul Cézanne]], Metzinger began incorporating a new geometry into his works that signified a further departure still from naturalism.&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

Robert Herbert writes of Metzinger's ''Coucher de soleil'' and its importance during the Neo-Impressionist period and thereafter:
:"At the Indépendants in 1905, his paintings were already regarded as in the Neo-Impressionist tradition by contemporary critics, and he apparently continued to paint in large mosaic strokes until some time in 1908. The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other [...] in prominent rectangles of pigment. (In the sky of [Coucher de soleil, 1906-1907, Collection Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller] is the solar disk which Delaunay was later to make into a personal emblem.)"&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and of Delaunay's ''Paysage au disque'' (1906-1907), writes Herbert, "is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..."&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

"The Neo-Impressionists" according to Maurice Denis, "inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life."&lt;ref name="Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

In 1904-05 [[Henri Poincaré]] discovered a graphical tool for visualizing different types of polarized light (known as Poincaré sphere). The [[Poincaré homology sphere]], also called Poincaré dodecahedral space, is a particular example of a homology sphere. Being a [[spherical 3-manifold]], it is the only homology 3-sphere, besides the [[3-sphere]] itself, with a finite [[fundamental group]]. While it is not known the extent to which such discoveries influenced Metzinger's representation of the radiating sun in ''Coucher de soleil no. 1'', his interest and prowess in mathematics is well documented.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

[[File:DickBrewer BillytheKid Regulators1620 0910.jpg|thumb|''Dick Brewer, Billy the Kid and the Regulators'' by Andrew Thomas]]

'''''Dick Brewer, Billy the Kid and the Regulators''''' is a painting by artist Andrew "Andy" Thomas that depicts the [[Lincoln County Regulators|Regulators]] as they hunt down William Morton and Frank Baker for the murder of businessman [[John Tunstall]]. This painting was sold at the Midwest Gathering of Artists in [[Carthage, Missouri]] on September 11, 2010.&lt;ref name="carthagepress" /&gt;

==Background==
The event depicted in this painting by Andrew Thomas occurred during the [[Lincoln County War]]. [[Richard M. Brewer|Dick Brewer]], [[Billy the Kid]], and the other Regulators were given warrants for the murderers of Tunstall, which included William Morton. After a five-mile gun chase, Morton surrendered on the condition that he and Baker would not be killed. On the third day on the trip back to [[Lincoln, New Mexico|Lincoln]] however, Morton and Baker ended up dead. The Regulators said that the prisoners had tried to escape; the [[James Dolan (Lincoln County War)|Dolan]] forces believed that the Regulators had actually murdered Baker and Morton, but the only witnesses were the potential murderers themselves.&lt;ref name="Utley" /&gt;

'''Ellen M. Mitchell''' (1838–1920) was an American [[philosopher]], educator and education reformer. She was one of the first women to be appointed lecturer in a university,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindermann|first=Kate|title=Ellen Mitchell|url=http://www.societyforthestudyofwomenphilosophers.org/Ellen_Mitchell.html|work=Women Philosophers|publisher=Kate Lindermann|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to writing philosophy, literature and literary criticism.

==Biography==

Ellen M. Smith was born in the Village of [[Geddes, New York]] to Harriet H. Rowland and Edwin R. Smith, the eldest of their four children. She graduated from the Cortland Academy, Homer, N.Y. in 1860, with a major in Classics. Ellen, also, taught school in Syracuse.  During the Civil War her brother, Edwin R. Smith, Jr., served in New York's 149th Regiment. Edwin was killed in the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 3, 1863. He was initially reported severely wounded; the family tried to determine whether the Confederates had captured him and treated him in the Confederate field hospital at Ellwood Manor. However, Edwin was lost without a trace.  Ellen adopted the nom de plume "Ella Ellwood" in identification with Edwin, writing with the name Ellwood during the war. Following Edwin's death, Ellen resigned her teaching position in Syracuse and moved to Cairo, Illinois, where she lived with her uncle, Ward L. Smith and his wife, Anna.

During the war, Ellen moved to [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. She wrote for the Missouri Republican newspaper of St. Louis, continuing to use the nom de plume Ella Ellwood until the war's end.  She married St. Louis attorney and Union civil war veteran Joseph W. Mitchell in the Presbyterian Church of Alton, Illinois in 1867. While in St. Louis, she attended the Hegelian philosophy lectures which had been organized there by William T. Harris. She and Joseph also contributed to a literary and philosophical discussion group called "The Pen &amp; Pencil Club," often hosting the meetings in their home.  
 
Ellen and Joseph moved to [[Denver, Colorado]] in 1878, seeking effective treatment for Joseph's illness (possibly tuberculosis). However, Joseph died in February, 1879. Ellen remained in Denver, where she taught school and, then, lectured on philosophy and literature in the [[University of Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindermann |first=Kate |title=Ellen Mitchell |url=http://www.women-philosophers.com/Ellen-Mitchell.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130725202858/http://www.women-philosophers.com/Ellen-Mitchell.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2013 |work=Women Philosophers |publisher=Kate Lindermann |accessdate=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, she actively contributed to the Kant Club, and to the Fortnightly Club, of Denver.

Ellen M. Mitchell attended the first session, in July 1879, of the Concord Summer School of Philosophy, which was hosted in Concord, Mass. by Bronson Alcott on his property.  William T. Harris organized the school and its programs after leaving St. Louis, with the intention of unifying the Hegelian Idealism of the St. Louis Philosophical Society with the Transcendentalism of Concord.  At that first 1879 session, Ellen became acquainted with many women from across the country who were leading the struggle for women's suffrage, as well as the efforts to improve educational and social policy standards.  Among those she met while attending the 1879 Concord session was Julia Ward Howe who, later, became the president of the Association for the Advancement of Women.  The Concord School played an important role in helping to build networks of policy reformers; more than one half of those who attended were women.  Mrs. Mitchell participated in the annual Concord School of Philosophy every year, until its final session in 1888. She wrote, in 1880, a description of the lectures during the previous session, and she delivered a paper titled "Friendship in Aristotle's Ethics" during the Concord session of July, 1887.

Mitchell actively contributed to the Association for the Advancement of Women, regularly attending the annual congresses.  At the 12th Woman's Congress in 1884, held at Baltimore, she delivered a paper titled "A Study of Hegel."  By the A.A.W.'s 13th Congress, held at Des Moines, Iowa, she was Vice Pres. of the A.A.W. for Colorado.  At that same 13th  Annual Congress, Prof. Maria Mitchell, of New York, and Ellen M. Mitchell, of Chicago (Mrs. Francis Mitchell) also were serving the A.A.W. as V.P.'s for the states of New York and Illinois, respectively.  At the A.A.W.'s 18th Women's Congress, at Toronto in 1890, Mitchell delivered a paper titled, "The Dramas of Henrik Ibsen."  Continuing as V. P. of the A.A.W. for Colorado, she was "Chairman" of the A.A.W.'s Committee for Topics and Papers. For the A.A.W.'s 19th Woman's Congress in 1891, at Grand Rapids, Mich., she continued serving as V.P. for Colorado, as the Chair of the Topics &amp; Papers Committee, and she delivered a paper titled "The Real and the Ideal in Art."

Throughout her career, Mitchell advocated, and endeavored to realize, the noble aspiration for American philosophy which was advocated by Walt Whitman in his great poetic essay manifesto of 1871, "Democratic Vistas".  

After 1893, she permanently returned to Geddes (by then a part of Syracuse) to care for her parents. In Syracuse, she organized and led the Round-Table of Syracuse, a literary and philosophical community adult seminar group. The Round Table began in 1894 and continued for more than 20 years.  To assist the participants in their studies and discussions, Mitchell wrote and privately published a series of essays on Dante, Tennyson, and Goethe. The title for one of the essays, "The Way of the Soul" is adapted from Hegel's introduction to his Phenomenology of Spirit. In her introduction to the essay, she wrote:
     "The Round Table of Syracuse is composed of a number of women who meet, season after season, to study and discuss the great books of the world.  They believe with Lowell that the truths which literature interprets can be known only by study of the supreme literary masterpieces.  They seek to trace the influence of literature upon art and their reciprocal relation to the history and social movements of an epoch.
      A clear yet spiritual interpretation of the author's meaning is diligently sought at first without the aid of any commentary.  This plan stimulates the members to do their own thinking, to discover for themselves what the original work has to say that they can comprehend.  Later, the help of commentaries is welcomed, ideas are compared and sifted, and opinion separated from knowledge.
      One aim of the Round Table is rational conversation.  By question and answer, by informal discussion, by the living contact of mind with mind, thought is quickened and stimulated, and many a problem independently suggested and solved.
      The studies pursued during the season of 1901-1902 relate for the most part to the dominant ideas of the nineteenth century as expressed in literature, art, philosophy, and science.  Selections from the great prose writers were followed by a comparative study of Tennyson's 'In Memoriam' and Dante's 'Divine Comedy'.  To sum up the spiritual gain of this work is impossible.  The following essay simply seeks to trace 'The Way of the Soul' out of the 'shadow of night' into the 'daybreak.'   Syracuse, March 15, 1902."

Ellen M. Mitchell died in Syracuse, N.Y. May 14, 1920 at the age of 81, three months before the 19th amendment to the constitution was ratified, finally establishing universal suffrage.  She is interred beside her parents in the Myrtle Hill Cemetery of the Village of Geddes.

In her obituary, May 16, 1920, the Syracuse Herald newspaper commented:  "The Herald records with sincere regret the death of Mrs. Ellen M. Mitchell, for many years the gentle preceptor and oracle of the Syracuse Round Table.  The value of her services to the literary life of the city cannot easily be overestimated....Mrs. Mitchell's personality was singularly lovable, and it imparted a magnetic charm to her discourse and her teaching.  On its intellectual side the City of Syracuse is much the poorer by her death."

==Philosophy==
"A Study of Greek Philosophy", Mitchell's book length philosophical discussion, was published in 1891 by S.C.Griggs &amp; Co. The book contains 36 chapter essays, chronologically presenting the development of the classical Greek tradition in philosophy, extending from the pre-Socratics to the neo-Platonists.  Her book is the first book length philosophical analysis to have been written in America by a woman scholar.  It guides university students, philosophy specialists, educators, and adult scholars through a program of study of the ancient Greek tradition in philosophy.  The book is, also, the first book to preserve the legacy of ancient Greek philosophy in the New World.

In her introduction to her book, Mitchell wrote:

     "It may be interesting to my readers to know something of the genesis of this book.  Twelve years ago, in St. Louis, a little band of women used to assemble every week to study and discuss the problems of philosophy.  I led the circle as teacher and learner.  Beginning with the study of Greek thought, and applying myself diligently to the works of the great masters, and the commentaries to be found in English, German and French, I sought continually to make clear to others what became clear to myself.  At the end of two years, the circle in St. Louis was exchanged for one in Denver, but with unabated interest and enthusiasm on my part and that of my co-workers.  At their request, the verbal exposition became a written one, and finally developed into its present form.  Whatever merit it possesses is due in part to those who have helped me towards the light by their eager questions, their hesitation at the obscure, their quick appreciation of spiritual truth hidden beneath obscure phraseology, their loving fellowship and sympathy.  Above all other teachers I am indebted to Dr. William T. Harris. From him I first learned to seek philosophy in the history of philosophy, and to find it everywhere as the spiritual interpretation of the universe.  I have also received help and stimulus from the expositions and lectures of Prof. F. Louis Soldan, of St. Louis; Prof. D.J. Snider, of Chicago; Prof. Thomas Davidson, of New York; from the Concord School of Philosophy; and the Kant Club, of Denver."

Reviews of the book were offered by prominent scholars and thought leaders when it was published in 1891:
     * Dr. W.T. Harris, U.S. Commissioner of Education: "It shows on every page evidence of scholarship in the best lines, and of real insight into the questions discussed." 
     * S.H. Howison, Prof. of Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley: "I am deeply gratified to read in English, at last, a work on the great Greek thinkers that does not 'condescend' toward them as if they were infantile minds compared with moderns, but brings to convincing light the truly permanent value of their thinking."
     * Edmund Clarence Stedman: "This survey, with its analysis of the Greek schools, is the most clear and inclusive, as far as my knowledge extends, that has been made in our language within so compact a space. It is of genuine value."
     * Prof. Louis J. Block, Chicago: "Admirable in spirit and excellent in matter.  I do not know where a clearer and more useful history of Greek philosophy is to be found."
     * Frank Sanborn, in Springfield Republican: "There is probably no manual better than this for those who would begin the study of the Greek masters, and yet the book lacks the dryness of manuals and has an interest for all thoughtful readers."
     * Caroline K. Sherman, in Chicago Herald: "This is no superficial hand-book giving a hasty survey of Greek thought - no condensed, simplified form of a larger treatise. It is a careful study from original sources of the great thinkers of antiquity, and it is presented to willing students in a form that will tempt them to go likewise to the same original sources."
     * Science, New York: "This work is written in an earnest, serious spirit, and with an evident desire to present the truth as the writer understands it. It is impartial too as between the different schools of thinkers, none of them being slighted, and no decided preference shown for one over another except as their real importance demands it."
     * Vouga's Art Folio, New York: "The work is comprehensive, and the author has, in a clear compact manner, given a place to each school, following the sequences in a style likely to impress the readers most forcibly, while the explanations and deductions show a most thorough and careful study of a complex and sometimes confused subject." 
     * Review of Reviews, New York: "This little work is an interesting, valuable, and very comprehensive view of the whole course of Greek philosophic thought."
     * The Scotsman, Edinburgh: "The book is one from which the general readers can gather a clear idea of the drift of Greek thought, its subject-matter and development, which will serve as an excellent groundwork for further study." 
     * The Methodist Review, Volume 52 (1892):  "The value of philosophy is the basal assumption in the issue of the above volume. Because of its lofty range of inquiry, its thought discipline, and its search after the ultimate truth, it ranks among the chief studies that can occupy human attention.  Greek philosophy also, from its antecedent and fundamental relation to the later philosophic systems, is a perpetual body of instruction. Its maxims have an enduring charm for men; its theories, if dissented from, are wisely conceived; its leaders are among the great schoolmasters of the world.  In a circle of St. Louis women, where the study of Greek thought was undertaken under the lead of the present author, the book now considered had its origin.  From the rise of philosophy in Greece, under the Ionians, to its close following Neo-Platonism the historic review here sweeps.  The personality of many great leaders of Grecian thought-as Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno-is set forth with clearness; and the differing systems which they gave to their age and the world are traced with sufficient outline for the full understanding of the whole range of Grecian inquiry in those great centuries of intellectual activity.  It is instructive in these days, when the materialistic is receiving its full share of notice at the expense of the ideal, to notice such a circle of learners as that which gave the present volume its origin; and in the published result of their philosophic pursuits a wider circle of readers should find enjoyment and edification." 
     * Julia Ward Howe, in Literary World, Boston: "Mrs. Mitchell's volume is evidently the work of one who loves philosophy for its own sake. No tiresome pedantry, no encyclopedic dryness is found in its pages, but an earnest desire to present the theme in a graphic and tangible form, which shall rather invite the reader to its further study than discourage him with a mass of difficulties not to be overcome. A wholesome, appreciative, intelligible book. The volume of some two hundred eighty pages represents wide reading and careful study. Its contents belong to that easy reading which does not come of easy writing, but of the endeavor on the part of the writer to make "the crooked straight and rough places plain," an endeavor which cannot in this field be too highly commended.  Mrs. Mitchell conveys much valuable information and suggestion in a small space, but does not fatigue the reader with overcrowding facts and statements.  Rev. W.R. Alger, highly reputed as a student and lover of philosophy, contributes a brief paper on the "Claim and Charm" of his favorite pursuit."

William R. Alger, in his introduction to the book wrote, in part:
      "The etymological force of the word philosophy is the love of wisdom. Seizing this, we grasp a descriptive phrase, not a definition; we take possession of the practical substance but miss the dialectic essence.  Wisdom is knowledge enriching experience with blessed fruits.  Wisdom is assimilative insight in fruition at its goal.  But, let us leave the surface of description, and enter the depth of definition.  What is philosophy?  It is that form of thinking wherein all the parts imply one another, and every part implies the whole.  It is that kind of knowledge which has its presuppositions in itself, and is, therefore, independent of all other knowledge, while all other knowledge is dependent upon it.  It is the self-seizure of the idea in reflective consciousness.  It is the science of self-activity.  It is the pure search after the First Principle, the finding of it, and the deduction thence of all else.  It takes for its province those elements and methods which are common to all the special sciences, and groups them in a sovereign unification.  Hence, with entire justice, it has generally been designated the science of sciences, queen of all the rest.  Strenuous efforts have recently been made in several elaborate lectures to show that ethical science does not depend either on religion or philosophy, but is every way competent to itself.  This is a shallow confusion of thought, and an unwarrantable use of language.  The case may be conclusively stated in a nutshell thus: Philosophy is the science of ultimate grounds.  Morality is the science of right and wrong in human conduct."

Ellen Mitchell focused her writings on the philosophy of history, philosophy of art, political ethics, [[transcendentalism]], and [[Phidias]] and [[Plato]]. While lecturing at the Denver University she was one of the first to introduce women to idealist thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the other being Marietta Kies.

In “The Philosophy of Pessimism” she was one of the philosophers who resisted philosophical systems that grew out of the skeptical tradition. They were not interested in determining what is not true, possible, or real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She only believed in positive theories that relied on what God created, like nature rather than based on human reason and judgment, it was based on the God-given world. Mitchell was part of the idealist philosophers.

One of her larger successes was “A Study of Hegel.” This seventeen page article did not discuss Hegel’s theories in detail. It does discuss important issues for women; nature, art, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a paragraph in the article that distorts Hegel’s thought by using her own thoughts;

:"We communicate with the outward world through the organs of sense; but the impressions received by this means are confused and unrelated, and do not of themselves constitute knowledge, until they have been referred to the unifying power of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This conflicts with Hegel’s belief as the mind must not be said to stand apart from the world as Mitchell here implies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paragraph starts the same as Hegel's belief of communicating with the world through senses, but it changes to hers about how to gain the power of knowledge is through using these senses to your individual experiences in life. This shows that she did not always just state other philosopher beliefs, but also had her own philosophies. When it came to the person and society Mitchell said that someone being away from social order is impossible. She states that “social institutions play a critical role in individual self-determination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Dorothy G.|title=America's first women philosophers : transplanting Hegel, 1860 - 1925|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0826474759|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  meaning that in order to rise above, an individual must become a part of society to be able to rise above it.

In her book ''A study of Greek Philosophy'' she claims the object of knowledge in philosophy is the human spirit itself, and truth is a living process which develops and advances in the civilizing course of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Ellen M.|title=A Study of Greek Philosophy: -1891|year=1891|publisher=Cornell University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the book it reveals that we gain self-knowledge as we gain more experiences in life that affects our knowledge and become who we are.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The '''exhaustion of intellectual property rights''' constitutes one of the limits of [[intellectual property]] (IP) rights. Once a given product has been sold under the authorization of the IP owner, the reselling, rental, lending and other third party commercial uses of IP-protected goods in domestic and international markets is governed by the principle.&lt;ref name=wipo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/ip_business/export/international_exhaustion.htm|title=International Exhaustion and Parallel Importation|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a product covered by an IP right, such as by a [[patent]] right, has been sold by the IP right owner or by others with the consent of the owner, the IP right is said to be exhausted. It can no longer be exercised by the owner.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This limitation is also referred to as the '''exhaustion doctrine''' or '''first sale doctrine'''.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; For example, if an inventor obtains a patent on a new kind of umbrella, the inventor (or anyone else to whom he sells his patent) can legally prohibit other companies from making and selling this kind of umbrella, but can not prohibit customers who have bought this umbrella from the patent owner from reselling the umbrella to third parties. There is a "fairly broad consensus" throughout the world "that this applies at least within the context of the domestic market".&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "national exhaustion". However, "[t]here is less consensus as to what extent the sale of an IP protected product abroad can exhaust the IP rights over this product in the context of domestic law."&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "regional exhaustion" or "international exhaustion". The rules and legal implications of the exhaustion largely differ depending on the country of importation, i.e. the national jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt;

The legal concept of international exhaustion is much more controversial, and is recognized in some countries but not in others. The importation, in a country that recognizes the concept of international exhaustion, of a product sold in a foreign country with the authorization of the IP right owner cannot be prevented by the IP right owner.&lt;ref&gt;The United States Supreme Court adopted the doctrine of international exhaustion in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' for US copyright law, and in that decision explained the general rationale for the doctrine under [[common law]] principles of property rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS), an international agreement administered by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), does not address the issue of exhaustion of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 TRIPS: "For the purposes of dispute settlement under this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 nothing in this Agreement shall be used to address the issue of the exhaustion of intellectual property rights."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Finn and Hengest''''' is a study by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], edited by Alan Bliss and published posthumously in book form in 1982.

[[Finn (Frisian)|Finn]] and [[Hengest]] are two [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] heroes appearing in the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' and in the fragment of "[[The Fight at Finnsburg]]". Hengest has sometimes been identified with the [[Hengest|Jutish king of Kent]]. He and his brother [[Horsa]] (the names meaning "[[stallion]]" and "horse") were the legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon immigrants to [[Great Britain|Britain]] as mercenaries in the 5th century.

The book is based on an edited series of lectures Tolkien made before and after [[World War II]]. In his lectures, Tolkien argued that the Hengest of "[[The Fight at Finnsburg]]" and ''[[Beowulf]]'' was a historical rather than a legendary figure and that these works record episodes from an orally composed and transmitted history of the [[Hengest]] named in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J. R. R. |last=Tolkien |editor=[[Michael D. C. Drout]] |title=[[Beowulf and the Critics]] |year=2002 |publisher=Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, [[Arizona State University]] |isbn=0-86698-290-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has gained acceptance from a number of medieval historians and Anglo-Saxon scholars both since Tolkien's initial lectures and since the publication of this posthumous collection.

Tolkien's lectures describe what he called the "Jutes-on-both-sides theory", which was his explanation for the puzzling occurrence of the word ''ēotenas'' in the episode in ''Beowulf''. Tolkien read the word as [[Jutes]], and theorised that the fight was a purely Jutish feud, and Finn and Hnæf were simply caught up by circumstance. Tolkien explained both their presence and their ambiguous loyalty with his interpretation of the story.

==Synopsis and interpretation by Tolkien==

[[Hnæf]], son of Hoc Half-Dane, is the lord of a Danish people who have conquered part of [[Jutland]] (probably the northern part of the [[Cimbrian Peninsula]]) and exiled its former Jutish rulers. Finn, king of Frys-Land (modern-day [[Friesland]] in the Netherlands) has allowed dispossessed Jutes to settle in his lands and enter his service. Finn marries Hnæf's older sister [[Hildeburh]], and sends their son (whose name was probably Friðuwulf) to be [[Foster care|foster]]ed in Hnæf's household.

Around the year AD 450, Hnæf sails to Frys-Land in the autumn; his purpose is to return Finn's now-grown son and spend the winter in Finn's citadel, celebrating [[Yule]]. He brings a retinue of some sixty [[Thegn|thanes.]] Chief among these thanes is a Jute named Hengest, leader of a band of Jutes who have taken service under Hnæf. Unfortunately, and foreseen by no one, when they arrive at Finn's stronghold they find that many of Finn's thanes are also Jutes, particularly one Garulf, who seems to be the rightful heir to the kingdom conquered by Hnæf's people; and these Frisian Jutes are at [[blood feud]] with Hengest and his band, because Hengest supports the conquering Danes, if for no other reason. This would explain why Hildeburh "had no cause to praise the fealty of the Jutes," since that fealty led to the re-awakening of the feud, which killed her brother, husband, and son.

Finn (who seems guiltless in Tolkien's interpretation) tries to prevent trouble by separating the parties, and allowing Hnæf and his thanes to occupy the royal hall, while he removes his own thanes to a different building. However, the Frisian Jutes make a pre-dawn attack, hoping to take Hengest and his band by surprise. But the Danes have been expecting trouble, and a watchman sees the light of their approaching torches. He asks rhetorically, "What is this light?  Is it the dawn in the East, or is it the flight of a dragon, or are the gables burning?"  Hnæf answers, "Neither is this the dawn in the East, nor is it the flight of a dragon, nor are the gables of this hall burning," it is an attack.
Prepared, the Danes and Hengest's Jutes barricade the two doors of the hall against attack. Garulf is warned by one [[Guðhere]] not to risk his "precious life" in the assault, but he attacks and is the first to fall. Finn's Frisian thanes, who have ties of marriage and friendship to Finn's Jutish thanes, join in the fight against the Danes. The Danes hold the hall for five days without losing a man. On the morning of the fifth day the Frisians force their way into the hall, and in the battle, both Hnæf and Friðiwulf are killed. (It is not clear which side Friðiwulf was fighting on, but Tolkien thinks it likely he was staying in the hall with Hnæf, his foster-father and uncle; this would explain why ''Beowulf'' emphasises that Friðiwulf was laid on the funeral pyre at Hnæf's side.) The surviving Danes, and Hengest's Jutes, drive the Frisians and Jutes out of the hall and re-barricade the door.

At this point Finn (who may not have joined in the fight personally) intervenes and offers to make a bargain with the survivors. As Tolkien points out, the Danes had several advantages:
#Finn had lost so many men that he could not force his way into the hall again.
#The Danes were occupying his royal hall, and he was unwilling to burn it to get them out.
#Finn must have felt both guilty and ashamed that his feuding thanes had killed Hnæf, who was his brother-in-law and guest.

Inside the hall, the survivors are in two groups: Danes, led by a chief thane who is described as ''Hunlafing'' ("the son of Hunlaf") and Jutes, led by Hengest.  The Jutes are Hengest's own band, and owed loyalty to Hnæf only because Hengest followed him.  Finn at first tries to make peace with the Danes only, but the Danes loyally insist that any peace agreement must include Hengest and his men.  Finn agrees, and swears an oath of peace: the Danes and Hengest's men will lay down their arms, and since they cannot leave Frys-Land until the winter ends, they will sit at Finn's table and technically accept him as their protector (since he was now their only possible source of food and maintenance, and they had intended to be his guests throughout the winter anyway.)  Finn gives the Danes a separate hall to dwell in for the winter, specifying that they shall share it with the sons of the Jutes (meaning Hengest and his band.)  He also swears that any one of his own thanes who tries to renew the feud (by taunting the Danes that they now follow the slayer of their lord) will be punished, possibly with death, by Finn himself.  The bodies of Hnæf and Friðiwulf are honourably burned.

Over the winter, the Danes and their Jutish allies brood over the fall of Hnæf.  Hengest is faced with a conflict of duty: whether to honour the peace-treaty with Finn, or to honour his duty to avenge his fallen lord.  Finally the son of Hunlaf takes a sword ''Hildeleoma'' ("Battleflame") which was probably Hnæf's sword, and lays it in Hengest's lap.  Hengest "does not refuse the world's counsel" (that is, he goes along with what everyone agrees is right) and decides that his loyalty to Hnæf must outweigh his obligation to Finn.  (In any case, Tolkien points out that we do not see Hengest swearing any oath to Finn; we only see Finn swearing oaths to Hengest and the Danes.)  When the spring comes, the Danes sail home and tell the story of the downfall of Hnæf.  They return to Finn's stronghold in force.  Hengest, having remained in Frys-Land under the guise of upholding the terms of the peace-treaty, opens the gates to the invaders and the Danes sack Finn's stronghold, kill Finn and all his men, loot and burn the city and return home, taking Hildeburh with them.

'''Fun Boy Three''' were an [[England|English]] [[New wave music|new wave]] [[Pop music|pop]]&lt;ref name=Allmusic&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4322/biography|pure_url=yes}} Fun Boy Three Allmusic bio]&lt;/ref&gt; band, active from 1981 to 1983 and formed by singers [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]], [[Neville Staple]] and [[Lynval Golding]] after they left [[The Specials]].

==History==
The Fun Boy Three reduced the ska sound that they and [[Jerry Dammers]] had crafted with great success with [[The Specials]] and initially took a more minimal approach with the focus on percussion and vocals.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, Jim &amp; Robbins, Ira "[http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=fun_boy_three Fun Boy Three]", ''[[Trouser Press]]'', retrieved 27 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For their second album they assembled a six-piece backing group including a [[cello|cellist]] and a [[trombone]] player, allowing the record to feature more diverse and expansive arrangements, and also enabling them to play live instead of being a purely studio group as previously. The band enjoyed six UK Top 20 hits, including "The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum)" and "[[The Tunnel of Love (Fun Boy Three song)|Tunnel of Love]]" and created two albums of which the eponymous ''[[Fun Boy Three (album)|Fun Boy Three]]'' was the most successful. The follow-up album ''[[Waiting (Fun Boy Three album)|Waiting]]'', produced by [[David Byrne]], was well-received critically&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r7880|pure_url=yes}} Review] from [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rcreview_Wait"&gt;[http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1944 Fun Boy Three] from Christgau's website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/10/arts/the-pop-life-090349.html?&amp;pagewanted=all | title= The Pop Life | author=Robert Palmer | publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=10 August 1983 |accessdate=2009-11-11 | authorlink= Robert Palmer (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not sell as well.

The trio's last UK hit was "[[Our Lips Are Sealed]]", co-written by Terry Hall and [[Jane Wiedlin]] of [[The Go-Go's]], who had a U.S. hit with the song a year earlier. They then toured the [[United States]] and split afterwards.

They were also credited with helping launch the career in 1982 of [[Bananarama]], whom Hall first saw in ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine. The three women provided credited [[choir|chorus]] vocals on the hit "[[T'ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)|It Ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)]]"; the Fun Boy Three later sang on the Bananarama song "[[Really Saying Something]]".

The '''''Gualino Madonna''''' is a painting attributed to Italian late medieval artist [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Duccio|publisher=Silvana Editore|year=2003|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[Galleria Sabauda]] of Turin, northern Italy.

==History==
The provenance of the panel is unknown. In 1910 it was sold on the Florence antiquary market covered by a 16th-century repainting, which was removed in 1920. In 1925 it was acquired by the Turinese entrepreneur and collector [[Riccardo Gualino]] who, in 1930, gave it to the Galleria Sabauda. In 1933-1959 it was in London, after which it returned to the Turinese museum.

The work is not signed, and has been attributed, among the others, to [[Cimabue]]. Now it is unanimously assigned to Duccio, belonging to his early career, when he was influenced by Cimabue.

'''Henoch (Henryk) Barczyński''' (born December 15, 1896 in [[Łódź]] - d. March 14, 1941 (?) in [[Tomaszów Mazowiecki]]) was a Polish painter of Jewish descent, graphic artist, illustrator.

==Biography==
Henoch Barczyński was a son of Szmul Barczyński, tailor, and Sara née Parzęczewska. In years 1912-14 he studied graphics in Jakub Katsenbogen's drawing school in Lodz. Later he was a pupil of [[Enrico Glicenstein|Henryk Glicenstein]] in Warsaw. In years 1919-1926 he studied painting at the Academy of Fine Art in Dresden. He was connected with the artistic group "Jung Jidysz" in Łódź. In 1925 he won the first prize for a propaganda poster during the International Red Cross Contest. He visited France, Spain and Italy. He spend some months in [[Paris]] and [[Prague]]. In years 1927-33 he lived in [[Berlin]]. In 1933 he returned to Łódź (Poland). In 1933-39 he lived in his ''Heimatstadt''.

In September 1939 he settled in Tomaszów Mazowiecki. In this town he created an artistic circle. He is mentioned six times in Lutek Orenbach's ''Letters from the Tomaszów Ghetto''. The last mention is dated (December 25, 1940).

He was killed by the Nazis in 1941 (probably 14 March) in Tomaszów Mazowiecki.

== Artistic works ==
Barczyński's artistic works were influenced by [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Oskar Kokoschka]], and motivated by the everyday life of the Polish Jews. He painted in water colors, practiced copper plate engraving and etching. His art-works were exhibited in Berlin, [[Dresden]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[New York City]] and Łódź.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5619">The '''International Symmetry Society''' ("International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry", abbreviated name '''SIS''') is a non-profit organization registered in Hungary (Budapest, Vármegye u. 7. II. 3., H-1052).
Its main objectives are: 
# to bring together artists and scientists, educators and students devoted to, or interested in, the research and understanding of the concept and application of symmetry (asymmetry, dissymmetry);
# to provide regular information to the general public about events in symmetry studies;
# to ensure a regular forum (including the organization of symposia, and the publication of a periodical) for all those interested in symmetry studies.

The topic was introduced for the first time by Russian and Polish scholars. Then in 1952, Hermann [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]] published his fascinating book ''Symmetry'',&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Weyl, 1952. ''Symmetry''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-02374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later translated into 10 languages. Since then, it became an attractive subject of research in various fields. A variety of manifestations of the principle of symmetry in sculpture, painting, architecture, ornament, and design, in organic and inorganic nature has been revealed; the philosophical and mathematical significance of this principle has been studied.
During the 1980's the discussions concerning the nature of the world, whether it was essentially probabilistic or naturally geometric, revived the interest of the researchers to the topic. The intellectual atmosphere of this period facilitated the idea of establishment of a new institution devoted to the study of all forms of complexity and patterns of symmetry and orderly structures pervading science, nature and society, that ultimately led to the establishment of the International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry.

The Society's community comprises several branches of [[science]] and [[art]], while symmetry studies have gained the rank of an individual interdisciplinary field in the judgement of the scientific community. The Society has members in all continents, in over forty countries.

The Society was founded in 1989 following a successful international meeting in Budapest. 
It has operated continuously since its foundation, publishing printed and web journals and hosting an International Congress and Exhibition entitled '''''Symmetry: Art and Science''''' every three years:

* 1989 in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]
* 1992 in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]
* 1995 in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]], [[United States|US]]
* 1998 in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]
* 2001 in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]
* 2004 in [[Tihany]], [[Hungary]]
* 2007 in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]
* 2010 in [[Gmünd, Lower Austria|Gmünd]], [[Austria]]
* 2013 in [[Crete]], [[Greece]]
* 2016 in [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]]
*2019 forthcoming in Japan.

Interim full conferences have been held in 
* Tsukuba Science City (co-organized with ''Katachi no kagaku kai'', Japan), 1994 and 1998
*Brussels (2002)
* Lviv [Lemberg] (2008)
* Kraków and Wroclaw (2008).

A new series of conferences under the general heading '''''Logics of Image''''' have been launched on 2013, planned to take place every two years. This series is co-organised with the Research Group on [[Universal logic|Universal Logic]]:
* [http://www.easyconferences.eu/issc2016/ ISSC 2016]: Logics of Image - ''Visualization, Iconicity, Imagination and Human Creativity'', in [[Santorini]], [[Greece]]
* [https://sites.google.com/site/logicsofimage2/home ISSC 2018]: Logics of Image - ''Visual Learning, Logic and Philosophy of Form in East and West'', in [[Crete]], [[Greece]]

The Society is governed by a number of special [http://symmetry-us.com/index-page-for-society/society-officers/ Boards and Committees].
The President of the International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry is Dénes Nagy.

'''Brick Romanesque''' ({{lang-de|Backsteinromanik}}) is an architectural style and chronological phase of architectural history. The term described [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] buildings built of brick; like the subsequent [[Brick Gothic]], it is geographically limited to [[Northern Germany]] and the [[Baltic region]]. Structures in other regions are not described as Brick Romanesque but as "Romanesque brick-built church" or similar terms.

In comparison to Brick Gothic, Brick Romanesque is a less established and less frequently used term. On the one hand, this is caused by the fact that the Baltic region was only beginning to develop its own stylistic identity during the Romanesque period, on the other by the relatively low number of surviving buildings. Many of the [[List of Brick Gothic buildings|major Brick Gothic edifices]] had Brick Romanesque predecessors, remains of which are often still visible. Nearly all preserved buildings are churches. The buildings contrast with earlier stone-built churches ([[Fieldstone church]]es or ''Feldsteinkirchen''), which were constructed of [[glacial erratic]]s and [[rubble]].  Such rounded stones limit the potential size of a building; the material and technique do not permit the construction of structures larger than a village church for [[Structural analysis|static reasons]]. Monumental constructions only became possible through the growing use and perfection of [[brick]] building.

== Import of technique and style == 
Already in the antique [[Roman Empire]] huge brick buildings had  been erected north of the Alps, but present day [[Denmark]] and present day northern Germany east of [[Elbe River]] never had been part of that empire, and west of the Elbe its rule had been too short to build more than some military camps. Even in the northern Roman provinces, the techniques of building in brick were forgotten with the decay of the empire.

Kloster Jericho1.jpg|[[Jerichow Monastery]],&lt;br /&gt;since 1149
&lt;/gallery&gt;
But in [[Langobardia Major]], northern Italy, there was a continuity of building in bricks from late Antiquity to early [[Middle Age]]s. In [[First Romanesque|Early Lombard Romanesque]] style, technique and shapes, later on typical for the [[Baltic Sea]] were already completely developed. During the 12th century, Northern Germany and [[Denmark]], at that time the major power of [[North Sea]] and Baltic Sea, imported the techniques and many elements of style from the [[Padan Plain|Padan Region]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdklabor.de/wiki/Backsteinbau RDK-Labor: digitized text of ''Reallexikon zur Deutschen Kunstgeschichte'' (1937), ''Backsteinbau'' by Otto Stiehl (chapters I–III) and Hans Wentzel (chapters IV–VI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. John's Church (''Sankt-Johannis-Kirche'') in [[Oldenburg (Holstein)]] is considered to be the oldest brick church in [[Northern Europe]]. The first monumental churches were [[Ratzeburg]] cathedral and [[Lübeck Cathedral]], both begun shortly after 1160 under [[Henry the Lion]]. Lübeck Cathedral was later converted into a Gothic [[hall church]] (1266 to 1335). Jerichow Abbey with its convent church of which construction started in 1148 played an influential role for the brick architecture in the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. For [[Scandinavia]], the stylistically independent [[Roskilde Cathedral]], started in the 1170s and used as the burial church for Danish monarchs, is of special importance. A last flourish and the transition to the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style is marked by the [[Cistercian]] [[Lehnin Abbey]] in the Margraviate of Brandenburg.

[[File:Battle-of-Cable-Street-red-plaque.png|thumb|upright|Plaque commemorating the [[Battle of Cable Street]]]]
Kenton was born in [[Stepney]], east London to a Jewish [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] family who had escaped from [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|Tsarist pogroms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=Max |authorlink=Max Arthur |year=2009 |title=The Real Band of Brothers – First hand accounts from the last British survivors of the Spanish Civil War |place=London |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=9780007295098 |chapter=Section 1 – Lou Kenton |page=21}} – reference to Kenton's place and date of birth&lt;/ref&gt; His father died from [[tuberculosis]] when he was young.

Kenton left school aged 14 and started work in a paper factory. There he first encountered [[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom|anti-semitism]], which led him to join the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1929. He took part in the CPGB's disruption of the [[British Union of Fascists]]' rally at [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] in June 1934 and resistance to the BUF in the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in October 1936.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9556423/Lou-Kenton.html |title=Lou Kenton |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
Early in 1937 Kenton left Stepney and rode his [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] motorcycle to [[Albacete]], where he join the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. His first wife Lillian, an [[Austria]]n nurse who fled Nazi Germany in 1933, shortly followed him. When he arrived at the International Brigades headquarters in [[Albacete]], he applied to join the International Brigade's Medical Unit. It was from there that he spent nearly two years in action as medical courier on his motorcycle distributing medical supplies to hospitals across the country, and as an ambulance driver on the front lines. He returned to Britain late in 1938 on an 'Aid for Spain' mission to raise money for a new ambulance. By the time he had completed his tour, the [[International Brigades#Disbandment|International Brigades had been disbanded]].

==Later life==
After the International Brigades were withdrawn from Spain, Kenton was hugely depressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baxell |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Baxell |year=2012 |title=[[Unlikely Warriors: The British in the Spanish Civil War and the Struggle Against Fascism]] |place=London |publisher=[[Aurum Press]] |isbn=9781781312339 |chapter=21, From Spanish War to World War |page=409}} – reference to Kenton's depression following the Republic's defeat&lt;/ref&gt; One of his missions was to repatriate to the Spanish authorities the [[Basque people|Basque]] refugees given asylum in the United Kingdom. It was "the first time I saw the fascist police in their three-cornered hats. All the children were in tears and all of them were hanging on to me as we checked each one and handed them over."&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

[[File:Lidice shall live.jpg|thumb|upright|British "Lidice shall live" poster]]
Kenton then joined the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] and in the first part of the Second World War served on an [[Antarctic]] [[whaler]], the ''Southern Princess''. He and Lillian were divorced and in 1941 Kenton married his second wife Raffa Ephgrave. He was wounded in [[The Blitz]], spent two years in hospital and then took a factory job.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; After the [[Lidice]] massacre in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1942, Kenton joined the British "Lidice Shall Live" organisation. He was an active member for many years and in the 1990s served as its Chairman.

After the Second World War, Kenton joined the Homes for Heroes campaign, which helped [[Squatting in England and Wales#Post World War II|homeless ex-servicemen and their families to squat in unoccupied properties]]. He joined the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as a [[proofreader]], and continued to work there until he was in his 70s.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Kenton remained a devout communist, working tirelessly on trade union organisation, unemployed marches and party activities until 1968 when the [[Prague Spring]] was suppressed by the [[Soviet Union]]. He then joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and remained a member for the rest of his life.

===Commemorative potter===
From 1980 Kenton produced commemorative pottery for the trade union movement and for radical causes. His work was commissioned by [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen]], [[Amicus|Tobacco Workers' Union]], [[Society of Graphical and Allied Trades]], [[Trades Union Congress]], areas of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], the People's March for Jobs, the [[International Brigades|International Brigade]], [[Greater London Council]] Peace Year, [[Liberty (advocacy group)|National Council for Civil Liberties]], [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and the [[Greenham Common]] women's campaign.

Kenton had two children and two granddaughters.

===Spanish passport===
On 26 May 2009 it was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6360886.ece |last=Haynes |first=Deborah |title=Spanish Civil War volunteers are granted citizenship 70 years on |newspaper=[[The Times]]}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seven British pensioners were to be awarded Spanish passports at the Spanish Embassy in London on 9 June 2009.

'''''Lucifer''''' is a painting by the German artist [[Franz Stuck]], one of the founders of the [[Munich Secession]], from 1890.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3908">In July 1827, the inmates of the [[King's Bench Prison]], in Borough, South London, devised an amusement to pass the time which gained the attention of the general public. It was proposed that they should elect a member to represent "Tenterden" (a slang name for the prison) in Parliament. Three candidates were put up, one of whom was Lieutenant Meredith, an eccentric naval officer.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}
{{quote|... As I approached the unfortunate, but merry, crowd, to the last day of my life I shall ever remember the impression... baronets and bankers, authors and merchants, painters and poets... dandies of no rank in rap and tat-ters... all mingled in indiscriminate merriment, with a spiked wall, twenty feet high, above their heads...|[[Benjamin Haydon]].{{sfn|Percy|Timbs|1828|p=194}} }}

All the characteristics of a regular election were parodied. Addresses from the candidates to the 'worthy and independent electors' were printed and posted up around the prison; contending parties wrote broadsheets &amp; sang songs attacking their opponents; there were processions with flags and music, to take the several candidates to visit the several "Collegians" (i. e., prisoners) in their rooms; speeches were made in the courtyards, full of grotesque humour; a pseudo "high-sheriff" and other "election officers" were chosen to oversee the proceedings "properly"; and the electors were invited to "rush to the poll" early on Monday morning, the 16th of July.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}

The turnkeys (guards) of the prison entered into the fun. While these preliminary plans were engaging attention, a creditor happened to enter the prison; and seeing the prisoners so exceedingly joyous, declared that such a kind of imprisonment for debt could be no punishment; and he therefore liberated his debtor. Whether owing to this singular result of prison-discipline (or indiscipline), or an apprehension of evils that might follow, Mr. Jones, marshal of the prison, put a stop to the whole proceedings on the morning of the 16th. Apparently the proceedings were halted violently, exasperating the prisoners. They resented the language used towards them, and opposed the treatment to which they were subjected; until a squad of Foot-guards, with fixed bayonets, forcibly drove some of the leaders into a filthy "black-hole" or place of confinement.{{sfn|Chambers|1869}}
{{quote|The three candidates, and other persons who were active in the election, were for some time kept in close confinement, and a sergeant's guard was introduced, and remained in the prison all night. The result was pacific; but the conduct of the marshal has been much censured and threatened with a parliamentary investigation.|Benjamin Haydon.{{sfn|Percy|Timbs|1828|p=196}} }}

The election occurred while [[Benjamin Haydon]] was in prison for the second time. He produced the picture of the ''Mock Election'', and sold it to King [[George IV]] for £500.

The service went through several pricing structures following its original invite-only launch (including those limited to 2 or 3 films per month, and "unlimited" plans, with pricing based on market size), before announcing in August 2017 that it would switch to offering a plan with a single film per day priced at $9.95 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-moviepass-works-2017-8|title=Here's how to use MoviePass, the $10-a-month service that lets you see one movie per day in theaters|work=Business Insider|access-date=August 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in business model came with the acquisition of a majority stake in the company by an analytics firm, which sought to widen the service's reach so it could collect more information on customer viewing habits.

MoviePass was named as one of the "25 Most Disruptive Apps of 2012" and part of "The Best of Everything in 2012" by ''[[Business Insider]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-25-most-disruptive-apps-2012-12|title=The Top 25 Most Disruptive Apps Of 2012 - Business Insider|date=December 7, 2012|work=Business Insider|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-of-everything-in-2012-2012-12#best-entertainment-app-moviepass-4|title=The Best Of Everything In 2012|date=December 24, 2012|work=Business Insider|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2017 change in business model has been successful in attracting customers; the service reported having 2 million subscribers in February 2018. That same month, the company announced at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] that it would also acquire and distribute films under the new subsidiary, MoviePass Ventures.

Since its launch, MoviePass has faced objections from major cinema chains, particularly [[AMC Theatres]], over its business model and sustainability.&lt;ref name="deadline-twothumbsdown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety-amcmp"/&gt; These concerns were exacerbated in July 2018, when the service was forced to temporarily shut down for a day in order to negotiate an additional loan, and began to make other changes such as reducing its unlimited plan to only offer 3 no-cost tickets per-month (with further tickets only being discounted), implementing [[dynamic pricing|demand-based]] fees and blackouts on specific high-profile releases, and ultimately restricting the service to a limited selection of up to six specified films, rotating daily.

MoviePass was founded in 2011&lt;ref name="bloomberg-crazyplan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-15/netflix-co-founder-s-crazy-plan-pay-10-a-month-go-to-the-movies-all-you-want|title=Netflix Co-Founder’s Crazy Plan: Pay $10 a Month, Go to the Movies All You Want|date=August 15, 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by technology and entertainment entrepreneurs [[Stacy Spikes]] and Hamet Watt.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is backed by major investors including True Ventures, AOL Ventures, Lambert Media, Moxie Pictures and other investors.&lt;ref name="deadline-twothumbsdown"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2011/06/moviepass-trying-to-go-forward-with-test-weekend-despite-nix-by-two-movie-chains-144755/|title=UPDATE: MoviePass Gets Its Ticket Punched As Trial Launch Is Cancelled After Two Movie Chains Give It Thumbs Down|last=Jr|first=Mike Fleming|date=July 1, 2011|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company launched in beta in June 2011 in [[San Francisco]]. During initial trials, it encountered resistance from movie theater chains, resulting in the company going on a "temporary hiatus".&lt;ref name="deadline-twothumbsdown"/&gt;

At first, MoviePass operated with a voucher system. Members printed a voucher on their home computers and redeemed them for movie tickets at participating cinemas. In August 2011, the company partnered with Hollywood Movie Money to conduct its service through its preexisting voucher program and cinema network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/moviepass-tries-unlimted-movie-plan-again-time-help-30561/|title=MoviePass Tries Unlimited Movie Plan Again, This Time With Help|date=August 30, 2011|work=TheWrap|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voucher system was replaced after users complained it was cumbersome. In October 2012, following a national [[beta test]], the service switched to a mobile app and electronically-preloaded prepaid card. While MoviePass claimed the card could be used at all cinemas that accepted major credit cards, there was still some hostility from the industry, including [[AMC Theatres]], who publicly disassociated itself from the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/nyregion/a-movie-a-day-without-breaking-the-bank.html|title=A Movie a Day, Without Breaking the Bank|last=Brustein|first=Joshua|date=January 18, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2012/10/02/moviepass-goes-national-unlimited-trips-to-the-movies-from-25-per-month/|title=MoviePass Goes National: Unlimited Trips to the Movies from $25 Per Month|last=Tuttle|first=Brad|work=Time|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
In June 2016, MoviePass named [[Mitch Lowe]], a former executive of [[Netflix]] and [[Redbox]], as its new CEO. Lowe had been an advisor to the company since 2014.&lt;ref name="variety-lowemp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Netflix Exec Mitch Lowe Takes Over as MoviePass CEO|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/exec-shuffle-people-news/mitch-lowe-moviepass-ceo-1201805026/|website=Variety|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Lowe, the service began to experiment with different pricing models; Lowe stated that his eventual goal was to have a low-end service at around $20 per month, ranging up towards a high-end service at around $100 with unlimited movies and availability of 3D screenings. In some regions, the service tried offering different subscription plans to users, such as a $50 plan for six movies per month, or $99 for unlimited—both allowing users to purchase tickets to 3D screenings. The new plans were criticized by those who felt that they were designed to [[price gouging|gouge]] "unprofitable" frequent users of the service.&lt;ref name="variety-priceexperiment"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Brett|title=MoviePass to Experiment With New Pricing Models, CEO Says|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/moviepass-new-prices-netflix-mitch-lowe-1201806341/|website=Variety|accessdate=August 17, 2017|quote="What they’re trying to do is eliminate the unprofitable people. The people who use the service all the time."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-newplans"/&gt;

In July 2016, MoviePass unveiled a new plan structure effective in September, with tiers based on 2, 3 or unlimited movies per month. Prices varied by region, with (for example) the two-movie-per-month plan costing from $15 in small markets to $21 in larger ones. The unlimited plans were also modified to remove the previous restriction of one film every 24 hours, with prices ranging from $40 to $50 per month. Lowe argued that the new plans were designed to appeal to those who did not go to movies often.&lt;ref name="engadget-newplans"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/07/12/moviepass-unveils-new-prices-starting-at-15-a-month/|title=MoviePass unveils new prices, starting at $15 a month|last=devindra|website=Engadget|access-date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, the service had 20,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/moviepass-get-serious-customer-acquisition-957690|title=MoviePass Gets Serious About Customer Acquisition|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=November 6, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studio Movie Grill purchased a stake in the company in December 2016. MoviePass and Studio Movie Grill were also partnering on testing food features through the MoviePass app including [[OpenTable]] (purchases) and Explore More (menu).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Verhoeven |first1=Beatrice |title=MoviePass Launches Partnership with Studio Movie Grill |url=https://www.thewrap.com/moviepass-studio-movie-grill-partnership/ |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |work=TheWrap |date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017-2018===
In August 2017, a majority stake in MoviePass was sold to the analytics firm Helios and Matheson. At the same time, the company announced that it would lower its price for an unlimited plan allowing one film per-day, to $9.95 per month. Lowe explained that "after years of studying and analysis we found that people want to go to the movies more often, but the pricing keeps going up, and that prevents them from going more. We're making it more affordable for people." Helios and Matheson's CEO Ted Farnsworth stated the service wanted to increase the size of its userbase in order to analyze viewing habits for [[targeted advertising]]. Farnsworth compared the model to those of [[Facebook]] and [[Google]], whose free services are subsidized by the collection of personal information for advertising.&lt;ref name="variety-mpacquire"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/moviepass-1202527956/|title=MoviePass Sells to Helios and Matheson Analytics|last=Lang|first=Brent|date=August 15, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg-crazyplan"/&gt; After announcing their new pricing, the company's website went down due to the increase in traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/35561-moviepass-site-down-traffic-subscription-deal|title=MoviePass's Crazy Popular Subscription Deal Immediately Crashed the Site|work=Inverse|access-date=August 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2017, the number of subscribers had increased to 400,000, to 600,000 in mid-October, to one million in December, and two million in February 2018. In June 2018, the company announced in a press release that it had more than three million paying subscribers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/moviepass-struggling-to-keep-up-as-subscriptions-surged-to-400000-2017-9 | title=After cutting prices for its movie-a-day subscription service, MoviePass is struggling to keep up with demand | first=Caroline | last=Cakebread | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=September 14, 2017 | accessdate=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/moviepass-is-now-servicing-more-than-600000-subscribers-2017-10-24 | first=Trey | last=Williams | title=MoviePass is now servicing more than 600,000 subscribers | work=[[MarketWatch]] | date=October 24, 2017 | accessdate=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/box-office/moviepass-2-million-mark-subscribers-1202692553/|title=MoviePass Tops 2 Million Mark in Subscribers|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=February 8, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=March 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helios advanced MoviePass $55 million from December to February 20, 2018. MoviePass then converted the advances from debt to capital. Helios ownership stake thus increased from 62.4 percent to 81.2 percent. Another $35 million in advances converted to capital put Helios to 91.8 percent allowing for a merger unilateral initiated by the Helios board.&lt;ref name="nyp"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morgan |first1=Richard |title=MoviePass owners weighing merger despite burning through cash |url=https://nypost.com/2018/04/22/moviepass-owners-weighing-merger-despite-burning-through-cash/ |accessdate=June 5, 2018 |work=New York Post |date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 19, 2018 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], MoviePass announced the new subsidiary MoviePass Ventures, which would co-acquire films with traditional distributors.&lt;ref name=vty0&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/moviepass-sundance-1202669456/|title=Sundance: MoviePass Announces It Will Acquire Films|last=Lang|first=Brent|date=January 19, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=January 19, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dl0&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/moviepass-film-finance-moviepass-ventures-sundance-film-festival-1202262786/|title=MoviePass Launches MoviePass Ventures: Subsidiary Will Co-Acquire Films With Distributors – Sundance|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=January 19, 2018|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=January 19, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the price further dropped to $7.95 per month for new customers if they paid annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mashable.com/2018/02/10/movie-pass-price-drop/#TaAtQLdbHkqh|title=MoviePass lowered it's prices again, somehow|last=Allen Clark|first=Peter|date=February 10, 2018|work=[[Mashable]]|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, they lowered it to $6.95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moviepass Lowers Price To $6.95 Per Month |url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/HMNY.OQ/key-developments/article/3792478 |accessdate=June 5, 2018 |work=Reuters |date=March 23, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, Helios and Matheson acquired the movie listings website [[Moviefone]] from [[Verizon Communications]]'s digital media subsidiary [[Oath Inc.]], with Verizon taking a stake in MoviePass stock.&lt;ref name=bb&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-05/moviepass-teams-with-moviefone-to-shake-up-theater-business|title=MoviePass Acquires Moviefone to Bolster Film-a-Day Service|last=Smith|first=Gerry|date=April 5, 2018|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|access-date=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/04/05/moviepass-buys-moviefone/|title=MoviePass Just Bought Moviefone.

Also in April 2018, MoviePass quietly removed the unlimited plan for new customers, and replaced it with a new plan limited to three movies per-month, bundled with a complimentary three-month trial of [[iHeartRadio]] All-Access. Lowe stated that he was not sure if the previous plan would be reinstated, explaining that "We just always try different things. Every time we try a new promotion, we never put a deadline on it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/moviepass-ceo-one-movie-per-day/|title=MoviePass CEO says he doesn’t know if the one-movie-per-day subscription will ever return|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a change that prohibited MoviePass customers from buying multiple tickets to "select" movies.&lt;ref name="VERGE"&gt;{{cite news |title="MoviePass Unlimited" |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/27/17291242/moviepass-unlimited-movie-deal-repeat-viewings-theater-blackouts |work=Verge |date=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unlimited plan was reinstated two weeks later, with the limited plan maintained as a cheaper option at the $7.95 price point; Lowe stated that the company was "absolutely committed" to keeping the unlimited option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barret|first1=Brian|title=MoviePass Revives Its Unlimited Plan|url=https://www.wired.com/story/movie-pass-unlimited-is-back/|website=Wired.com|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALLA"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldsmith |first1=Jill |title=MoviePass Expands And Will Now Make Movies Too |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgoldsmith/2018/05/31/moviepass-expands-and-will-now-make-movies-too/#6ad2f71d400a |work=Forbes |date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Financial issues ====
In May 2018, the company lost $40 million.&lt;ref name="PROF"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamos/2018/07/05/moviepass-worst-month-ever-at-least-for-now/#6ac9e24877f5 "MoviePass' Worst Month Ever (At Least For Now)"], ''Forbes'', Jim Amos, July 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that MoviePass was responding to the creation of the competitor AMC Stubs A-List by announcing new fees for its service, with surge fees added to popular films and prime timeslots.&lt;ref name="PROF"/&gt; The peak pricing rolled out was $2 to $6 extra during peak times. In the summer of 2018 the company launched a $164 million bond sale.&lt;ref name="INTRO"&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/05/media/moviepass-surge-pricing/index.html "MoviePass introduces surge pricing"], CNN, Jill Disis, July 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VAR"&gt;[https://variety.com/2018/film/news/moviepass-peak-pricing-surcharge-1202865767/ "MoviePass Launches ‘Peak Pricing’ Surcharge"], ''Variety'', Dave McNary, July 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; MoviePass said subscribers could waive one peak fee per month.&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;[https://www.cnet.com/news/moviepass-surge-pricing-is-here-2-to-6-extra-at-peak-times/ "MoviePass surge pricing is here: $2 to $6 extra at peak times"], [[CNET]], Gordon Gottsegen, July 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the month, MoviePass announced it would begin selling merchandise.&lt;ref name="PROF"/&gt;

On August 6, 2018, MoviePass backtracked on plans to raise its monthly fee from $9.95 to $14.95,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/moviepass-raising-prices|title=MoviePass Rises from the Dead After Raising Its Monthly Prices|last=Desta|first=Yohana|work=HWD|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but announced that it would instead limit these subscribers to three free tickets per-month, with any further screening offering a $5 discount on the ticket price instead. MoviePass stated that this measure was intended to "protect the longevity of our company and prevent abuse of the service."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/moviepass-keeps-plan-at-10-but-limits-subscribers-to-three-movies-a-month/|title=MoviePass keeps plan at $10, but limits subscribers to three movies a month|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, 2018, MoviePass announced that it would also limit the service's film options to "up to six films to choose from daily, including a selection of major studio first-run films and independent releases".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/16/moviepass-is-limiting-selection-to-up-to-six-films-a-day/|title=MoviePass is limiting selection to ‘up to six films’ a day|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early August 2018, Helios and Matheson completed the acquisition of Emmett Furla Oasis Films assets for the MoviePass subsidiary, [[MoviePass Films]].&lt;ref name=dl1&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jr |first1=Mike Fleming |title=MoviePass Films Sets First Pic: Bruce Willis To Star In ’10 Minutes Gone’ |url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/moviepass-films-bruce-willis-10-minutes-gone-1202441596/ |accessdate=October 16, 2018 |work=Deadline |date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 24, 2018, MoviePass announced that it had ceased providing its previous annual unlimited plan, with all subscribers transitioned to the monthly limited plan. Subscribers who do not wish to have this plan were instructed to cancel their subscriptions by August 31, 2018 to receive a pro-rated refund (as per the MoviePass terms of service, users who cancel their subscription may not re-join the service for 9 months).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/moviepass-kills-off-its-annual-plan-even-if-you-already-paid-for-it/|title=MoviePass kills off its annual plan -- even if you already paid for it|date=2018-08-24|work=CNET|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October, reportedly over a million subscribers had cancelled the service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4223252-helios-matheson-cash-burn-slows-amid-significant-decline-moviepass-subscriptions Helios And Matheson: Cash Burn Slows Amid Significant Decline In MoviePass Subscriptions].

==Operation==
Subscribers to MoviePass are issued a branded prepaid debit card. Using the MoviePass [[mobile app]], users check-in at a supported cinema, and select a film and showtime occurring within the next 30 minutes; the card is automatically loaded with the amount of money needed to purchase a single ticket from the cinema for that film. The user then purchases their ticket as usual, using their MoviePass card as their payment method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://appscout.pcmag.com/none/303448-moviepass-service-adds-funds-your-card-when-you-reach-the-theater|title=MoviePass Service Adds Funds Your Card When You Reach the Theater|work=PC Magazine|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the service is subsidizing the purchase of tickets directly from the cinema by the customer. Some cinemas support e-tickets through MoviePass.&lt;ref name="variety-proscons"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/moviepass-explainer-advantages-drawbacks-pros-cons-1202528720/|title=What Is MoviePass?

==Criticism and controversy==
{{Anchor|Reception}}
The business model of MoviePass has faced notable resistance from major cinema chains since its launch; the company's 21-theatre pilot in [[San Francisco]] was called off after objections by [[AMC Theatres]] and [[Landmark Theatres]], who were included in the slate of locations without their knowledge. Stacy Spikes explained to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' that he "imagine[d] a day where studio executives can see real-time decisions that subscribers are making from their phones and devices. If studios say they are not interested in being able to talk to their customers, knowing what they are thinking and being able to notify them of things like ancillary items, and that theater owners aren't interested in having these people go to the movies more, and drive up concessions sales, and having us put all this in the palms of their hands, then I'm in the wrong business."&lt;ref name="deadline-twothumbsdown"/&gt;

Following the announcement of MoviePass's new pricing model in August 2017, AMC stated that it was "actively working now to determine whether it may be feasible to opt out and not participate in this shaky and unsustainable program", as "by definition and absent some other form of other compensation, MoviePass will be losing money on every subscriber seeing two movies or more in a month", and that lowering its prices in response to the service would harm the customer experience.&lt;ref name="variety-amcmp"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/amc-moviepass-1202528974/|title=AMC Slams MoviePass, Threatening Legal Action|last=Lang|first=Brent|date=August 15, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service's original pricing depended on a business model similar to those of [[health club]]s, where the company would profit more if customers paid for the service but only used it on occasion.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-crazyplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety-amcmp"/&gt;

The company was founded in 1983 by Shmuel BenTov as Software Ben-Tov.&lt;ref name=sb2p12&gt;{{cite report|title=Form SB-2: Registration Statement|publisher=The A Consulting Team|date=June 13, 1997|pages=12 &amp; 35|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1040792/0000950130-97-002800.txt|via=EDGAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; It changed its name later that year to The A Consulting Team.&lt;ref name=sb2p12 /&gt; The company made its [[initial public offering]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Form 10-KSB: Annual Report|publisher=The A Consulting Team|date=March 31, 1998|page=8|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1040792/0001040792-98-000004.txt|via=EDGAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Helios &amp; Matheson Information Technology Ltd., an IT consulting firm based in India, purchased a majority stake in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stock vindaloo: Shady Indian investors take grip of a U.S. firm|newspaper=New York Post|first=Christopher|last=Byron|date=August 7, 2006|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F1135DC12AA891D48&amp;rft_id=info%3Asid%2Finfoweb.newsbank.com&amp;rft_val_format=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;svc_dat=AWNB&amp;req_dat=1028A39C75C2B899|via=NewsBank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Form 8-K: Current Report|publisher=The A Consulting Team|date=September 8, 2006|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1040792/000112528206005648/b414864_8k.txt|via=EDGAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A Consulting Team changed its name in 2007 to Helios &amp; Matheson North America, to highlight its association with the parent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Form 10-K: Annual Report|publisher=Helios &amp; Matheson North America|date=March 29, 2007|page=1|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1040792/000095012307004660/y32542e10vk.htm|via=EDGAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company again changed its name in 2011 to Helios &amp; Matheson Information Technology Inc., to reflect that it was seeking business opportunities worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Form 10-K: Annual Report|publisher=Helios &amp; Matheson Information Technology|date=March 13, 2012|page=3|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1040792/000114420412014589/v303156_10k.htm|via=EDGAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in 2013 to Helios and Matheson Analytics, to reflect that the business had "moved beyond IT".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Form 10-K: Annual Report|publisher=Helios and Matheson Analytics|date=March 13, 2014|page=1|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1040792/000143774914003183/hmny20131231_10k.htm|via=EDGAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The company acquired Zone Technologies, maker of the RedZone Map app, in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bary |first1=Emily |title=Helios &amp; Matheson stock falls after company gets extension for 10-K filing |url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/helios-matheson-stock-falls-after-company-gets-extension-for-10-k-filing-2018-04-03 |accessdate=June 5, 2018 |work=MarketWatch |date=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zonemerger&gt;{{cite press release|title=Helios and Matheson Analytics and Zone Technologies, maker of RedZone Map, close merger|publisher=Helios and Matheson Analytics|date=November 9, 2016|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F1608D06131CA5A68&amp;rft_id=info%3Asid%2Finfoweb.newsbank.com&amp;rft_val_format=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;svc_dat=AWNB&amp;req_dat=1028A39C75C2B899|via=NewsBank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zone founder Richard Farnsworth was appointed chairman of Helios, and then, in January 2017, became Helios's CEO.&lt;ref name=zonemerger /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. names chairman Theodore Farnsworth as chief executive officer|publisher=Helios and Matheson Analytics|date=January 23, 2017|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/helios-and-matheson-analytics-inc-names-chairman-theodore-farnsworth-as-chief-executive-officer-300394541.html|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Helios purchased a majority stake in MoviePass.&lt;ref name="variety-mpacquire"/&gt; Helios advanced MoviePass $55 million from December to February 20, 2018. MoviePass then converted the advances from debt to capital. This increased Helios' ownership stake from 62.4 percent to 81.2 percent. Another $35 million in advances converted to capital put Helios at 91.8 percent, allowing for a merger unilaterally initiated by the Helios board.&lt;ref name="nyp"/&gt;

In April 2018, Helios acquired the movie listings website [[Moviefone]] from [[Verizon]]'s digital media subsidiary, [[Oath Inc.]] As part of the transaction, Verizon took an equity stake in MoviePass.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;

In March 2018, the board of directors began the process to spin off Zone Technologies to shareholders as a separate, publicly traded company, in hopes that it would allow Helios to focus on its strengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. announces plans to spin-off Zone Technologies Inc. to become a separate public company|publisher=Helios and Matheson Analytics|date=March 15, 2018|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315005643/en/Helios-Matheson%C2%A0Analytics-Announces-Plans-Spin-Off-Zone-Technologies|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MoviePass owner's shares tumble after stock-sale plan|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|first=Maria|last=Armental|date=April 18, 2018|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/moviepass-owners-shares-tumble-after-stock-sale-plan-1524110178|accessdate=September 9, 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Helios sold $150 million in stock with $30 million of the shares at $2.75, a discount from the closing market price of $3.83. Most of the proceeds were used to fund MoviePass. With the diluting and discount on the shares, prior investors indicated their unhappiness with the company on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vega |first1=Nicolas |title=MoviePass faces angry investors after selling off $150M in stock |url=https://nypost.com/2018/04/19/moviepass-faces-angry-investors-after-selling-off-150m-in-stock/ |accessdate=June 5, 2018 |work=New York Post |date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the company acquired the assets of [[Emmett Furla Oasis Films]] plus gain its executives' expertise in making films for a new subsidiary, [[MoviePass Films]] with an option to purchase the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldsmith |first1=Jill |title=MoviePass Expands And Will Now Make Movies Too |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgoldsmith/2018/05/31/moviepass-expands-and-will-now-make-movies-too/#a2686e7400ad |accessdate=October 16, 2018 |work=Forbes |date=May 31, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new company would be 51% owned by Helios and the remainder by EFO.&lt;ref name=vty&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lang |first1=Brent |title=MoviePass Parent Company Acquiring Emmett Furla Oasis Films |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/moviepass-emmett-furla-lone-survivor-1202825039/ |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |work=Variety |date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early August 2018, Helios and Matheson completed the acquisition of Emmett Furla Oasis Films assets for the MoviePass subsidiary, MoviePass Films.&lt;ref name=dl1/&gt;

In August 2018, the company reported a loss of $100 million in the second quarter of 2018 with the company trading at an implied value of $30 million.&lt;ref name="Salinas"&gt;{{cite news |last=Salinas |first=Sara |last2=Forkin |first2=Jim |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/17/new-york-ag-launches-probe-into-moviepass-parent-company-for-allegedly-misleading-investors-source.html |title=New York AG launches probe into MoviePass parent company for allegedly misleading investors |work=[[CNBC]] |date=2018-10-17 |accessdate=2018-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of 2018, the [[Attorney General of New York]] opened an investigation into Helios and Matheson Analytics, looking into whether it misled investors about the company's financial situation.&lt;ref name="Salinas"/&gt;

With market perception of MoviePass affecting Helios &amp; Matheson's stock value, in October 2018 the company revealed a preliminary plan to spin off its film industry units as MoviePass Entertainment Holdings. The plan calls for a stock dividend of a minority of the holding company's stock allowing Helios to retain a controlling interest and for listing the new company on the NASDAQ or alternative market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vlessing |first1=Etan |title=MoviePass Parent to Spin Off Cinema Subscription Service |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/moviepass-parent-confirms-ipo-plans-cinema-subscription-service-1154382 |accessdate=October 23, 2018 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=October 23, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MoviePass Ventures==
On January 19, 2018 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], MoviePass announced the new subsidiary MoviePass Ventures, which would co-acquire films with traditional distributors. Lowe explained that the company wanted to "bring great films to the big screen across the country for our subscribers", and that "given the successes we have demonstrated for our distributor partners in ensuring strong box office in the theatrical window, it's only natural for us to double down and want to play alongside them – and share in the upside."&lt;ref name=vty0/&gt;&lt;ref name=dl0/&gt;

MoviePass Ventures' first acquisition (in partnership with [[The Orchard (company)|The Orchard]]), Bart Layton's ''[[American Animals]]'', was on June 1, 2018, while their second, ''[[Gotti (2018 film)|Gotti]]'' starring John Travolta as the titular [[John Gotti|mob boss]], was released on June 15, 2018.&lt;ref name=dl&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/moviepass-american-animals-the-orchard-1202288609/|title=The Orchard &amp; MoviePass Ventures To Unleash Sundance Acquisition ‘American Animals’ This Summer|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=February 14, 2018|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=February 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MoviePass Venture operation was questioned by some in the industry, with one independent studio head telling ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'': "It used to be in distribution, we'd all gossip whether a studio was buying tickets to their own movie to goose their opening, but in the case of MoviePass, there's no secret: They're literally buying the tickets to their own movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/06/incredibles-2-tag-superfly-weekend-box-office-1202411262/|title='Incredibles 2' Opens To $18.5M In Thursday Previews|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |date=June 15, 2018 |first=Anthony |last= D'Alessandro |accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MoviePass' own reports, the service made up 25–35% of ''American Animals''{{'}} opening weekend ticket sales, and around 40% of ''Gotti''{{'}}s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/06/moviepass-gotti-opening-rotten-tomatoes-0-1202412227/|title=MoviePass Reps 40% Of ‘Gotti’s $1.67M Opening As Critics Slaughter John Travolta Mob Pic|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |date=June 17, 2018 |first=Anthony |last= D'Alessandro |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MoviePass Venture films===
It was noted that the MoviePass Ventures film ''[[Gotti (2018 film)|Gotti]]'' had large disparities between critic and audience scores on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with most of the positive reviews coming from new users, and those whose only other review was of fellow release ''[[American Animals]]''. This led to allegations that MoviePass was attempting to manipulate reviews in order to bolster the service.&lt;ref name="pastescore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/06/something-suspicious-is-happening-with-rotten-toma.html |title=Something Suspicious Is Happening With Rotten Tomatoes User Reviews for Gotti |website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |access-date=June 20, 2018 |date=June 19, 2018 |first=Jim |last=Vorel |publisher=Paste Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etrtscore"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/19/gotti-slams-movie-critics/ |title='Gotti' fires back at movie critics after terrible reviews: 'A troll behind a keyboard' |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=June 20, 2018 |first=James |last=Hibbard |date=June 19, 2018 |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Mystic  Marriage of St. Francis''''' is a  painting by the  Italian Renaissance artist [[Stefano di Giovanni|Sassetta]], currently housed in the [[Musée Condé]] of [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], [[France]].

==Description==
The painting was originally part of a [[polyptych]] at [[Sansepolcro]], where it was seen by [[Piero della Francesca]].

It portrays [[St. Francis of Assisi]] while ideally marrying the three [[Theological Virtues]], Faith, Hope and Charity, through the donation of a ring to them. The three virtues have differently colored dresses: red for Charity, green for Hope and white for Faith; they are also depicted on the left while flying to heaven with sticks in their hands. Behind St. Francis, who wears his traditional brown monk habit, is his companion Fra' Leone.

The scene is set in an idyllic landscape, between hills, castles and cultivated fields, without any attention to perspective and realism as in other Renaissance works. Sassetta was in fact one of the last painters of the Sienese Gothic school, as shown by the use of elongated figures, the delicate colors and the courtly atmosphere.

== Editorial practice ==
Levinson focuses on the opportunities presented by digital and online media for reaching new audiences and expanding the impact of scholarly work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Nancy|date=2013-10-01|title=Print and Pixel|url=https://placesjournal.org/article/print-and-pixel/|journal=Places Journal|language=en-US|issue=2013|doi=10.22269/131001|issn=2164-7798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Levinson’s editorship, ''Places'' moved from print to online and built a substantial and wide-ranging interdisciplinary readership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/news/from-the-editor-2009/|title=From the Editor|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://landscapearchitecturemagazine.org/2014/10/22/places-journal-has-a-new-place/|title=PLACES JOURNAL HAS A NEW PLACE|date=2014-10-22|work=Landscape Architecture Magazine|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson has expanded the mandate of the journal under the tagline “Public scholarship on architecture, landscape, and urbanism”''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/|title=Places Journal|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her editorial direction is described as “harnessing the moral and investigative power of public scholarship to promote equitable cities and sustainable landscapes.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Levinson has led funding campaigns to support the research and publication on topics that might not otherwise be addressed. This has resulted in funding from the [[Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts|Graham Foundation]] for three initiatives – History of the Present: Cities in Transition,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Future Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/5232-future-archive|title=Graham Foundation &gt; Grantees &gt; Places Journal|website=www.grahamfoundation.org|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Writers’ Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/5526-places-journal-writers-fund|title=Graham Foundation &gt; Grantees &gt; Places Journal|website=www.grahamfoundation.org|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inequality Chronicles, a series investigating racial, social and economic inequality in American cities, was funded by [[The Kresge Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/series/the-inequality-chronicles/|title=The Inequality Chronicles: A Series on Places Journal|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinson has also used ''Places'' as a foundation on which to build a range of related enterprises that seek to expand participation, readership and the dissemination of scholarship on the built environment. Initiatives include [https://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/title/places-books.html Places Books], a collaboration between Places and [[Princeton Architectural Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/title/places-books.html|title=Browse Princeton Catalog in Places Books {{!}} Princeton University Press|website=press.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first in the series is ''Where are the Women Architects?'' by [[Despina Stratigakos]], which has been well received across academia and the architectural profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935925102|title=Where are the women architects?|last=Despina,|first=Stratigakos,|isbn=9781400880294|location=Princeton|oclc=935925102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-where-are-the-women-architects-despina-stratigakos-princeton-university-press|title=Where are the Women Architects?, by Despina Stratigakos|last=Samuel|first=Flora|authorlink=Flora Samuel|date=June 2, 2016|website=Times Higher Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archiparlour.org/where-are-the-women-architects/|title=Where are the Women Architects|last=Thompson|first=Kerstin|authorlink=Kerstin Thompson|date=October 10, 2016|website=Parlour: women, equity, architecture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spacing.ca/national/2017/01/24/book-review-where-are-the-women-architects/|title=Book Review: Where Are the Women Architects? - Spacing National|date=2017-01-24|work=Spacing National|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://placesjournal.org/reading-lists/ Places Reading List] is a collaborative tool that allows readers to share knowledge and generate content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/news/places-journal-launches-new-tool-for-interdisciplinary-public-scholarship/|title=Places Journal launches new tool for interdisciplinary public scholarship|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archdaily.com/609192/places-journal-launches-new-tool-for-sharing-articles-about-architecture-landscape-and-urbanism|title=Places Journal Launches New Tool for Sharing Articles about Architecture, Landscape, and Urbanism|date=2015-03-13|work=ArchDaily|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre''' is a full-time [[Drama school|professional conservatory for actors]] located at 340 East 54th Street in New York City, and is known as the home of the [[Meisner technique]], developed by [[Sanford Meisner]].

==History==
[[File:Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre building on Grand Street in 1916.jpg|left|thumb|275px|The Grand Street building in 1916]]
The '''Neighborhood Playhouse''' had originally been founded as an [[off-Broadway]] theatre by philanthropists [[Alice Lewisohn]] and [[Irene Lewisohn]] in 1915, but closed in 1927. The following year, it re-opened as The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre with the addition of Rita Wallach Morgenthau. [[Sanford Meisner]] joined the faculty in 1935 from the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]]. Meisner used his study of Russian theatre and acting innovator, [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Stanislavski System|System]] to develop his own technique, as an alternative to [[Lee Strasberg]]'s [[Method acting]].

The Executive Director Emeritus of the Playhouse, Harold G. Baldridge, a graduate of the school himself, had been head of the school for 32 years. Pamela Moller Kareman serves as the current Executive Director, also a graduate of The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.

The school offers a Two Year Certificate Program, with admission to the second year dependent upon unanimous approval of the faculty. There is also a Six Week Summer Intensive.

The Neighborhood Playhouse also offers Playhouse Juniors, a popular Saturday training program for children in grades 1–12.  Children attend a fixed curriculum of singing, acting and dancing classes in a non-competitive environment.

Playwright [[Horton Foote]] met actor [[Robert Duvall]] at Neighborhood Playhouse when Duvall starred in a 1957 production of Foote's play, ''[[The Midnight Caller (play)|The Midnight Caller]]''. Foote recommended Duvall to play the part of [[List of To Kill a Mockingbird characters#Arthur .22Boo.22 Radley|Boo Radley]] in the 1962 film, ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people= [[Robert Duvall]] (actor), Gary Hertz (director) |date= April 16, 2002 |title = Miracles &amp; Mercies |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/ |medium= Documentary |publisher= [[Blue Underground]] |location= [[West Hollywood]], California |accessdate = 2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

'''Nesting Orientalisms''' is a concept introduced by Milica Bakić-Hayden, a [[visiting lecturer]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. It is based on gradation of "Orients", i.e. otherness and primitiveness.

== Background ==
As developed by Milica Bakić-Hayden, '''Nesting Orientalisms''' is a conceptual variant of [[Edward Said]]'s theory of [[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]; an additional influence is [[Larry Wolff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ashbrook  |first=John E |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Buying and selling the Istrian goat : Istrian regionalism, Croatian nationalism, and EU enlargement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uk9VVZ1esGwC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Nesting+Orientalisms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GuBcTr_SG86N-wbg94HuAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nesting%20Orientalisms%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |series= |origyear= |year=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=New York |isbn=90-5201-391-8 |oclc=213599021 |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=22 |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=Milica Bakić-Hayden built on Wolff's work, incorporating ideas from Edward Said's ''Orientalism'' |laysummary= |laydate= |postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in fact, she already had used the term ‘Nesting Orientalism’ in the article ‘Orientalist Variations on the Theme “Balkans”: Symbolic Geography in Recent Yugoslav Cultural Politics” (1992), co-author Robert Hayden, before Wolff published ''Inventing Eastern Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;Milica Bakic-Hayden and Robert Hayden, "Orientalist Variations on the Theme "Balkans": Symbolic Geography in Recent Yugoslav Cultural Politics" Slavic review, vol. 51, no. 1 (Spring 1992), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The concept ==

This concept explains "a tendency of each region to view the cultures and religions to its South and East as more conservative and primitive".&lt;ref name="Petrović 2009 141"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petrović|first=Tanja|title=Kulturen der Differenz – Transformationsprozesse in Zentraleuropa nach 1989  transdisziplinäre Perspektiven|year=2009|publisher=Vienna Univ. Press|isbn=3-89971-714-7|editor=Heinz Fassmann|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explains how a group which creates the Orientalized other can also be the subject of Orientalization by another group, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cela|first=Alba|title=‘Orientalism’ in service of Contemporary National Identity Building in Albania: The literary work of Ismail Kadare.|url=http://web.ceu.hu/nation/theses/Cela.pdf|accessdate=|edition=|series=|origyear=|year=2006|publisher=Central European University Nationalism Studies Program|location=Budapest, Hungary|isbn=|oclc=|doi-inactive-date=|bibcode=|id=|page=18|nopp=|at=|chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=Milica Bakic-Hayden’s work on “Nesting Orientalisms”... exposed how the project of creating a necessary other sometimes involves the Orientalization of one group by another, who has been in turn Orientalized by another, and so on.|laysummary=|laydate=|postscript=|lastauthoramp=|ref=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003122409/http://web.ceu.hu/nation/theses/Cela.pdf|archivedate=3 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this concept Asia is more "east" or "other" than Eastern Europe. Within Eastern Europe the [[Balkans]] is perceived as most "eastern". Such hierarchy continues within the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harrington  |first=Carol |author2=Ayman Salem |author3=Tamara Zurabishvili |title=After communism : critical perspectives on society and sociology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNejIRHgCyIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22Nesting+Orientalisms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GuBcTr_SG86N-wbg94HuAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nesting%20Orientalisms%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |series= |origyear= |location= |isbn=978-0-8204-6951-5 |oclc=56334118 |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=84 |quote=...Hayden very interestingly introduced the idea of 'nesting Orientalism', which contains the process of descending East/West exclusion: "The gradation of 'Orients' that I call 'nesting Orientalisms' is a pattern of reproduction of the original dichotomy upon which the Orientalism is premised.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nesting Balkanisms ===
In the case of the Balkans there are many rankings connected with this concept, which "play a significant role in . . . [[Identity (social science)|identity]] building [and proclaiming] a more prestigious position within a generally negatively assessed entity".&lt;ref name=Ethnologia37&gt;{{Citation |last=Elchinova |first= Magdalena |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Bulgaria's Way to Europe: Some Aspects of Identity Construction Among Bulgarian Students Today |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0ogSzrXJEfMC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22Nesting+Orientalisms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UUddToTxDOSk4AT93pUm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nesting%20Orientalisms%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |series=Ethnologia Balkanica |volume=8 |origyear= |year= 2004 |publisher=Prof. M.

Hence, Bulgarian historian [[Maria Todorova]] introduced the related concept of "nesting balkanisms".&lt;ref name=Ethnologia37/&gt; Todorova emphasized the importance of this concept in identity constructions, which in the case of the Balkans involve the dual perception of the Balkans as a part of Europe but also as in opposition, as the "darker side" of Europe.&lt;ref name=Ethnologia37/&gt;

=== Nesting Colonialisms ===

Another concept related to the concept of nesting orientalisms was introduced by Tanja Petrović, a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] from [[Slovenia]]: that of "nesting colonialisms", which is marked by parallels and analogies of the [[European Union]] and the rest of the world, which are perceived as former colonial powers and former colonies. This concept provides members of European Union, no matter whether they had a colonial past or not, with a "pool" of discursive patterns used for exclusion of those who are outside the European Union.&lt;ref name="Petrović 2009 141"/&gt;

=== Nesting Occidentalisms ===

Bulgarian intellectuals have modified the concept of Nesting Orientalisms into the reversed concept of ''Nesting Occidentalisms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bracewell|first=Wendy|title=Balkan Departures: Travel Writing from South-Eastern Europe|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn|location=New York|isbn=1-84545-254-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCb4_3H6yjkC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=%22nesting+occidentalisms%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ysRGvoXMRf&amp;sig=Ee2z3xuTCstOBgAWDvkGnAl9eSk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KixeTrDaLsbb4QSL2Jke&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nesting%20occidentalisms%22&amp;f=false|author2=Alex Drace-Francis|accessdate=31 August 2011|page=111|quote=Milica Bakić Hayden speaks of "nesting Orientalisms". Bulgarian intellectuals ... appear to have ... adopted a reversed version of her model. They approach Europe in terms of 'nesting Occidentalisms' or a 'gradation of Occidents'. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of nesting occidentalisms is present in the 2006 [[mockumentary]] ''[[Borat]]'', which exploits foreign and domestic hierarchies of [[Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hall|first=Richard Andrew|editor=|editorn=|editorn-last=|editorn-first=|editor-link=|editorn-link=|others=|title=BORAT: ORIENTALIST SATIRE FOR MAKE GLORIOUS DEBATE WESTERN INTELLIGENTSIYA|url=http://homepage.mac.com/khallbobo/RichardHall/pubs/boratslavicreview022807.pdf|accessdate=|edition=|series=|origyear=|location=|isbn=|oclc=|doi-inactive-date=|bibcode=|id=|nopp=|at=|chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=Borat! is replete with what might be called 'nesting occidentalisms' or 'nesting antiAmericanisms':  that is, it creates and plays on foreign and domestic hierarchies of Americans, good, bad, and ugly|laysummary=|laydate=|postscript=|lastauthoramp=|ref=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305073153/http://homepage.mac.com/khallbobo/RichardHall/pubs/boratslavicreview022807.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Nihon Bijutsu Token Hozon Kyokai''''' ({{Nihongo|日本美術刀剣保存協会}}) ('''NBTHK''') or '''Society for the Preservation of Japanese Art Swords''' is an agency of the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] whose remit is the registration and preservation of antique [[Japanese sword|swords]].

The [[Agency for Cultural Affairs|Japanese Cultural Affairs Agency]] founded the NBTHK in 1948, in response to the [[Occupied Japan|Allied prohibition]] on Japanese swords after [[World War Two]].&lt;ref name=probe&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Raid Society for Preservation of Japanese Art Swords|url=http://www.japanprobe.com/2010/09/30/police-raid-society-for-preservation-of-japanese-art-swords/|publisher=Japan Probe|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RousmaniereMuseum2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicole Coolidge Rousmaniere|author2=British Museum|author3=Kokuritsu Kindai Bijutsukan (Japan) |author4=Kyōto Kokuritsu Kindai Bijutsukan |author5=Nihon Kōgeikai |author6=Kokusai Kōryū Kikin|title=Crafting beauty in modern Japan: celebrating fifty years of the Japan traditional art crafts exhibition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRnrAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 April 2013|date=30 August 2007|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98733-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The NBTHK holds annual competitions for modern swordsmiths, which is the highlight of the Japanese sword-making calendar.

The Society issues certification for antique swords. There are four levels of classification in this system: ''hozon'' (worthy of preservation), ''tokubetsu hozon'' (high value work worthy of preservation), ''juyo token'' (important sword) and ''tokubetsu juyo token'' (highest value and importance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Worth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-IJAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 April 2013|year=2007|publisher=CurtCo.

[[File:Pan-asian-theatre.jpg|thumb|250px|Theatre entrance]]
The '''Pan Asian Repertory Theatre''' is a [[New York City]]-based theatre group that explores the [[Asian American|Asian-American]] experience and provides professional opportunities for Asian-American artists to collaborate. Pan-Asian was founded by [[Tisa Chang]] in 1977 "with her salary from six months of [[The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel]] with [[Al Pacino]],"&lt;ref name=Haun&gt;Harry Haun, [http://www.playbill.com/article/40-years-on-pan-asian-rep-still-uses-art-as-protest "40 Years On, Pan Asian Rep Still Uses Art as Protest"], Playbill, June 16th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; who continues on today as artistic director. Chang established the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre as a resident company at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] in 1977, with the intention of popularizing [[Asian American theater|Asian-American theater]]. [[Mel Gussow]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that "Before Pan Asian Rep, Asian Americans had severely limited opportunities in the theater… [now] heartened by Ms. Chang's example, similar companies have sprung up around the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/22/theater/a-stage-for-all-the-world-of-asian-americans.html "A Stage for All the World of Asian-Americans"], New York Times, April 22nd, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  For over thirty years, Pan Asian has created opportunities for underrepresented artists to  stage modern classics that give insight into the Asian-American experience.

Specializing in intercultural productions of new Asian-American plays, Asian classics in translation, and innovative adaptations of Western classics, some of the works Pan Asian has presented included: 
*''Empress of China'' - featuring [[Tina Chen]] in the title role of China's last dowager ruler
*''[[Yellow Fever (play)|Yellow Fever]] -'' continued to an [[Off-Broadway]] run
*''[[Ghashiram Kotwal]] -'' [[Marathi language|Marathi]] play with music
*''Teahouse'' - by [[Lao She]], spanning fifty years of modern Chinese history
*''Cambodia Agonistes'' - by Ernest Abuba, music by Louis Stewart
*''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (play)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]'' - by [[John Patrick (dramatist)|John Patrick]]
*''Forbidden City Blues -'' by Alexander Woo
*''The Fan Tan King'' - by C. Y. Leethe, world premiere
*''Yohen -'' by [[Philip Kan Gotanda]]
*''Tea -'' by [[Velina Hasu Houston]], 20th anniversary production
Pan Asian has staged early works of writers including Momoko Iko, [[Wakako Yamauchi]], [[Philip Kan Gotanda]], [[Rick Shiomi|R. A. Shiomi]], and [[David Henry Hwang]]. 

Pan Asian Rep had a season in the West End Theatre in the [[Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew (New York City)|Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew]], and in 2007 returned to the Julia Miles Theatre to revive their classic productions with a large cast. Major programs include the Senior Artist Resident Ensemble, the Theatre For Youth program, touring and residencies domestically and internationally, the Staged Reading Series directed by Ron Nakahara, and Actor Training Workshops taught by Ernest Abuba.

The company has been invited to several national theater festivals including Edinburgh in 1988, Singapore in 1992, Cairo and Johannesburg (1995), and the Xi Havana Theatre Festival in 2003. From June 11–24, 2007, Pan Asian served along with [[Ma-Yi Theater Company|Ma-Yi Theater]] and NAATCO as a Co-Steering Committee member of the first National Asian American Theatre Festival. The two-week festival brought work from more than 35 emerging and established artists and ensembles from across the United States to 13 venues around New York City.

Pan Asian celebrated its 39th anniversary in 2016, and continues a cycle of Masterpiece productions. The cycle began in 2007 with ''The Joy Luck Club,'' a play by Susan Kim adapted from the novel by [[Amy Tan]], directed and choreographed by [[Tisa Chang]]. In 2008, Pan Asian presented the first professional theatrical production of ''The Missing Woman'', written and directed by Nguyen thi Minh Ngoc. The play was performed in Vietnamese and English, and  enabled diverse audiences to explore themes of social justice and human rights through the lens of traditional Vietnamese art forms. ''The Missing Woman'' represented Pan Asian's efforts towards international artistic collaboration.

''Shogun Macbeth'' opened the 2008 season. Adapted by John R. Briggs from Shakespeare's [[Macbeth]], the epic production combined medieval history with traditional Japanese techniques of Noh, Kyogen, and Samurai sword fighting, while retaining the complexity of [[Shakespearean]] language. Ernest Abuba, who had acted in the title role 22 years prior, directed the 2008 production. In the fall of 2009, the company produced ''Imelda'', a new musical based on the controversial figure of [[Imelda Marcos]]. Pan Asian Repertory Theatre and [[East West Players]] collaborated on this production, which was directed by Tim Dang, with the book by Sachi Oyama, lyrics by Aaron Coleman, music by Nathan Wang, and choreography by Reggie Lee.

In spring 2010, Pan Asian produced the East Coast premiere of ''Ching Chong Chinaman'', a comedy by Lauren Yee and directed by May Adrales. The work used the pejorative jingle to examine common assumptions about identity and culture. Pan Asian continued their relationship with Vietnamese audiences and artists with 2011's "Vietnam Project II: Past and Present". This included productions of Nguyen thi Minh Ngoc's ''We Are'', about Vietnamese women who work or marry abroad, and Derek Nguyen's ''Monster'', about a Vietnamese-American detective in search of a missing child and his past. The company's 35th anniversary season included ''Shanghai Lil's'' by Lilah Kan with music by Louis Stewart, a musical about the nightclub scene in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]] just prior to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; and Mayank Keshaviah's ''Rangoon'', a world premiere about a family of Indian immigrants pursuing the [[American Dream]].

For their 41st season starting in 2017, Pan-Asian Rep featured the show ''Daybreak'' by [[Joyce Van Dyke]], which features the Armenian Genocide in the 1920s. If asked why Armenia, Chang replies: "Because Pan Asian is all of Asia and Polynesia. And I also feel the Middle East needs to be represented. It’s a very affirming play and, again, a story seldom told. If anything, history tends to hide traumatic periods, so I think that it’s a great service we do presenting these stories."&lt;ref name=Haun&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Theodor Lipps]], a Munich-based research psychologist, played an important role in the early development of the concept of ''art psychology'' in the early decade of the twentieth century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} His most important contribution in this respect was his attempt to theorize the question of Einfuehlung or "[[empathy]]", a term that was to become a key element in many subsequent theories of ''art psychology''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

== History ==

===1880-1950===
One of the earliest to integrate psychology with [[art history]] was [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), a Swiss art critic and historian, whose dissertation ''Prolegomena zu einer Psychologie der Architektur'' (1886) attempted to show that architecture could be understood from a purely psychological (as opposed to a historical-progressivist) point of view.&lt;ref name=Jarzombek&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]. ''The Psychologizing of Modernity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure in the development of art psychology was [[Wilhelm Worringer]], who provided some of the earliest theoretical justification for expressionist art. The Psychology of Art (1925) by [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896–1934) is another classical work. [[Richard Müller-Freienfels]] was another important early theorist.&lt;ref name="RMF"&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychologie der Kunst | author=Müller-Freienfels, R | publisher=Teubner | location=Leipzig, Germany | year=1923 | url=https://archive.org/details/psychologiederk00fregoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Numerous artists in the twentieth century began to be influenced by the psychological argument, including [[Naum Gabo]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and somewhat [[Josef Albers]] and [[György Kepes]]. The French adventurer and film theorist [[André Malraux]] was also interested in the topic and wrote the book [[La Psychologie de l'Art]] (1947-9) later revised and republished as ''The Voices of Silence''.

===1950-present===
Though the disciplinary foundations of art psychology were first developed in Germany, there were soon advocates, in psychology, the arts or in philosophy, pursuing their own variants in the USSR, England ([[Clive Bell]] and [[Herbert Read]]), France ([[André Malraux]], [[Jean-Paul Weber]], for example), and the US.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the US, the philosophical premises of art psychology were strengthened—and given political valence—in the work of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the High Time of American Liberalism''. W.W. Norton 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Art as Experience'' was published in 1934, and was the basis for significant revisions in teaching practices whether in the kindergarten or in the university. Manuel Barkan, head of the Arts Education School of Fine and Applied Arts at Ohio State University, and one of the many pedagogues influenced by the writings of Dewey, explains, for example, in his book ''The Foundations of Art Education'' (1955), that the aesthetic education of children prepares the child for a life in a complex democracy. Dewey himself played a seminal role in setting up the program of the [[Barnes Foundation]] in Philadelphia, which became famous for its attempt to integrate art into the classroom experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wattenmaker, Richard J.; [[Distel, Anne]], et al. (1993). ''Great French Paintings from the Barnes Foundation''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. pp. 6, 13–14. {{ISBN|0-679-40963-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of art psychology between 1950 and 1970 also coincided with the expansion of art history and museum programs. The popularity of [[Gestalt psychology]] in the 1950s added further weight to the discipline. The seminal work was ''Gestalt Therapy: Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality'' (1951), that was co-authored by [[Fritz Perls]], Paul Goodman, and Ralph Hefferline. The writings of [[Rudolf Arnheim]] (born 1904) were also particularly influential during this period. His ''Toward a Psychology of Art'' (Berkeley: University of California Press) was published in 1966. [[Art therapy]] drew on many of the lessons of art psychology and tried to implement them in the context of ego repair.&lt;ref&gt;see for example: Arthur Robbins and Linda Beth Sibley, ''Creative Art Therapy''. (Brunner/Mazel, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marketing]] also began to draw on the lessons of art psychology in the layout of stores as well as in the placement and design of commercial goods.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Creating images and the psychology of marketing communication'', Edited by Lynn R. Kahle &amp; Chung-Hyun Kim (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art psychology, generally speaking, was at odds with the principles of Freudian [[psychoanalysis]] with many art psychologists critiquing, what they interpreted as, its reductivism [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that the creative process is an alternative to neuroses. He felt that it was likely a sort of defence mechanism against the negative effects of neuroses, a way to translate that energy into something socially acceptable, which could entertain and please others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Jeff|title=Understanding Creativity: What Drives us to Create?|url=http://www.naturibeauty.com/understanding-creativity-drives-us-create/|publisher=Psychology of Beauty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of [[Carl Jung]], however, had a favorable reception among art psychologists given his optimistic portrayal of the role of art and his belief that the contents of the personal unconscious and, more particularly, the collective unconscious, could be accessed by art and other forms of cultural expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man and His Symbols |editor-last1=Jung |editor-first1=Carl |editor-first2=Marie-Luise |editor-last2=von Franz|year=1964 |publisher=Aldus Books Ltd. |location=London |isbn=0385052219 |oclc=224253 |titlelink=Man and His Symbols|pages=18–103 |chapter=Approaching the Unconscious|first=Carl|last=Jung}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man and His Symbols |editor-last1=Jung |editor-first1=Carl |editor-first2=Marie-Luise |editor-last2=von Franz|year=1964 |publisher=Aldus Books Ltd. |location=London |isbn=0385052219 |oclc=224253 |titlelink=Man and His Symbols|pages=230–271 |chapter=Symbolism in the Visual Arts |last= Jaffe|first=Aniela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the centrality of art psychology in academy began to wane. Artists became more interested in [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock (ed.), ''Psychoanalysis and the Image''. (Oxford: Blackwell. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher (ed.), ''Inside the Visible''. (MIT Press, Boston, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and architects in [[phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] and the writings of [[Wittgenstein]], [[Lyotard]] and [[Derrida]]. As for art and architectural historians, they critiqued psychology for being anti-contextual and culturally naive. [[Erwin Panofsky]], who had a tremendous{{peacock term|date=June 2016}} impact on the shape of art history in the US, argued that historians should focus less on what is seen and more on what was thought.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Podro ''The Critical Historians of Art'' (Yale University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Arnold and Margaret Iverson (eds.) ''Art and Thought''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, psychology still plays an important role in art discourse, though mainly in the field of art appreciation.&lt;ref name=Jarzombek/&gt;

Because of the growing interest in personality theory—especially in connection with the work of Isabel Briggs Myers and Katherine Briggs (developers of the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]])—contemporary theorists are investigating the relationship between personality type and art. Patricia Dinkelaker and John Fudjack have addressed the relationship between artists’ personality types and works of art; approaches to art as a reflection of functional preferences associated with personality type; and the function of art in society in light of personality theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap3x.net/EMBTI/j7readintro.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic Experience==

Art is considered to be a subjective field, in which one composes and views artwork in unique ways that reflect one’s experience, knowledge, preference, and emotions.  The aesthetic experience encompasses the relationship between the viewer and the art object.  In terms of the artist, there is an emotional attachment that drives the focus of the art.  An artist must be completely in-tune with the art object in order to enrich its creation.&lt;ref name="M &amp; S"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0014292|title=An experiential account of the psychology of art|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|volume=3|issue=3|pages=181–187|year=2009|last1=Sullivan|first1=Paul|last2=McCarthy|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the piece of art progresses during the creative process, so does the artist.  Both grow and change to acquire new meaning.  If the artist is too emotionally attached or lacking emotional compatibility with a work of art, then this will negatively impact the finished product.&lt;ref name="M &amp; S"/&gt;  According to Bosanquet (1892), the "aesthetic attitude" is important in viewing art because it allows one to consider an object with ready interest to see what it suggests.  However, art does not evoke an aesthetic experience unless the viewer is willing and open to it.  No matter how compelling the object is, it is up to the beholder to allow the existence of such an experience.&lt;ref name="B &amp; S"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Lloyd E.|last1=Sandelands|first2=Georgette C.|last2=Buckner|chapter=Of Art and Work: Aesthetic Experience and the Psychology of Work Feelings|chapter-url=http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/lsandel/PDFs/Of%20Art%20and%20Work.pdf|title=Research in Organizational Behavior|volume=11|pp=105–131|isbn=9780892329212|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073948/http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/lsandel/PDFs/Of%20Art%20and%20Work.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eyes of Gestalt psychologist Rudolf Arnheim, the aesthetic experience of art stresses the relationship between the whole object and its individual parts.  He is widely known for focusing on the experiences and interpretations of artwork, and how they provide insight into peoples' lives.  He was less concerned with the cultural and social contexts of the experience of creating and viewing artwork.  In his eyes, an object as a whole is considered with less scrutiny and criticism than the consideration of the specific aspects of its entity.  Artwork reflects one’s "lived experience" of his/her life.  Arnheim believed that all psychological processes have cognitive, emotional, and motivational qualities, which are reflected in the compositions of every artist.&lt;ref name="M &amp; S"/&gt;

==Psychological research==

===Overview: bottom-up and top-down processing===
Cognitive psychologists consider both "bottom-up" and "top-down" processing when considering almost any area of research, including vision.&lt;ref name=Lindell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindell|first=Annukka K.|author2=Mueller, Julia |title=Can science account for taste?

=== Abstract versus figurative art ===
[[Abstract paintings]] are unique in the explicit abandonment of representational intentions.&lt;ref name=Landau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landau|first=Mark J.|author2=Greenberg, Jeff |author3=Solomon, Sheldon |author4=Pyszczynski, Tom |author5= Martens, Andy |title=Windows Into Nothingness: Terror Management, Meaninglessness, and Negative Reactions to Modern Art|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=90|issue=6|pages=879–892|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.6.879|pmid=16784340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figurative or [[representational art]] is described as unambiguous or requiring mild interpretation.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt;

==== The importance of meaning ====
The popular distaste for abstract art is a direct consequence of [[semantic ambiguity]].&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt; Researchers have examined the role of [[Terror management theory|terror management theory (TMT)]] concerning meaning and the aesthetic experience of abstract versus figurative art. This theory suggests that humans, like all life forms are biologically oriented toward continued survival but are uniquely aware that their lives will inevitably end. TMT reveals that modern art is often disliked because it lacks appreciable meaning, and is thus incompatible with the underlying terror management motive to maintain a meaningful conception of reality.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt;  [[Mortality salience]], or the knowledge of approaching death, was manipulated in a study aimed at examining how aesthetic preferences for seemingly meaningful and meaningless art are influenced by intimations of mortality. The mortality salience condition consisted of two opened ended questions about emotions and physical details concerning the participant’s own death.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt; Participants were then instructed to view two abstract paintings and rate how attractive they find them.  A t test comparing the mortality salience condition and the control found that participants in the mortality salience condition found the art less attractive.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt;

The meaning maintenance model of sociology states that when a committed meaning framework is threatened, people experience an arousal state that prompts them to affirm any other meaning framework to which they are committed.&lt;ref name="Absurd art"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proulx|first=T.|author2=Heine, S. J. |author3=Vohs, K. D. |title=When Is the Unfamiliar the Uncanny? Meaning Affirmation After Exposure to Absurdist Literature, Humor, and Art|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=5 May 2010|volume=36|issue=6|pages=817–829|doi=10.1177/0146167210369896|pmid=20445024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers sought to illustrate this phenomenon by demonstrating a heightened personal need for structure following the experience of abstract artwork.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt;  Participants were randomly assigned to a between-subjects viewing of artwork (abstract vs. representational vs. absurd artwork), followed by allocation of the Personal Need for Structure scale. Personal Need for Structure scale is used to detect temporary increases in people’s need for meaning.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt; Theoretically, one should experience more need for structure when viewing abstract art than figurative art since unrelated meaning threats (abstract art) evoke a temporarily heightened general need for meaning.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt; However, results showed that overall scores for representational art, and abstract art did not differ significantly from one another.  Participants reported higher scores on the Personal Need for Structure scale in absurd rather than abstract art. Yet, the question remains as to whether the same kinds of results would be obtained with an expanded sample of abstract expressionist or absurd images.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt;

==== Complexity ====

Studies have shown that when looking at abstract art, people prefer complexity in the work to a certain extent.  When measuring "interestingness" and "pleasingness," viewers rated works higher for abstract works that were more complex.  With added exposure to the abstract work, liking ratings continued to rise with both subjective complexity (viewer rated) and judged complexity (artist rated).  This was only true up to a certain point.  When the works became too complex, people began to like the works less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=237–249|doi=10.1037/h0082029|title=Preference for non-representational art as a function of various measures of complexity|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie|volume=29|issue=3|year=1975|last1=Nicki|first1=R. M.|last2=Moss|first2=Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neural evidence ====
Neuroanatomical evidence from studies using [[fMRI]] scans of aesthetic preference show that representational paintings are preferred over abstract paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neuroanatomical correlates of aesthetic preference for paintings|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychology|year=2004|volume=15|issue=5|pages=893–897|doi=10.1097/00001756-200404090-00032|last1=Vartanian|first1=Oshin|last2=Goel|first2=Vinod}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is displayed through significant activation of brain regions related to preference ratings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt;  To test this, researchers had participants view paintings that varied according to type (representational vs. abstract) and format (original vs. altered vs. filtered). Behavioral results demonstrated a significantly higher preference for representational paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt; A positive correlation existed between preference ratings and response latency. FMRI results revealed that activity in the right [[caudate nucleus]] extending to [[putamen]] decreased in response to decreasing preference for paintings, while activity in the left [[cingulate sulcus]], [[Gyri|bilateral occipital gyri]], [[Gyri|bilateral fusiform gyri]], [[Gyri|right fusiform gyrus]], and [[Cerebellum|bilateral cerebellum]] increased in response to increasing preference for paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt;  The observed differences were a reflection of relatively increased activation associated with higher preference for representational paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt;

Brain wave studies have also been conducted to look at how artists and non-artists react in different ways to abstract and representational art.  EEG brain scans showed that while viewing abstract art, non-artists showed less arousal than artists.  However, while viewing figurative art, both artists and non-artists had comparable arousal and ability to pay attention and evaluate the art stimuli.  This suggests abstract art requires more expertise to appreciate it than does figurative art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Style and spectral power: Processing of abstract and representational art in artists and non-artists|journal=Perception|date=11 June 2010|volume=39|issue=12|pages=1659–1671|doi=10.1068/p6747|pmid=21425703|author1=Batt|first1=R|last2=Palmiero|first2=M|last3=Nakatani|first3=C|last4=Van Leeuwen|first4=C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Personality type ====
Individual personality traits are also related to aesthetic experience and art preference. Individuals chronically disposed to clear, simple, and unambiguous knowledge express a particularly negative aesthetic experience towards abstract art, due to the void of meaningful content.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt; Studies have provided evidence that a person’s choice of art can be a useful measure of personality.&lt;ref name=Personality&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personality and judgments of abstract, pop art, and representational paintings|journal=European Journal of Personality|year=2001|volume=15|issue=1|pages=57–72|doi=10.1002/per.340|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian|last2=Walker|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual personality traits are related to aesthetic experience and art preference. Testing personality after viewing abstract and representational art was performed on the [[NEO-Five Factor Inventory|NEO Five-Factor Inventory]] which measures the [[Big Five personality traits|“big five” factors of personality]].&lt;ref name=Personality /&gt;  When referencing the “Big Five” dimensions of personality, Thrill and Adventure Seeking were positively correlated with a liking of representational art, while Disinhibition was associated with positive ratings of abstract art. Neuroticism was positively correlated with positive ratings of abstract art, while Conscientiousness was linked to liking of representational art. Openness to Experience was linked to positive ratings of abstract and representational art.&lt;ref name=Personality /&gt;

==== Automatic evaluation ====

Studies looking at implicit, automatic evaluation of art works have investigated how people react to abstract and figurative art works in the split-second before they had time to think about it.  In implicit evaluation, people reacted more positively to the figurative art, where they could at least make out the shapes.  In terms of explicit evaluation, when people had to think about the art, there was no real difference in judgement between abstract and representational art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano |author2=Bartoli, Gabriella |author3=Carrus, Giuseppe|title=The Automatic Aesthetic Evaluation of Different Art and Architectural Styles|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=May 2011|volume=5|issue=2|pages=126–134|doi=10.1037/a0021126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laterality and movement ===

==== Handedness and reading direction ====

Laterality and movement in visual art includes aspects such as interest, weight, and balance. Many studies have been conducted on the impact of handedness and reading direction on how one perceives a piece of art. Research has been conducted to determine if hemispheric specialization or reading habits affect the direction in which participants “read” a painting. Results indicate that both factors contribute to the process. Furthermore, hemispheric specialization leads individuals to read from left to right, giving those readers an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maass|first=A|author2=Russo, A |title=Directional bias in the mental representation of spatial events: nature or culture?|journal=Psychological Science|date=July 2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=296–301|pmid=12807400|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.14421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Building off of these findings, other researchers studied the idea that individuals who are accustomed to reading in a certain direction (right to left, versus left to right) would then display a bias in their own representational drawings reflecting the direction of their reading habits. Results indicated that this prediction held true, in that participants’ drawings reflected their reading bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaid|first=Jyotsna|author2=Rhodes, Rebecca |author3=Tosun, Sumeyra |author4= Eslami, Zohra |title=Script Directionality Affects Depiction of Depth in Representational Drawings|journal=Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=3|pages=241–248|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000068|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers also looked to see if one’s reading direction, left to right or right to left affects one’s preference for either a left to right directionality or a right to left directionality in pictures. Participants were shown images as well as its mirror image, and were asked to indicate which they found more aesthetically pleasing. Overall, results indicate that one’s reading directionality impacts one’s preference for pictures either with left to right directionality or right to left directionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chokron|first=Sylvie|author2=De Agostini, Maria|title=Reading habits influence aesthetic preference|journal=Cognitive Brain Research|volume=10|issue=1–2|pages=45–49|doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(00)00021-5|pmid=10978691|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, researchers examined if the right-side bias in aesthetic preference is affected by handedness or reading/writing habits. The researchers looked at Russian readers, Arabic readers, and Hebrew readers that were right handed and non-right-handed. Participants viewed pictures taken from art books that were profiles or human faces and bodies in two blocks. Images were shown to participants as inward or outward facing pairs and then in the opposite orientation. After viewing each pair, participants were asked which image of the pair was more aesthetically pleasing. When looking at the results for handedness, right-handed participants had "left preferences" and non right-handed participants had "right preferences". These results indicated that “aesthetic preference for facial and bodily profiles is associated primarily with the directionality of acquired reading/writing habits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nachson|first=I.|author2=Argaman, E. |author3=Luria, A. |title=Effects of Directional Habits and Handedness on Aesthetic Preference for Left and Right Profiles|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=106–114|doi=10.1177/0022022199030001006|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reading direction seems to impact how people of all ages view artwork. Using kindergarten to college aged participants, researchers tested viewers’ aesthetic preference when comparing an original piece of art with its mirror image. The original paintings followed the convention that viewers "read" paintings from left to right; therefore, the patterns of light directed the audience to view the painting in the same manner. Findings indicated that participants preferred the original paintings, most likely due to the western style of viewing paintings from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swartz|first=Paul|author2=Hewitt, David |title=Lateral organization in pictures and aesthetic preference|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1970|volume=30|issue=3|pages=991–1007|doi=10.2466/pms.1970.30.3.991|pmid=5429349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lighting direction====

The direction of the lighting placed on a painting also seems to have an effect on aesthetic preference. The left-light bias is the tendency for viewers to prefer artwork that is lit with lighting coming from the left hand side of the painting. Researchers predicted that participants would prefer artwork that was lit from the left side and when given the option, they would choose to place lighting on the upper left side of a piece of artwork. Participants found paintings with lighting on the left to be more aesthetically pleasing than when it was lighter on the right side and when given the opportunity to create light on an already existing painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDine|first=David A.|author2=Livingston, Ian J. |author3=Thomas, Nicole A. |author4= Elias, Lorin J. |title=Lateral biases in lighting of abstract artwork|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|volume=16|issue=3|pages=268–279|doi=10.1080/13576500903548382|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Left and right cheek bias====

The left cheek bias occurs when viewers prefer portraits with the subject displaying their left cheek, while those that hold a right cheek bias prefer portraits displaying the right cheek. Studies have found mixed results concerning the left cheek bias and the right cheek bias. Male and female participants were shown male and female portraits, each displaying an equal number of left or right cheek positions.  Participants were shown each portrait in its original orientation and in its reversed orientation and asked which portrait they preferred more. Results indicated that the majority of participants chose portraits displaying the subject’s right cheek over the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=John P.|author2=Murphy, Kimberly E. |title=Preference for Profile Orientation in Portraits|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.2190/MUD5-7V3E-YBN2-Q2XJ|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study explored which posing orientations conveyed certain messages. Scientists in the 18th century{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} more commonly displayed a right cheek bias, and were rated as “more scientific.” According to the researchers, showing one’s right cheek hides emotion, while the left cheek expresses it. The shift from right to left cheek bias post 18th century may represent more personal or open facial characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=175–192|doi=10.1023/A:1020713416442|year=2002|last1=ten Cate|first1=Carel|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|title=Posing as Professor: Laterality in Posing Orientation for Portraits of Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===

Complexity can literally be defined as being "made up of a large number of parts that have many interactions."&lt;ref name="Simon (Econ)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=H. A.|title=The Sciences of the Artificial|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been applied to many subjects, such as art, music, dance, and literature. In aesthetics research, complexity has been divided into three dimensions that account for the interaction between the amount of elements, differences in elements, and patterns in their arrangement. Furthermore, this characteristic in aesthetics consists of a wide spectrum, ranging from low complexity to high complexity. Key studies have found through [[Galvanic skin response]] that more complex artworks produce greater physiological arousal and higher hedonic ratings,&lt;ref name=Krupinski&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krupinski|first=E|author2=Locher, P |title=Skin conductance and aesthetic evaluative responses to nonrepresentational works of art varying in symmetry|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|year=1988|volume=26|issue=4|pages=355–358|doi=10.3758/bf03337681}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is consistent with other findings that claim that aesthetic liking increases with complexity. Most important, several studies have found that there exists a [[#Inverse U-Shape hypothesis|U-shape]] relationship between aesthetic preference and complexity.&lt;ref name="Berlyne 1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berlyne|first=D.E.|title=Aesthetics and Psychobiology|year=1971|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measuring complexity====
In general, complexity is a something that has many parts in an intricate progression. Some researchers break complexity down into two different subparts: objective complexity and perceived complexity. Objective complexity is any part of art that could be manipulated. For visual art that may be the size of the shapes, the number of patterns, or the number of colors used. For acoustic art that could include duration, loudness, number of different harmonies, number of changes in rhythmic activity, and rate of rhythmic activity.&lt;ref name=Orr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=Mark|author2=Ohlsson, Stellan |title=Relationship Between Complexity and Liking as a Function of Expertise|journal=Music Perception|year=2005|volume=22|issue=4|pages=583–611|doi=10.1525/mp.2005.22.4.583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of complexity is perceived complexity, or subjective complexity. In this form each individual person rates an object on the complexity they perceive. Therefore, subjective complexity might depict our view of complexity more accurately, however, the measure may change from person to person.

One form of using computer technology to rate complexity, is by using computer intelligence when rating an image.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=K.|author2=Harrell, S. |author3=Ji, X. |title=Computational Aesthetics: On the Complexity of Computer-Generated Paintings|journal=Leonardo|year=2012|volume=45|issue=3|pages=243–248|doi=10.1162/leon_a_00366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this format, the amount of computer intelligence used is assessed when creating a digital image. Computer intelligence is assessed by recording the mathematic formulas used in creating the images. Human involvement, adding or taking away aspects of the image, could also add or take away from the complexity of the image.&lt;ref name=Zhang /&gt;

One way to measure complexity is to manipulate original artwork to contain various levels of density.  This process is done by subtracting and adding pixels to change the density of black and white paintings. This technique allowed researchers to use authentic artwork, instead of creating artificial versions of artwork, to control stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neperud|first=Ronald|author2=Marschalek |title=Informational and Affect Bases of Aesthetic Response|journal=Leonardo|year=1988|volume=21|issue=3|pages=305–31|doi=10.2307/1578660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still others find it best to measure complexity based on the number of parts an artwork has.&lt;ref name=Chamorro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=T|author2=Burke, C. |title=Personality Predictors of Artistic Preferences as a Function of Emotional Valence and Perceived Complexity of Paintings|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics Creativity, and the Arts|year=2010|volume=4|issue=4|doi=10.1037/a0019211|pages=196–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; More aspects to the art, such as more colors, details, shapes, objects, sounds, melodies, and the like, create a more complex artwork. However, there is limited research done on the comparison between part based complexity and human perception of complexity, making it unclear if people perceive images with more parts as being more complex.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

====Inverse U-Shape hypothesis====

[[File:Inverted u.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Inverted-U Graph.]]
The Inverted U-Shape Hypothesis suggests that aesthetic responses in relation to complexity will exhibit an inverted-shape distribution.  In other words, the lowest ratings in aesthetic responses correlate with high and low levels of complexity, which displays an "avoidance of extremes". Furthermore, the highest level of aesthetic response occurs in the middle level of complexity.&lt;ref name="Berlyne 1971" /&gt; Previous studies have confirmed the U-Shape hypothesis (see Inverted U-graph image). For instance, in a study of undergraduates’ ratings of liking and complexity of contemporary pop music reported an inverted U-shape relationship between liking and complexity.&lt;ref name=North /&gt;

Previous research, suggest that this trend of complexity could also be associated with ability to understand, in which observers prefer artwork that is not too easy or too difficult to comprehend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=P. J.|title=What Is Interesting? Exploring the Appraisal Structure of Interest|journal=Emotion|year=2005|volume=5|issue=1|pages=89–102|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.5.1.89|pmid=15755222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other research both confirms and disconfirms predictions that suggest that individual characteristics such as artistic expertise and training can produce a shift in the inverted U-shape distribution.&lt;ref name=North /&gt;

====Aspects of art====

;Visual art

A general trend shows that the relationship between image complexity and pleasantness ratings form an inverted-U shape graph (see [[#Art and expertise|Expertise]] section for exceptions). This means that people increasingly like art as it goes from very simple to more complex, until a peak, when pleasantness ratings being to fall again.

A recent study had also found that we tend to rate natural environment and landscape images as more complex, hence liking them more than abstract images that we rate as less complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forsythe|first=A|author2=Nadal, M. |author3=Sheehy, C. |author4=Cela-Conde, C. |author5=Sawey, M. |title=Predicting beauty: Fractal dimension and visual complexity in art|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=2011|doi=10.1348/000712610X498958 |pmid=21241285|volume=102 |issue=1|pages=49–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Music
Music shows similar trends in complexity vs. preference ratings as does visual art. When comparing popular music, for the time period, and perceived complexity ratings the known inverted-U shape relationship appears, showing that generally we like moderately complex music the most.&lt;ref name=North&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=A.C.|author2=Hargreaves, D.J. |title=Subjective Complexity, Familiarity, and Liking for Popular Music|journal=Psychomusicology|year=1995|volume=14|pages=77–93|doi=10.1037/h0094090}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the music selection gets more or less complex, our preference for that music dips. People who have more experience and training in popular music, however, prefer slightly more complex music.&lt;ref name=North /&gt; The inverted-U graph shifts to the right for people a stronger musical background. A similar pattern can be seen for [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass music]].&lt;ref name=Orr /&gt; Those with limited musical training in jazz and bluegrass demonstrate the typical inverted-U when looking at complexity and preference, however, experts in those fields do not demonstrate the same pattern. Unlike the popular music experts, jazz and bluegrass experts did not show a distinct relationship between complexity and pleasantness. Experts in those two genres of music seem to just like what they like, without having a formula to describe their behavior. Since different styles of music have different effects on preference for experts, further studies would need to be done to draw conclusions for complexity and preference ratings for other styles.

;Dance

Psychological studies have shown that the hedonic likings of dance performances can be influenced by complexity. One experiment used twelve dance choreographies that consist of three levels of complexity performed at four different tempos. Complexity in the dance sequences were created varying the sequence of six movement patterns (i.e. circle clockwise, circle counterclockwise, and approach stage). Overall, this studied showed that observers prefer choreographies with complex dance sequences and faster tempos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodchilds|first=Jacqueline|author2=Thornton B. Roby |author3=Momoyo Ise |title=Evaluative reactions to the viewing of pseudo-dance sequences: Selected temporal and spatial aspects.|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|year=1969|volume=79|issue=1|pages=121–133|doi=10.1080/00224545.1969.9922395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal differences====

It has been found that personality differences and demographic differences may lead different art preferences as well. One study tested peoples preferences on various art pieces, taking into account their personal preferences as well. The study found that gender diffences exist in art preference. Women generally prefer happy, colorful, and simple paintings whereas men generally prefer geometric, sad, and complex paintings. An age difference in complexity preferences exists as well, where preference for complex paintings increases as age increases.&lt;ref name=Chamorro /&gt;

Certain personality traits can also predict the relationship between art complexity and preference.&lt;ref name=Chamorro /&gt; In one study it was found that people who scored high on conscientiousness liked complex painting less than people who scored low on conscientiousness. This falls in line with the idea that conscientious people dislike uncertainty and enjoy control, thereby disliking artwork that might threaten such feelings. On the other hand, people who scored highly on openness to experience liked complex artworks more than those who didn't score highly on openness to experience. Individual differences are better predictors for preference of complex art than simple art, where no clear personality traits predict preference for simple art. Although educational level did not have a direct relationship with complexity, higher educational levels led to more museum visits, which in turn led to more appreciation of complex art.&lt;ref name=Chamorro /&gt; This shows that more exposure to complex art leads to greater preference, where indeed familiarity causes greater liking.

===Symmetry===
Symmetry and beauty have a strong biological link that influences aesthetic preferences. It has been shown that humans tend to prefer art that contains symmetry, deeming it more beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tinio|first=P. P. L.|author2=Leder, H. |title=Just how stable are stable aesthetic features? Symmetry, complexity, and the jaws of massive familiarisation|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=2009|volume=130|issue=3|pages=241–250|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2009.01.001|pmid=19217589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, symmetry directly correlates to the understanding of a face or artwork as beautiful.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=B.|author2=Lisa, D.M. |author3=Little, A. |title=The role of symmetry in attraction to average faces|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=69|issue=8|pages=1273–1277|doi=10.3758/BF03192944}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater the symmetry within the work or the face, generally the more beautiful it appears to be.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Research on aesthetic preference for geometric forms and the fluent processing of symmetry sheds light on the role that symmetry plays in the overall aesthetic judgment and experience.

Humans innately tend to see and have a visual preference for symmetry, an identified quality yielding a positive aesthetic experience that uses an automatic bottom-up factor.&lt;ref name=Rentschler&gt;{{cite journal|title=Innate and learned components of human visual preference|journal=Current Biology|year=1999|volume=9|issue=13|pages=665–671|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80306-6|pmid=10395537|author1=Rentschler|first1=I|last2=Jüttner|first2=M|last3=Unzicker|first3=A|last4=Landis|first4=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bottom-up factor is speculated to rely on learning experience and visual processing in the brain, suggesting a biological basis.&lt;ref name=Rentschler/&gt; Many studies have ventured to explain this innate preference for symmetry with methods including the [[Implicit Association Test]] (IAT).&lt;ref name=Makin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makin|first=Alexis D. J. |author2=Pecchineda, A. |author3=Bertamini, M.|title=Implicit Affective Evaluation of Visual Symmetry|journal=Emotion|year=2012|doi=10.1037/a0026924|pmid=22251051 |volume=12|issue=5 |pages=1021–1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that we may prefer symmetry because it is easy to process; hence we have a higher perceptual fluency when works are symmetrical.&lt;ref name=Reber&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=Rolf|author2=Schwarz, Norbert |author3=Winkielman, Piotr |title=Processing Fluency and Aesthetic Pleasure: Is Beauty in the Perceiver's Processing Experience?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=1 November 2004|volume=8|issue=4|pages=364–382|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0804_3|pmid=15582859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluency research draws on evidence from humans and animals that point to the importance of symmetry regardless of biological necessity. This research highlights the efficiency with which computers recognize and process symmetrical objects relative to non-symmetrical models.&lt;ref name=Reber/&gt; There have been investigations regarding the objective features that stimuli contain that may affect the fluency and therefore the preferences.&lt;ref name=Reber/&gt; Factors such as amount of information given, the extent of symmetry, and figure-ground contrast are only a few listed in the literature.&lt;ref name=Reber/&gt; This preference for symmetry has led to question on how fluency affects our implicit preferences by using the [[Implicit Association Test]]. Findings suggest that perceptual fluency is a factor that elicits implicit responses, as shown with the [[Implicit Association Test]] results.&lt;ref name=Makin/&gt; Research has branched from studying aesthetic pleasure and symmetry on an explicit but also implicit level. In fact, research tries to integrate [[priming (psychology)]], cultural influences and the different types of stimuli that may elicit an aesthetic preference.

Further research investigating perceptual fluency has found a gender bias towards neutral stimuli.&lt;ref name=Shepherd&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shepherd|first=Kathrine|author2=Bar, Moshe |title=Preference for symmetry: Only on Mars?|journal=Perception|year=2011|volume=40|issue=10|pages=1254–1256|doi=10.1068/p7057|pmid=22308897|pmc=3786096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies pertaining to generalizing symmetry preference to real-world versus abstract objects allow us to further examine the possible influence meaning may have on preference for a given stimuli.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; In order to determine whether meaning mattered for a given stimuli, participants were asked to view pairs of objects and make a forced-choice decision, evaluating their preference.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; The findings suggest that an overall preference for symmetric features of visual objects existed. Furthermore, a main effect for gender preference existed in the males that consistently indicated a preference for symmetry in both abstract and real objects.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; This finding did not transcend in the female participants.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; Further studies need to be conducted to investigate the factors that influence female preferences for visual stimuli as well as for why males showed a preference for symmetry in both abstract and real world objects.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt;

Art containing geometric forms, as seen in much of Islamic art, has an inherent symmetry to the work. This symmetry can be correlated to the attractiveness associated with the art form, since there is a correlation between human preference and symmetry.&lt;ref name=Cardenas&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cárdenas|first=R.A.|author2=Harris, L.J. |title=Symmetrical decorations enhance the attractiveness of faces and abstract designs|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=1–18|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies regarding facial attractiveness, symmetry is found to be a significant factor as well as the shape and coloration in determining attractiveness. The [[sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes hypothesis]] for symmetry preference argues that symmetry is a biological indicator of stable development, mate quality and fitness and therefore explains why we choose symmetrical traits in our mates.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; The [[sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes hypothesis]] does not, however, explain why this phenomenon is observed in our preferences for decoration art.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; Another proposed hypothesis is the [[the extended phenotype|extended phenotype hypothesis]] that argues that decoration art is not mate-irrelevant but rather a reflection of the fitness of the artist, as symmetrical forms are difficult to produce.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; These hypothesis and findings provide evidence for evolutionary biases on preference for symmetry and as reinforcement for cultural biases.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; Research suggests that symmetrical preference due to its evolutionary basis, biological basis and cultural reinforcement, might be replicable cross-culturally.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt;

===Compositional balance===
Compositional balance refers to the placement of various elements in a work of art in relation to each other, through their organization and positioning, and based upon their relative weights.&lt;ref name="Balance definition"&gt;{{cite web|last=Esaak|first=Shelley|title=Balance|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/glossaries/g/b_balance.htm|work=Education: Art History|publisher=About.com|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elements may include the size, shape, color, and arrangement of objects or shapes. When balanced, a composition appears stable and visually right.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt; Just as symmetry relates to aesthetic preference and reflects an intuitive sense for how things ‘should’ appear, the overall balance of a given composition contributes to judgments of the work.

The positioning of even a single object, such as a bowl or a light fixture, in a composition contributes to preferences for that composition. When participants viewed a variety of objects, whose vertical positions on a horizontal plane were manipulated, participants preferred objects that were lower or higher in the plane of vision, corresponding to the normal placement of the image (e.g., a light bulb should be higher and a bowl lower). The center bias manifests can explain the preference for the most important or functional part of an object to occupy the center of the frame, suggesting a bias for a "rightness" of object viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sammartino|first=Jonathan|author2=Palmer, Stephen E. |title=Aesthetic issues in spatial composition: Effects of vertical position and perspective on framing single objects.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1 January 2012|volume=38|issue=4|pages=865–879|doi=10.1037/a0027736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are also sensitive to balance in both abstract and representational works of art. When viewing variations on original artwork, such as the manipulation of the red, blue, and yellow areas of color in several [[Piet Mondrian]] paintings, design-trained and untrained participants successfully identified the balance centers of each variation. Both groups were sensitive to the distribution of color, weight, and area occupied. Expertise (see [[#Art and expertise|Art and Expertise]]) does not seem to have a large effect on perceiving balance, though only the trained participants detected the variation between the original work and manipulated versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Locher|first=Paul|author2=Overbeeke, Kees |author3=Stappers, Pieter Jan |title=Spatial balance of color triads in the abstract art of Piet Mondrian|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2005|volume=34|issue=2|pages=169–189|doi=10.1068/p5033|pmid=15832568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both experts and novices tend to judge original abstract works as more optimally balanced than experimental variations, without necessarily identifying the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Latto|first=Richard|author2=Brain, Douglas |author3=Kelly, Brian |title=An oblique effect in aesthetics: Homage to Mondrian (1872 - 1944)|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2000|volume=29|issue=8|pages=981–987|doi=10.1068/p2352|pmid=11145089}}&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be an intuitive sense for experts and non-experts alike that a given representational painting is the original. Participants tend to deem original artwork as original versus the manipulated works that had been both subtly and obviously altered with respect to the balance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Locher|first=Paul J|title=An empirical investigation of the visual rightness theory of picture perception|journal=Acta Psychologica|date=1 October 2003|volume=114|issue=2|pages=147–164|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2003.07.001|pmid=14529822}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests some innate knowledge, perhaps not influenced by artistic expertise, of the rightness of a painting in its balance. Both masters and novices are equally susceptible to shifts in balance affecting preference for paintings, which may suggest that both artists viewers have an intuitive sense of balance in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vartanian|first=Oshin|author2=Martindale, Colin |author3=Podsiadlo, Jacob |author4=Overbay, Shane |author5= Borkum, Jonathan |title=The link between composition and balance in masterworks vs. paintings of lower artistic quality|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=1 November 2005|volume=96|issue=4|pages=493–503|doi=10.1348/000712605X47927|pmid=16248938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and expertise===
{{primary sources|date=December 2012}}
Psychologists have found that a person's level of expertise in art influences how they perceive, analyze, and interact with art.&lt;ref name=Silvia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=P. J.|title=Knowledge-based assessment of expertise in the arts: exploring aesthetic fluency|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2007|volume=1|issue=4|pages=247–249|doi=10.1037/1931-3896.1.4.247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To test psychologically, scales have been designed to test experience rather than just years of expertise by testing recognition and knowledge of artists in a number of fields, fluid intelligence, and personality with the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] factor inventory.&lt;ref name=Silvia /&gt;  These found that people with high art expertise were not significantly smarter, nor had a college major in the arts.&lt;ref name=Silvia /&gt;   Instead, openness to experience, one of the Big Five factors, predicted someone's expertise in art.&lt;ref name=Silvia /&gt;

====Preferences====

In one study, experienced art majors and naive students were shown pairs of popular art paintings from magazines and high-art paintings, from museums.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winston|first=W. S.|last2=Cupchik|first2= G. C. |title=The evaluation of high art and popular art by naive and experienced viewers|journal=Visual Arts Research|year=1992|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–14|jstor=20715763}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers found a significant interaction between expertise and art preference. Naive participants preferred popular art over high-art, while expert participants preferred high-art over popular art.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt; They also found that naive participants rated popular art as more pleasant and warm and the high-art paintings as more unpleasant and cold, while experts showed the opposite pattern.&lt;ref name="Winston"/&gt;  Experts look to art for a challenging experience, naive participants view art more for pleasure.&lt;ref name="Winston"/&gt; Systematic preferences for viewing portraiture (left or right 3/4 profiles) have been found across media, artists, styles, gender/sex, and historical epoch.&lt;ref name=Conesa&gt;{{cite journal|title=Incidence of the Half-Left Profile Pose in Single-Subject Portraits|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1995|volume=81|issue=3|pages=920–922|pmid=8668453|author1=Conesa|first1=J|last2=Brunold-Conesa|first2=C|last3=Miron|first3=M|doi=10.2466/pms.1995.81.3.920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both experiential tendencies and innate predispositions have been proposed to account for pose preferences.&lt;ref name=2Conesa-Sevilla&gt;{{cite journal|title=Preference for the half-left profile pose: Three inclusive models|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1996|volume=82|issue=3|pages=1070|pmid= 8823872 |author1=Conesa|first1=J|doi=10.2466/pms.1996.82.3c.1070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies controlling variables such as sex and handedness,&lt;ref name="3Conesa-Sevilla, et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conesa-Sevilla-et. al.|first=J.|title=Sex and differential hemispheric activation in directional and orientation preferences|journal=Presented at the 77th meeting of the Western Psychological Association, Tacoma, Washington|year=1997|volume=|issue=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ongoing hemispheric activation, have shown that these preferences can be studied across several construct dimensions.&lt;ref name=4Conesa-Sevilla&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conesa-Sevilla|first=J.|title=Hemispheric activation and preference for the half-left profile|journal=Presented at the Western Psychological Association, Portland, Oregon, April 2000|year=2000|volume=|issue=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eye movements====

To investigate if experts and non-experts experience art differently even in their eye movements, researchers used an eye tracking device to see if there are any differences in the way they look at works of art.&lt;ref name=Pihko&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pihko|first=E.|title=Experiencing art: the influence of expertise and painting abstraction level|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|year=2011|volume=5|pages=1–10|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00094|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After viewing each work, participants rated their liking and emotional reactions to the works.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; Some works were presented with auditory information about that work, half of which were neutral facts and the other half were emotional statements about the work.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; They found that non-experts rated the least abstract works more preferably, while abstraction level did not matter to the experts.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; Across both groups, the eye paths showed more fixations within more abstract work, but each fixation was shorter in time than those within less abstract work .&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; Expertise influences how participants thought about works, but did not influence at all how they physically viewed them.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt;

In another study using eye-movement patterns to investigate how experts view art, participants were shown realistic and abstract works of art under two conditions: one asking them to free scan the works, and the other asking them to memorize them.&lt;ref name=Vogt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vogt|first=S.|author2=S. Magnussen |title=Expertise in pictorial perception: eye-movement pattern and visual memory in artists and laymen|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=91–100|doi=10.1068/p5262|pmid=17357707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants' eye movements were tracked as they either looked at the images or tried to memorize them, and their recall for the memorized images was recorded.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt; The researchers found no differences in the fixation frequency or time between picture types for experts and nonexperts.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt;  However, across sessions, the non-experts had more short fixations while free scanning the works, and fewer long fixations while trying to memorize; experts followed the opposite pattern.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt;  There was no significant difference in the recall of the images across groups, except experts recalled abstract images better that non-experts, and more pictorial details.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt; These results show that people with arts expertise view repeated images less than non-experts, and can recall more details about images they have previously seen.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt;

====Levels of abstraction====

Aesthetic reactions to art can be measured on a number of different criteria, like arousal, liking, emotional content, and understanding. The art can be rated on its levels of abstraction or place in time. An experiment examining how these factors combine to create aesthetic appreciation included experts and nonexperts rating their [[Valence (psychology)|emotional valence]], arousal, liking, and comprehension of abstract, modern, and classical art works.&lt;ref name=Leder&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=H.|author2=G. Gerger |author3=S. G. Dressler |author4=A. Schabmann |title=How art is appreciated|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–10|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts demonstrated a higher degree of appreciation with higher ratings on all scales, except for arousal with classical works.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt; Classical artworks yielded the highest comprehension ratings, with abstract art receiving the lowest values.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt; However, emotional valence was highest for classical and modern art, while arousal was highest for abstract works.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt; Although experts rated the works higher overall, each factor influenced the nonexperts' ratings more, creating greater flexibility in their ratings than those of the experts.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt;

Another experiment examined the effect of color and degree of realism on participants' perception of art with differing levels of expertise. Groups of experts, relative experts, and non-experts viewed stimuli consisting of generated versions of figurative paintings varying in color and abstraction.&lt;ref name=Hekkert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hekkert|first=P.|author2=Van Wieringen, P. C.|title=The impact of level of expertise on the evaluation of original and altered versions of post-impressionistic paintings|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=1996|volume=94|issue=2|pages=117–131|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(95)00055-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants rated the stimuli on their overall preference, abstractness, color properties, balance, and complexity.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt; Figurative pictures were preferred over abstract pictures with decreasing expertise and colored pictures were preferred over black-and-white pictures.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt; However, experts were more likely to prefer black-and-white pictures over colored ones than non-experts and relative experts.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt; This suggests that experts may view art with cognitive models, while non-experts view art looking for familiarity and pleasure.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt;

====Other factors====

An experiment studying the effect of expertise on the perception and interpretation of art had art history majors and psychology students view ten contemporary art paintings of diverse styles. Then, they grouped them into whatever labels they thought to be appropriate.&lt;ref name=Augustin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Augustin|first=M. D.|author2=Leder, H. |title=Art expertise: a study of concepts and conceptual spaces|journal=Psychology Science|year=2006|volume=48|issue=2|pages=135–156|url=http://www.pabst-publishers.de/psychology-science/2-2006/05_Augustin.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1614-9947|publisher= Pabst Science Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data were coded to classify the categorizations and compared between experts and non-experts.&lt;ref name=Augustin /&gt; Experts broke down their classifications into more groups than the non-experts and categorized by style, while the non-experts depended on personal experiences and feelings.&lt;ref name=Augustin /&gt;

This style-related processing, which leads to a mastery of the artwork, is important in viewing modern abstract art and is affected by expertise.&lt;ref name=Belke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belke|first=B.|author2=Leder, H. |author3=Augustin, M.D. |title=Mastering style - effects of explicit style-related information, art knowledge and affective state on appreciation of abstract paintings|journal=Psychology Science|year=2006|volume=48|issue=2|pages=115–134|url=http://cognitivefluency.com/research/mastering.style.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1614-9947|publisher= Pabst Science Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants viewed and rated their liking on three sets of paintings, half of which included information about the style of the painting, such as artistic technique, stylistic features, and the materials used.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; The next day, participants viewed new paintings, saw a blank screen, and estimated how long they had viewed the paintings.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; Participants also completed questionnaires indicating interest in art, a questionnaire indicating expertise in art, and the “Positive and Negative [[Affect (psychology)|Affect]] Schedule” mood questionnaire.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; The effects of style-related information depended on art expertise, where non-experts liked the paintings more after receiving information about the paintings and the experts liked the paintings less after receiving style-related information.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; Explicit style information provoked mood changes in liking, where the high Positive Affect group liked the paintings more with information and the low Positive Affect group liked the paintings less with information.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; Art expertise did not, however, affect the estimations of presentation time.

===Title information===

Titles do not simply function as a means of identification, but also as guides to the pleasurable process of interpreting and understanding works of art.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=Phil A.|title=Effort after meaning and the hedonic value of paintings|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=1 February 2003|volume=94|issue=1|pages=99–110|doi=10.1348/000712603762842138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing title information about a painting does not seem to affect eye movement when looking at it or how subjects interpret its spatial organization. However, titles influence a painting’s perceived meaning.  In one study, participants were instructed to describe paintings while using flashlight pointers to indicate where they were looking. The participants repeated this task for the same set of paintings in two sessions. During the second session, some of the paintings were presented with new titles to evaluate the consistency in their descriptions. As expected, subjects did not change where their eye-gaze focused, but they did change their descriptions by making them more consistent with a given title.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Margery B.|author2=Becklen, Robert C. |author3=Doyle, Charlotte L. |title=The Influence of Titles on How Paintings Are Seen|journal=Leonardo|date=1 January 1993|volume=26|issue=2|pages=103|doi=10.2307/1575894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though descriptions might fluctuate, aesthetically appreciating both abstract and representative art remains stable, regardless of different title information.&lt;ref name=leder&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Carbon, Claus-Christian |author3=Ripsas, Ai-Leen |title=Entitling art: Influence of title information on understanding and appreciation of paintings|journal=Acta Psychologica|date=1 February 2006|volume=121|issue=2|pages=176–198|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2005.08.005|pmid=16289075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that word/image relations can promote different modes of understanding art, but do not account for how much we like a particular piece.&lt;ref name=Franklin /&gt;

A famous example of title confusion that altered a work’s title/image relationship, and thus its ostensive meaning, is a painting titled ''[[La trahison des images]]'' (''The treachery of images''), by [[René Magritte]], that is often referred to as "This is not a pipe". It contains an image of a pipe as well as the legend "This is not a pipe," even though that was not meant to be its title. In this case, two different understandings of the artists’ intentions and the content depend on which title is chosen to go with it.&lt;ref name=Yeazell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeazell|first=Ruth Bernard|authorlink=Ruth Yeazell|title=This Is Not a Title|journal=The Yale Review|date=April 2011|volume=99|issue=2|pages=134–143|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9736.2011.00709.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9736.2011.00709.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, random titles, other than the original, decrease understanding ratings, but do not necessarily alter the significance of aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Millis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: the influence of titles on aesthetic experiences|journal=Emotion|date=1 September 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320–329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborative, as opposed to descriptive, titles are particularly important in helping viewers assign meaning to abstract art. Descriptive titles increase understanding of abstract art only when viewers are presented with an image for a very short period of time (less than 10 seconds). Because art can have a variety of multi-leveled meanings, titles and other additional information can add to its meaningfulness and consequently, its hedonic value.&lt;ref name=Russell /&gt;

==Applications==

Discoveries from the psychology of art can be applied to various other fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfirevic | first1 = Dj | year = 2011 | title = Visual Expression in Architecture | url = http://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/0354-6055/2011/0354-60551131003A.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Arhitektura i urbanizam | volume = 31 | issue = 31| pages = 3–15 | doi=10.5937/arhurb1131003a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markovic | first1 = S. | last2 = Dj | first2 = Alfirevic | year = 2015 | title = Basic dimensions of experience of architectural objects' expressiveness: Effect of expertise | url = https://www.academia.edu/11541805/Basic_dimensions_of_experience_of_architectural_objects_expressiveness_Effect_of_expertise | journal = Psihologija | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 61–78 | doi=10.2298/psi1501061m}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creative process of art yields a great deal of insight about the mind.  One can obtain information about work ethics, motivation, and inspiration from an artist’s work process.  These general aspects can transfer to other areas of one’s life.  Work ethic in art especially, can have a significant impact on one’s overall productivity elsewhere.  There is a potential in any kind of work that encourages the aesthetic frame of mind.  Moreover, art defies any definite boundaries.  The same applies to any such work that is aesthetically experienced.&lt;ref name="B &amp; S"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
The psychology of art can be a criticized field for numerous reasons.  Art is not considered a science, so research can be scrutinized for its accuracy and relativity.  There is also a great deal of criticism about art research as psychology because it can be considered subjective rather than objective.  It embodies the artist’s emotions in an observable manner, and the audience interprets the artwork in multiple ways.  The aims of an artist differ dramatically from the aims of a scientist.  The scientist means to propose one outcome to a problem, whereas an artist means to give multiple interpretations of an object.  The inspirations of an artist are fueled through his/her experiences, perceptions, and perspectives of the world art movements such as Expressionism are known for the artist’s release of emotions, tension, pressure, and inner spiritual forces that are transcribed to external conditions.  Art comes from within oneself, and it is expressed in the external world for the entertainment of others.  Everyone can appreciate a piece of artwork because it speaks to each individual in unique ways—therein lies the criticism of subjectivity.&lt;ref name="R &amp; T"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Saeid|last1=Rahmatabadi|first2=Reza|last2=Toushmalani|title=Physical Order and Disorder in Expressionist Architecture Style|url=http://ajbasweb.com/old/ajbas/2011/September-2011/406-409.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences|volume=5|issue=9|pp=406–409|year=2011|issn=1991-8178|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234028/http://ajbasweb.com/old/ajbas/2011/September-2011/406-409.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the aesthetic experience of art is heavily criticized because it cannot be scientifically determined.  It is completely subjective, and it relies on an individual’s bias.  It cannot be fundamentally measured in tangible forms.  In contrast, aesthetic experiences can be deemed "self-motivating" and "self-closing".&lt;ref name="B &amp; S"/&gt;

'''Quillwork''' is a form of [[textile]] embellishment traditionally practiced by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] that employs the [[quill]]s of [[porcupine]]s as an aesthetic element. Quills from bird feathers were also occasionally used in quillwork.

==History==
[[File:Upper MO quillwork pre1804 UPenn.jpg|thumb|Backside of loomed quillwork collected from an [[Plains Indians|Upper Missouri tribe]] by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], pre-1804. All [[natural dyes]]. Collection of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]]]]
Porcupine quillwork is an art form completely unique to North America. Before the introduction of glass beads, quillwork was a major decorative element used by the peoples who resided in the porcupine's natural habitat,&lt;ref name="worldtex"&gt;Gillow and Sentance 223&lt;/ref&gt; which included [[indigenous peoples of the Subarctic]], [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]], and [[Northern Plains]]. The use of quills in designs spans from [[Maine]] to [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="Orchard"&gt;Orchard&lt;/ref&gt; Quillworking tools were discovered in [[Alberta, Canada]] and date back to the 6th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin 265&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheyenne]] [[oral history]], as told by Picking Bones Woman to George Bird Grinnell, says quilling came to their tribe from a man who married a woman, who hid her true identity as a buffalo. His son was also a buffalo. The man visited his wife and son in their buffalo home, and, while among the buffalo, the man learned the art of quilling, which he shared with the women of his tribe.&lt;ref name="Penney and Horse Capture, 119"&gt;Penney and Horse Capture 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining the Cheyenne Quilling Society was a prestigious honor for Cheyenne women. Upon entering the Society, women would work first on quilling [[Moccasin (footwear)|moccasins]], then [[cradle board|cradleboards]], rosettes for men's shirts and [[tipi]]s, and ultimately, hide robes and backrests.&lt;ref name="Penney and Horse Capture, 119"/&gt;

Porcupine quills often adorned [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]] and tanned hides, but during the 19th century, [[Wiigwaasi-makak|quilled birch bark boxes]] were a popular trade item to sell to European-Americans among Eastern and Great Lakes tribes. Quillwork was used to create and decorate a variety of Native American items, including those of daily usage to Native American men and women. These include clothing such as coats and moccasins, accessories such as bags and belts, and furniture attachments such as a cradle cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Christina|last2=Herald|first2=Susan|year=2010|title=The History and Analysis of Pre-Aniline Native American Quillwork Dyes|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=tsaconf|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings|volume=|pages=|via=Digital Commons@University of Nebraska-Lincoln}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[Image:Quill knife sheath.png|thumb|left|140px|A quillwork knife sheath.]]
Quills suitable for embellishment are two to three inches long and may be dyed before use.&lt;ref name="worldtex" /&gt; In their natural state, the quills are pale yellow to white with black tips. The tips are usually snipped off before use. Quills readily take dye, which originally was derived from local plants and included a wide spectrum of colors, with black, yellow, and red being the most common. By the 19th century, aniline dyes were available through trade and made dying easier.&lt;ref&gt;Feest 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The quills can be flattened with specific bone tools or by being run through one's teeth. Awls were used to punch holes in hides, and [[sinew]], later replaced by European thread, was used to bind the quills to the hides.

The four most common techniques for quillwork are [[Applique|appliqué]], [[embroidery]], wrapping, and [[loom]] weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Feest 215&lt;/ref&gt; Appliquéd quills are stitched into hide in a manner that covers the stitches.&lt;ref name="worldtex" /&gt;  In wrapping, a single quill may be wrapped upon itself or two quills may be intertwined.&lt;ref name="worldtex" /&gt;

Quills can be appliquéd singly to form curvilinear patterns, as found on [[Odawa people|Odawa]] pouches from the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent 15&lt;/ref&gt; This technique lends itself to floral designs popularized among [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|northeastern tribes]] by [[Ursulines|Ursuline nuns.]] [[Wyandot people|Huron]] women excelled at floral quillwork during the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent 24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plains Indians|Plains]] quillwork is characterized by bands of rectangles creating geometrical patterns found also in Plains painting.&lt;ref&gt;Feest 140&lt;/ref&gt; Rosettes of concentric circles of quillwork commonly adorned historical Plains men's shirts, as did parallel panels of quillwork on the sleeves. These highly abstracted designs had layers of symbolic meaning.

The [[Pembina Band of Chippewa Indians|Red River Ojibwe]] of [[Manitoba]] created crisp, geometric patterns by weaving quills on a loom in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent 28 and 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Ferdy's dragonfly.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary quillwork design on [[birch bark]], by Ferdy Goode]]

Quillwork never died out as a living art form in the Northern Plains. Some communities that had lost their quillwork tradition have been able to revive the art form. For instance, no women quilled in the [[Dene]] community of [[Wha Ti, Northwest Territories]] by the late 1990s. The Dene Cultural Institute held two workshops there in 1999 and 2000, effectively reviving quillwork in Wha Ti.&lt;ref&gt;Marie and Thompson, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The art form is very much alive today. Examples of contemporary, award-winning quillworkers include [[Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty]], ([[Sioux]]-[[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]]) artist;&lt;ref&gt;Durbin 279 and 304&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Brave Eagle ([[Oglala Lakota]]) of [[Denver, Colorado]];&lt;ref&gt;Melmer, David.

'''Rafael Monleón y Torres''' (1843 &amp;ndash; 24 November 1900) was a Spanish artist (painting, engraving, ceramics), archaeologist, historian and [[Maritime pilot|naval pilot]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Valencia]]. His father was the architect, {{ill|Sebastián Monleón Estellés|es}}, a professor at the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos]].&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/monleon-y-torres-rafael/ Brief biography] @ the [[Museo del Prado]].&lt;/ref&gt; After studying there from 1855 to 1866, he joined the [[merchant marine]] and became a pilot; sailing around Europe.  Later, he was a student of the marine artist [[Paul Jean Clays]] in [[Bruges]], where he also studied engraving. Upon his return to Spain, he completed his studies with [[Carlos de Haes]].&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;
[[File:British ships in the Seven Years War before Havana.jpg|thumb|left|275px|British Ships at the [[Battle of Havana (1762)|Battle of Havana]]]]
At first, he was primarily a painter of [[azulejo]]s, and his experience as a sailor gave him a particular talent for [[marine art]]. He focused on shipwrecks and other dramatic scenes, but he was also knowledgeable in regards to naval archaeology and history; which he was able to take advantage of when he was named the conservator/restorer for the [[Museo Naval de Madrid]] in 1870.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

His most ambitious work was never published during his lifetime: the treatise on the ''Historia gráfica de la navegación y de las construcciones navales en todos los tiempos y en todos los países'' (Graphic History of Navigation and Naval Construction...). It was illustrated with over a thousand drawings, blue prints and watercolors; completed while he was at the museum, together with hundreds of texts and vignettes on every known type of ship, European and Oriental. A small excerpt was later published as ''La Construcción Naval española en la obra de Rafael Monleón Torres''.
[[File:ElCadáverDeHernandoDeSotoEsArrojadoAlRíoMisisipíRafaelJulioDe1542MonleónYTorres1887.jpg|thumb|300px|The Body of [[Hernando de Soto]] being thrown into the Mississippi River.]]
He participated in every [[National Exhibition of Fine Arts (Spain)|National Exhibition of Fine Arts]] after 1864, except for 1892, owing to his involvement in the celebrations for the four-hundredth anniversary of the "Discovery of America", which included an elaborate scale model of the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' being made as a gift to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcnbiografias.com/app-bio/do/show?key=monleon-rafael Brief biography] @ MCN Biografías.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was awarded a second-class [[Crosses of Naval Merit|Cross of Naval Merit]] and the title of Commander in the [[Order of Charles III]].

As an engraver, he provided illustrations on marine topics for ''[[La Ilustración Española y Americana]]'', ''{{ill|Nuevo Mundo (New World)|es|Nuevo Mundo (revista)}}'' and other periodicals. He also created ceramics, some of which have been preserved at the [[González Martí National Museum of Ceramics and Decorative Arts]]. As a designer, he created his own office furniture. He died in [[Madrid]], aged 57.

'''Rag-i-Bibi''' (''Veins of the Lady'') refers to a [[Sassanian]] [[rock relief]] on a cliff in modern [[Afghanistan]]. It first became known to western scholarship in 2002. It is located about a kilometre south of [[Shamarq]] and 10 km south of [[Puli Khumri]]. Rag-i-Bibi is the local name of the relief, which refers to [[Fatimah]] the daughter of [[Muhammad]], who is venerated by the [[Shiites]].

The relief is 4.9 m high and 6.5 m wide. It has been largely destroyed, partially by weathering and partially by [[Taliban]] iconoclasm. At the end of Taliban rule, local villagers reported the relief to local authorities, since they feared it would be damaged. Thus, individual Taliban were conscious of the relief and damaged it on the grounds that local residents "worshipped" it.

The relief shows a Sassanian king hunting an [[Indian rhinoceros]]. The king reins in a galloping horse. His figure would be about 2.4 m high if it were standing upright. Three figures stand around the king. Behind the ruler's horse, another two can be made out, which are poorly preserved. The upper portion of the relief shows a band of poorly preserved architectural features.

The king's head is particularly severely damaged. The crown might enable an identification with a historical king; some stylistic details suggest that [[Shapur I]] is depicted. Stylistically, the relief contains Sassanian features, but also local [[Gandhara art|Gandhara]] ones.

'''Rider Spoke''' developed by [[Blast Theory]] in collaboration with the Mixed Reality Lab was first staged at the [[Barbican]], [[London]] in October 2007. Created for cyclists, it combines elements of [[theatre]], [[performance]], [[game play]] and state of the art technology. Rider Spoke was built in the IPerG project on the [http://equip.sourceforge.net/ EQUIP] [[Software architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh2013-Homepage"/&gt;

Rider Spoke has since been presented in [[Athens]] (2008), [[Brighton]] (2008), [[Budapest]] (2008), [[Sydney]] (2009, [[Adelaide]] (2009) and [[Liverpool]] (2010).

'''Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe''' is a firm of [[bookbinding|bookbinders]] established in [[London]] in 1901.   It is considered to be one of the most important bookbinding companies of the 20th century, famous for its luxurious [[jewelled bookbinding|jeweled bindings]] that used real gold and precious stones in their book covers.

Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe was established by Francis Sangorski (1875-1912) and George Sutcliffe (1878-1943).  They had met in 1896 at a bookbinding [[evening class]]es taught by [[Douglas Bennett Cockerell|Douglas Cockerell]] at the [[London County Council]]'s [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]].  In 1898, Sangorski and Sutcliffe each won one of the ten annual craft scholarship awards, giving them £20 a year for three years to continue their training as [[apprentice]] bookbinders. They were employed at Cockerell's own bindery, and began to teach bookbinding at [[Camberwell College of Art]].  They were laid off in 1901 after a [[coal strike]] caused an economic slump, and they decided to set up on their own in a rented attic in [[Bloomsbury]], starting on 1 October 1901.  They soon moved to [[Vernon Place]], and then, in 1905, to [[Southampton Row]].

Sangorski's elder brother, [[Alberto Sangorski]], worked for the firm.  He became an accomplished [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminator]], working for [[Robert Riviere|Rivière]] from 1910.

They quickly revived the art of [[jewelled bookbinding]]s, decorating their sumptuous multi-colour leather book bindings with gold inlay and precious and semi-precious jewels.  They were commissioned to create a most luxurious binding of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', the front cover of which was adorned with three golden peacocks with jewelled tails and surrounded by heavily tooled and gilded vines, that was sent on the ill-fated [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912.  The book, known as the [[Great Omar]], sank with the ship and has not been recovered.  Shortly afterwards, Sangorski drowned.

Sutcliffe continued the firm, which became recognised as one of the leading bookbinders in London.  The bindery moved to [[Poland Street]], and managed to survive through the [[First World War]], the [[Great Depression]], the [[Second World War]], and post-war austerity.  In this period, it undertook work for the [[Ashendene Press]], [[Golden Cockerel Press]] and the [[J. &amp; E. Bumpus]] bookshop. It also created miniature books for [[Queen Mary's Dolls' House]].

After Sutcliffe suffered a [[stroke]] in 1936, he entrusted the business to his nephew, [[Stanley Bray]] (1907-1995), who had worked for his uncle since 1926.  The company merged with [[HT Woods]] in 1939, bringing Kenneth Hobson to the firm.  He introduced a more modern style of binding.  Bray inherited the company on Sutcliffe's death.  The firm merged again in 1988, joining with [[Zaehnsdorf]]'s bindery in [[Bermondsey]] (established by [[Joseph Zaehnsdorf]] in 1842).  The combined business was bought by [[Asprey]] in 1985 and renamed SSZ Limited.  Shepherds, a bookbinding company, bought the company from Asprey in 1998, and revived the Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe name.  The bindery recently moved from its premises in Bermondsey to [[Rochester Row]].

A second copy of the Omar Khayyam was bound as World War II broke out and this was placed in a bank safe vault for safe keeping, but enemy bombing destroyed the vault and the second copy. Stanley Bray after his retirement made a Third version of the binding using the original design, this is now in the British Library.

[[File:Contantinople Christian sarcophagus circa 400.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Constantinople]] Christian sarcophagus with [[XI monogram]], c. 400]]

A '''sarcophagus''' (plural '''sarcophagi''') is a box-like funeral receptacle for a [[cadaver|corpse]], most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word "sarcophagus" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Wiktionary:σάρξ|σάρξ]] ''sarx'' meaning "flesh", and [[Wiktionary:φαγεῖν|φαγεῖν]] ''phagein'' meaning "to eat", hence ''sarcophagus'' means "flesh-eating"; from the phrase ''lithos sarkophagos'' ([[Wiktionary:λίθος|λίθος]] [[Wiktionary:σαρκοφάγος|σαρκοφάγος]]). Since ''lithos'' is Greek for "stone", ''lithos sarcophagos'' means "flesh-eating stone". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of [[limestone]] that was thought to rapidly facilitate the decomposition of the flesh of corpses contained within it due to the chemical properties of the limestone itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/520/?letter=C&amp;spage=19 WordInfo etymology.] As a noun the Greek term was further adopted to mean "[[coffin]]" and was carried over into [[LATIN]], where it was used in the phrase ''lapis sarcophagus'', "flesh-eating stone", referring to those same properties of limestone.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;[http://www.mcah.columbia.edu/medmil/pages/non-mma-pages/text_links/burialpractices.html Columbia University Department of Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Worms sarcophagi.jpg|right|thumb|Roman-era sarcophagi at [[Worms, Germany]]]]

Sarcophagi were most often designed to remain above ground. In Ancient Egypt, a sarcophagus acted like an outer shell.

The [[Hagia Triada sarcophagus]] is a stone sarcophagus elaborately painted in [[fresco]]; one style of later Ancient Greek sarcophagus in painted pottery is seen in [[Klazomenian sarcophagi]], produced around the Ionian Greek city of [[Klazomenai]], where most examples were found, between 550 BC (Late Archaic) and 470 BC. They are made of coarse clay in shades of brown to pink. Added to the basin-like main sarcophagus is a broad, rectangular frame, often covered with a white slip and then painted. The huge [[Lycia]]n [[Tomb of Payava]], now in the [[British Museum]], is a royal tomb monument of about 360 BC designed for an open-air placing, a grand example of a common Lycian style.

[[Ancient Roman sarcophagi]]—sometimes metal or plaster as well as [[limestone]]—were popular from about the reign of [[Trajan]],&lt;ref&gt;Presbrey - Leland, ‘’Commemoration: The Book of Presbrey - Leland Memorials’’, Presbrey-Leland Incorporated, 1952 p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and often elaborately carved, until the early [[Christian burial]] preference for interment underground, often in a limestone [[sepulchre]], led to their falling out of favor.&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt; However, there are many important [[Early Christian sarcophagi]] from the 3rd to 4th centuries.
[[File:Roman - Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus - Walters 2331.jpg|left|thumb|The limestone relief on this [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sarcophagus, c.&amp;nbsp;AD 190, depicts the ''Triumph of [[Dionysus]]''. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]], Maryland.]]
Most Roman examples were designed to be placed against a wall and are decorated on three of the sides only. Sarcophagi continued to be used in Christian Europe for important figures, especially rulers and leading church figures, and by the [[High Middle Ages]] often had a recumbent [[tomb effigy]] lying on the lid. More plain sarcophagi were placed in crypts, of which the most famous examples include the [[Habsburg]] [[Imperial Crypt]] in [[Vienna]], Austria. The term tends to be less often used to describe Medieval, Renaissance, and later examples.

In the [[early modern period]], lack of space tended to make sarcophagi impractical in churches, but chest tombs or false sarcophagi, empty and usually bottomless cases placed over an underground burial, became popular in outside locations such as cemeteries and churchyards, especially in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, where memorials were mostly not highly decorated and the extra cost of a false sarcophagus over a headstone acted as an indication of social status.

==United States==

Sarcophagi, usually "false", made a return to the cemeteries of America during the last quarter of the 19th century, at which time, according to a New York company which built sarcophagi, "it was decidedly the most prevalent of all memorials in our cemeteries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Veit|first=Richard Francis|title=New Jersey Cemeteries and Tombstones: History in the Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Rutgers University Press/Rivergate Books|isbn=978-0813542362|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to be popular into the 1950s, at which time the popularity of flat memorials (making for easier grounds maintenance) made them obsolete. Nonetheless, a 1952 catalog from the memorial industry still included 8 pages of them, broken down into [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Classical architecture|Classical]] detail, a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] adaptation, and a [[Modern architecture|Modern]] variant.&lt;ref&gt;Presbrey - Leland, ‘’Commemoration: The Book of Presbrey - Leland Memorials’’, Presbrey-Leland Incorporated, 1952 pp. 79–85&lt;/ref&gt; Shown on the right are sarcophagi from the late 19th century located in [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The one in the back, the Warner Monument created by [[Alexander Milne Calder]] (1879), features the spirit or soul of the deceased being released.

==Asia==
In the [[Mekong Delta]] in southwestern [[Vietnam]], it is common for families to inter their members in sarcophagi near their homes, thus allowing ready access for visits as a part of the indigenous tradition of [[Veneration of the dead#Vietnam|ancestor worship]].

In [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]], [[waruga]] are a traditional form of sarcophagus.

'''Sheffield Archives''' (located in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]]) collects, preserves and lists records (or [[archives]]) relating to Sheffield and South Yorkshire and makes them available for reference and research.

Sheffield Archives is a joint service with [[Sheffield Local Studies Library]]. They are part of the Sheffield Libraries Archives and Information Service delivered by [[Sheffield City Council]]

== History of archive collecting in Sheffield ==

===Up to 1939===

[[Sheffield Central Library|Sheffield’s Central Library]] was officially opened in 1934. In planning it Mr J. P. Lamb, who was then City Librarian, gave considerable thought to the accommodation and expansion of the local history and 'special' collections (as they were then called). A large reading room was provided to accommodate readers and house the local collection of printed material; there were storage facilities for maps and special collections in an adjoining room and two small strongrooms in the basement, providing about 700 feet of shelving for manuscripts.

During the previous twenty-five years the beginnings of a local collection of archives had been brought together, particularly through the assistance of a Sheffield solicitor, T. Walter Hall, himself a competent antiquary and from 1910 to 1926 a co-opted member of the Libraries Committee. Through his good offices the Library in 1912 acquired the Jackson collection, consisting of many original documents and a large amount of genealogical material. This was followed by two fine solicitors' accumulations (Wheat and Tibbitts), subsequently added to, and a number of smaller groups. Finally in 1933, in anticipation of the opening of the new building, the Fairbank collection of several thousand draft maps and plans, accumulated by a local family of surveyors between c. 1740 and 1840, was given to the Library. About the same time the executors of Edward Carpenter, the socialist writer who had lived at Holmesfield near Sheffield, presented the Carpenter collection comprising Carpenter's library, editions of his works, and manuscript material. In 1926 the Library had been recognized by the Master of the Rolls as a repository for manorial records.

The nearest institutions collecting documents and archives at this time were at Leeds (the Yorkshire Archaeological Society and Leeds Public Libraries), Manchester (John Rylands Library) and Derby (Derby Public Library). Though the Yorkshire Archaeological Society aimed at covering the whole of Yorkshire, it was not very active in the southern part of the West Riding and the other three scarcely impinged on the Sheffield region. From the first Sheffield therefore aimed to cover an area roughly within thirty miles radius of the Town Hall, including North Derbyshire and South Yorkshire.

===1939 - 1945===
The outbreak of hostilities in 1939 and the heavy air-raids on Sheffield in December 1940 affected the development of the archive collections in several unfortunate ways. Staff shortages soon meant that only routine attention could be given them, and in December 1941 they were removed for safety to a comparatively rural branch library where premises had been specially strengthened to protect them. More disastrous, the Sheffield Union offices in West Bar, where the Guardians' records still remained, together with the surviving records of the old overseers of the poor, were completely destroyed by enemy action. At the same time business firms were turning out their old records for salvage; the Library does not appear to have taken any steps to save such records from destruction and much was undoubtedly lost at this period.

The war years were not, however, entirely devoid of interest, for 1942 saw the purchase of part of the antiquarian collection of Bacon-Frank of Campsall (Talbot correspondence), the gift of family records from Beauchief Hall and silver-plating records and catalogues of the firm of Thomas Bradbury &amp; Sons.

===1945 - 1960===
After the war the collections were brought back to the Central Library and the reading room, which had been closed for the duration, was re-opened in November 1947. A turning point came about a year later on 31 October 1948 when, with the City Librarian's active support, a meeting of the National Register of Archives was held at the Central Library with the late Lord Scarbrough in the chair; at the meeting it was decided to set up a South Yorkshire committee of the National Register.

Colonel G. E. G. Malet, the Registrar of the National Register, was faced with a particular South Yorkshire problem at this time. The great Fitzwilliam mansion of Wentworth Woodhouse was about to be let to the West Riding as a college. There was an immediate need to find a repository willing to receive the whole of the family archives (except the muniments of title) many of which lay stacked in the corridors there. The City Librarian and the Libraries committee agreed to accept them into custody on loan deposit and on 26 and 27 January 1949 three large furniture vans transported the archives to Sheffield. It is difficult to remember how they were housed until two new strong rooms with 1800 feet of shelving were made ready for use early the following year. During the summer of 1949 a document repairer was appointed and given a period of training at the Public Record Office.

Following the announcement in the press of the deposit of the Fitzwilliam archives, scholars from both sides of the Atlantic began to make their way to the Library, initially to study the Rockingham and Burke papers. Professor T. W. Copeland arrived in May 1949 and five Americans were working on the papers that summer. Two years later Chicago University Press undertook to sponsor a new and full edition of Edmund Burke's correspondence, with Professor Copeland as general editor. For the next 18 years the 'Burke factory' was working in part of the Sheffield Local History and Archives Department on this project.

The ten years following 1949 saw the deposit of several large family and estate archives, including the Duke of Norfolk's Sheffield and Worksop estate records, as well as other types of records. The full-time appointment of an archivist as the National Register of Archives, South Yorkshire committee's representative (working from the Central Library) for about eighteen months during 1953-4 was a great asset at this time. Early in 1956, as part of the City Libraries' centenary celebrations, a Guide to the Manuscript Collections was published.

===1960 - 1974===
By 1960 most large family collections were already in custody and in the following years a wider range of records was received from varied sources. Several smaller family collections came from London solicitors (through the British Records Association or privately). In 1962 came the first official deposit of parish records of the diocese of Sheffield and the same year the first deposit of Methodist chapel and circuit records. In 1964 the Library was recognized by the Bishop as the diocesan repository for parish records.

Documents from Sheffield solicitors' offices have been prominent from the start; in the 1960s several similar accumulations were received from solicitors over a wider field — Barnsley, Wath, Snaith and Sherburn-in-Elmet. Archives deposited by industrial firms increased during this period. In 1960 the Library was recognized as the official local repository for certain categories of public local records and a large deposit of colliery records was handed over by the National Coal Board as a result, making a very substantial modern addition (up to 1948) to older colliery records from private sources.

Further strong room accommodation became essential and a small room, 15 feet x 16 feet, was added in the Central Library in 1963 and a larger manuscript store, built onto one of the branch libraries was ready for use in 1969.

By the 1960s most counties had established record offices, the West Riding being one of the few exceptions. Working through the local committees of the National Register of Archives, the two city libraries of Leeds and Sheffield aimed at making some provision for records other than official county records in the north and south of the Riding, respectively.

===1974 - 1986===
In 1974, with the creation of a new (county) tier of local government for South Yorkshire, the South Yorkshire County Council established a county record office service.  For 12 years, until the abolition of the metropolitan county councils in 1986, the South Yorkshire County Record Office (SYCRO) based at Ellin Street in Sheffield, acquired material relating to the county.  This was in addition to the existing archive services at Sheffield and Doncaster.

===1986 - date===
In 1986, following abolition, the SYCRO collections were transferred to the custody of Sheffield City Council. The ‘county’ service was funded and managed under a joint arrangement between all four local authorities – Barnsley, Doncaster, Sheffield and Rotherham.  Sheffield Archives continued to acquire county archives from 1986. In 1989 the archives moved into a former car showroom premises on [[Shoreham Street]]. The building was converted to house all the documents from the Central Library.

== The collections ==

The records preserved by Sheffield Archives date from the 12th century to the present day and relate to Sheffield and the rest of South Yorkshire and parts of North [[Derbyshire]].

===Local Government records===
Local government records derive mainly from Sheffield City Council and its departments, including Council and Committee minutes, building plans and school records, and from superseded authorities such as Urban and Rural District Councils, Poor Law Unions, civil townships and the former South Yorkshire County Council. Sheffield was created a corporate borough in 1842 and a city in 1897. The old parish, which was coterminous with the new borough until boundary extensions took place in the 20th century, consisted of six townships.

There is a good series of rate books comprising continuous runs of collectors' books from 1755 for Sheffield township and from the 1780s for four of the other townships. From 1891 borough rate-books for the census years only have been retained. Valuations date from the 1820s and 1830s. These records were kept in the vestry halls of the several wards of the city and thus escaped the destruction by enemy action which befell the records stored in the Union offices in West Bar.

Vestry minutes for several townships from the early nineteenth century have also survived, together with some highway surveyors' records. All the records of the old poor law together with the Guardians' records for both the Sheffield and Ecclesall Unions were destroyed in the West Bar offices. Most of the old workhouse records have likewise disappeared. Apart from runs of Guardians' printed minutes, this important side of local life is very sparsely represented among the official records. A good deal of information about the old poor law can however be gleaned from private collections, especially solicitors' collections.

Practically all of the current council departments and directorates are represented in the Archives collections. Worthy of note are council and committee minutes from 1843 onwards; registers of children's homes from 1894; school records from many hundreds of schools, a full series of claims for damage and loss on account of the Sheffield flood of 1864 caused by the bursting of the Damflask reservoir, though to modern papers on the World Student games of 1991 and the recent urban renaissance project - Heart of the City.

Other public bodies whose records may be mentioned are the Doncaster and Mexborough Joint Hospital Board from 1900 - 1948, the Sheffield Gas Company from 1818, and the Coal Board's pre-vesting date records for this area.

===Public Records===
Local public records include Sheffield Quarter Sessions, Magistrate Courts and H.M. Coroners, health authorities and hospitals and records of once nationalised industries such as the National Coal Board for South Yorkshire and the Yorkshire Water Authority.

===Ecclesiastical records===
As the Diocesan Record Office for the Archdeaconry of Sheffield, Sheffield Archives holds records for most of the Anglican parishes within the area, including registers, and records of the Diocese itself. Also held are records of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hallam and its parishes, and numerous records of other denominations such as Methodists and Quakers etc.

Sheffield also holds a cartulary of Beauchief Abbey, a Premonstratensian house formerly in Derbyshire, the site of which is now within the city of Sheffield. The cartulary was used extensively by Samuel Pegge (Historical account of Beauchief Abbey, 1801) but has never been published. Also emanating from the monastery is a small notebook or miscellany containing biblical texts and a note of an ordination in 1500. Both volumes are in the original bindings.

===Family and estate records===

====The Wentworth Woodhouse Collection====
The Wentworth Woodhouse Collection (Wentworth-Fitzwilliam family) include personal papers of statesmen such as the Earl of Strafford, 2nd Marquis of Rockingham and Edmund Burke.  The Wentworths had been at Woodhouse since the thirteenth century. Little however survives from any period prior to the early seventeenth century, except ancient deeds and some Gascoigne pedigrees which remain at Wentworth Woodhouse. The muniments may be said to begin properly with the period of Thomas Wentworth the great Earl of Strafford whose correspondence was preserved with care by the family. The archives of his son William, the 2nd earl, have not survived. Since his death in 1695 the estates have twice passed in the female line, first to Thomas Watson-Wentworth whose son, another Thomas, was created Marquis of Rockingham in 1746, and secondly in 1782 to the 4th Earl Fitzwilliam. Members of each of these families were deeply involved in the politics of the time. Much of their correspondence has survived, and forms, together with the correspondence of Edmund Burke, a prime source for the political history of the eighteenth century.

The Strafford correspondence comprises eleven letter books into which Wentworth's official correspondence was copied by his secretaries, and about 2,800 original letters, including a considerable number of his own letters to his family, servants and friends. Though by far the largest part of the correspondence dates from the last ten years of Wentworth's life (1631 - 1641), after his appointment as Lord Deputy of Ireland, there is a considerable amount of material even for the years up to 1628, before he held high office. There is naturally much correspondence with the king's ministers, Laud, Cottington, Portland and Secretary Coke, and, at the other end of the scale, many letters full of detail relating to the management of his estates and local affairs. Well-selected letters on national affairs were edited and published in 1739 by William Knowler; more recently Mr J. P. Cooper has published a volume in the Camden series (1973) of Wentworth papers 1597-1628. A vast amount of local interest and many letters from Wentworth's contemporaries remain virtually unknown.

The first Marquis of Rockingham copied selected correspondence into two vast letter books. It relates mainly to the York county elections of 1733 and 1741, the Stuart Rebellion of '45 and letters between him and his son while the latter was in Italy. The son succeeded his father as second Marquis in 1750 and a large amount of his correspondence survives for his two short periods as Prime Minister in 1765 - 1766 and January to July 1782, and for the intermediate period when he held the Whigs together in opposition. Some of these letters were published in 1852 by the Earl of Albemarle, strung together as Memoirs of the Marquis of Rockingham and his contemporaries. Two shortish but valuable studies have appeared since the muniments were deposited here, viz: The early career of Lord Rockingham 1730-1765 by the late Professor G. H. Guttridge, (1952), and Mr P. Langford's The first Rockingham Administration 1765-66, (1973). Rockingham is perhaps regarded as too colourless a figure to merit either a full-scale biography or an edition of his correspondence, though this view scarcely does his personality justice. For American history of the period and for Whig politics this section of the muniments remains of first class importance.

The labours of the Burke editors have now produced nine volumes of Edmund Burke's letters, about half of them from the Sheffield archives. These are virtually all letters from Burke. The bulk of the correspondence here, however, consists of letters addressed to him by a vast number of his contemporaries and relating to topics from America to India; of these the writers' names only are indexed.

The 4th Earl Fitzwilliam's correspondence covering the period 1782-1832, containing over 7,000 letters, has material relating to Ireland, to elections and to many local topics. Of particular interest are the papers concerning working class agitation from 1794 to 1819, ending with the Earl's dismissal from the Lord Lieutenancy of the West Riding at the time of Peterloo. His son, Lord Milton, also played a part in politics until he virtually retired on succeeding to the peerage in 1833. The Yorkshire election archives are extensive.

There is also a vast range of estate material relating to the Irish estates from 1707 and to the West Riding and Malton estates from the 1720s. The stewards' correspondence includes letters from John Carr the architect and there are a number of his original plans for many features in Wentworth House and Park. As with virtually all the great South Yorkshire families, collieries played an important part and are well represented in the Fitzwilliam muniments, up to and including the extensive opencast working on the estate during the last thirty years.

====Duke of Norfolk's Arundel Castle Manuscripts====
Archives of more exclusively estate interest are the Duke of Norfolk's Sheffield, Worksop, and Derbyshire estate archives ([[Arundel Castle]] manuscripts). The [[Duke of Norfolk|Dukes of Norfolk]] and their predecessors the Earls of Shrewsbury were lords of the manor of Sheffield (as the present Duke still is), of Worksop, and of [[Glossop]] and Glossopdale in Derbyshire. The manuscripts include detailed accounts and rentals (including the Shropshire estates) for the late Elizabethan period. The Sheffield archives are extensive, their main interest lying in the urban development of Sheffield in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including collieries and markets. There is a series of the Sheffield agents' letters and diaries in the nineteenth century. The Worksop records cover in particular the eighteenth century when Worksop was a residence of the dukes. The Glossop records also refer mainly to the nineteenth century when the town became a prosperous manufacturing district and there are records of several turnpike trusts of the Glossop area.

====Wharncliffe Papers====
The [[Earls of Wharncliffe]], [[the Vernon-Wentworths]] and [[the Spencer Stanhopes]] have also deposited their records. Besides estate matters in Scotland, Yorkshire and (a few) Cornwall, they include much correspondence. The small number of letters from Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (about 40 in all) have been published by Professor R. Halsband, in the Complete Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. A much more extensive group of letters forms basically the correspondence of the first Baroness Wharncliffe and her family, including her mother Lady Erne and her grandfather the 4th Earl of Bristol and spanning the years 1773 to 1845. Much is merely personal but much also concerns the political affairs in which Lord Wharncliffe was involved in the period c. 1820 - 1845, as a Tory. This correspondence remains as it was arranged by Lord Stuart of Wortley when he was preparing, with Caroline Grosvenor, the biography of The First Lady Wharndiffe, which was published in 1927. This work makes limited use of the letters. There is also a run of typed transcripts, made for Lord Stuart of Wortley, which includes originals no longer available.

Secondly, there is a long series of letters, 1856 - 1891, to the 1st Earl (3rd Baron) of Wharncliffe. He moved in the highest society of his day and took an interest in politics (Tory), the church and the arts. He was particularly active on behalf of the southern states in the American civil war and the [[Southern Independence Association]] in England. Among his correspondents were Lillie Langtry, Sir Samuel White Baker 'of the Nile', and novelists 'Rolf Boldrewood' and '[[Violet Fane]]'.

====Wilson Family====
A family of very different significance is the Wilson family of Sheffield, one member of which was H. J. Wilson, radical M.P. for the Holmfirth division of Yorkshire from 1885 to 1912. His voluminous political papers, docketed by himself, cover the period from 1870 to 1910. They relate to the political topics in which he was interested, including Ireland, South Africa and the control of the opium trade; and to Sheffield constituency politics over many years, including Lib-Lab relations at the beginning of this century. As the Sheffield Smelting Company the Wilsons ran a business for refining precious metal from metallic waste, the records of which form a separate archive. The correspondence of H. J. Wilson's aunt, Mrs Mary Anne Rawson, takes the family record back to the anti-slavery period, a topic in which she was much interested.

====Edward Carpenter====
The name of [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844-1929) has already been mentioned. Most of his correspondence was received after the publication of the Bibliography of Edward Carpenter by the City Libraries in 1949. It includes series of letters from [[Olive Schreiner]], [[Havelock Ellis|Havelock]] and [[Edith Ellis]], [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry]] and Kate Salt (among others) as well as some of Carpenter's own letters and many from a host of friends in all parts of the world interested in socialism, philanthropy, eastern mysticism, sexual psychology, and the simple life at Holmesfield.

====Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society====
Several other large groups of letters may be mentioned here, each forming part of composite collections. In the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society's (SLPS) collection is the correspondence of James Montgomery, Sheffield poet and editor of the Iris newspaper (1771-1854). His correspondents included a number of lesser literary figures of his period (examples are William Roscoe, William Carey, Dr [[John Aikin]], Barbara Hofland, Mrs Basil Montagu) and evangelical Christians on both sides of the Atlantic; his correspondence with Joseph Aston includes the period of Montgomery's trial and imprisonment in 1794. Also in the SLPS collection are letters to Henry Clifton Sorby, the Sheffield geologist, over the period 1844 - 1896.

====Hunter Archaeological Society====
Correspondence and diaries of Mrs Margaret Gatty and her daughter, Mrs Juliana H. Ewing, form part of the Hunter Archaeological Society's collection. Both were writers of children's books and Mrs Gatty did interesting work on algae; her correspondence includes letters from authorities in this field and Mrs Ewing's includes letters written by her from Fredericton in Canada and her correspondence with Randolph Caldecott, illustrator of her books (many of his adorned with pen and ink sketches). The period covered is 1830 - 1885.

====Clarke family of Noblethorpe====
Industry (particularly coal mining) and landowning naturally go together in many other family archives. Notable in this category are the Clarke family of Noblethorpe's estate and colliery records. This family worked some of the best Silkstone coal in South Yorkshire. Cumulatively their papers give a good picture of the coal trade as carried on by canal and the changeover to rail.

====Crewe Muniments====
Among the many collections of South Yorkshire deeds may be mentioned the Crewe muniments, including Bawtry deeds of the Lister family with references to wharves and trade on the river Idle.

===Business records===
The rich industrial history of the Sheffield area is represented in the large collections of business records, which cover iron and steel, silver plate, coal mining and cutlery firms to professional firms of solicitors, land surveyors, auctioneers and architects. Many of the city’s major industrial concerns have deposited their archives at Sheffield, notably:

The firm of Thomas Bradbury and Sons, silver platers, is represented by day books, ledgers, orders, correspondence, etc., going back to the 1780s. A particular feature of this collection is the fine series of early engraved catalogues of old Sheffield plate.

A collection of 29 massive ledgers of the South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire iron trade carried on by the syndicate of iron-masters of whom William Spencer was one, links up with material in the Spencer Stanhope collection. It was deposited by the Staveley Iron Works and covers the period 1690-1766. The ledgers give detailed information of many aspects of the iron trade and were unknown to Dr A. Raistrick when he wrote 'The South Yorkshire ironmasters, 1690-1750' (Economic History Review, 1939).

There is also one volume of Staveley furnace accounts, 1772-1806. The nail and file trade in Sheffield is represented by orders, correspondence, etc., of the firm of Joseph Bramall, originally of [[Oughtibridge]] and subsequently of Sheffield, from 1856 to about 1932. A sheep-shear makers, Burgon &amp; Ball, has records from its commencement in the 1860s; these include much relating to its Australian trade. The firm also had an agency for the sale of bicycles with rubber tyres in the eighteen-nineties and cars early in this century. The technical drawing office records of the Yorkshire Engine Company consist of engine plans and orders and there is also a series of photographs of many engines made by the firm. A selected series of over seventy sales ledgers of Arthur Balfour's (now Balfour Darwin's) illustrates the growth of the firm's trade in steel throughout the world from 1865 to about 1948. Spear &amp; Jackson, tool makers, have also deposited some records. The business of an eighteenth-century hardware (cutlery) merchant is represented by stock and account books of Walter Oborne of Sheffield and subsequently of Ravenfield. Cutlery manufacturing firms, mainly of the nineteenth century, are represented by small deposits of Thomas Nowill &amp; Co., Christopher Johnson &amp; Co., and Ibbotson Bros., and by some orders and correspondence of Joseph Rodgers &amp; Sons rescued from destruction in the 1930s. Reference has already been made to the Sheffield Smelting Company's extensive records. From Thurlstone, bordering on the textile district, have come records of a peculiar trade, the making of hair-cloth and bagging for oil presses, from about 1790-1820s; this archive contains a series of letters from an emigrant to Pittsburg, written to his relatives in Yorkshire.

===Trade Unions===
Trades Unionism, another aspect of industrial life, is represented by archives of the local branch of ASLEF (from 1880), the Sawmakers' Protection Society (from 1860), the Pen and Pocket Blade Forgers' and Smithers' Protection Society (from 1870), and the Table-blade Grinders Association (from 1907, on microfilm); not all the records however are continuous from the earliest dates.

===Solicitors===
The numerous deposits received from solicitors contain much relating to families, manors, estates and local public business. Notable items among them include records of the Heck and Wentbridge Railway, 1825–28, and some papers relating to the Snaith and Co wick Police Association, 1847-58 (Clark &amp; Co. of Snaith); records of the Sheffield-Wakefield Turnpike trust from 1741 (Wheat and Tibbitts collections); land society trust deeds (Parker collection); some seventeenth-century proceedings of the West Riding commission of sewers (Baxter collection).

===Fairbank Collection===
The Fairbank collection, mentioned earlier, containing the firm's draft maps and plans, and their field and survey books, covers the parish of Sheffield and many adjacent areas. As surveyors for local enclosures and turnpike roads, as well as for many private clients, they mapped manors, estates, street developments, single properties and even some collieries. One of their chief clients was the Duke of Norfolk's Sheffield agent, especially over the period from 1770 to 1801, and the Arundel Castle manuscripts include several hundreds of finished plans of various parts of the ducal estates in Sheffield. Together, these two collections must make Sheffield one of the best mapped towns at this period.

===Architectural Plans===
[[Architectural plan]]s have been received from the offices of several firms of architects and represent the work of local architects in the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries.

===Institutions and organizations===
Records have been deposited by a variety of different bodies such as political parties, trades unions, clubs, societies, charities, trusts and independent schools. Some are mentioned above.

===Individuals===
The letters, diaries and personal papers of many individuals from all walks of life have been deposited, including those as diverse as [[Edward Carpenter]], Mrs Gatty and [[David Blunkett]] MP.

===Maps===
A unique and vast accumulation of maps and surveys, mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries, in the Fairbank Collection, as well as enclosure, tithe and Ordnance Survey maps.

===Other records===
Photographs, including a series of aerial photographs, and audio recordings from Radio Sheffield.

'''''The Prison - A Book With A Soundtrack''''' (or simply '''''The Prison''''') is Michael Nesmith's seventh solo album of his post-[[Monkees]] career and his first to be released under his own record label, [[Pacific Arts]]. It includes a novella meant to be read while listening to the album as its "soundtrack". In 1994 Nesmith recorded a companion novella/album entitled ''[[The Garden (Michael Nesmith album)|The Garden]]''.  According to Nesmith's website (Videoranch), a third installment titled ''The Ocean'' has been released and completes the Infinitia trilogy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videoranch.com/html/frnezfaq.html Videoranch website FAQs.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Prison'' and ''The Garden'' were re-released together on CD in 2004 by Video Ranch.

==Critical reception==
[[Allmusic]] called ''The Prison'' "a brilliant multimedia concept marrying the personal and inner visual experience of Michael "Papa Nez" Nesmith's novella with the aural medium of an equally original soundtrack." [[Robert Christgau]] called it a "ghastly boxed audio-allegory-with-book."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Michael+Nesmith Robert Christgau mention of The Prison.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remixes==
"The Prison" was dramatically remixed by Michael Nesmith for CD release on "Rio Records" in 1990, and again in 2007 on "Edsel Records". Some changes on both remixes include the removal or addition of drum machines, extra reverb on vocals (in the case of the 2007 remix, a new or alternate lead vocal track in places), and many other changes. &lt;BR&gt;Although the iTunes download of "The Prison" is credited in the iTunes store as the 1990 remix, it is actually the 2007 remix. As of September 2013, the original mix that appeared on vinyl has not been officially released on CD.

"'''The Twelve Huntsmen'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] as tale number 67 in their ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]''.  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]''.

It is [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 884, the forsaken fiancée.  Other tales which include this type as part of their plot are ''[[The True Bride]]'', ''[[The Two Kings' Children]]'', and ''[[Sweetheart Roland]]''.

==Synopsis==
Once there was a prince who was betrothed to a beautiful maiden whom he loved. One day, the prince was summoned to his father's deathbed and was so grief-stricken that he promised he would marry the [[false hero|neighboring princess]] whom his father wished he would marry. After his father died and the prince became king, he felt bound by his promise to marry the other princess. His fiancee heard of the new king's promise and asked her father for eleven maidens who looked exactly like her. Each maiden [[crossdressing|dressed]] as huntsmen went to the king's court.

At court, the king had a lion who knew everything. It told him that the huntsmen were women, and to test them, the king should put peas on the floor:  a man's firm step would crush them, while a woman's would make them roll. The maiden heard this and warned her companions to step firmly. And so, when the huntsmen stepped on the peas, they were crushed. The lion then said the king should put spinning wheels in the room, betraying the maidens' interest. Once again, the maiden learned of the lion's plan and warned her companions. The lion soon fell from favor as the king believed he did not know everything, as once thought. 

When the king's new bride entered court, the maiden fainted. Fearing that a faithful servant had fallen ill, the king came to her aid and found she had the ring he had given her. He dismissed the new bride and married the maiden, and restored the lion to favor as it had seen the truth.

'''Timurid art''' is a style of art originating during the rule of the [[Timurid Empire]] (1370-1507). Timurid art was noted for its usage of both [[Persian art|Persian]] and [[Chinese art|Chinese]] styles, as well as for taking influence from the art of other civilizations in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/timu/hd_timu.htm|title=The Art of the Timurid Period (ca. 1370–1507) {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Komaroff|first=Authors: Suzan Yalman, Linda|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the decline of the Timurid Empire, the art of the civilization continued to influence other cultures in [[Western Asia|West]] and Central Asia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
The Timurid Empire was established by [[Timor the Lame]] in 1370 after the conquest of the various [[Ilkhanate]] successor states. After conquering a city, the Timurids commonly spared the lives of the local artisans and deported them to the Timurid capital of [[Samarkand]]. After the Timurids conquered [[Persia]] in the early 15th century, many Persian artistic traits became interwoven with existing [[Mongol art]]. Timor the Lame's conversion to [[Islam]] later in life made Samarkand one of the centers of [[Islamic art]]. In the mid 15th century the empire moved its capital to [[Herat]], which became a focal point for Timurid art. As with Samarkand, Persian artisans and intellectuals soon established Herat as a center for arts and culture. Soon, many of the Timurids adopted [[Persian Culture|Persian culture]] as their own.&lt;ref&gt;B.F. Manz; W.M. Thackston; D.J. Roxburgh; L. Golombek; L. Komaroff; R.E. Darley-Doran (2007). "Timurids". Encyclopedia of Islam, online edition. &lt;q&gt;During the Timurid period, three languages, Persian, Turkish, and Arabic were in use. The major language of the period was Persian, the native language of the Tajik (Persian) component of society and the language of learning acquired by all literate and/or urban Turks. Persian served as the language of administration, history, belles lettres, and poetry.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illustration ===
Timurid art absorbed and improved upon the traditional Persian concept of the "Arts of the Book". The new, Timurid-inflected works of art saw illustrated [[paper]] (as opposed to [[parchment]]) manuscripts produced by the empire's artists. These illustrations were notable for their rich colors and elaborate designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artarena.force9.co.uk/timurid.htm|title=Iransaga - Persian Art, The Timurids|website=www.artarena.force9.co.uk|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the quality of the miniature paintings found in these manuscripts, [[Suzan Yalman]] of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] noted that "the Herat school [of manuscript painting] is often regarded as the [[apogee]] of Persian painting."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Painting was not limited to manuscripts, as many Timurid artists also created intricate [[Mural|wall paintings]]. Many of these wall paintings depicted landscapes derived from both Persian and Chinese artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;"Timurids" ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'' (Sixth ed.). New York City: [[Columbia University]]. Retrieved 2006-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; While the subject matter of these paintings was borrowed from other cultures, Timurid wall paintings were eventually refined into their own, unique style.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, W. Thomas. ''Dynastic Imagery in Early Timurid Wall Paintings''. Los Angeles Museum of Art.

Pelican History of Art, {{ISBN|0300064659}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metalwork, ceramics, and carving ===
The Timurid Empire also produced quality pieces of metalwork. [[Steel]], [[iron]], [[brass]], and [[bronze]] were commonly used as mediums.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/metalwork|title=METALWORK – Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timurid silver-[[Inlay|inlaid]] steel is often being cited as being of particularly high quality.&lt;ref&gt;The Caspian Sea Journal ISSN: 1578-7899 Volume 10, Issue 1, Supplement 3 (2016) 127-132 The Compilation of One Object of Timurid Metalwork (12th Century) in the National Museum of Iran with Two Objects in National Museum of Yerevan-Armenia.

URL: http://csjonline.org/CSJ/2016/Supp3/127-132.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Following the collapse of the Timurid Empire, several Iranian and Mesopotamian cultures co-opted Timurid metalwork.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Chinese-style [[Pottery|ceramics]] were produced by Timurid artisans. [[Jade|Jade carving]] also had some presence in Timurid art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legacy ===
Following the decline of the Timurid Empire in the late 15th century, the [[Ottomans]], [[Safavid dynasty]], and [[Mughal Empire]] co-opted Timurid artistic traditions into their own.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/dynasties/timurids-and-turkmen|title=The Timurids and the Turkmen - The David Collection|website=www.davidmus.dk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:White Hart Badge of Richard II.svg|thumb|White Hart as a [[Royal Badges of England|Royal Badge]] of [[Richard II]]]]
The '''White Hart''' ((white) "[[Hart (deer)|hart]]" is an archaic word for a mature [[white stag]]) was the personal [[badge (heraldry)|badge]] of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], who probably derived it from the arms of his mother, [[Joan of Kent|Joan "The Fair Maid of Kent"]], heiress of [[Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent|Edmund of Woodstock]]. It may also have been a pun on his name, as in "Rich-hart".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|last=Fox-Davies|first=Arthur=location=London|publisher=TC &amp; EC Jack|date=1909|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41617/41617-h/41617-h.htm#page329}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[The Wilton Diptych|Wilton Diptych]] ([[National Gallery, London]]), which is the earliest authentic contemporary portrait of an English king, Richard II wears a gold and enamelled white hart jewel, and even the angels surrounding the [[Virgin Mary]] all wear white hart badges. In [[English Folklore]], the white hart is associated with [[Herne the Hunter]].

There are still many inns and pubs in England that sport a sign of the white hart, the fifth most popular name for a pub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fatbadgers.co.uk/Britain/weird.htm Pub names: 5.White Hart.] {{verify credibility|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] wrote a collection of [[science fiction]]al [[tall tale]]s under the title of ''[[Tales from the White Hart]]'', which used as a [[framing device]] the [[conceit]] that the tales were told during drinking sessions in a pub named the '''White Hart''' that existed somewhere between [[Fleet Street]] and [[the Embankment]]. This pub was fictional, but was based on a real pub named the White Horse where the science fiction community of London met in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Notable British inns called the White Hart==

===Braintree===
The White Hart Hotel in [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]] dates back as far as the 14th Century in its current guise, and was placed at the crossroad of two Roman roads that form the centre of Braintree town and Bocking. It was a [[coaching inn]] that ran services to Sudbury and Norwich daily, up until the arrival of the railway in 1848. It has recently had a renovation by its current owners.

===Brentwood===
The White Hart in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] is the oldest pub in the town, dating back to before 1480. It may have been so named after [[King Richard II]] passed through Brentwood in 1392, possibly staying at the inn. It became a [[coaching inn]] in the 18th century and survived long enough that in 1910 it even offered repairs to motor vehicles.&lt;ref name="Boredtown"&gt;{{cite web | author=Qichina | title=Boredtown - Brentwood History | url=http://boredtown.co.uk/history.html | year=2006 | work=A Grumpy Old Man in Brentwood, Essex muses on small town life | accessdate=2006-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now operating as a nightclub and restaurant called Sugar Hut. The building can be seen on reality TV programme, '[[The Only Way Is Essex]]'.

===Canterbury===
The White Hart in [[Canterbury]] probably dates from Victorian times, but is reputed to be built on the site of St Mary de Castro, demolished around 1486,&lt;ref name="STMDEC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.machadoink.com/St%20Mary%20de%20Castro.htm|title=St Mary de Castro|year=2014|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mortuary of which is now the pub's cellar and still has a body chute. The small park next door, crossed by a diagonal path, is the graveyard, with gravestones lined up against the wall. The pub has a very nice garden, with bat and trap in summer.

===Coggeshall===
Part of a quaint market village on the route between [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]] and [[Colchester]], the White Hart Inn at [[Coggeshall]] dates back as far as 1420, and still has many of its original features, notably the timber rooms housing up to 18 beds. There is also a large meeting room available for hire.

===Colyford===
The White Hart Inn in Colyford sits on the A3052, which runs along the south coast from [[Bridport]] to [[Exeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehartcolyford.co.uk/|title=The White Hart Inn|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dartington, Totnes===
The White Hart is the name of the bar and restaurant within the estate of [[Dartington Hall]], near [[Totnes]] in [[Devon]]. The medieval Dartington Hall was built for [[John Holand, Earl of Huntingdon]] and half-brother to [[Richard II of England]]. The [[Dartington Morris Men]] side was formed at Dartington Hall in 1968 and was given permission to use the crest of the white hart on a red rose as its emblem.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Edinburgh===
In Edinburgh, "The White Hart" is an inn in the [[Grassmarket]], established early in the 16th century. It stood a few hundred steps from the place where public [[hanging]]s were held, and was popular among spectators. [[Robert Burns]] and [[William Wordsworth]] were among its notable visitors, and [[Burke and Hare]] found some of the victims of their murder-for-body-parts scheme there.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Hampshire===
There is a string of White Hart pubs along what was one of the old main coaching inn roads from London to [[Salisbury, United Kingdom|Salisbury]]. These are at: [[Hook, Hart|Hook]] (The White Hart and The Old White Hart), [[Basingstoke]], Worting, [[Overton, Hampshire|Overton]], [[Whitchurch, Hampshire|Whitchurch]], [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], [[Stockbridge, Hampshire|Stockbridge]], Gosport and [[Salisbury, United Kingdom|Salisbury]] in east Wiltshire .

===Hull===
"The Olde White Harte" in Silver Street, [[Kingston upon Hull]], was built c.1660, and remodelled in 1881 as a romantic re-imagining of a 17th-century inn. The exterior is in the ''Artisan Mannerist'' style, the interior has extensive wood panelling, including 17th century work; the building is Grade II* listed. Local legend, thought to originate in the 19th century and now considered unlikely to be correct, links the building with [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]], and the [[English Civil War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1197696|desc=The Old White Hart Inn|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the wood panelled first floor room known as the "Oak Room" or "Plotting Parlour" is the supposed location where Sir John Hotham and others took the decision to refuse [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] entry to the town, precipitating the [[Siege of Hull (1642)|First Siege of Hull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = General and concise history and description of the town and port of Kingston-upon-Hull|first = James Joseph|last=Sheahan|year = 1864| publisher = Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co.|url = https://archive.org/details/generalconcisehi00shea| pages= 605, 106–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The White Hart" is in Alfred Gelder Street, [[Kingston upon Hull]]. It was built in 1904 and frequented by the poet [[Philip Larkin]], who gave a talk to the Jazz Record Society entitled ‘My Life and Death as a Record Reviewer’ here in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelarkintrail.co.uk/city-centre.php?item=trialItem_name_10#trialItem_name_10|title=The White Hart|last=|first=|date=|website=www.thelarkintrail.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isle of Wight===
The White Hart in [[Havenstreet]] is close to the main centre of the [[Isle of Wight Steam Railway]] and has a railway theme.

===Llangybi===
The White Hart in [[Llangybi, Monmouthshire|Llangybi]] was first built in the early 16th century and was to become the property of [[Henry VIII]] as part of [[Jane Seymour]]'s wedding [[dowry]], while a century later [[Oliver Cromwell]] is reputed to have used it as his headquarters in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] during the [[English Civil War]]. The interior still retains no fewer than 11 fireplaces from the 17th century, a wealth of exposed beams, original [[Tudor period]] plasterwork and even a priest hole.

For years, students of English literature were mystified by a couple of lines in the poem 'Usk' written by [[T.S. Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/aug/06/highereducation.books|title=TS Eliot scholar finds answer to pub poet's riddle|last=Ezard|first=John|date=2003-08-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that [[T. S. Eliot]] made cryptic reference to this pub in his poem "Usk", referring not to an animal but to The White Hart Village Inn. Touring Wales in 1935, the poet had visited the old hostelry which does indeed stand near the village well, once painted white and now in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = John| last = Ezard| title = TS Eliot scholar finds answer to pub poet's riddle| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/aug/06/highereducation.books| work = The Guardian| date = 2003-08-06| accessdate = 2008-03-29 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ringwood===
The White Hart at [[Ringwood]] in the [[New Forest]] is said to have been the first pub so named, after King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] caught such a beast nearby, had it leashed and led it back to the town in triumph, a legend with the flavour of political allegory.&lt;ref&gt;The dynastic [[Wars of the Roses]] between supporters of the rival houses of [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[House of York|York]], for the throne of [[England]] were begun when the legitimate king, Richard II, was deposed by the Lancastrian [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]], and ended in the victory of Henry VII, the Lancastrian claimant, who married the Yorkist heiress. These events were not obscure, as they may seen today.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rowen, Conwy===
White Hart Road is the name given to a section of hill land road enclosed from common land in the parish of Caerhun high above the village of Rowen, in the Conwy Valley. It was planned as a new part of the [[Royal Mail]] coach road from [[Llanbedr y Cennin]] to [[Abergwyngregyn]] before the A55 coast road was built linking Chester to Holyhead around Penmaenmawr. The enclosure award still shows the name White Hart, which is very unusual for a road name rather than inns.

===Sonning-on-Thames===
The [[Great House at Sonning]] in [[Sonning]], [[Berkshire]], on the banks of the [[River Thames]], was formerly known as the ''White Hart'' because [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]'s wife, [[Isabella of Valois]] was kept prisoner in the village after his death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Southwark, London===
[[File:White Hart, Southwark.jpg|thumb|The White Hart, Southwark]]
An inn at the sign of the "White Hart" was established in the [[medieval]] period on [[Borough High Street]] in [[Southwark]]. It is mentioned by [[William Shakespeare]] in ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' as the headquarters of the rebels in [[Jack Cade]]'s 1450 [[Kent]]ish rebellion. Louis L'Amour mentions the Southwark White Hart in "Sackett's Land", an historical fiction taking place circa 1600. It became one of the many famous [[coaching inn]]s in the days of [[Charles Dickens]], and it was here that [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] met [[Samuel Pickwick|Mr. Pickwick]] in the famous scene from ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', chapter 10.&lt;ref&gt;"There are in London several old inns," Dickens begins. "It was in the yard of one of these inns—of no less celebrated a one than the White Hart—that a man was busily employed in brushing the dirt off a pair of boots."&lt;/ref&gt; The Inn was pulled down in the 19th century. It was next door to [[The George Inn, Southwark|The George Inn]] and near the site of [[The Tabard]].

Also in Southwark, but approximately 0.5&amp;nbsp;km to the west, the White Hart at 22 Great Suffolk Street was built in 1882. It survived redevelopment of the surrounding area and is now the only Victorian public house on that street.

The White Hart Inn in [[Witham]] is situated in the north centre of the town, and has been situated there since the late 13th Century. Based at the top of Newland Street, it sits pretty as one of the many old buildings in the town, and has since 2006 been refurbished to an authentic state that it was originally in.

'''William Gilbert''' (20 May 1804 – 3 January 1890) was an English writer and [[Royal Navy]] [[surgeon]].  He wrote a considerable number of novels, biographies, histories, essays (especially about the dangers of alcohol and the plight of the poor) and popular fantasy stories, mostly in the 1860s and 1870s. Some of these have been reprinted in recent decades and are still available today.  He is best remembered, however, as the father of dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].

==Life and career==
Gilbert was born at [[Bishopstoke]], Hampshire, the eldest son of William (1780–1812), a grocer in Commercial Row, [[Blackfriars, London]], and his wife Sarah ''née'' Mathers (1782–1810).&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, family tree and pp. 5 and 13. Gilbert's ODNB entry says her name was Catherine, but Ainger's extensive, and later, research on family history is clear.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both his parents died of tuberculosis by the time William was seven years old, and thereafter, he and his younger siblings, Joseph and Jane, were raised in London by their mother's sister and her husband, Mary ''nee'' Mathers (b. 1778) and John Samuel Schwenck (d. 1865), a childless and financially comfortable couple.  Gilbert's father had also left the children legacies that would be invested by their uncle until the youngest had reached age 21, so Gilbert's would not be due to him until age 26.  With the three young Gilbert children, the Schwencks soon moved from [[Lambeth]] to a larger house in [[Clapham]], where they raised the children with affection.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert served the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]] as a [[midshipman]] from 1818 (age 14) to 1821 but was unhappy with the conditions, and so he quit the service. He then spent several years in Italy, returning to England about 1825. There he studied at [[Guy's Hospital]] and served as an assistant surgeon in the navy, and then he entered the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in 1830.  At this time, he received his an annuity from his father's estate, giving him financial independence, and also published a volume of his poetry.  He first married Mary Ann Skelton in 1832, who died two years later at around age 20.  By this time, he had privately published another book, but after the death of his wife, he published no more for many years.  He married Anne Mary Bye Morris (1811–1888), age 24, on 14 February 1836.  She was the daughter of Thomas Morris (1760–1849), an apothecary, and Christiana ''nee'' Sutherland (1777–1845).  The couple's famous son, [[W. S. Gilbert]], was born on 18 November 1836 at the Morris's house in Southampton Street. The Gilberts then moved to [[Hammersmith]], near Anne's sister Harriet and her family.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, family tree and pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, Gilbert took his wife and toddler on a long trip to Italy, where he had lived as a young man.  There, their daughter Jane Morris Gilbert (1838–1906) was born.  In 1841, Gilbert's brother and sister, Joseph and Jane, both died of tuberculosis.  Gilbert received some property owned by his sister and became a potential co-guardian to Joseph's two young sons, together with the Schwencks.  In 1843, his daughter Mary Florence (1843–1911) was born.  In early 1845, Gilbert decided to take custody of his two young nephews from their mother, Catherine, who had begun a relationship with an officer of the East India Company.  She brought a custody lawsuit and her children were returned to her.  Amidst considerable publicity critical of Gilbert and the Schwencks, Gilbert fled with his young family to [[Boulogne]], France, where his daughter, Anne Maude (1845–1932), was born. The family lived there for two years and returned to London in 1847, moving to [[Brompton, London|Brompton]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert and Anne "led an increasingly quarrelsome life" in London.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Stedman, Jane. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10707/10707?back=,33400 "Gilbert, William (1804–1890)"], ''Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 21 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early writing career===
Gilbert began his writing career around 1857. He was concerned, throughout his life, with the welfare of the poor and served as honorary secretary of the Society of the Relief of Distress. His interest in the poor is evident in his writing, and one of his recurring themes was that poverty and alcohol, not genealogy, was the major cause of crime and the main factor in one's later fortunes. This theme would also be seen in his son's writing.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the elder Gilbert's first pieces was a pamphlet entitled, "On the Present System of Rating for the Relief of the Poor in the Metropolis" (1857). In 1858, anonymously, Gilbert published ''Dives and Lazarus, or the adventures of an obscure medical man in a low neighbourhood.''  The book was a fictional account focusing on what Gilbert saw as the increasing disparity in the lives of the rich and the poor. A similar theme pervades another early Gilbert novel, ''The Weaver's Family'' (1860). This theme continued to concern Gilbert throughout his career including in ''Contrasts; dedicated to the ratepayers of London'' (1873) and in one of his fiercest attacks on social abuses, ''The City; An Inquiry into the Corporation, its livery companies, and the administration of their charities and endowments'' (1877),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wJkHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22william+gilbert%22+%22the+city+an+inquiry%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sw9WUwYZGX&amp;sig=FCDBe9_AfGizfqHEEtVz79G0qw8 Online googlebooks version of ''The City'']&lt;/ref&gt; describing how 50,000 working-class people were evicted from their dwellings to make room for the [[Metropolitan Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;  In an age of [[male chauvinism]], Gilbert also wrote several articles about discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian. "The Beginnings of Bab: a perspective", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 3, issue 21, Summer 2007, pp. 662–63&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, Gilbert published a novel, ''Margaret Meadows, A Tale for the Pharisees''. This was made into a play called ''Mary Warner'' by [[Tom Taylor]] in 1869, who was forced to pay Gilbert a settlement for plagiarising his novel. Gilbert's most successful early novel was ''Shirley Hall Asylum: Or the Memoirs of a Monomaniac'' (1863), which told the stories of inmates of a lunatic asylum from the point of view of an escapee driven mad by trying to solve the problem of [[perpetual motion]]. Gilbert's first novel published under his own name was ''Christmas Tale: The Rosary, a Legend of Wilton Abbey'' (1863). The story purports to be the written confession of one Alicia Longspée, who had been Lady Abbess of the [[Wilton Abbey|Benedictine Convent at Wilton]] in the 15th century. Gilbert's next novel, ''De Profundis, a tale of the social deposits'' (1864) is the story of a foundling rescued by a Scottish Fusilier Guardsman stationed in London. The foundling grows up to marry the guardsman's daughter. Another 1864 book was ''The Goldsworthy Family, or the country attorney'', about an unethical lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's 1865 book, ''The Magic Mirror'' (about a mirror that grants wishes), containing stories with a moral was illustrated by his multi-talented son. Gilbert also wrote histories and articles and stories for numerous periodicals (often anonymously), including ''Cornhill, Temple Bar, St. Paul's, the Quiver, The Contemporary Review, The Sunday Magazine, Good Things, Good Words, Strahan's Boy's and Girl's (sic) Annual'' and ''The Fortnightly Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Gilbert's best-known, and most popular, works were his ''Innominato'' tales of the supernatural, published in various magazines, including ''[[Argosy Magazine|Argosy]]'', and finally collected in [http://www.haddon-hall.com/Libretti/WizardOfTheMountainFirst.pdf ''The Wizard of the Mountain'' (1867)]. One of the best-known is "The Last Lords of Gardonal" (1867).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/lastlord.htm Online copy of "The Last Lords of Gardonal"]&lt;/ref&gt;  These stories concerned the adventures of an enigmatic wizard and astrologer called the Innominato (in English, "Nameless"), in 14th century Italy, who tried to use his powers to help people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jessnevins/vici.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+17:04:22 Article about the Innominato character]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1868, Gilbert wrote ''The Doctor of Beauweir, an autobiography'', told from the point of view of a South Wales medic.  ''King George's Middy'' (1869), also illustrated by W. S. Gilbert, relates the adventures of a [[Leicestershire]] squire's son who becomes a midshipman and is marooned of the coast of Africa. Another 1869 novel was Sir Thomas Branston. Later that year, Gilbert produced his most famous biography, ''Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara: a biography: Illustrated by rare and unpublished documents''. In this work, Gilbert concluded, after extensive research, that there was no evidence of the acts of gross immorality of which Borgia was accused, including murder. This was followed in 1870 by ''The Inquisitor, or the Struggle in Ferrara'', about the life of [[Renée of France]], Duchess of Ferrara, set in 1554.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, pp. 297–98&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the novel ''Martha'' was followed by ''The Landlord of the "Sun"'', again describing a descent into degradation, this time involving a villainous seducer, an illegitimate child and drunkenness, and, in 1873, by ''Clara Levesque.''  Another theme that was seen in Gilbert's writings was his dislike of established religion and the Roman Catholic Church in particular. Two works on this theme included ''Facta non Verba: a comparison between the good works performed by the ladies in Roman Catholic communities in England and the unfettered efforts of their Protestant sisters'' (1874) and ''Disestablishment from a Church point of view'' (1875).&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, pp. 298–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert had a mercurial temper and was difficult to live with, imposing arbitrary restrictions on his wife and daughters. After many years of strained relations with his wife, Gilbert left home and separated from her in 1876 after forty years of marriage. He left his wife and daughters substantial incomes and the family home, assuming that he would be able to earn a good living from his writing.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he soon became seriously ill and appeared to be dying, and his doctors advised him not to write. His wife did not assist in his care and did not, ultimately, allow him to return home. Her son appealed to her on his father's behalf, but she would not change her mind. W. S. Gilbert apparently never contacted his mother again.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Gilbert went to live with Jane, his only married daughter, and her husband in The Close at [[Salisbury]], where he resided for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, Gilbert published ''Them Boots'', another description of characters from the lowest class of society, as well as ''The City''. Pursuing another favourite theme, the dangers of drink, Gilbert also published in 1877 ''Nothing but the Truth, an unvarnished picture of the effects of intemperance'', and example of his many writings about the dangers of alcohol. 1879 saw the publication of ''Mrs. Dubosq's Bible'', about a French [[Huguenot]] group in [[Spitalfields]] in the 18th century, and the possession of a 1650 Geneva Bible by a poor person. In 1880, ''Memoirs of a Cynic'' was a protest against cruelty and hypocrisy. This was followed in 1881 by ''Modern Wonders of the World, or the new Sinbad'', a series of 10 stories told to London children by Hassan, the son of an Egyptian slave dealer. His last book, published in 1882, ''Legion, or the modern demoniac'', returns to Gilbert's campaign against drink, which, he illustrated, leads to "crime, profligacy, suicide, homicide, brutality, cruelty, pauperism, idiocy and insanity."&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, pp. 300–01&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert died at the age of 86 and was buried in The Close at Salisbury.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Direct descendants of the Gilbert family still live in [[Cornwall]], England.

'''''Zaide''''' (originally, ''Das Serail'') is an unfinished [[Opera in German|German-language opera]], [[Köchel catalogue|K.]]&amp;nbsp;344, written by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] in 1780. [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]], in 1778, was in the process of setting up an opera company for the purpose of performing [[Opera in German|German opera]]. One condition required of the composer to join this company was that he should write a comic opera. At [[Salzburg]] in 1779 Mozart began work on a new opera (now known as ''Zaide'' although Mozart did not give it such a title). It contains spoken dialogue, which also classifies it as a ''[[Singspiel]]'' (literally, "singing play"). Only the arias and ensembles from the first two acts were composed. Missing are an overture and third act.

It was popular at the time for operas to depict the rescue of enslaved Westerners from Muslim courts, since Muslim pirates were preying on Mediterranean shipping, particularly to obtain slaves for various purposes. This story portrays Zaide's effort to save her beloved, Gomatz.

Mozart was composing for a German [[libretto]] by [[Johann Andreas Schachtner]], set in [[Turkey]], which was the scene of his next, completed rescue Singspiel (''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]''). He  soon abandoned ''Zaide'', to work on ''[[Idomeneo]]'', and never returned to the project. The work was lost until after his death, when [[Constanze Mozart]], his wife, found it in his scattered manuscripts in 1799. The fragments would not be published until 1838, and its first performance was held in [[Frankfurt]] on January 27, 1866, the 110th anniversary of Mozart's birth. ''Zaide'' has since been said to be the foundations of a masterpiece, and received critical acclaim. The tender soprano air, "Ruhe sanft, mein holdes Leben" is the only number that might be called moderately familiar.

The title ''Zaide'' was supplied by the Mozart researcher [[Johann Anton André]], who first published the score, including his own completion of it, in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfsymphony.org/Watch-Listen-Learn/Read-Program-Notes/Program-Notes/MOZART-Three-Arias-from-Zaide,-K-344-336b.aspx San Francisco Symphony]. Retrieved 2 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  André's father [[Johann André]] had set the same text to music, before Mozart commenced his singspiel.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard. [http://utahopera.org/backstage/2014/04/the-singspiel-and-mozart/ "The Singspiel and Mozart"]. Retrieved 2 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern companion pieces to'' Zaide'' have been written by both [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Chaya Czernowin]].

In modern performances, Mozart's [[Symphony No. 32 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 32]], K.&amp;nbsp;318, which was composed around the same time as ''Zaide'' and later used as an overture to [[Francesco Bianchi (composer)|Francesco Bianchi]]'s ''[[La villanella rapita]]'' (1784), is often given as an overture to ''Zaide''. Completions of the opera may use a pastiche of Mozart's concert arias or, more popularly, music from ''[[Thamos, King of Egypt]]'', also from the same period of Mozart's career.

==Style==
''Zaide'' can neither be described as [[opera buffa]] or [[opera seria]]; it contained elements of both forms, and parallels may be drawn to both genre in Mozart's work. ''Zaide'' is also notable as being one of only two dramatic pieces by Mozart to contain [[melodrama]] (the other being ''[[Thamos, King of Egypt]]''). Most of the spoken dialogue to ''Zaide'' has been lost, though there have been various attempts in modern times to write new dialogue to substitute for Schachtner's lost words.

==Performance history==
In 1995, [[La Monnaie|le Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie]] in Brussels presented ''Zaide'' in a production helmed by modern choreographer [[Lucinda Childs]] in her directing debut. In honor of the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth, a production of ''Zaide'' directed by [[Peter Sellars]] debuted at the [[Vienna Festival|Wiener Festwochen]] in 2006; it was later presented at the [[Mostly Mozart Festival]] in New York and the [[Barbican Centre]] in London. Sellars took the remaining fragments of ''Zaide'' and added excerpts from the composer's incidental music to the play ''Thamos, King of Egypt'', which, like ''Zaide'', was written when Mozart was 23. Taking off from the opera's theme of slavery, he set it in a contemporary sweatshop and cast it with African-American and Asian singers. The production featured the [[Concerto Köln]] under the direction of [[Louis Langrée]], sets by [[George Tsypin]], lighting by [[James F. Ingalls]], and costumes by Gabriel Berry. A revival, with the [[Camerata Salzburg]] in the pit, was presented at the [[Aix-en-Provence Festival]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Dermoncourt, Bertrand (30 June 2008). [http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/scene/le-ratage-zaide-la-reussite-siegfried_519658.html "Le ratage Zaïde, la réussite Siegfried"]. ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Zaide falls in love with Gomatz, a slave, which strikes up jealousy and rage in the [[Sultan]], who happens to also admire her. After capture she chooses a free life with Gomatz rather than a good life with the Sultan. Allazim encourages the sultan to consider Gomatz as a man, not as a slave. The final surviving quartet suggests Zaide and Gomatz are sentenced to punishment or execution. This is where Mozart's manuscript breaks off.

There are similarities with [[Voltaire]]'s play ''[[Zaïre (play)|Zaïre]]'' (''Zara'') in which Zaïre, a Christian slave who had been captured as a baby falls in love with Osman, the Sultan of [[Jerusalem]]. Osman wrongly believes Zaïre and another Christian slave Nerestan (Gomatz in Mozart's opera) are lovers and kills Zaïre in a jealous rage and then kills himself. The elderly Lusignan, a prisoner of the Sultan (paralleled in the character Allazim) recognizes Zara and Nerestan as his children as she escorts him to safety. From the surviving arias we can deduce a few differences between Voltaire's play and Mozart's opera. By Act II of the opera Zaide, Gomatz, and possibly Allazim actually escape, only to be captured once more. In the opera there is no evidence that Mozart intended to cast Zaide, Gomatz and Allazim as a reunited family. Indeed, the original ending of Voltaire's play may have been too serious for contemporary tastes and may have been a reason for Mozart's leaving the project incomplete.
