'''''Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays''''' ([[Princeton University Press]], 1957) is a book by Canadian literary critic and theorist, [[Herman Northrop Frye|Northrop Frye]], which attempts to formulate an overall view of the scope, theory, principles, and techniques of [[literary criticism]] derived exclusively from literature. Frye consciously omits all specific and practical criticism, instead offering classically inspired theories of modes, symbols, myths and genres, in what he termed "an interconnected group of suggestions." The literary approach proposed by Frye in ''Anatomy'' was highly influential in the decades before [[deconstruction|deconstructivist criticism]] and other expressions of [[postmodernism]] came to prominence in American academia circa 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Frank Lentricchia]], ''After the New Criticism'' (1980), in which Chapter One, 'The Place of Northrop Frye's ''Anatomy of Criticism'' ', begins by calling the book 'monumental'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frye's four essays are sandwiched between a "Polemical Introduction" and a "Tentative Conclusion." The four essays are titled "Historical Criticism: A Theory of Modes", "Ethical Criticism: a Theory of [[Symbol]]s", "[[Archetypal]] Criticism: A Theory of [[mythology|Myth]]s", and "Rhetorical Criticism: A Theory of [[Genre]]s."

==Contents==
===Polemical Introduction===
The purpose of the introduction is to defend the need for literary criticism, to distinguish the nature of genuine literary criticism from other forms of criticism, and to clarify the difference between direct experience of literature and the systematic study of literary criticism.

There are a number of reasons why the introduction is labeled as a '[[polemic]]'. In defending the need for literary criticism, Frye opposes a notion common to [[Tolstoy]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] thought that 'natural taste' is superior to scholarly learning (and by extension, criticism). Frye also accuses a number of methods of criticism (e.g. [[Marxist]], [[Freud]]ian, [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian, [[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]], etc.) as being embodiments of the deterministic fallacy. He is not opposed to these ideologies in particular, but sees the application of any external, ready-made ideology to literature as a departure from genuine criticism. This results in subjecting a work of literature to an individual's pet philosophy and an elevation or demotion of authors according to their conformity to the pet philosophy.

Another point is to distinguish the difference between personal taste and genuine criticism. Personal taste is too easily swayed by the prevailing morals, values and tastes of the critic's society at that point in history. If taste succumbs entirely to such social forces, the result is the same as that of consciously adopting an external ideology described above. Yet even if there is a consensus among critics that the works of [[John Milton]] are more fruitful than [[R. D. Blackmore]] (to use Frye's example), a critic contributes little by saying so. In other words, value judgments contribute little to meaningful criticism.

In place of meaningless criticism, Frye proposes a genuine literary criticism which draws its method from the body of literature itself. Literary criticism ought to be a systematic study of works of literature, just as physics is of nature and history is of human action. Frye makes the explicit assumption that in order for systematic study to be possible, the body of literature must already possess a systematic nature. Frye claims that we know very little about this system as yet and that the systematic study of literature has progressed little since [[Aristotle]].

Frye concludes his introduction by addressing the weaknesses of his argument. He mentions that the introduction is a polemic, but written in first person to acknowledge the individual nature of his views. He concedes that the following essays can only give a preliminary, and likely inexact, glimpse of the system of literature. He admits to making sweeping generalities that will often prove false in light of particular examples. Finally, he stresses that while many feel an "emotional repugnance" to schematization of [[poetry]], the schematization should be regarded as an aspect of criticism, not the vibrant, personal, direct experience of the work itself—much as the geologist turns away from his or her systematic work to enjoy the beauty of the mountains.

==="Historical Criticism: Theory of Modes"===
Frye's systemization of literature begins with three aspects of poetry given by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': ''mythos'' (plot), ''ethos'' (characterization/setting), and ''dianoia'' (theme/idea). Frye sees works of literature as lying somewhere on a continuum between being [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] driven, as in most [[fiction]], and [[idea]] driven, as in [[essay]]s and [[Lyrics|lyric]]al poetry. The First essay begins by exploring the different aspects of fiction (subdivided into tragic and comic) in each mode and ends with a similar discussion of thematic literature.

Frye divides his study of tragic, comic, and thematic literature into five "modes", each identified with a specific literary epoch: mythic, romantic, high [[mimesis|mimetic]], low mimetic, and ironic. This categorization is a representation of ''[[ethos]]'', or characterization and relates to how the protagonist is portrayed in respect to the rest of humanity and the protagonist's environment. Frye suggests that Classical civilizations progressed historically through the development of these modes, and that something similar happened in Western civilization during medieval and modern times. He speculates that contemporary fiction may be undergoing a return to myth, completing a full circle through the five modes. Frye argues that when irony is pushed to extremes, it returns to the mode of myth; this concept of the ''recursion'' of [[cyclic history|historical cycles]] is familiar from [[Giambattista Vico]]&lt;ref&gt;Cotrupi, Caterina Nella [https://books.google.com/books?id=rh8gcNF9YXkC ''Northrop Frye and the poetics of process''] p.18&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oswald Spengler]].&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RgcnAQAAIAAJ ''Spiritus Mundi: Essays on Literature, Myth, and Society''] p.113 quotation: {{quotation|The demonic aspect of historical time is clearer in Vico than in Spengler, though Vico came later into my readig. In Vico there is also a projecting of authority, first on gods, then on "heroes" or human leaders, then on the people themselves. Vico lived at a time when there had been no permanently successful example of a democracy, and from his study of Roman history he concluded that the people cannot recover the authority they project on others, and hence the third age of the people is followed by a ''ricorso'' that starts the cycle over again. In Spengler there is no general cyclical movement of this kind, but there is one latent in his argument. Spengler's sense of a historically finite culture, exploiting and exhausting a certain range of imaginative possibilities, provided the basis for the conception of modes outlined in the first essay of Anatomy of Criticism. I soon scrapped his loaded term "decline" for a more neutral conception of cultural aging, but his vision of cultural history superseded the onward- and-upward people I had read still earlier in youth, such as Bernard Shaw and HG Wells, who had obviously got it wrong.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.prodigy.net/aesir/aoc.htm review]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403220409/http://pages.prodigy.net/aesir/aoc.htm |date=April 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tragedy is concerned with the hero's separation from society.
*Mythic tragedy deals with the death of gods.
*Romantic tragedy features elegies mourning the death of heroes such as [[King Arthur|Arthur]] or [[Beowulf]].
*High mimetic tragedy presents the death of a noble human such as [[Othello]] or [[Oedipus]].
*Low mimetic tragedy shows the death or sacrifice of an ordinary human being and evokes pathos, as with [[Thomas Hardy]]'s [[Tess of the d'Urbervilles|Tess]] or [[Henry James]]'s [[Daisy Miller]].
*The ironic mode often shows the death or suffering of a protagonist who is both weak and pitiful compared to the rest of humanity and the protagonist's environment; [[Franz Kafka]]'s works provide many examples of such. At other times, the protagonist is not necessarily weaker than the average person yet suffers severe persecution at the hands of a deranged society. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s Hester Prynne, and Hardy's Tess exemplify this treatment.

Comedy is concerned with integration of society.
*Mythic comedy deals with acceptance into the society of gods, often through a number of trials as with [[Hercules]] or through [[salvation]] or assumption as in the [[Bible]].
*In romantic comic modes, the setting is pastoral or idyllic, and there is an integration of the hero with an idealized simplified form of nature.
*High mimetic comedy involves a strong central protagonist who constructs his or her own society by brute force, fending off all opposition until the protagonist ends up with all honor and riches due him or her—the plays of [[Aristophanes]] or something like [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Prospero]] are examples.
*Low mimetic comedy often shows the social elevation of the hero or heroine and often ends in marriage.
*Ironic comedy is perhaps more difficult, and Frye devotes a good deal more space to this than the other comedic modes. At one extreme, ironic comedy borders on savagery, the inflicting of pain on a helpless victim. Some examples of this include tales of [[Lynching|lynch mob]]s, [[Crime fiction|murder mysteries]], or human sacrifice. Yet ironic comedy may also offer biting satire of a society replete with snobbery. It may even depict a protagonist rejected by society (thus failing the typical comic reintegration) yet who appears wiser than the rejecting society. Aristophanes, [[Ben Jonson]], [[Molière]], [[Henry Fielding]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], and [[Graham Greene]] offer examples of the wide range of ironic comic possibility.

Finally, Frye explores the nature of thematic literature in each mode. Here, the intellectual content is more important than the plot, so these modes are organized by what is considered more authoritative or educational at the time. Also, these modes tend to organize by societal structure.
*In the mythical mode scripture, literature claiming divine inspiration is prevalent.
*In the romantic, the gods have retreated to the sky and it is up to chroniclers in a nomadic society to remember the lists of names of the patriarchs, the proverbs, traditions, charms, deeds, etc.
*In the high mimetic mode society is structured around a capital city, and "national" epics such as ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and ''[[The Lusiad]]'' are typical.
*In the low mimetic, thematic exposition tends toward individualism and romanticism. The individual author's own thoughts and ideas are now the center of authority, as instanced by [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[The Prelude|Prelude]]''.
*Finally, in the ironic mode, the poet figures as a mere observer rather than an authoritative commentator, producing writing that tends to emphasize discontinuity and anti-epiphany. [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' exemplify this thematic mode.

==="Ethical Criticism: Theory of Symbols"===
Now that Frye has established his theory of modes, he proposes five levels, or ''phases'', of symbolism, each phase independently possessing its own ''mythos'', ethos, and ''dianoia'' as laid out in the first essay. These phases are based on the four levels of [[medieval allegory]] (the first two phases constituting the first level). Also, Frye relates the five phases with the ages of man laid out in the first essay. Frye defines a literary symbol as: "[A]ny unit of any literary structure that can be isolated for critical attention."

Symbolic phases:
* Literal/descriptive (motifs and signs)
* Formal (image)
* Mythical (archetype)
* Anagogic (monad)

The '''descriptive''' phase exhibits the centrifugal, or outward, property of a symbol. For example, when a word such as 'cat' evokes a definition, image, experience or any property connected with the word 'cat' external to the literary context of the particular usage, we have the word taken in the descriptive sense. Frye labels any such symbol a ''sign''. He does not define the sign beyond this sense of pointing to the external, nor does he refer to any particular semiotic theory. In opposition to the sign stands the ''motif'' which is a symbol taken in the '''literal''' phase. This phase demonstrates the inward, or centripetal, direction of meaning, best described as the contextual meaning of the symbol. To Frye, ''literal'' means nearly the opposite of its usage in common speech; to say that something "literally" means something generally involves referring to a definition external to the text. Instead, ''literal'' refers to the symbol's meaning in its specific literary situation while ''descriptive'' refers to personal connotation and conventional definition. Finally, Frye draws an analogy between rhythm and harmony with the literal and descriptive phases respectively. The literal phase tends to be horizontal, dependent on what comes before and after the symbol while the descriptive phase tends to be laid out in space, having external meanings that vary in nearness to the contextual meaning.

Frye next introduces the '''formal''' phase, embodied by the image, in order to define the layer of meaning that results from the interplay of the harmony and rhythm of the signs and motifs. The  most frequently repeated imagery sets the tone of the work (as with the color red in ''[[Macbeth]]''), with less repeated imagery working in contrast with this tonal background. This section of the essay gives a faithful representation of literary formalism (also known as [[New Criticism]]). Frye's representation of formalism here is unique; however, its setting as part of the larger system of literary criticism Frye outlines in the entire work. The notion of form (and perhaps Frye's literal phase) relies heavily on the assumption of inherent meaning within the text—a point contested by deconstructionist critics.

The '''mythical''' phase is the treatment of a symbol as an archetype. This concept relates most closely with [[intertextuality]] and considers the symbol in a work as interconnected with similar symbolism throughout the entire body of literature. While Frye deals with myths and archetypes from a broader perspective in the third essay, in this section he focuses on the critical method of tracing a symbol's heritage through literary works both prior and subsequent to the work in question. Frye argues that convention is a vital part of literature and that copyright  is deleterious to the process of literary creation. Frye points to the use of convention in Shakespeare and Milton as examples to strengthen his argument that even verbatim copying of text and plot does not entail a death of creativity. Further, Frye argues that romantic, anti-conventional writers such as [[Walt Whitman]] tend to follow convention anyway. In criticism, the study of the archetypal phase of a symbol is akin to the "nature" perspective in the psychological debate over [[nature versus nurture]]. Rather than viewing the symbol as a unique achievement of the author or some inherent quality of the text, the archetypeal phase situates the symbol in its society of literary kindred as a product of its conventional forebears.

Finally, Frye proposes an '''anagogic''' phase wherein a symbol is treated as a monad. The anagogic level of medieval allegory treated a text as expressing the highest spiritual meaning. For example, Dante's Beatrice in the [[Divine Comedy]] would represent the bride of Christ. Frye makes the argument that not only is there a lateral connection of archetypes through intertextuality, but that there is a transcendent almost spiritual unity within the body of literature. Frye describes the anagogic in literature as "the imitation of infinite social action and infinite human thought, the mind of a man who is all men, the universal creative word which is all words."

==="Archetypal Criticism: Theory of Myths"===
Frye begins the essay regarding [[myth]] as the source of all [[literature]] (as a visual, auditory and textual art form), paintings (as visual art form) and music (as an auditory art form). The underlying structures and patterns of all these forms are similar, though they have a unique style of their own.

The third essay is the culmination of Frye's theory in that it unites the elements of characterization and each of the five symbolic phases presented in the first two essays into an organic whole. This whole is organized around a metaphor of human desire and frustration as manifested in the [[Great Chain of Being]] (divine, human, animal, vegetable, mineral and water) by analogy to the four [[season]]s.

At one pole we have apocalyptic imagery which typifies the revelation of [[heaven]] and ultimate [[wikt:fulfillment|fulfillment]] of human desire. In this state, the literary structure points toward unification of all things in a single analogical symbol. The ultimate of the divine is the deity, of the human is [[Christ]] (or any other being that embodies the oneness of humanity in its spiritual culmination), of the animal is the [[Domestic sheep|lamb]], of the vegetable is the [[Tree of life|Tree of Life]] or [[vine]], and of the mineral is the [[New Jerusalem|heavenly Jerusalem]] or city of God.

At the opposite pole lies [[demon]]ic imagery which typifies the unfulfillment, perverion, or opposition of human desire. In this state, things tend toward [[anarchy]] or [[tyranny]]. The divine is an angry, inscrutable God demanding sacrifice, the human is the tyrannical [[anti-christ|anti-Christ]], the animal is a predator such as a [[lion]], the vegetable is the evil wood as found at the beginning of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' or Hawthorne's "[[Young Goodman Brown]]", and the city is the [[dystopia]] embodied by [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s ''1984'' or [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]''.

Finally we have the analogical imagery, or more simply, depictions of states that are similar to paradise or [[hell]], but not identical. There is a great deal of variety in the imagery of these structures, but tame animals and wise rulers are common in structures analogical to the apocalyptic (analogy of innocence), while predatory aristocrats and masses living in squalor characterize analogy to the demonic (analogy of experience).

Frye then identifies the mythical mode with the apocalyptic, the ironic with the demonic, and the romantic and [[Mimesis|low mimetic]] with their respective analogies. The [[Mimesis|high mimetic]], then, occupies the center of all four. This ordering allows Frye to place the modes in a circular structure and point to the cyclical nature of myth and archetypes. In this setting, literature represents the natural cycle of birth, growth, maturity, decline, death, [[resurrection]], rebirth, and the repetition of the cycle. The remainder of the chapter deals with the cycle of the four seasons as embodied by four mythoi: [[comedy]], [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], [[tragedy]], and [[irony]] or [[satire]].

==="Rhetorical Criticism: Theory of Genres"===
In the first three essays, Frye deals mainly with the first three elements of Aristotle's elements of poetry (i.e. mythos, ethos, dianoia). In the fourth essay, he explores the last three elements:
* ''melos'' - the element dealing with the tonal, musical aspect of literature
* ''lexis'' - the written word, lying somewhere between musical and visual aspects. It may be referred to as diction (ear) or imagery (eye) depending on the critical focus.
* ''opsis'' - the element dealing with visual aspects of literature

Whereas mythos is the verbal imitation of action and dianoia the verbal imitation of thought (ethos being composed of the two), melos and opsis (with lexis composed of the two) correspond, though seen from a different (rhetorical) perspective. Frye identifies the connection as such: "The world of social action and event . . . has a particularly strong association with the ear. . . . The world of individual thought and idea has a correspondingly close connection with the eye . . ." (Frye, 243).

Rhetoric means two things: ornamental (opsis) speech and persuasive (melos) speech. Rhetorical criticism, then, is the exploration of literature in the light of melos, opsis, and their interplay as manifested in lexis.

The ''radical of presentation''—the relation (or idealized relation) between author and audience—is a further consideration. Difference in genre relies not on topical considerations (science fiction, romance, mystery), nor in length (e.g. epics are long, lyrics are short), but in the radical of presentation. As such, Frye proposes a total of four distinct genres:
* epos - Author speaks directly to audience (e.g. story telling, formal speech).
* fiction - Author and audience are hidden from each other (e.g. most novels).
* drama - Author is hidden from the audience; audience experiences content directly.
* lyric - Audience is "hidden" from author; that is, the speaker is "overheard" by hearers.

These four genres form the organizing principle of the essay, first examining the distinctive kind of rhythm of each, then looking at specific forms of each more closely. As Frye describes each genre, he explains the function of melos and opsis in each. To understand Frye's melos, it is important to note{{According to whom|date=May 2011}} his counter-intuitive usage of the term "musical". He contends that the common usage of the term is inaccurate for purposes of criticism, drawn from analogy with harmony, a stable relationship. Music, however, does not consist of a plastic, static, continuously stable relationship, but rather a series of dissonances resolving at the end into a stable relationship. Poetry containing little dissonance, then, has more in common with the plastic arts than with music.

The original presentation of the epic was ''ta epe'' (that which is spoken), and when an author, speaker, or storyteller addresses a visible audience directly, we have epos. The rhythm of epos is that of recurrence (i.e. accent, meter, sound patterns). These are the rhythms most commonly associated with poetry.

"Fiction" is a vague term which Frye uses to avoid introducing too many new terms. Part of the difficulty comes from fact that this is the only of the four genres which has no precedent in antiquity. He acknowledges having used the term previously in a different sense. In this essay, the term refers to literature in which the author addresses the audience through a book, or more simply stated, prose. The rhythm of prose is that of continuity of meaning.

Drama lies halfway between epos and fiction, or more accurately, its diction must fit the setting and the character. Some characters may be melos-oriented, speaking in meter or with various rhetorical effects in song and banter. Others may be opsis-oriented, speaking more in prose and conveying ideological content. Most characters alternate according to the dramatic situation. Such a marriage of the appropriate language with the character and setting (ethos) defines a rhythm of decorum, the distinctive rhythm of drama.

Classical lyrical poetry often presents a shepherd speaking of his love; he is overheard by his audience. However, the distinctiveness of lyric comes more from its peculiar rhythm than from this radical of representation. Frye describes this rhythm as associative rather than logical and is the stuff of dreams and the subconscious. It is closely related to the chant, and though it is found in all literature, it is more apparent in certain kinds of literature than others. At this point Frye suggests a connection between the four historical modes and the four genres. In this sense, the lyrical is typical of the ironic age—just as the ironic protagonist has turned away from society, the lyrical poet makes utterances without regard to the audience. The lyrical rhythm is very clearly seen in Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', a work based almost entirely on associative babbles and dream utterance.

==Miscellaneous==
* The Latin dedication at the beginning, "Helenae Uxori" is to Northrop's wife, Helen.
* Frye's [[Green World]] theory developed
* [[Bergson]]'s ''[[Laughter (Bergson book)|Laughter]]'' may provide a complementary view on [[comedy]].
* The book evolved out of an introduction to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'': "the introduction to Spenser became an introduction to the theory of [[allegory]]" Frye allowed (p. vii).

The '''Art Renewal Center''' ('''ARC''') is a non-profit, educational organization, which hosts an online museum dedicated to realist art.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=sWeMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=art+renewal+center&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie4u7_nOjZAhVQd6wKHcoKDOQQ6AEIYDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=art%20renewal%20center|title=Master Narratives and their Discontents|last=Elkins|first=James|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135872571|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARC was founded by [[New Jersey]] businessman and art collector Fred Ross.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2007/08/20/Gifted-artist-Bouguereau-s-work-controversial-more-than-a-century-after-his-death/stories/200708200191|title=Gifted artist?

Particular emphasis is given to nineteenth-century [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], who is represented by more than 226 images on the site; Ross says that Bouguereau's work is accessed twice as often as any other artist on the site.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
The Art Renewal Center is devoted to the rehabilitation of late nineteenth-century academic painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zzMrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Art+Renewal+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1u7WW5urZAhVK_4MKHdVTDr44ChDoAQg1MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Art%20Renewal%20Center%22|title=The Art and Thought of John La Farge: Picturing Authenticity in Gilded Age America|last=Kresser|first=Katie|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351546461|location=|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross feels that there has been a "concerted and relentless effort to disparage, denigrate and obliterate the reputations, names and brilliance of the academic artistic masters of the late 19th century." The Art Renewal Center is intended as a platform for Ross and his supporters to "extol the virtues of academic artists and castigate nearly everything associated with modern art."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ARC describes itself as offering "responsible views opposing that of the current art establishment".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Bouguereau Nymphs and Satyr MMA cr.jpg|thumb|[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], ''Nymphs and Satyr'', 1873, [[Clark Art Institute]]]]
Ross is a strong admirer of Adolphe Bouguereau's work. In 2002 he spoke to the New York Society of Portrait Artists and described the impression made on him in the Clark Art Institute (Williamstown, Massachusetts) by Bouguereau's {{convert|8.5|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} painting, ''Nymphs and Satyr'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Frozen in place, gawking with my mouth agape, cold chills careening up and down my spine, I was virtually gripped as if by a spell that had been cast. Years of undergraduate courses and another 60 credits post-graduate in art, and I had never heard [Bouguereau's] name. Who was he? Was he important? Anyone who could have done this must surely be deserving of the highest accolades in the art world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2007/08/20/Gifted-artist-Bouguereau-s-work-controversial-more-than-a-century-after-his-death/stories/200708200191|title=Gifted artist?

==Reception==
Artist and blogger [[Mark Vallen]] stated on his web site that the ARC assertions "are not incorrect when noting the follies of modern art, but their total rejection of it is beyond the pale and thoroughly reactionary." Vallen was critical of Bouguereau: "Bouguereau's strength was his dedication to the craft of painting, and his technical mastery of oil painting can't be denied. If today's artists knew but a fraction of the painting skills possessed and employed by Bouguereau, they would be better off. Nevertheless, Bouguereau was also imprisoned by his extremely conservative vision of what painting could be—and that was his greatest weakness."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5633">An '''art book fair''' is a type of curated [[Arts festival#Art Fair|art fair]] or [[exhibition]] for the purpose of displaying, selling and networking between artists, [[Artist's book|art book]] creators, illustrators, writers, specialty printers, [[Independent publisher|independent publishers]] and their audience. The parameters of inclusion vary from fair to fair: some only include publications which are themselves considered art objects, limited edition [[Artist's book|art books]], artist multiples or books specifically about an art topic; others are wider to include [[Graphic novel|graphic novels]], cultural [[Magazine|magazines]], [[Zine|zines]], [[creative writing]], [[poetry]], and other artist projects. Like other art fairs, an art book fair will not only include works for sale but also artist installations, projects, [[Happening|happenings]], workshops, talks, panel discussions or book launches. Recursive fairs may run with a yearly theme or prompt which guides programming.

Unlike a traditional [[trade fair]] or book fair (such as the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]]), art book fairs are public and less formal in regards to industry conferencing or networking; while they do serve as an opportunity for publishers and artists to commingle, the nature of art book sales is such that there are no sales or rights marketing as with a regular book fair. Instead, art book fairs are an aspect of [[Artist-run initiative|artist-run culture]] and an address to artmaking in the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] era&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherlock|first=Diana|date=Spring 2013|title=Institutions by Artists: Resistance Or Retreat?|url=|journal=International Contemporary Art|volume=|pages=16–20|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Art book fairs are also a way for viewers to interact with, collaborate, and learn with and obtain artwork outside of commercial art institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/obituaries/shannon-michael-cane-who-transformed-art-book-fairs-dies-at-43.html|title=Shannon Michael Cane, Who Transformed Art Book Fairs, Dies at 43|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=2017-11-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=All the Books You'Ll Never Catch on a Kindle.|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=October 3, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the ephemeral and mass-produced nature of [[Publishing|publishing history]], "publishing seems to offer," as Offprint Paris director Yannick Bouillis put it, "an authentic, autonomous space within the art community. Books and other publishing artifacts such as magazines, posters, and tapes are—in comparison to artworks—relatively free from public and market concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://conversations.e-flux.com/t/why-has-there-been-such-a-boom-in-art-book-fairs/948|title=Why has there been such a boom in art book fairs?|website=e-flux conversations|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
One early example of art book fair as differentiated from trade book fairs or art exhibitions is by artist-run non-profit organization [[Printed Matter, Inc|Printed Matter]], which emerged in New York City in the 1960s. Printed Matter began a bookstore and gallery which celebrated publishing as an artistic medium, artist-run culture, and alternative art practice, an ethos which has carried through to contemporary art book events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/beyond-prints-a-confrontation-at-la-art-book-fair|title=Beyond Prints: A Confrontation at L.A. Art Book Fair|date=2015-02-06|work=KCET|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2004 Printed Matter and then director, artist [[AA Bronson]], launched the first [[NY Art Book Fair|New York Art Book Fair]], and later the LA Art Book Fair in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.printedmatter.org/about/mission-history|title=Mission History - Printed Matter|website=Printed Matter|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fairs have grown steadily to an audience well beyond the local art scenes or literati: the 2015 NY Art Book Fair was host to 370 exhibitors from 28 countries and had an estimated 35,000 guests in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2015/09/26/ny-art-book-fair-numbers/|title=The Rise of the New York Art Book Fair: A Look at the Numbers|last=Greenberger|first=Alex|date=2015-09-26|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the Printed Matter model, art book fairs have emerged around the world as a way for artist-run or non-profit institutions to generate awareness with a broader public and fundraise through the sale of admission, special event tickets, and limited edition artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/beyond-prints-a-confrontation-at-la-art-book-fair|title=Beyond Prints: A Confrontation at L.A.

[[File:William Morris design for Trellis wallpaper 1862.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|[[William Morris]] design for "Trellis" wallpaper, 1862]]
The '''Arts and Crafts movement''' was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920, emerging in Japan (the [[Mingei]] movement) in the 1920s. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moses N. Ikiugu and Elizabeth A. Ciaravino, ''Psychosocial Conceptual Practice models in Occupational Therapy''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] | url= http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style09a/index.html | title= Arts and Crafts Style Guide | work=British Galleries | accessdate= 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by [[Modernism]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards.&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt;

The term was first used by [[T. J. Cobden-Sanderson]] at a meeting of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] in 1887,&lt;ref name=crawford&gt;Alan Crawford, ''C. R.

The movement developed earliest and most fully in the British Isles,&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Grove Encyclopedia of [[Decorative Arts]], Volume 1 | isbn = 978-0-19-518948-3 | first = Gordon | last = Campbell | publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spread across the British Empire and to the rest of Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Kaplan and Alan Crawford, ''The Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in Europe &amp; America: Design for the Modern World'', Los Angeles County Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; It was largely a reaction against the perceived impoverished state of the [[decorative arts]] at the time and the conditions in which they were produced.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;Brenda M. King, ''Silk and Empire''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and influences==
===Design reform===
The Arts and Crafts movement emerged from the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid 19th century Britain. It was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory production. Their critique was sharpened by the items they saw in [[the Great Exhibition of 1851]], which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used.


The art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] has said that exhibits in the Great Exhibition showed "ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, the integrity of the surface" and "vulgarity in detail".&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; Design reform began with the organisers of the Exhibition itself, [[Henry Cole]] (1808–1882), [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] (1809–1874), [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] (1820–1877) and [[Richard Redgrave]] (1804–1888),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/w/wallpaper-design-reform/ V&amp;A, "Wallpaper Design Reform"]&lt;/ref&gt; who deprecated excessive ornament and impractical and badly made things.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The organisers were "unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} Owen Jones, for example, complained that "the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter" produce "in art novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} From these criticisms of the contemporary state of manufactured goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's ''Supplementary Report on Design'' (1852) analysed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for "more logic in the application of decoration."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} Other works followed in a similar vein: Wyatt's ''Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century'' (1853), [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst'' ("Science, Industry and Art") (1852), [[Ralph Wornum]]'s ''Analysis of Ornament'' (1856), Redgrave's ''Manual of Design'' (1876) and Jones's ''Grammar of Ornament'' (1856).{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The ''Grammar of Ornament'' was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}}

Jones declared that "Ornament ... must be secondary to the thing decorated", that there must be "fitness in the ornament to the thing ornamented", and that wallpapers and carpets must not have any patterns "suggestive of anything but a level or plain".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design''&lt;/ref&gt; Where a fabric or wallpaper in the Great Exhibition might be decorated with a natural motif made to look as real as possible, these writers advocated flat and simplified natural motifs. Redgrave insisted that "style" demanded sound construction before ornamentation, and a proper awareness of the quality of materials used. "''Utility'' must have precedence over ornamentation."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}}

[[File:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpg|thumb|upright|''The Nature of Gothic'' by John Ruskin, printed by William Morris at the Kelmscott Press in 1892 in his [[Golden Type]] inspired by the 15th century printer [[Nicolas Jenson]]. This chapter from ''The Stones of Venice'' was a sort of manifesto for the Arts and Crafts movement.]]

However, the design reformers of the mid 19th century did not go as far as the designers of the Arts and Crafts Movement: they were more concerned with ornamentation than construction, they had an incomplete understanding of methods of manufacture,{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}} and they did not criticise industrial methods as such. By contrast, the Arts and Crafts movement was as much a movement of social reform as design reform and its leading practitioners did not separate the two.

===A. W. N. Pugin===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:The Grange, Ramsgate 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pugin's house, "The Grange", in Ramsgate, 1843. Its simplified Gothic style, adapted to domestic building, helped shape the architecture of the Arts and Crafts Movement.]]

Some of the ideas of the movement were anticipated by [[A.W.N. Pugin]] (1812–1852), a leader in the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival in architecture]]. For example, he, like the Arts and Crafts artists, advocated truth to material, structure and function.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A /&gt; Pugin articulated the tendency of social critics to compare the faults of modern society (such as the sprawling growth of cities and the treatment of the poor) unfavorably with the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name=hill&gt;Rosemary Hill, ''God's Architect: Pugin and the Building of Romantic Britain'', London: Allen Lane, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a tendency that became routine with Ruskin, Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. His book ''Contrasts'' (1836) drew examples of bad modern buildings and town planning in contrast with good medieval examples, and his biographer [[Rosemary Hill]] notes that in it he "reached conclusions, almost in passing, about the importance of craftsmaship and tradition in architecture that it would take the rest of the century and the combined efforts of Ruskin and Morris to work out in detail." She describes the spare furnishings he specified for a building in 1841—"rush chairs, oak tables"—as "the Arts and Crafts interior in embryo."&lt;ref name=hill /&gt;

===John Ruskin===
{{expand section|date=December 2014}}
The Arts and Crafts philosophy derived in large measure from [[John Ruskin]]'s social criticism, which related the moral and social health of a nation to the qualities of its architecture and to the nature of work. Ruskin (1819–1900) considered the sort of mechanized production and division of labour that had been created in the [[industrial revolution]] to be "servile labour" and he thought that a healthy and moral society required independent workers who designed the things they made. His followers favoured craft production over industrial manufacture and were concerned about the loss of traditional skills, but they were arguably more troubled by the effects of the [[factory system]] than by machinery itself&lt;ref name=sarsby&gt;Jacqueline Sarsby" Alfred Powell: Idealism and Realism in the Cotswolds", ''Journal of Design History'', Vol. 10, No. 4, pp. 375-397&lt;/ref&gt; and William Morris's idea of "handicraft" was essentially work without any division of labour rather than work without any sort of machinery.&lt;ref name=pye&gt;David Pye, ''The Nature and Art of Workmanship'', Cambridge University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Morris===
[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|William Morris, the main influence on the Arts and Crafts Movement]]
[[William Morris]] (1834–1896), the towering figure in late 19th century design, was the main influence on the Arts and Crafts movement. The aesthetic and social vision of the Arts and Crafts movement derived from ideas he developed in the 1850s with a group of students at the [[University of Oxford]], who combined a love of [[Romantic literature]] with a commitment to social reform.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|pp=96-97}} By 1855 they had discovered Ruskin and, believing there to be a contrast between the barbarity of contemporary art and the painters preceding [[Raphael]] (1483-1530), they formed themselves into the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] to pursue their artistic aims. The [[medieval]]ism of [[Mallory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'' set the standard for their early style.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p=49}} In [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' words, they intended to "wage Holy warfare against the age".{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=97}}

[[File:The Red House, Bexleyheath.JPG|thumb|William Morris's [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in London designed by Philip Webb. Completed 1860, it is one of the most significant buildings of the Arts and Crafts Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/red-house#Overview National Trust, "Iconic Arts and Crafts home of William Morris"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Morris began experimenting with various crafts and designing [[furniture]] and [[interior design|interiors]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} He was personally involved in manufacture as well as design,{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} which was to be the hallmark of the Arts and Crafts movement. Ruskin had argued that the separation of the intellectual act of design from the manual act of physical creation was both socially and aesthetically damaging; Morris further developed this idea, insisting that no work should be carried out in his workshops before he had personally mastered the appropriate techniques and materials, arguing that "without dignified, creative human occupation people became disconnected from life".{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}}

[[File:Morris and Company Weaving at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|The weaving shed in Morris &amp; Co's factory at [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]], which opened in the 1880s]]

In 1861 Morris began making furniture and decorative objects commercially, modeling his designs on medieval styles and using bold forms and strong colors. His patterns were based on flora and fauna  and his products were inspired by the vernacular or domestic traditions of the British countryside. In order to display the beauty of the materials and the work of the craftsman, some were deliberately left unfinished, creating a rustic appearance. Truth to materials, structure and function became characteristic of the Arts and Crafts movement.

Unlike their counterparts in the United States, most Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain had strong, slightly incoherent, negative feelings about machinery. They thought of 'the craftsman' as free, creative, and working with his hands, 'the machine' as soulless, repetitive, and inhuman. These contrasting images derive in part from John Ruskin's (1819-1900) ''The Stones of Venice'', an architectural history of Venice that contains a powerful denunciation of modern industrialism to which Arts and Crafts designers returned again and again. Distrust for the machine lay behind the many little workshops that turned their backs on the industrial world around 1900, using preindustrial techniques to create what they called 'crafts.'

===Critique of industry===
William Morris shared Ruskin's critique of industrial society and at one time or another attacked the modern factory, the use of machinery, the division of labour, capitalism and the loss of traditional craft methods. But his attitude to machinery was inconsistent. He said at one point that production by machinery was "altogether an evil",&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but at others he was willing to commission work from manufacturers who were able to meet his standards with the aid of machines;&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Shankland, "William Morris - Designer", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that, in a "true society", where neither luxuries nor cheap trash were made, machinery could be improved and used to reduce the hours of labour.&lt;ref&gt;William Morris, "Useful Work versus Useless Toil", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiona MacCarthy says that "unlike later zealots like [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], William Morris had no practical objections to the use of machinery ''per se'' so long as the machines produced the quality he needed."{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|p=351}}

Morris insisted that the artist should be a craftsman-designer working by hand&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; and advocated a society of free craftspeople, such as he believed had existed during the Middle Ages. "Because craftsmen took pleasure in their work", he wrote, "the Middle Ages was a period of greatness the art of the common people. ... The treasures in our museums now are only the common utensils used in households of that age, when hundreds of medieval churches—each one a masterpiece—were built by unsophisticated peasants."&lt;ref name=mingei/&gt; Medieval art was the model for much Arts and Crafts design and medieval life, literature and building was idealised by the movement.

Morris's followers also had differing views about machinery and the factory system. [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee]], for example, a central figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement, said in 1888, that, "We do not reject the machine, we welcome it. But we would desire to see it mastered."&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashbee, C.&amp;nbsp;R., ''A Few Chapters on Workshop Construction and Citizenship'', London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; After unsuccessfully pitting his Guild and School of Handicraft guild against modern methods of manufacture, he acknowledged that "Modern civilization rests on machinery",&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but he continued to criticize the deleterious effects of what he called "mechanism", saying that "the production of certain mechanical commodities is as bad for the national health as is the production of slave-grown cane or child-sweated wares."&lt;ref&gt;"C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', New York and London: Garland, 1978, p.12 (Facsimile of the 1911 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Arthur Smith Benson]], on the other hand, had no qualms about adapting the Arts and Crafts style to metalwork produced under industrial conditions. (See quotation box.)

Morris and his followers believed the division of labour on which modern industry depended was undesirable, but the extent to which every design should be carried out by the designer was a matter for debate and disagreement. Not all Arts and Crafts artists carried out every stage in the making of goods themselves, and it was only in the twentieth century that that became essential to the definition of craftsmanship. Although Morris was famous for getting hands-on experience himself of many crafts (including weaving, dying, printing, calligraphy and embroidery), he did not regard the separation of designer and executant in his factory as problematic. Walter Crane, a close political associate of Morris's, took an unsympathetic view of the division of labour on both moral and artistic grounds, and strongly advocated that designing and making should come from the same hand. Lewis Foreman Day, a friend and contemporary of Crane's, as unstinting as Crane in his admiration of Morris, disagreed strongly with Crane. He thought that the separation of design and execution was not only inevitable in the modern world, but also that only that sort of specialisation allowed the best in design and the best in making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marshallcolman.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/designer-and-executant-argument-between.html Designer and Executant: An Argument Between Walter Crane and Lewis Foreman Day]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few of the founders of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] insisted that the designer should also be the maker. Peter Floud, writing in the 1950s, said that "The founders of the Society ... never executed their own designs, but invariably turned them over to commercial firms."&lt;ref name=floud&gt;Peter Floud, "The crafts then and now", ''The Studio'', 1953, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the designer should be the maker and the maker the designer derived "not from Morris or early Arts and Crafts teaching, but rather from the second-generation elaboration doctrine worked out in the first decade of [the twentieth] century by men such as [[W. R. Lethaby]]".&lt;ref name=floud/&gt;

===Socialism===
Many of the Arts and Crafts Movement designers were socialists, including Morris, [[T. J. Cobden Sanderson]], [[Walter Crane]], C.R.Ashbee, [[Philip Webb]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]] and [[A.H.Mackmurdo]].{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=109}} In the early 1880s Morris was spending more of his time on socialist propaganda than on designing and making.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=640-663}} Ashbee established a community of craftsmen, the Guild of Handicraft, in east London, later moving to [[Chipping Campden]].&lt;ref name=crawford/&gt; Those adherents who were not socialists, for example, [[Alfred Hoare Powell]],&lt;ref name=sarsby/&gt; advocated a more humane and personal relationship between employer and employee. [[Lewis Foreman Day]], a very successful and influential Arts and Crafts designer, was not a socialist either, despite his long friendship with Crane.

===Association with other reform movements===
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
In Britain the movement was associated with [[dress reform]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/victorian-dress-at-v-and-a/ V&amp;A, "Victorian Dress at the V&amp;A"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[ruralism]], the [[garden city movement]]&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''Anarchy and Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy 1860-1960'', London: National Portrait Gallery, 2014 {{ISBN|978 185514 484 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cecil Sharp|the folk-song revival]]. All were linked, in some degree, by the ideal of "the Simple Life".&lt;ref&gt;Fiona McCarthy. ''The Simple Life'', Lund Humphries, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In continental Europe the movement was associated with the preservation of national traditions in building, the applied arts, domestic design and costume.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Development==
Morris's designs quickly became popular, attracting interest when his company's work was exhibited at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London. Much of Morris &amp; Co's early work was for churches and Morris won important interior design commissions at [[St James's Palace]] and the [[South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). Later his work became popular with the middle and upper classes, despite his wish to create a democratic art, and by the end of the 19th century, Arts and Crafts design in houses and domestic interiors was the dominant style in Britain, copied in products made by conventional industrial methods.

The spread of Arts and Crafts ideas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries resulted in the establishment of many associations and craft communities, although Morris had little to do with them because of his preoccupation with socialism at the time. A hundred and thirty Arts and Crafts organisations were formed in Britain, most between 1895 and 1905.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=602|}}

In 1881, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], [[Mary Fraser Tytler]] and others initiated the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] to encourage the working classes, especially those in rural areas, to take up handicrafts under supervision, not for profit, but in order to provide them with useful occupations and to improve their taste. By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=120}}

In 1882, architect [[A.H.Mackmurdo]] formed the [[Century Guild of Artists|Century Guild]], a partnership of designers including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Herbert Horne]], Clement Heaton and [[Benjamin Creswick]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=591}}{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=115}}

In 1884, the [[Art Workers Guild]] was initiated by five young architects, [[William Lethaby]], [[Edward Schroeder Prior|Edward Prior]], [[Ernest Newton]], Mervyn Macartney and [[Gerald C. Horsley]], with the goal of bringing together fine and applied arts and raising the status of the latter. It was directed originally by [[George Blackall Simonds]]. By 1890 the Guild had 150 members, representing the increasing number of practitioners of the Arts and Crafts style.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=593}} It still exists.

The London department store [[Liberty &amp; Co.]], founded in 1875, was a prominent retailer of goods in the style and of the "[[artistic dress]]" favoured by followers of the Arts and Crafts movement.

In 1887 the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]], which gave its name to the movement, was formed with [[Walter Crane]] as president, holding its first exhibition in the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]], London, in November 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda, ''William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook'', New York, Portland House, 1989 {{ISBN|0-517-69260-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first show of contemporary decorative arts in London since the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]'s Winter Exhibition of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/arts/essays/Theoretical-Practical-Critical-Ideals/Of-The-Arts-And-Crafts-Movement-Part-4.html |title=Crane, Walter, "Of the Arts and Crafts Movement", in '&amp;#39;Ideals In Art: Papers Theoretical Practical Critical'&amp;#39;, George Bell &amp; Sons, 1905 |publisher=Chestofbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morris &amp; Co.]] was well represented in the exhibition with furniture, fabrics, carpets and embroideries. [[Edward Burne-Jones]] observed, "here for the first time one can measure a bit the change that has happened in the last twenty years".{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=596}} The society still exists as the Society of Designer Craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societyofdesignercraftsmen.org.uk/ |title=Society of Designer Craftsmen |publisher=Society of Designer Craftsmen |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.R.Ashbee]], a major late practitioner of the style in England, founded the [[Guild and School of Handicraft]] in the East End of London. The guild was a craft co-operative modelled on the medieval guilds and intended to give working men satisfaction in their craftsmanship. Skilled craftsmen, working on the principles of Ruskin and Morris, were to produce hand-crafted goods and manage a school for apprentices. The idea was greeted with enthusiasm by almost everyone except Morris, who was by now involved with promoting [[socialism]] and thought Ashbee's scheme trivial. From 1888 to 1902 the guild prospered, employing about 50 men. In 1902 Ashbee relocated the guild out of London to begin an experimental community in [[Chipping Campden]] in the [[Cotswolds]]. The guild's work is characterized by plain surfaces of hammered silver, flowing wirework and colored stones in simple settings. Ashbee designed jewellery and silver tableware. The guild flourished at Chipping Camden but did not prosper and was liquidated in 1908. Some craftsmen stayed, contributing to the tradition of modern craftsmanship in the area.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ashbee.htm |title=Utopia Britannica |publisher=Utopia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |title=Court Barn Museum |publisher=Courtbarn.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.F.A. Voysey]] (1857–1941) was an Arts and Crafts architect who also designed fabrics, tiles, ceramics, furniture and metalwork.  His style combined simplicity with sophistication. His wallpapers and textiles, featuring stylised bird and plant forms in bold outlines with flat colors, were used widely.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;

Morris's thought influenced the [[distributism]] of [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Joseph Nuttgens, London Review of Books, 13 May 2010 p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the nineteenth century, Arts and Crafts ideals had influenced architecture, painting, sculpture, graphics, illustration, book making and photography, domestic design and the decorative arts, including furniture and woodwork, stained glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Peter|title=Arts and Crafts Stained Glass|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-20970-9|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; leatherwork, lacemaking, embroidery, rug making and weaving, jewelry and metalwork, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]ing and ceramics.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; By 1910, there was a fashion for "Arts and Crafts" and all things hand-made. There was a proliferation of amateur handicrafts of variable quality&lt;ref&gt;"Arts and Crafts", ''Journal of the Royal Society of Arts'', Vol. 56, No. 2918, 23 October 1908, pp. 1023-1024&lt;/ref&gt; and of incompetent imitators who caused the public to regard Arts and Crafts as "something less, instead of more, competent and fit for purpose than an ordinary mass produced article."&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Rooke]], "The Craftsman and Education for Industry", in ''Four Papers Read by Members of the Arts &amp; Crafts Exhibition Society'', London: Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society held eleven exhibitions between 1888 and 1916. By the outbreak of war in 1914 it was in decline and faced a crisis. Its 1912 exhibition had been a financial failure.&lt;ref name=harrod&gt;Tania Harrod, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-300-07780-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While designers in continental Europe were making innovations in design and alliances with industry through initiatives such as the [[Deutsche Werkbund]] and new initiatives were being taken in Britain by the [[Omega Workshops]] and the [[Design in Industries Association]], the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, now under the control of an old guard, was withdrawing from commerce and collaboration with manufacturers into purist handwork and what Tania Harrod describes as "decommoditisation"&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Its rejection of a commercial role has been seen as a turning point in its fortunes.&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Nikolaus Pevsner in his book ''Pioneers of Modern Design'' presents the Arts and Crafts Movement as design radicals who influenced the modern movement, but failed to change and were eventually superseded by it.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;

===Later influences===
The British artist potter [[Bernard Leach]] brought to England many ideas he had developed in Japan with the social critic [[Yanagi Soetsu]] about the moral and social value of simple crafts; both were enthusiastic readers of Ruskin. Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which struck a chord with practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in ''A Potter's Book'', published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after the demise of the Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British [[Utility furniture]] of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html Designing Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515141802/http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html |date=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its main promoters, [[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]], chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas. He manufactured furniture in the Cotswold Hills, a region of Arts and Crafts furniture-making since Ashbee, and he was a member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. William Morris's biographer, [[Fiona MacCarthy]], detected the Arts and Crafts philosophy even behind the [[Festival of Britain]] (1951), the work of the designer [[Terence Conran]] (b. 1931)&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt; and the founding of the British [[Crafts Council]] in the 1970s.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=603}}

==Outside England==

===Ireland===
The movement spread to Ireland, representing an important time for the nation's cultural development, a visual counterpart to the literary revival of the same time&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Gordon Bowe, ''The Irish Arts and Crafts Movement (1886-1925)'', Irish Arts Review Yearbook, 1990-91, pp. 172-185&lt;/ref&gt; and was a publication of Irish nationalism. The Arts and Crafts use of stained glass was popular in Ireland, with [[Harry Clarke]] the best-known artist and also with [[Evie Hone]]. The architecture of the style is represented by the [[Honan Chapel]] (1916) in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the grounds of [[University College Cork]]. Other architects practicing in Ireland included Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (Heywood House in Co. Laois, Lambay Island and the [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]] in Dublin) and Frederick 'Pa' Hicks ([[Malahide Castle]] estate buildings and round tower). Irish Celtic motifs were popular with the movement in silvercraft, carpet design, book illustrations and hand-carved furniture.

The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]], (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: The People Designer - 1834–1904'' (Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement had an "extraordinary flowering" in Scotland where it was represented by the development of the '[[Glasgow Style]]' which was based on the talent of the [[Glasgow School of Art]].  Celtic revival took hold here, and motifs such as the Glasgow rose became popularised. [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the Glasgow School of Art were to influence others worldwide.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dublin"&gt;Nicola Gordon Bowe and Elizabeth Cumming, ''The Arts And Crafts Movements in Dublin and Edinburgh''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

In continental Europe, the revival and preservation of national styles was an important motive of Arts and Crafts designers; for example, in Germany, after unification in 1871 under the encouragement of the ''Bund für Heimatschutz'' (1897)&lt;ref&gt;Ákos Moravánszky, ''Competing visions: aesthetic invention and social imagination in Central European Architecture 1867-1918'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk'' founded in 1898 by Karl Schmidt; and in Hungary [[Károly Kós]] revived the vernacular style of [[Transylvania]]n building. In central Europe, where several diverse nationalities lived under powerful empires (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), the discovery of the vernacular was associated with the assertion of national pride and the striving for independence, and, whereas for Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain the ideal style was to be found in the medieval, in central Europe it was sought in remote peasant villages.&lt;ref&gt;Andrej Szczerski, "Central Europe", in Karen Livingstone and Linda Parry (eds.), ''International Arts and Crafts'', London: V&amp;A Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Till en liten vira.jpg|thumb|The Swedish artists [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Karin Bergöö Larsson]] were inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement when designing their home.]]
Widely exhibited in Europe, the Arts and Crafts style's simplicity inspired designers like [[Henry van de Velde]] and styles such as [[Art Nouveau]], the Dutch [[De Stijl]] group, [[Vienna Secession]], and eventually the [[Bauhaus]] style. Pevsner regarded the style as a prelude to [[Modernism]], which used simple forms without ornamentation.&lt;ref name="pevsner" &gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design'', Yale University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-300-10571-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Arts and Crafts activity in continental Europe was in [[Belgium]] in about 1890, where the English style inspired artists and architects including can de Velde, [[Gabriel Van Dievoet]], [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]] and a group known as ''[[La Libre Esthétique]]'' (Free Aesthetic).

Arts and Crafts products were admired in Austria and Germany in the early 20th century, and under their inspiration design moved rapidly forward while it stagnated in Britain.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=183}} The [[Wiener Werkstätte]], founded in 1903 by [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Koloman Moser]], was influenced by the Arts and Crafts principles of the "unity of the arts" and the hand-made. The [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Association of Craftsmen) was formed in 1907 as an association of artists, architects, designers, and industrialists to improve the global competitiveness of German businesses and became an important element in the development of [[modern architecture]] and industrial design through its advocacy of standardized production. However, its leading members, van de Velde and [[Hermann Muthesius]], had conflicting opinions about standardization. Muthesius believed that it was essential were Germany to become a leading nation in trade and culture. Van de Velde, representing a more traditional Arts and Crafts attitude, believed that artists would forever "protest against the imposition of orders or standardization," and that "The artist ... will never, of his own accord, submit to a discipline which imposes on him a canon or a type." {{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=189}}

In Finland, an idealistic artists' colony in [[Helsinki]] was designed by [[Herman Gesellius]], [[Armas Lindgren]] and [[Eliel Saarinen]],&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; who worked in the [[National Romantic style]], akin to the British [[Gothic Revival]].

In [[Hungary]], under the influence of Ruskin and Morris, a group of artists and architects, including [[Károly Kós]], [[Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch]] and Ede Toroczkai Wigand, discovered the [[folk art]] and vernacular architecture of [[Transylvania]]. Many of Kós's buildings, including those in the [[Budapest Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden|Budapest zoo]] and the [[Wekerle estate]] in the same city, show this influence.&lt;ref&gt;Széleky András, ''Kós Károly'', Budapest, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, [[Viktor Hartmann]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Yelena Polenova]] and other artists associated with [[Abramtsevo Colony]] sought to revive the quality of medieval Russian [[decorative arts]] quite independently from the movement in Great Britain.

In Iceland, [[Sölvi Helgason]]'s work shows Arts and Crafts influence.

In the United States, the Arts and Crafts style initiated a variety of attempts to reinterpret European Arts and Crafts ideals for Americans. These included the "Craftsman"-style architecture, furniture, and other decorative arts such as designs promoted by [[Gustav Stickley]] in his magazine, ''The Craftsman'' and designs produced on the Roycroft campus as publicized in Elbert Hubbard's ''The Fra''.  Both men used their magazines as a vehicle to promote the goods produced with the Craftsman workshop in Eastwood, NY and Elbert Hubbard's [[Roycroft]] campus in [[East Aurora, NY]]. A host of imitators of Stickley's furniture (the designs of which are often mislabelled the "[[American Craftsman|Mission Style]]") included three companies established by his brothers.

The terms ''[[American Craftsman]]'' or ''Craftsman style'' are often used to denote the style of architecture, interior design, and decorative arts that prevailed between the dominant eras of [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] in the USA, or approximately the period from 1910 to 1925.  The movement was particularly notable for the professional opportunities it opened up for women as artisans, designers and entrepreneurs who founded and ran, or were employed by, such successful enterprises as the [[Kalo Shops]], [[Rookwood Pottery]], and [[Tiffany Studios]]. In Canada, the term ''Arts and Crafts'' predominates, but ''Craftsman'' is also recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acam/hd_acam.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Monica Obniski, "The Arts and Crafts Movement in America" |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=1972-02-20 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Europeans tried to recreate the virtuous crafts being replaced by industrialisation, Americans tried to establish a new type of virtue to replace heroic craft production: well-decorated middle-class homes. They claimed that the simple but refined aesthetics of Arts and Crafts decorative arts would ennoble the new experience of industrial consumerism, making individuals more rational and society more harmonious. The American Arts and Crafts movement was the aesthetic counterpart of its contemporary political philosophy, [[progressivism]]. Characteristically, when the Arts and Crafts Society began in October 1897 in Chicago, it was at [[Hull House]], one of the first American [[settlement house]]s for social reform.&lt;ref name="Obniski"&gt;Obniski.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts and Crafts ideals disseminated in America through journal and newspaper writing were supplemented by societies that sponsored lectures.&lt;ref name="Obniski"/&gt; The first was organized in Boston in the late 1890s, when a group of influential architects, designers, and educators determined to bring to America the design reforms begun in Britain by William Morris; they met to organize an exhibition of contemporary craft objects. The first meeting was held on January 4, 1897, at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (MFA) in Boston to organize an exhibition of contemporary crafts. When craftsmen, consumers, and manufacturers realised the aesthetic and technical potential of the applied arts, the process of design reform in Boston started. Present at this meeting were General Charles Loring, Chairman of the Trustees of the MFA; [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] and [[Denman Ross]], collectors, writers and MFA trustees; Ross Turner, painter; [[Sylvester Baxter]], art critic for the ''Boston Transcript''; Howard Baker, [[Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr.|A.W. Longfellow Jr.]]; and Ralph Clipson Sturgis, architect.

The first American Arts and Crafts Exhibition began on April 5, 1897, at [[Copley Hall, Boston]]{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} featuring more than 1000 objects made by 160 craftsmen, half of whom were women. Some of the advocates of the exhibit were Langford Warren, founder of Harvard's School of Architecture; Mrs. Richard Morris Hunt; Arthur Astor Carey and Edwin Mead, social reformers; and [[Will H. Bradley]], graphic designer. The success of this exhibition resulted in the incorporation of The Society of Arts and Crafts (SAC), on June 28, 1897, with a mandate to "develop and encourage higher standards in the handicrafts." The 21 founders claimed to be interested in more than sales, and emphasized encouragement of artists to produce work with the best quality of workmanship and design. This mandate was soon expanded into a credo, possibly written by the SAC's first president, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Society was incorporated for the purpose of promoting artistic work in all branches of handicraft. It hopes to bring Designers and Workmen into mutually helpful relations, and to encourage workmen to execute designs of their own. It endeavors to stimulate in workmen an appreciation of the dignity and value of good design; to counteract the popular impatience of Law and Form, and the desire for over-ornamentation and specious originality. It will insist upon the necessity of sobriety and restraint, or ordered arrangement, of due regard for the relation between the form of an object and its use, and of harmony and fitness in the decoration put upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Beverly Kay. ''The Craftsman and the Critic: Defining Usefulness and Beauty in the Arts and Crafts-era Boston.'' University of Massachusetts Press, 2009. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also influential were the [[Roycroft]] community initiated by [[Elbert Hubbard]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[East Aurora, New York]], [[Joseph Marbella]],  utopian communities like [[Byrdcliffe Colony]] in [[Woodstock, New York]], and [[Rose Valley, Pennsylvania]], developments such as [[Mountain Lakes, New Jersey]], featuring clusters of bungalow and chateau homes built by Herbert J. Hapgood, and the contemporary studio craft style. [[Studio pottery]]—exemplified by the [[Grueby Faience Company]], [[Newcomb Pottery]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Marblehead Pottery]], [[Teco pottery]], [[Overbeck Sisters|Overbeck]] and [[Rookwood pottery]] and [[Mary Chase Perry Stratton]]'s [[Pewabic Pottery]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], as well as the art [[tile]]s made by [[Ernest A. Batchelder]] in [[Pasadena, California]], and idiosyncratic furniture of [[Charles Rohlfs]] all demonstrate the influence of Arts and Crafts.

====Architecture and Art====
The "[[Prairie School]]" of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[George Washington Maher]] and other architects in Chicago, the [[Country Day School movement]], the [[bungalow]] and [[ultimate bungalow]] style of houses popularized by [[Greene and Greene]], [[Julia Morgan]], and [[Bernard Maybeck]] are some examples of the American Arts and Crafts and [[American Craftsman]] style of architecture. Restored and landmark-protected examples are still present in America, especially in California in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], and the sections of other towns originally developed during the era and not experiencing post-war urban renewal. [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]], Prairie School, and the '[[California bungalow]]' styles of residential building remain popular in the United States today.

As theoreticians, educators, and prolific artists in mediums from printmaking to pottery and pastel, two of the most influential figures were [[Arthur Wesley Dow]] (1857-1922) on the East Coast and [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]] (1882-1954) in California.  Dow, who taught at [[Columbia University]] and founded the Ipswich Summer School of Art, published in 1899 his landmark ''Composition'', which distilled into a distinctly American approach the essence of Japanese composition, combining into a decorative harmonious amalgam three elements: simplicity of line, "notan" (the balance of light and dark areas), and symmetry of color.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Nancy E. and Jessie Poesch| title=Arthur Wesley Dow and American arts &amp; crafts| date=1999|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.| location=New York, NY|isbn=0810942178|pages=55–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His purpose was to create objects that were finely crafted and beautifully rendered.  His student de Lemos, who became head of the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], Director of the [[Stanford University]] Museum and Art Gallery, and Editor-in-Chief of the ''School Arts Magazine'', expanded and substantially revised Dow's ideas in over 150 monographs and articles for art schools in the United States and Britain.&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=4–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his many unorthodox teachings was his belief that manufactured products could express "the sublime beauty" and that great insight was to be found in the abstract "design forms" of pre-Columbian civilizations.

===Asia===
In Japan, [[Yanagi Sōetsu]], creator of the [[Mingei]] movement which promoted folk art from the 1920s onwards, was influenced by the writings of Morris and Ruskin.&lt;ref name=mingei&gt;Elisabeth Frolet, Nick Pearce, Soetsu Yanagi and Sori Yanagi, ''Mingei: The Living Tradition in Japanese Arts'', Japan Folk Crafts Museum/Glasgow Museums, Japan: Kodashani International, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Arts and Crafts movement in Europe, Mingei sought to preserve traditional crafts in the face of modernising industry.

The movement ... represents in some sense a revolt against the hard mechanical conventional life and its insensibility to beauty (quite another thing to ornament). It is a protest against that so-called industrial progress which produces shoddy wares, the cheapness of which is paid for by the lives of their producers and the degradation of their users. It is a protest against the turning of men into machines, against artificial distinctions in art, and against making the immediate market value, or possibility of profit, the chief test of artistic merit. It also advances the claim of all and each to the common possession of beauty in things common and familiar, and would awaken the sense of this beauty, deadened and depressed as it now too often is, either on the one hand by luxurious superfluities, or on the other by the absence of the commonest necessities and the gnawing anxiety for the means of livelihood; not to speak of the everyday uglinesses to which we have accustomed our eyes, confused by the flood of false taste, or darkened by the hurried life of modern towns in which huge aggregations of humanity exist, equally removed from both art and nature and their kindly and refining influences.

Many of the leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement were trained as architects (e.g. William Morris, A. H. Mackmurdo, C. R. Ashbee, W. R. Lethaby) and it was on building that the movement had its most visible and lasting influence.

[[Red House (London)|Red House]], in [[Bexleyheath]], London, designed for Morris in 1859 by architect [[Philip Webb]], exemplifies the early Arts and Crafts style, with its well-proportioned solid forms, wide porches, steep roof, pointed window arches, brick fireplaces and wooden fittings.  Webb rejected classical and other revivals of historical styles based on grand buildings, and based his design on British [[vernacular architecture]], expressing the texture of ordinary materials, such as stone and tiles, with an asymmetrical and picturesque building composition.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style09a/index.html |title=Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London suburb of [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]], built mainly in the 1880s and 1890s, has about 360 Arts and Crafts style houses and was once famous for its [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]] residents. Several [[Almshouse]]s were built in the Arts and Crafts style, for example, [[Whiteley Village]], Surrey, built between 1914 and 1917, with over 280 buildings, and the [[Dyers Almshouses]], Sussex, built between 1939 and 1971. [[Letchworth Garden City]], the first garden city, was inspired by Arts and Crafts ideals.&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt; The first houses were designed by [[Richard Barry Parker|Barry Parker]] and [[Raymond Unwin]] in the [[vernacular]] style popularized by the movement and the town became associated with high-mindedness and simple living. The sandal-making workshop set up by [[Edward Carpenter]] moved from Yorkshire to Letchworth Garden City and [[George Orwell]]'s jibe about "every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, 'Nature Cure' quack, pacifist, and feminist in England" going to a socialist conference in Letchworth has become famous.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''The Road to Wigan Pier''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garden design==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
[[Gertrude Jekyll]] applied Arts and Crafts principles to garden design. She worked with the English architect, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], for whose projects she created numerous landscapes, and who designed her home ''[[Munstead Wood]]'', near Godalming in Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;Tankard, Judith B. and Martin A. Wood. Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood. Bramley Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Jekyll created the gardens for ''Bishopsbarns'',&lt;ref name="HEBishopsbarns"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1256793 |desc=Bishopsbarns|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the home of York architect [[Walter Brierley]], an exponent of the Arts and Crafts movement and known as the "Lutyens of the North".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/goddards-house-and-garden/documents/download-the-goddards-the-art-of-design-leaflet.pdf |title=The Art of Design |website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden for Brierley's final project, ''[[Goddards House and Garden|Goddards]]'' in York, was the work of George Dillistone, a gardener who worked with Lutyens and Jekyll at ''[[Castle Drogo]]''.&lt;ref name="HE1000452"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1000452 |desc=Castle Drogo park and garden|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Goddards'' the garden incorporated a number of features that reflected the arts and crafts style of the house, such as the use of hedges and [[herbaceous border]]s to divide the garden into a series of outdoor rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/goddards-house-and-garden/features/the-gardens-at-goddards- |title=The Gardens at Goddards|website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable Arts and Crafts garden is ''[[Hidcote Manor Garden]]'' designed by [[Lawrence Johnston]] which is also laid out in a series of outdoor rooms and where, like ''Goddards'', the landscaping becomes less formal further away from the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hidcote/features/the-garden-at-hidcote |title=The Garden at Hidcote|website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Arts and Crafts gardens include ''[[Hestercombe House|Hestercombe Gardens]]'', ''[[Lytes Cary|Lytes Cary Manor]]'' and the gardens of some of the architectural examples of arts and crafts buildings (listed above).

==Art education==
Morris's ideas were adopted by the [[New Education Movement]] in the late 1880s, which incorporated handicraft teaching in schools at Abbotsholme (1889) and [[Bedales]] (1892), and his influence has been noted in the social experiments of [[Dartington Hall]] during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|MacCarthy 1994|p=603}}

Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain were critical of the government system of art education based on design in the abstract with little teaching of practical craft. This lack of craft training also caused concern in industrial and official circles, and in 1884 a Royal Commission (accepting the advice of William Morris) recommended that art education should pay more attention to the suitability of design to the material in which it was to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf Charles Harvey and Jon Press, "William Morris and the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction", ''Journal of the William Morris Society''  11.1, August 1994, pp. 31-34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105132211/http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf |date=2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first school to make this change was the [[Birmingham Art School|Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts]], which "led the way in introducing executed design to the teaching of art and design nationally (working in the material for which the design was intended rather than designing on paper). In his external examiner's report of 1889, Walter Crane praised Birmingham School of Art in that it 'considered design in relationship to materials and usage.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://fineart.ac.uk/institutions.php?idinst=9 "Birmingham Institute of Art and Design" fineart.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of Edward Taylor, its headmaster from 1877 to 1903, and with the help of [[Henry Payne (artist)|Henry Payne]] and [[Joseph Southall]], the Birmingham School became a leading Arts-and-Crafts centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Everitt|first=Sian|title=Keeper of Archives|url=http://fineart.ac.uk/institutions.php?idinst=9|work=Birmingham Institute of Art and Design|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other local authority schools also began to introduce more practical teaching of crafts, and by the 1890s Arts and Crafts ideals were being disseminated by members of the Art Workers Guild into art schools throughout the country. Members of the Guild held influential positions: Walter Crane was director of the [[Manchester School of Art]] and subsequently the [[Royal College of Art]]; F.M. Simpson, [[Robert Anning Bell]] and C.J.Allen were respectively professor of architecture, instructor in painting and design, and instructor in sculpture at [[Liverpool School of Art]]; Robert Catterson-Smith, the headmaster of the Birmingham Art School from 1902-1920, was also an AWG member; [[W. R. Lethaby]] and [[George Frampton]] were inspectors and advisors to the [[London County Council]]'s (LCC) education board and in 1896, largely as a result of their work, the LCC set up the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and made them joint principals.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; Until the formation of the Bauhaus in Germany, the Central School was regarded as the most progressive art school in Europe.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=179}} Shortly after its foundation, the [[Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts]] was set up on Arts and Crafts lines by the local borough council.

As head of the Royal College of Art in 1898, Crane tried to reform it along more practical lines, but resigned after a year, defeated by the bureaucracy of the [[Board of Education]], who then appointed Augustus Spencer to implement his plan. Spencer brought in Lethaby to head its school of design and several members of the Art Workers' Guild as teachers.&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'', London: University of London Press, 1970.  {{ISBN|0 340 09420 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years after reform, a committee of inquiry reviewed the RCA and found that it was still not adequately training students for industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Departmental Committee on the Royal College of Art'', HMSO, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; In the debate that followed the publication of the committee's report, C.R.Ashbee published a highly critical essay, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art'', in which he called for the system of art education to be completely dismantled and for the crafts to be learned in state-subsidised workshops instead.&lt;ref&gt;C.R.Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Foreman Day]], an important figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, took a different view in his dissenting report to the committee of inquiry, arguing for greater emphasis on principles of design against the growing orthodoxy of teaching design by direct working in materials. Nevertheless, the Arts and Crafts ethos thoroughly pervaded British art schools and persisted, in the view of the historian of art education, Stuart MacDonald, until after the Second World War.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt;

'''Civilité''' type (in French: "Caractères de civilité") is a [[typeface]] invented in 1557 by the French engraver [[Robert Granjon]]. These characters imitate [[Blackletter#French cursiva|French cursiva]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} letters of the [[Renaissance]].

==History==
[[image:Civilite type.JPG|right|200px|thumb| Civilité types used in a French courtesy book (1785)]]
The first book in the new type was ''Dialogue de la vie et de la mort'', a French version of Innocenzo Ringhieri's dialogue, in the dedication of which Granjon explains his purpose in cutting the new design. He calls the typeface "lettres françaises" and suggests that France like other nations should have a type based on the national hand; his model was contemporary handwriting. The popular name for the type came from the titles of two early books in which it was used: Erasmus's ''La Civilité puerile'', Jean Bellère, Antwerp, 1559, and ''La Civile honesteté pour les enfans'', R. Breton, Paris, 1560. "Civilité" meant "good manners" and it was thought an advantage that children should learn to read from a book printed in a type resembling current handwriting. Between 1557 and 1562 Granjon printed some 20 books in this type. Two other Paris printers had typefaces made that were very similar and Granjon himself supplied his version to Guillaume Silvius and to Christophe Plantin at Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A. F. (1966) ''Type Designs''; 3rd ed. London: Andre Deutsch; pp. 138-40&lt;/ref&gt;

They were mostly employed to print books in [[Flanders]], [[Holland]],&lt;ref&gt;In the Netherlands the type was more popular than in France but mostly in a form based on the contemporary Flemish hand which was devised by Ameet Tavernier of Bailleul by 1559.--Johnson (1966), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Vlacq, Michiel et al. (1607) ''Den nieuwen verbeterden Lust-Hof, gheplant vol uytgelesene, eerlijcke, amoreuse ende vrolijcke ghesanghen''. [with:] (''Bruylofts Bancket''. Verghemaeckt door M[ichiel]. V[acq]. binnen der Goude verriert met ... copere figusren. ... Den derden druck gebetert en veel vermeerdert''. Amstelredam: Dirck Pietersz&lt;/ref&gt; [[England]], and [[France]]. In the latter, they were used until the second half of the 19th century to print children's lesson-books teaching civility and manners from which the type got its name.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Norbert, 1978: ''The Civilizing Process: a History of Manners''. Urizen Books, New York. p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Civilité type did not win great popularity in France although used occasionally at all periods. Another version of civilité were used in one book printed in 1597 by Claude Micard, and two others in two books printed by [[Jean de Tournes (1539–1615)|Jean de Tournes]] in 1581 and 1598. In the mid 19th century Louis Perrin of Lyons printed J. Soulary's ''Sonnets humouristiques'' in civilité. Granjon's experiment cannot be said to have been a success: one of the grave disadvantages was that many ligatures were required and some letters had more than one variant.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A. F. (1966) ''Type Designs''; 3rd ed. London: Andre Deutsch; pp. 138-40&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article is concerned with cultural resources in the widest sense: for traditional, archaeological and historic culture specifically, also see [[cultural heritage management]]''

In the broadest sense, '''cultural resources management''' ('''CRM''') is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources, such as [[the arts]] and [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of [[archaeology]].  Cultural resources management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as [[urban culture]], rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.

However, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with [[heritage management]]. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context. The term is, "used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws." &lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural resources include both physical assets such as [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s and also [[intangible culture]] such as [[folklore]] and interpretative arts, such as [[storytelling]] and [[drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Research/det/glossary_abbreviations.htm UK definition of cultural sector]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of [[museum]]s, [[art museum|galleries]], [[theatre]]s etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group.  [[Cultural tourism]] is a significant sector of the tourism industry.

At a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as [[language]]s in danger of extinction, [[public education]], the ethos or operation of [[multiculturalism]], and promoting access to cultural resources.  The [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] is an attempt by the [[United Nations]] to identify exemplars of intangible culture.

==Background==
Cultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment/conservational movement in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources. The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, commonly known as the Moss-Bennett Act, helped to fuel the creation of CRM, while creating “growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government, academia, and private sector.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the [[Antiquities Act]], but it was not until the 1970s when the term “cultural resources” was coined by the National Park Service. This term came into more popular usage after two meetings in 1974: the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Following these conferences, the National Park Service (NPS) defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being:

“Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems, both living and dead, that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture…[They] include but are not limited to sites, structures, districts, objects, and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples, cultures, and human activities and events, either in the present or in the past. Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural resources management applied to heritage management==
{{main article|Cultural heritage management}}
'''Cultural resources management''' in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential, the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts, and the culture of indigenous people.  The subject developed from initiatives in [[rescue archaeology]], sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people, and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage.

In the 1970s, archaeologists created the term "cultural resource management" as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources:&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historic properties (as listed or eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]])
* Older properties that may have cultural value, but may or may not be eligible for the National Register
* Historic properties that have cultural value beyond their historicity
* Archeological graves and cultural items
* Shipwrecks
* Museum collections
* Historical documents
* Religious sites
* Religious practices
* Cultural use of natural resources
* Folklife, tradition, and other social institutions
* Theater groups, orchestras, and other community cultural amenities

A significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the United States and United Kingdom is conducted on sites under threat of development. In the US, such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~dap/daddy/daddy.html "Who's my Daddy? Who's my Mommy?] Results of a Poll on the Origins of Private-Sector CRM," by David A. Phillips, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization exists to support the practice of CRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acra-crm.org Web site of the American Cultural Resources Association]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum]]s, besides being popular tourist attractions, often play roles in conservation of, and research on, threatened sites, including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction.

==National Register eligibility==
In the United States, a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review: CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This process commonly entails one or more [[archaeological field survey]]s.

==Careers in CRM==
Cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines. The general education of most involved in CRM includes, but is not limited to, sociology, archaeology, architectural history, cultural anthropology, social and cultural geography, and other fields in the social sciences.

In the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices. One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically, Native American resources.&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] (ACHP), or the [[state historic preservation office]] (SHPO) Beyond these choices, one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies, housing agencies, social service agencies, local museums, libraries, or educational institutions. Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians (see [[shovelbum]]) to principal investigators, project archaeologists, historic preservationists, and laboratory work.  One could also become a part of an advocacy organization, such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 241, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
It is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not. The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be “interpreted in different ways so that the significance… may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue that arises among scholars is that “protection does not necessarily mean preservation.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects. Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of cultural organizations==
The vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives, by organizations such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416204313/http://www.aandb.org.uk/ Arts and Business] which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations.  Some universities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 BA in Cultural Resources Management at Dundalk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207233207/http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmu.ac.uk/faculties/humanities/pg/ma/ecp_course_overview.jsp MA in European Cultural Planning at De Montfort]&lt;/ref&gt; now offer vocational degrees.

The management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in [[archaeology]], [[ethnography]] and [[history]].  The broader subject is also underpinned by research in [[sociology]] and [[culture studies]].

==Anthropology==
{{main article|Cultural anthropology}}
Understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples (Indigenous or not) is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources.

==Cultural resources policies==
Cultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalpolicies.net/ Compendium of Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial, particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world.  The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial.  On the other hand, traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism, performance of traditional dances, and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry.  Popular culture can also be an important economic asset.

'''''Empty''''' is a cult, [[Australian]] "creative" magazine, concerned largely with printed design work, photography, illustration and film, created for the professional creative community.

The magazine is published by [[Sydney]]-based [[Design is Kinky]] studio, curators of the [[Semi-Permanent]] design festival, a fixture in design culture's global landscape, which occurs annually in Australia.

The magazine acts largely as a gallery of artwork, both domestic and international. It also features cultural commentary and interviews with artists, animators, other magazines, and so on. Notable interviewees have included [[Mark Andrews (writer)|Mark Andrews]], head of story on [[The Incredibles]] (cover story, issue 2, late-2004) and [[Dan Houser]] of [[Rockstar Games]] (issue 3, early-2005). 

''Empty'' was launched in April 2004 and is published somewhat arbitrarily, but usually occurs on a bi-monthly basis.

The magazine features little to no advertising whatsoever.

Current editor is [[Andrew Johnstone]], creator of ''Empty'' and the above-mentioned [[Design is Kinky]] and [[Semi-Permanent]].

The magazine enjoys newsstand distribution, but at this time is distributed only within Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14682">A '''fixed book price agreement''' (FBPA) is a form of [[resale price maintenance]] applied to books. It commonly takes the form of an agreement between [[publisher]]s and [[bookseller]]s which set the prices at which [[book]]s were to be sold to the public. An example of an FBPA was the former [[Net Book Agreement]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

The key idea of an FBPA is to promote [[non-price competition]] between booksellers in order to promote the sale of little-known, difficult or otherwise culturally interesting books rather than catering only to [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] readers. To do so, an FBPA is deemed to ensure that the booksellers that provide the corresponding [[presale services]] are able to recoup their higher costs with a guaranteed margin on blockbusters.

A related case is the existence of a fixed book price law (FBPL), where the book prices are kept fixed by law. An example of an FBPL is the current [[Lang Law]] in [[France]]. 

An FBPA/FBPL, with various provisos, has existed in some developed countries since the beginning of the twentieth century. It remains in force in roughly half the countries of the [[European Union]] as well as in some other countries.

== Principle ==

The core idea of the FBP (either by agreement or law) is that a dense network of well-stocked, high quality bookshops is a necessary condition for the publication of a large variety of books, large variety itself deemed desirable for the cultural life of a country {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|p=742}}. Such bookshops have additional costs that are not borne by discounters, who just stock their shelves with the current blockbusters. Since the latter represent a large proportion of book sales, price competition between high-quality bookshops and discounters reduces bookshops' profitability. 

The FBP allows the publisher to mitigate this competition and thereby guarantees a sufficient margin for high-quality bookshops to operate.

Historically, most countries with a significant book industry have known an FBPA since the 19th century. The development of [[competition policy]] in the 1970s led to a wave of repeals of those agreements (Australia 1972, Sweden 1974, UK 1995) at a time when any form of [[resale price maintenance]] was seen with much suspicion. Conversely, other countries (Spain 1975, Greece 1997, Italy 2005) enacted laws making the FBP mandatory.

The following table gives an overview of the prevalence of FBP in rich countries (sources: European Booksellers Federation&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090713220757/http://www.ebf-eu.org/papers/Book%20Trade%20in%20Europe%20updated010206.doc&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|p=749}}).

== Assessment ==

The assessment of the FBP is a controversial one. On the one hand, most economists ({{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|}} for an overview, {{Harv|Ringstad|2004}} for a specific discussion) are skeptical of the cultural merits of the FBP and underline its distorting effect. On the other hand, other economists ({{Harv|Rouet|2007}} on the French case, {{Harv|Backhaus|Hansen|2003}} on the German case) and the book industry{{who?|date=December 2012}} argue that the FBP is the only tool that allows difficult, high-brow, and culturally significant books{{clarification needed|date=December 2012}} to be published. Therefore, they say, the distortion should account for the much larger cultural [[externality|externalities]] of meaningful cultural works. As {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|p=743}} put it,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural merits ascribed to such agreements have almost reached mythical proportions. No public debate in Europe on the cultural value of books is complete without a discussion of the FBP.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Theoretical framework ===

Several [[industrial organization]] frameworks can be applied to assess the consequences of the FBP. 

The most commonly cited result is {{Harv|Telser|1960}}. This paper states that when two retailer can engage on [[tangible presale services]], that is can undertake an unobservable costly effort that increases the demand for both of them (advertisement, sessions with authors, thematic weeks), each one has an incentive to [[Free rider problem|free-ride]] on the other retailer's effort by setting its price slightly below his competitor (which cannot correspondingly cut his price, since he supports the cost of a higher level of effort). This leads to a suboptimal (too low, from the publisher's point of view) level of aggregate effort. By cancelling the possibility of price competition, a FBP makes impossible this kind of opportunistic behaviour and induces both retailers to compete in services.

According to {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|}}, the main idea of FBP (keeping best seller prices high in order to subsidize the sale of less popular books) is unconvincing for several reasons: 

* the market subsidizes new books per se, in order to get a best seller
* there is no guarantee that the subsidy will occur anyway. In fact, the authors suggest that both publishers and booksellers have an incentive not to carry it out
* if less popular books are less price elastic than popular books, monopoly profits in them are higher
* even if the subsidy works, there is no accounting for what or how it's done
* even if the subsidy works, it's not clear that it's worth the price distortion

=== Empirical assessment ===

{{Harv|Ringstad|2004}} and {{Harv|Fishwick|2005}} provide empirical assessments of FBP comparing countries with and without a FBP (Nordic countries for the former, France and the UK for the latter). According to these authors, the two main effects of a repeal of a FBP is a displacement of small [[independent bookstore]]s by larger chain outlets and a decrease in the price of bestsellers, compensated by an increase of the price of all other books.

{{Harv|Ringstad|2004}} notices that the level of book prices and the number of published titles evolves in a similar manner in all Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland) although only Norway has a FBP and Finland belongs to a different linguistic group. In Denmark (FBP since 2000), however, book prices have increased one-third quicker than general inflation since 1985 and the number of books sold has fallen by two-thirds, a sharp contrast with Sweden and Norway, which belong to the same linguistic group. His conclusion, supported by elements from {{Harv|Fjeldstad|2001}}, is that the effects of a FBP are less than both proponents and critics make them, and that other institutional agreements (e.g. only pure bookshops can carry textbooks in Norway) better explain the evolution of the book markets in those countries. 

According to {{Harv|Fishwick|2005}}, the ending of the FBPA in the UK (1995) did not lead to a sharp decrease of the number of bookshops, rather to a displacement of small, independent bookshops by big-chain outlets. He notices however that the former stayed in place where a quality-sensitive demand existed, and that competition between bookshops spurred a reduction of operational costs thanks to better logistics and collection management (an argument also found in {{Harv|Ringstad|2004}}). In a counterfactual manner, {{Harv|Rouet|2007}} shows that in France, the FBP helped to maintain a dense network of independent bookshops, reined in the deployment of chain bookstores and spurred supermarkets to boost their offer of books. Fishwick also shows that while the number of published titles increases as fast as in France, there is no sign of an overall increase of book prices. He shows however that this stability hides a strong distributive effect. Comparison with France show that the FBP leads to an increase of the price of bestsellers relative to non-FBP markets and a decrease of low-selling or long-selling books. He argues that the assessment of this effect is difficult, since the relation between the (un)popularity of a book and its cultural value is unclear, whereas consumers of low-selling books are, on average, wealthier than consumers of bestsellers (making a FBP a subsidy of wealthier people by poorer people).

The book contains comprehensive information about ancient history, culture, traditions, ethnographic characteristics of Azeri nation, including more than thousand modern photos and available in seven languages; Azeri, English, Russian, French, Italian, German and Arabian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heydar-aliyev-foundation.org/en/content/view/77/510/A-ceremony-of-presentation-of-the-publication-%E2%80%9CAzerbaijan%E2%80%9D-developed-as-part-of-a-project-by-the-Heydar-Aliyev-Foundation-was-held|title=A ceremony of presentation of the publication “Azerbaijan” developed as part of a project by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation was held|website=http://heydar-aliyev-foundation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances and evaluation==
The foundation has according to a 2009 EurasiaNet article received some criticism for not being transparent about the financial sources, criticism the government and the [[New Azerbaijan Party]] has called slander.&lt;ref name= versailles/&gt;

In 2010, France awarded its [[Légion d'Honneur]] to Aliyeva, with French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] citing her "outstanding service and loyalty to France."&lt;ref name=honneur2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Zamejc|first=Anna|title=Azerbaijani First Lady Given Prestigious French Award|url= http://www.rferl.org/content/Azerbaijani_First_Lady_Given_Prestigious_French_Award/1960898.html |publisher=Radio Free Europe|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ibn al-Bawwāb''' was a Persian [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] and [[illuminated manuscripts|illuminator]] who lived during the time of the [[Buyid dynasty]]. He most likely died around 1022 AD in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/280693/Ibn-al-Bawwab|title=Ibn al-Bawwāb brief bio|accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ibn al-Bawwāb was from a poor family.  His name literally translates as the “son of the doorkeeper.”  He was trained in law and theology, was very devout and is said to have been able to recite the [[Quran|Qurʾān]] from memory.&lt;ref&gt;"Ibn al-Bawwab" [Biography], ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ibn-al-Bawwab Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied calligraphy with the daughter of [[Ibn Muqla]]. He was fluent in all six scripts and refined them. He achieved fame in his own lifetime and was readily recognised by his long beard. His students carried his improved style through to succeeding generations of calligraphers.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, G., ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World'',  Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, Ibn al-Bawwāb reputedly produced 64 copies of the Qurʾān. One of the most beautiful in the rayḥānī script is in the [[Laleli Mosque]] in Istanbul, and another is in the [[Chester Beatty Library]] in Dublin, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbl.ie/Collections/The-Islamic-Collection/The-Qur-an-Collection.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; a gift of the Ottoman Sultan [[Selim I]] (1470–1512). Ibn al-Bawwāb was recognized as a master in his own time; his school of calligraphy lasted until Baghdad fell to the [[Mongols]] more than two centuries after his death.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

==Works==
One of his greatest achievements was the perfection of the [[al-Khatt al-Mansub]] (literally, ''the well-proportioned script'') style of [[Islamic calligraphy]]. He also contributed to the development of many of the early cursive scripts including [[rayḥānī]], [[Naskh (script)|naskh]], [[Tawqi|tawqīʿ]] and [[muhaqqaq]].&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; Only one of Q'ran by al-Bawwab is known to have survived. It is the earliest extant manuscript written in cursive script on paper. &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, F (ed.), ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World'',  Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18859">An '''Inquisition post mortem''' (abbreviated to '''Inq.p.m.''' or '''i.p.m.''', and formerly known as an '''escheat''')&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Lyte, Introduction, uses the term "inquisition post mortem" and states they were "formerly known as 'escheats'". Modern academic usage favours the term Inq.p.m., see e.g. the Winchester University project, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin, meaning "(inquisition) after death") is an English medieval record of the death, estate and heir of one of the king's [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]], made for royal fiscal purposes. The process of making such inquisition was effected by the royal escheators in each county where the deceased held land. The earliest inq.p.m. was made in 1236, in the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216–1272), and the practice ceased c.1640, at the start of the Civil War, and was finally abolished by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]], which ended the feudal system.

==Purpose==
The escheators were ordered by a writ from the king's [[Court of Chancery|chancery]] to investigate the deaths of tenants-in-chief in order to assess what monetary value was due to the king from his so-called feudal incidents, comprising for example feudal relief, wardships, and marriages. Such revenues which resulted from the deaths of his tenants-in-chief formed a significant proportion of the [[History of the English fiscal system|mediaeval royal revenues]]. The feudal due which was payable to the king on the inheritance of the lands by the tenant's heir is termed a [[Feudal relief|relief]], from Latin ''levo, levare'' (to lift-up), plus ''re'' (again), signifying the process of re-elevating the heir to the honourable position of the deceased, as a [[lord of the manor]] and tenant-in-chief. The scale of reliefs payable to the king by his tenants-in-chief who held under the [[feudal land tenure]] of [[English feudal barony|barony]] had become a fixed sum under clause two of [[Magna Carta]] (1215), but the king nevertheless needed to know who the heir was so payment of the relief could be demanded. If the tenant-in-chief was found to have no heir, for example if he was unmarried or childless, the lands held would "escheat" (i.e. revert to the [[demesne]] of the king) to be re-granted as a valuable reward to a favoured courtier or official, or sold for cash proceeds. This aspect of the process was the origin of their former appellation by early Victorian antiquarians of "escheats". If the tenant-in-chief left a minor son as heir, that is to say one aged under 21, his wardship escheated likewise to the king, who was able to sell or award his marriage to a third party. Generally the marriages of such wards were purchased by wealthy men as husbands for their own daughters, and a marriage contract was drawn up at the direction of the bride's father which [[entail]]ed the ward's future estate onto the progeny of the marriage. Thus the wealthy purchaser's grandchildren became the inheritors of the ward's estate. If the deceased tenant-in-chief left a minor daughter, that is to say one aged under 14, or one younger who was not contracted in marriage, as sole heiress (or more as joint-heiresses), her wardship and marriage likewise escheated to the king. Such wardships constituted a significant part of the royal revenues in mediaeval times.

==Avoidance measures==
The practice arose amongst tenants-in-chief of transferring the legal title in their lands to [[feoffee|feoffees to uses]], which effectively established trusts enabling the tenant-in-chief to continue to use the land and its revenues, but to avoid being officially recognised in law as the legal holder. This exempted him from the scope of the Inquisition post mortem, as the legal holders were effectively an immortal [[corporation]] one or two of whose constituent feoffees could on occasion die, only to be replaced by others. Such avoidance devices were apparently tolerated by the crown for a considerable time, yet on the accession of [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] (1485–1509)
the king's ancient right to his feudal incidents was enforced with determination and ruthlessness.

==Procedure==
For an heir to inherit his paternal lands a formal and lengthy standard procedure had to be completed, only at the end of which he could "sue out his [[livery of seisin]]" (i.e. gain physical possession of his inheritance), so it was in his best interest to get the process started as soon as possible after the death. He himself, or his relatives if a minor, would generally inform the king's chancery that the death had occurred,&lt;ref&gt;That the heir himself generally sued for a writ of ''diem clausit extremum'' is noted by Fleming, Peter &amp; Wood, Michael, in Gloucestershire's Forgotten Battle: Nibley Green 1470&lt;/ref&gt; and this would prompt the production of a writ by the chancery under the king's [[Great Seal of the Realm|great seal]] addressed to the various escheators of the counties in which the deceased held lands, known as a writ ''diem clausit extremum''.  This writ, the earliest identified example of which dates from 1254,&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Lyte&lt;/ref&gt; informed the escheator that the king had been informed (''quia datum est nobis intelligi'' ("because it has been given to us to know")) that the tenant-in-chief named had "closed his last day", as the Latin phrase by which the writ has become known may be translated, and that he was ordered to hold an inquisition ''post mortem'', and to send the resultant report back to the chancery, with his seal and with the writ ''diem clausit extremum'' sewn onto it. On receipt of the writ the escheator requested the sheriff of the county concerned to empanell a jury made up of local freeholders, that is to say persons of social standing, who could be relied upon to provide the standard information required in accurate form. Such information, termed 'the jurors' "verdict"' &lt;ref&gt;Called a verdict in contemporary correspondence re the Inq.p.m. of William Paston (d.1444), see Winchester University case study 2: Informing the Escheator&lt;/ref&gt; comprised:
*Date of death
*Name of heir
*Age of heir
*Name of manors held in chief
*Name of manors held from other persons
*Extent (i.e. area/size) of manors
*Annual value of manors
*Nature of [[feudal land tenure|feudal tenure]]s &amp; services due
The most immediate order in the writ however was that requiring the escheator to take control of all the deceased's [[demesne]] lands, i.e. those which had not been [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] to [[Mesne lord|mesne tenant]]s but had been managed in-hand directly by the deceased and his household officials. All revenues resulting from such lands whilst in the hands of the escheator had to be audited (i.e. accounted for before the Barons of the Exchequer) periodically at the treasury.

The end result of the inquisition would be one of the three following, depending on what the jury reported:
*If the vassal had died with an heir who was of age, then a fine was paid to the king for the right of the heir to inherit, namely his [[feudal relief|relief]].
*If the heir was underage, that is to say under 21 for a male and under 14 for a female, then the heir and the lands were placed into royal [[wardship]].
*If there was no heir, then the lands [[escheat]]ed (i.e. reverted) to the king's royal [[demesne]].

==Form of permanent record==
Inquisitions post mortem (or "escheats") were recorded on two duplicate sheets of parchment. The original return was held in the records of the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], to which department the escheator had made his original return, the other by the [[treasury]], which had caused a copy to be made for fiscal purposes, in order to verify the escheator's accounts&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, op.cit., para 5&lt;/ref&gt; which were presented to the treasury periodically. Unlike some other series of records, they were not historically sewn together as rolls, but in modern times the parchment sheets have been bound in files with covers, and are today held at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] in Kew. The documents formerly comprising the chancery records are classified under the initial letter "C", whilst those from the exchequer bear the class letter "E". After the establishment of the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]] in 1540 a copy of the Inq.p.m. was also sent to that court, and these records also survive at the National Archives classified as "WARD 7". When an Inq.p.m. had been held not as a result of a writ from chancery but under the escheator's own authority, the verdict was sent to the exchequer only.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, para.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value as historical source documents==
Inquisitions post mortem form a valuable source for historians and genealogists, as they not only detail the familial relationships of many of the English nobility and gentry, but also provide information on the history of individual [[manor]]s, including their size and forms of tenure by which they were held.&lt;ref name=Lyon478&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; They thus constitute "one of the most important sources for the social and economic history of mediaeval England".&lt;ref&gt;Winchester University, stated in several passages&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide summaries and terms of settlements made during the lifetime of the deceased, for example settlement to feoffees, the original copy of which has rarely survived.

==Example==
The following example of the abstracted Latin inq.p.m. of William Pagam (d.1422), published in 1995 as no. 932 in vol. 20, 6–10 Henry V, of the ''Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem'', illustrates many common elements:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Writ 24 July 1422. Hampshire. Inquisition. Alton, 26 Aug.
He held of the king in-chief in his demesne as of fee the manor of Drayton, annual value 8 marks, for 6s. 8d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas and providing at his own expense for 15 days a hobbler to keep the castle in time of war. By an indenture of 26 Oct. 1418, shown to the jurors, William Tauk, Robert Monkeston and Thomas Welegh, who were seised in their demesne as of fee, granted the manor of Pury, a messuage, carucate and 13 acres meadow, 40 a. pasture and 20 a. wood at "la Bere juxta Southwyke" as lands and tenements in Pury, Badley, "Colvyle", "Holdmede", and "Bere", to William Pagam and his wife Agnes, who survives, for life of Agnes, remainder to William and his heirs in fee simple. The manor of Pury, annual value 6 marks, is held of the king in chief, service unknown. The messuage, carucate, arable, meadow, pasture and wood at "le Bere" annual value 40s. are held of the king in chief for 7s. 4d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas. He died on 15 July last. Philip Pagam is his son and next heir, aged 6 years and more. C 138/63, no.26A"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here the manor of Drayton is held by the [[Feudal land tenure|feudal military tenure]] of [[castle-guard]]; the manor of Pury had been transferred to feoffees to uses, and was re-granted by them in 1418 back to William and his wife for their uses under trust.

==Calendars of Inq.p.m's.==
Printed [[Calendar (archives)|calendars]] (abstracted summaries) of almost all the rolls of Inq.p.m.'s have been published in some form, with the exception of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1660. An extensive series of calendars extending from the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] to that of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], and with an appendix of lists to the reign of [[James VI and I]], was published in four volumes by the [[Record Commission]] between 1806 and 1828, edited by [[John Caley]] and [[John Bayley (antiquary)|John Bayley]]. However, these volumes were later judged by Sir [[Henry Maxwell Lyte]] to be of "unsatisfactory character", and to contain many omissions. In 1865 two volumes were published, covering the reigns of Henry III and [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], in a new series edited by Charles Roberts entitled ''Calendarium Genealogicum'', which concentrated on providing the names of heirs omitted from the previous publications, designed to be of particular use to genealogists. In 1898 the production of three volumes covering the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (1485–1509) was started, and was completed in 1955. In 1904 the first volume of a new series of Inq.p.m.'s was published, intended to be more complete and systematic, under Maxwell Lyte's editorship. It covered the reign of Henry III, from 1236, when the practice of producing inq.p.m.'s began. This "first series" continued for 26 volumes, the last volume having been published in 2009, although volumes were not published in chronological order. [[Winchester University]] and the [[Department of Digital Humanities]] at [[King's College London]] are currently working on a project to publish on-line in searchable format a revised and expanded series of all existing texts covering the years 1236–1447 and 1485–1509.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitionspostmortem.ac.uk |title=Inquisitions Post Mortem – Mapping the Medieval Countryside: properties, places &amp; people |accessdate=19 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also aims in the long-term to produce calendars for the first time of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1542. A number of county [[Text publication society|record societies]] have published calendars of Inq.p.m.'s relating to their own counties, abstracted from the chancery and exchequer rolls.

==History==
The Aster Dance Club was founded in 1986 in Sarajevo, then part of [[SFR Yugoslavia]] and was named after American dancer, choreographer and actor, [[Fred Astaire]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pkaster.ba/|title= Plesni klub Aster|publisher=pkaster.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally part of the [[Slobodan_Princip#Legacy|Slobodan Princip "Seljo" Student Cultural Club]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pkaster.ba/|title= Plesni klub Aster|publisher=pkaster.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was a founding member of the Bosnian Dance Federation, but ceased to exist in 2000. In 2014 the club was reestablished by former members. That same year it founded the festival in cooperation with the acclaimed Berlin Dance Institute, the [[World DanceSport Federation]] and [[MTV Dance (Europe)|MTV Dance Europe]]. In 2017, the organizers signed a cooperation agreement with the [[2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/kultura/inter-dance-fest-dovodi-najbolje-plesace-u-sarajevo/296584|title= Inter Dance FEST potpisao memorandum o saradnji sa organizatorima EYOF 2019|publisher=Radio Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Format==
The festival is organized in April and lasts for three days. Its format is 19 competitive and 7 non-competitive dance programmes that are held for the first two days of the festival and represent contemporary dance styles from four different continents. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sportsport.ba/magazin/medunarodni-plesni-festival-inter-dance-fest-2018-u-aprilu-u-sarajevu/265130|title=Međunarodni plesni festival Inter Dance FEST 2018 u aprilu u Sarajevu|publisher=sportsport.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third day, organized in cooperation with the [[International Dance Organization]], is reserved for programmes that fall under Performing Arts: [[Tap Dance]], [[Musical Theatre]], [[Contemporary ballet]], [[Lyrical dance]] and [[Concert dance]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/kultura/inter-dance-fest/296955|title=Takmičenje / Inter Dance FEST doveo najbolje plesače u Sarajevo|publisher=Radio Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous panels of international judges decide on the winner of each competitive programme. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sportsport.ba/magazin/medunarodni-plesni-festival-inter-dance-fest-2018-u-aprilu-u-sarajevu/265130|title=Međunarodni plesni festival Inter Dance FEST 2018 u aprilu u Sarajevu|publisher=sportsport.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lee was born in [[Seoul]], South Korea, in 1971. He moved to Brazil when he was 10, and later came to New York City to study at [[Parsons School of Design]]. He ended up graduating with a degree in communication and graphic design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://universrevolved.com/8.About%20the%20Author/AboutJi1.htm author's biography] at Web site for [http://universrevolved.com Univers Revolved], one of Mr. Lee's projects&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the works of public art he is known for is [[the Bubble Project]]: Mr. Lee printed 50,000&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/22751666&lt;/ref&gt; stickers that look like speech bubbles used in comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pleaseenjoy.com/project.php?cat=1&amp;subcat=&amp;pid=3&amp;navpoint=0 Description of the Bubble Project] at [http://pleaseenjoy.com/index.php Please Enjoy Web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926185204/http://pleaseenjoy.com/index.php |date=2010-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then posted these blank speech bubbles on top of advertisements throughout New York City allowing anyone who sees them to write in their comments and thoughts. In 2006, Mr. Lee wrote a book about the project called Talk Back:The Bubble Project which talks about the blank bubbles which transformed the corporate monologue into a true public dialogue.

==Mysterabbit==
Lee was also one the founders of the project Mysterabbit&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysterabbit.com/about&lt;/ref&gt; where a small white coloured rabbit was placed anonymously in over 19 different countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysterabbit.com/photos/map&lt;/ref&gt; The rabbit is 3D Printable&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysterabbit.com/participate&lt;/ref&gt; and there are photos available on their Mysterabbit website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysterabbit.com/photos&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kruithof curve''' describes a region of [[illuminance]] levels and [[color temperature]]s that are often viewed as comfortable or pleasing to an observer. The curve was constructed from [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] data collected by Dutch physicist [[Arie Andries Kruithof]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Arie Andries|last=Kruithof|url=http://dap.library.uu.nl/cgi-bin/dap/dap?diss_id=7789|title=Aanslag van het waterstofmolecuulspectrum door electronen|date=December 12, 1934}} (PhD dissertation at [[Utrecht University]] under [[Leonard Ornstein]]) {{nl icon}}
&lt;/ref&gt; though the original experimental data is not present on the curve itself. Lighting conditions within the bounded region were [[Empirical evidence|empirically]] assessed as being pleasing or natural, whereas conditions outside the region were considered uncomfortable, displeasing or unnatural.&lt;ref name=Kruithof1941&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kruithof|first=Arie Andries|title=Tubular Luminescence Lamps for General Illumination |journal=Philips Technical Review| volume=6|issue=3|pages=65–96|year=1941|issn=0031-7926}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cnspan|1=The Kruithof curve is a sufficient model for describing pleasing|date=March 2017}} [[Light#Light source|sources]] that are considered [[Sunlight|natural]] or closely resemble [[Planck's law|Planckian]] [[Black body|black bodies]], but its value in describing human preference has been consistently questioned by further studies on interior lighting.&lt;ref name="Davis &amp; Ginthner 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce &amp; Cuttle 1990"/&gt;

For example, natural daylight has a color temperature of 6500 [[Kelvin|K]] and an illuminance of about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[lux]]. This color temperature–illuminance pair results in natural [[Color Rendering Index|color rendition]], but if viewed at a low illuminance, would appear bluish. At typical indoor office illuminance levels of about 400 lux, pleasing color temperatures are lower (between 3000 and 6000 K), and at typical home illuminance levels of about 75 lux, pleasing color temperatures are even lower (between 2400 and 2700 K). These color temperature-illuminance pairs are often achieved with [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] and [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent sources]], respectively. It is noteworthy that the pleasing region of the curve contains color temperatures and illuminance levels comparable to naturally lit environments.

==History==
At the emergence of fluorescent lighting in 1941, Kruithof conducted psychophysical experiments to provide a technical guide to design artificial [[lighting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viénot|first=Françoise |author2=Marie-Lucie Durand |author3=Elodie Mahler|title=Kruithof's rule revisited using LED illumination|journal=Journal of Modern Optics|date=20 July 2009|volume=56|issue=13|pages=1433–1446|doi=10.1080/09500340903151278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Gas-discharge lamp|gas-discharge fluorescent lamps]], Kruithof was able to manipulate the color of emitted light and ask observers to report as to whether or not the source was pleasing to them. The sketch of his curve as presented consists of three major regions: the middle region, which corresponds to light sources considered pleasing; the lower region, which corresponds to colors that are considered cold and dim; and the upper region, which corresponds to colors that are warm and unnaturally colorful. These regions, while approximate, are still used to determine appropriate lighting configurations for homes or offices.

==Perception and adaptation==
[[File:Red geranium photoic mesopic scotopic.jpg|thumb|right|Simulated appearance of a red geranium and foliage in normal bright-light ([[Photopic vision|photopic]]) vision, dusk ([[Mesopic vision|mesopic]]) vision, and night ([[Scotopic vision|scotopic]]) vision. The blueish flower centers are still [[Perception|perceived]] as bright in the image of the flower viewed at dusk and at night.]]
Kruithof's findings are directly related to human [[Adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] to changes in illumination. As illuminance decreases, human [[Spectral sensitivity|sensitivity]] to blue light increases. This is known as the [[Purkinje effect]].&lt;ref name="frisby1980"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Frisby, John P. | title=Seeing: Illusion, Brain and Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford | year=1980|isbn=978-0-19-217672-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The human [[visual system]] switches from photopic ([[Cone cell|cone]]-dominated) vision to scotopic ([[Rod cell|rod]]-dominated) vision when [[luminance]] levels decrease. Rods have a very high spectral sensitivity to blue energy, whereas cones have varying spectral sensitivities to reds, greens and blues. Since the dominating [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] in scotopic vision is most sensitive to blue, human sensitivity to blue light is therefore increased. Because of this, intense sources of higher (bluer) color temperatures are all generally considered to be displeasing at low luminance levels, and a narrow range of pleasing sources exist. Subsequently, the range of pleasing sources increases in photopic vision as luminance levels are increased.

==Criticism==
While the curve has been used as a guide to design artificial lighting for indoor spaces, with the general suggestion to use sources with low correlated color temperatures at low illuminances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=Peter R.|title=Human factors in lighting|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=978-0-7484-0950-1|pages=245–250|edition=2|chapter=Lighting for offices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kruithof did not describe the method of evaluation, the independent variables, nor the test sample that were used to develop the curve. Without these data, nor other validation, the conclusions should not be considered credible. The relationship between illuminance and CCT was not supported by subsequent work.&lt;ref name="Boyce &amp; Cuttle 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyce|first1=P.R.|last2=Cuttle|first2=C.|title=Effect of correlated colour temperature on the perception of interiors and colour discrimination|journal=Lighting Research &amp; Technology|date=1990|volume=22|issue=1|pages=19–36|doi=10.1177/096032719002200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis &amp; Ginthner 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=RG|last2=Ginthner|first2=DN|title=Correlated color temperature, illuminance level and the Kruithof curve|journal=Journal of the Illuminating Engineering Society|date=1990|volume=Winter|pages=27–38|doi=10.1080/00994480.1990.10747937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kruithof curve, as presented, does not contain experimental data points and serves as an approximation for desirable lighting conditions. Therefore, its scientific accuracy has been reassessed.

Color rendering index is a [[Units of measurement|metric]] for describing the [[Visual appearance|appearance]] of a source and whether or not it is considered pleasing. The color rendering index of a given source is a measure of that source's ability to faithfully reproduce colors of an object. Light sources, like [[candle]]s or incandescent light bulbs produce spectrums of [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic]] energy that closely resemble Plankian black bodies; they look much like natural sources. Many fluorescent lamps or [[LED lamp|LED light bulbs]] have spectrums that do not match those of Plankian blackbodies and are considered unnatural. Therefore, the way that they render the perceived colors of an environment may be also considered unnatural. While these newer sources can still achieve correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels that are within the comfortable region of the Kruithof curve, variability in their color rendering indices may cause these sources to ultimately be displeasing.

Different activities or scenarios call for different color temperature-illuminance pairs: preferred light sources change depending on the scenario the source is illuminating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|url=http://naoyuki-oi.la.coocan.jp/Research/CIE_2007_proceeding.pdf|first=Naoyuki|last=Oi|author2=Hironobu Takahashi|title=Preferred Combinations Between Illuminance and Color Temperature in Several Settings for Daily Living Activities|institution=Kyushu University|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals did prefer color temperature-illuminance pairs within the comfortable region for [[Eating|dining]], [[Socialization|socializing]] and [[Study skills|studying]], but also preferred color temperature-illuminance pairs that were in the lower uncomfortable region for night time activities and preparing for bed. This is linked to the Purkinje effect; individuals who desire some light at night time desire lower (redder) color temperatures even if luminance levels are very low.

Kruithof's findings may also vary as a function of [[culture]] or [[Geography|geographic]] location. Desirable sources are based on an individual's previous experiences of perceiving color, and as different regions of the world may have their own lighting standards, each culture would likely have its own acceptable light sources.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The illuminance of a source is the dominating factor for deciding as to whether or not a source is pleasing or comfortable, as viewers participating in this experiment evaluated a range of correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels, yet their impressions remained generally unchanged as correlated color temperature changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bodmann|first=H.W.|author2=G. Sollner |author3=E. Voit |title=Evaluation of lighting level with various kinds of light|journal=Proceedings of the CIE|year=1963|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is a relationship between correlated color temperature and appeared brightness of a source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Han|first=S.|title=Effect of Illuminance, CCT and Decor on the Perception of Lighting|degree=M.S.|publicationplace=[[Troy, New York]]|institution = [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these findings, it is evident that color rendering index, in place of correlated color temperature, may be a more appropriate metric for determining as to whether or not a certain source is considered pleasing.

'''''La Caricature''''' was a satirical weekly published French periodical that was distributed in Paris between 1830 and 1843 during the [[July Monarchy]].  Its cartoons repeatedly attacked King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], whom it typically depicted as a pear.

==History==
[[File:Caricature Charles Philipon pear.jpg|thumb|The famous cartoon of Louis Philippe as a pear, drawn by [[Honoré Daumier]] after the sketch by [[Charles Philipon]] and published in ''La Caricature'' in 1831]]
''La Caricature morale, politique et littéraire'' was published from 1830 to 1843.  Auguste Audibert was editor and [[Charles Philipon]] (1800–61) was director and main author.{{sfn|La Caricature ... Gallica}} Honoré de Balzac and Louis Desnoyers assisted Philipon in writing some of the magazines issues. Primary artists were Honoré Daumier and Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville with caricature contributions from many artists including  Henry Monnier, Alexandre Decamps, Auguste Raffet, Paul Gavarni, Achille Devéria, Auguste Desperret, Eugène Forest, Benjamin Roubaud. The journal was founded after the censorship laws had been relaxed following the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 in which Louis Philippe came to power. It covered both politics and art. 251 issues appeared between 1830 and 1835, each of four pages, with two or three lithographs.{{sfn|Mellby|2009}}

Philipon was the owner of the largest printing house in Paris equipped with lithographic presses, and used them to print ''La Caricature'' and ''[[Le Charivari]]'', another illustrated paper. He drew together a group of skilled artists who mostly worked for these two papers, through which they attacked the king and the system of government with growing violence.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=3}} The major contributors were [[Honoré Daumier]] (1808–79) and [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville]] (1803–47), but there were many others.{{sfn|Mellby|2009}} For example, a caricature by [[Jules David]] appeared in ''La Caricature'' of 31 May 1831.  The king is depicted as an illusionist who uses the ''[[juste milieu]]'' and some ''poudre de non-intervention'' to make liberty and revolution vanish.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=75}}

In 1830–31 there were revolutionary uprisings in Italy. The Austrians intervened to suppress the revolts, and the French did nothing to prevent them. The Pope broke his promise to grant the rebels in the [[Papal States]] an amnesty. ''La Caricature'' published a cartoon that showed the Pope on his throne surrounded by corpses.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=75}} Similarly, Philipon published cartoons that associated the French government with that of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] when Russia suppressed a revolt in Poland. The fall of Warsaw was announced by [[Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta|Horace Sebastiani]], the French foreign minister, as "L'ordre règne à Varsovie" (Order reigns in Warsaw). The phrase was used as a caption for one of the cartoons.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=76}}

The journal became increasingly vocal in its opposition to Louis-Philippe, and was seized more than twelve times. The publishers were prosecuted, and Philipon was jailed for a year. In 1835 the government passed legislation that forced ''La Caricature'' to cease publication.{{sfn|Mellby|2009}} The journal began publication again in 1838 and continued until 1843.{{sfn|La Caricature ... Gallica}} Writing in 1840, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] talked of the "curious contest between the State and M. Philipon's little army."{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=3}} Thackery wrote,
{{quote|Half-a-dozen poor artists on the one side, and his Majesty Louis-Philippe, his august family, and the numberless [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]] and supporters of his monarchy, on the other.... The King of the French suffered so much, his ministers were so mercilessly ridiculed, his family and his own remarkable figure drawn with such odious and grotesque resemblance, in fanciful attitudes, circumstances, and disguises, so ludicrously mean, and so often appropriate, that the King was obliged to descend into the lists and battle his ridiculous enemies in form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=4}} }}

'''Matthieu van Plattenberg''', known in France as '''Matthieu de Plattemontagne''', '''Matthieu de Platte Montagne''' and '''Matthieu Montaigne'''&lt;ref&gt;Other name variations: 'Matthijs van Plattenberg', 'Matieo Van Plattenberg', 'Matthieu van Platte-Montague', 'Matthieu van Platten'&lt;/ref&gt; (1607 or 1608 &amp;ndash; 19 September 1660) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Flemish Baroque painter|Baroque painter]], draughtsman, [[etcher]] and [[engraver]] who specialized in [[marine art|marine paintings]] and [[landscape art|landscapes]].  He spent most of his career abroad, first in Italy and then in France where he played an important role in the development of the painting of stormy seascapes.

==Life==
Matthieu van Plattenberg was born in [[Antwerp]] in 1607 or 1608.  He was likely a pupil of the marine painter [[Andries van Eertvelt]] in Antwerp.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/63823 Matthieu van Plattenberg] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled together with van Eertvelt to Italy, where he worked in Florence.&lt;ref name=storm&gt;[http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/12288.html Matthieu van Plattenberg, A Dutch Ship Running onto a Rocky Coast] at the [[National Maritime Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Matthieu van Plattenberg - Shipping in a River Estuary.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Shipping in a River Estuary]]

From around 1630 he worked in Paris.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;  He was active as a painter and copper engraver as well as a designer of embroidery patterns.  In Paris, he studied under the Flemish émigré painter [[Jacques Fouquier]] who was a well-established landscape painter and printmaker.&lt;ref name=storm/&gt;  Fouquier taught him how to etch.&lt;ref name=was&gt;L. J. Wassink. "Plattenberg, Matthieu van." Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. [[Oxford University Press]]. Web. 20 Oct. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1631 he married in Paris the sister of the French painter, engraver and publisher [[Jean Morin (artist)|Jean Morin]].  Van Plattenberg and Morin collaborated on publishing projects for which van Plattenberg made the engravings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/search?p=3&amp;ps=12&amp;maker=Matthieu%20van%20Plattenberg&amp;ii=0 Van Plattenberg] at the [[Rijksmuseum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, van Plattenberg called himself 'Matthieu (de) Platte-Montaigne' or 'Platte-Montagne' and also signed his works with '(M) Montagne' or '(M) Montaigne'. Plattenberg's success gained him favour at the royal court and he was awarded the title of 'Peintre du Roy pour les mers' (Royal painter of seas'). He was one of the founding members in 1648 of the [[Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture]] and remained a member until his death in Paris in the year 1660.&lt;ref name=ita&gt;[http://www.popsoarte.it/FixedPages/IT/artisti.php/L/IT/ID/51 Matthieu Van Plattenberg - Platte-Montagne o Montagne (Anversa 1608 - Parigi 1660)] {{link language|it|Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of Matthieu van Plattenberg, known as [[Nicolas de Plattemontagne]], was a painter and a pupil of [[Philippe de Champaigne]].  He had a very successful career in France but his work fell into oblivion after his death.&lt;ref name=ita/&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Matthieu van Plattenberg - A Ship and a Galley Wrecked on a Rocky Coast.jpg|thumb|300px|A Ship and a Galley Wrecked on a Rocky Coast]]
Plattenburg specialized in depictions of vividly coloured storms with turbulent, foaming seas. Van Plattenberg seldom signed or dated his works.&lt;ref name=storm/&gt;  His work has in the past been wrongly attributed to a presumed Flemish or Dutch painter active in Italy around the time when van Plattenberg was working there.  This painter was referred to as 'Monsù Montagna' or 'Renaud de la Montagne'.  The art historian [[Marcel Roethlisberger]] has compared several dozen unsigned paintings of sea storms that traditionally were attributed to Monsù Montagna.  He found that these paintings form a consistent group in that they combine Flemish types with a broad painterly treatment resembling the work of [[Salvator Rosa]].  Roethlisberger is of the view that these works formerly attributed to 'Monsù Montagna' are in fact works by van Plattenberg.  Since Plattenberg left Italy before Rosa began to paint, any influence was likely from van Plattenberg to Rosa.&lt;ref name=chris&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=251316 Matthieu van Plattenberg, called Monsù Montagna (1608-1660), 'A Storm on a rocky Coast with Ships in Distress'] at [[Christie's]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Roethlisberger, ''Cavalier Pietro Tempesta and his time'', University of Delaware Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Plattenberg influenced the marine painter [[Allessandro Grevenbroeck]], a painter of Dutch descent who was active in Northern Italy between 1717 and 1747.&lt;ref&gt; Renate Trnek, ''Die holländischen Gemälde des 17. Jahrhunderts: in der Gemäldegalerie der Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Wien'', Böhlau Verlag Wien, 1992, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is further considered an important precursor of [[Pieter Mulier II|Pieter Mulier]], known in Italy where he was active for most of his life as 'Cavalier Pietro Tempesta'.  Mulier was especially known for the stormy skies of his seascapes and Plattenberg's paintings are believed to anticipate Tempesta's early sea storms.  Tempesta must have seen van Plattenberg's works in Italy.  Some of the works of Monsù Montagna (Matthieu van Plattenberg) have in the past been attributed to Mulier.&lt;ref name=ita/&gt; Van Plattenberg is also to be distinguished from ''Montagne of Venice'' (or Rinaldo della Montagna), who was also a marine painter mentioned by [[Cesare Malvasia]] in his biography of Guido Reni (p.78).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MxwGAAAAQAAJ Abecedario de P.J. Mariette: et autres notes inédites de cet ..., Volume 4], by Pierre Jean Mariette, Philippe de Chennevières, Anatole de Montaiglon; 1857-1858; page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plattenberg also executed three dozen engravings depicting sea- and landscapes.  These engravings were often published by his brother-in-law Jean Morin and were inscribed 'Morin ex cum privil. Re.'.&lt;ref name=was/&gt;

'''Movses Khorenatsi''' (ca. 410–490s AD; {{lang-hy|[[wikt:Մովսես|Մովսես]] [[wikt:խորենացի|Խորենացի]]}}, {{IPA-hy|mɔfˈsɛs χɔɾɛnɑˈtsʰi|pron}}, also written as ''Movsēs Xorenac‘i'' and '''Moses of Khoren''', '''Moses of Chorene''', and '''Moses Chorenensis''' in Latin sources) was a prominent [[Armenia]]n historian from the period of [[Late Antiquity]] and the author of the ''[[History of Armenia (book)|History of Armenia]]''.

Khorenatsi is credited with the earliest known historiographical work on the [[history of Armenia]] written in Armenian, but was also a [[poet]], or [[hymnodist|hymn writer]], and a [[Philology|grammarian]]. The ''History of Armenia'' was written at the behest of Prince [[Sahak II Bagratuni|Sahak]] of the [[Bagratuni dynasty]] and has had an enormous impact on Armenian historiography. It was used and quoted extensively by later medieval Armenian authors. Although other Armenians such as [[Agathangelos]] had previously written histories on Armenia, Movses' work holds particular significance because it contains unique material on the old oral traditions in Armenia before its conversion to Christianity and, more importantly, traces Armenian history from Movses' day back to its origins.

Khorenatsi is considered to be the "father of Armenian history" (''patmahayr''), and is sometimes referred to as the "Armenian [[Herodotus]]."&lt;ref name="byzantinoslavica112"&gt;To Hellēnikon: Byzantinoslavica, Armeniaca, Islamica, the Balkans and modern Greece.

London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2001, p. 181 {{ISBN|0-7007-1452-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Khorenatsi's work became the first attempt of a universal history of Armenia.&lt;ref name="byzantinoslavica112" /&gt;

Movses identified himself as a young disciple of [[Mesrop Mashtots]], inventor of the [[Armenian alphabet]], and is recognized by the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] as one of the [[Holy Translators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Giusto Traina|Traina, Giusto]].

''[[Patma-Banasirakan Handes]]'' 134 (1992), pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Movses' biographical details are given at the very end of the ''History of the Armenians'' but additional information provided by later medieval Armenian historians have allowed modern scholars to piece together additional information on him. Movses was believed to have been born in the village of Khorni (also spelled as Khoron and Khoronk) in the Armenian province of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] or [[Turuberan]] sometime in 410.&lt;ref&gt;For this reason, some have also referred to him as Movses of Taron.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars contend that if he was born here, he would have then been known as Movses of '''Khorneh''' or '''Khoron'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Stepan Malkhasyants|Malkhasyants, Stepan]]. "Introduction" in Movses Khorenatsi's ''Հայոց Պատմություն, Ե Դար'' [History of the Armenians, 5th Century]. [[Gagik Sargsyan|Gagik Kh. Sargsyan]] (ed.) Yerevan: Hayastan Publishing, 1997, p. 7. {{ISBN|5-540-01192-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They instead move the location of his birth from Taron to the Armenian [[Syunik Province|province of Syunik]], in the village of Khorena in the region of Harband.&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his education in Syunik' and was later sent to be taught under the auspices of [[Mesrop Mashtots]],&lt;ref&gt;Great historians from antiquity to 1800: an international dictionary, by Lucian Boia, 1989 – 417 pages, P. 9&lt;/ref&gt; the creator of the [[Armenian alphabet]], and [[Catholicos]] [[Isaac of Armenia|Sahak Partev]]. In having considerable difficulty translating the [[Bible]] from Greek to Armenian, Mesrop and Sahak felt the need to send Movses and several of their other students to [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], at that time the center of education and learning, so that they themselves learn the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Syriac language]]s, as well as [[grammar]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Gagik Sargsyan|Sargsyan, Gagik Kh]]. «Մովսես Խորենացի» [Movses Khorenatsi]. [[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1982, vol. viii, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to Armenia ===
The students left Armenia sometime between 432 and 435. First they went to [[Edessa]] where they studied at the local libraries. Then they moved towards Jerusalem and Alexandria. After studying in Alexandria for five to six years, Movses and his classmates returned to Armenia, only to find that Mesrop and Sahak had died. Movses expressed his grief in a [[lament]] at the end of ''History of the Armenians'':
{{quotation|While they [Mesrop and Sahak] awaited our return to celebrate their student’s accomplishments [i.e., Movses’], we hastened from [[Constantinople|Byzantium]], expecting that we would be dancing and singing at a wedding...and instead, I found myself grieving at the foot of our teachers' graves...I did not even arrive in time to see their eyes close nor hear them speak their final words.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} Movses Khorenatsi. ''Հայոց Պատմություն, Ե Դար'' [History of the Armenians, 5th Century], Annotated translation and commentary by Stepan Malkhasyants. Gagik Kh. Sargsyan (ed.) Yerevan: Hayastan Publishing, 1997, 3.68, p. 276. {{ISBN|5-540-01192-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
To further complicate their problems, the atmosphere in Armenia that Movses and the other students had returned to was one that was extremely hostile and they were viewed at with contempt by the native population. While later Armenian historians blamed this on an ignorant populace, Persian ideology and policy also lay at fault, since its rulers "could not tolerate highly educated young scholars fresh from Greek centers of learning."&lt;ref&gt;Hacikyan, Agop Jack, Gabriel Basmajian, Edward S. Franchuk, and Nourhan Ouzounian. ''The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the Oral Tradition to the Golden Age, Vol. I''. Detroit: Wayne State University, 2000, p. 307. {{ISBN|0-8143-2815-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this atmosphere and persecution by the Persians, Movses went into hiding in a village near [[Vagharshapat]] and lived in relative seclusion for several decades.

[[File:Moses of Chorene.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Movses depicted in a 14th-century Armenian manuscript.]]
Gyut, [[Catholicos of All Armenians]] (461–471), one day met Movses while traveling through the area and, unaware of his true identity, invited him to supper with several of his students. Movses was initially silent, but after Gyut's students encouraged him to speak, Movses made a marvelous speech at the dinner table. One of the Catholicos' students was able to identify Movses as a person Gyut had been searching for; it was soon understood that Gyut was one of Movses' former classmates and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Gyut embraced Movses and, being either a [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian Christian]], or, at least, tolerant of them (since Movses was also Chalcedonian), brought his friend back from seclusion and appointed him to be a bishop in Bagrevan.

=== ''History of the Armenians'' ===
Serving as a bishop, Movses was approached by Prince Sahak Bagratuni (died in 482 during Charmana battle against Persian army), who, having heard of Movses' reputation, asked him to write a history of the Armenians, especially the biographies of Armenian kings and the origins of the Armenian ''[[nakharar]]'' families.&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Armenian historian Artashes Matevosyan placed Movses' completion of ''History'' to the year {{CE|474}} based on his research on the ''Chronicle'' by the sixth century Armenian historian Atanas Taronatsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} Matevosyan, Artashes S. "Մովսես Խորենացին և Աթանաս Տարոնացու Ժամանակագրությունը" [Movses Khorenatsi and Atanas Taronatsi's ''Chronicle''] ''Patma-Banasirakan Handes'' 124 (1989), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his primary reasons for taking up Sahak Bagratuni's request is given in the first part of ''Patmutyun Hayots'', or ''History of the Armenians'': "For even though we are small and very limited in numbers and have been conquered many times by foreign kingdoms, yet too, many acts of bravery have been performed in our land, worthy of being written and remembered, but of which no one has bothered to write down."&lt;ref&gt;Movses Khorenatsi. ''History of the Armenians'', 1.4, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; His work is a first historical record that covered the whole history of Armenia from a very ancient period until the death of the historian. His ''History'' served as a textbook to study the history of Armenia until the eighteenth century. Movses' history also gives a rich description of the oral traditions that were popular among the Armenians of the time, such as the romance story of ''[[Satenik|Artashes and Satenik]]'' and the birth of the god [[Vahagn]]. Movses lived for several more years, and he died sometime in the late {{CE|490s}}.

== Literary influence ==
Three possible early references to Movses in other sources are usually identified. The first one is in [[Ghazar Parpetsi]]’s ''History of the Armenians'' (about 500 A.D.), where the author details the persecution of several notable Armenian individuals, including the “blessed Movses the philosopher,” identified by some scholars as Movses Khorenatsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} Hasratyan, Morus. “Որ՞ն է Մովսես Խորենացու ծննդավայրը.” [Where was Movses Khorenatsi’s Birthplace?] ''Lraber Hasarakakan Gituyunneri'' 12 (1969), pp. 81–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{hy icon}} Hovhannisyan, Petros. "Review of ''History of the Armenians''." ''Banber Yerevani Hamalsarani''. 45 (1982), pp. 237–239.&lt;/ref&gt; But there is no indication in Parpetsi that this Movses had "composed any historical works."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert W. Thomson|Thomson, Robert W.]] "Introduction" in Moses Khorenats'i. ''History of the Armenians''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, p. 3. {{ISBN|0-674-39571-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The second one is the ''Book of Letters'' (sixth century), which contains a short theological treatise by "Movses Khorenatsi."&lt;ref&gt;Brock, S. P. "Review of ''The Incarnation: a study of the doctrine of the Incarnation in the Armenian Church in the 5th and 6th centuries according to the Book of Letters''." ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 46 (1983), pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this treatise, not being an historical work, cannot be convincingly attributed to the historian Movses.&lt;ref name="Mahe 13"&gt;{{fr icon}} See Annie and [[Jean-Pierre Mahé]]'s introduction to their translation of Moïse de Khorène ''Histoire de l'Arménie''. Paris: Gallimard, 1993, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The third possible early reference is in a tenth-eleventh centuries manuscript containing a list of dates attributed to Athanasius (Atanas) of Taron (sixth century): under the year 474, the list has "Moses of Chorene, philosopher and writer." This mention is, however, considered as too uncertain.&lt;ref name="Mahe 13" /&gt;

{{Main|History of Armenia (book)}}

=== Hypercritical phase ===
Beginning in the nineteenth century, as a part of a general trend in those years to reexamine critically the validity of classical sources, Movses' ''History'' was cast into doubt. The conclusions reached by [[Alfred von Gutschmid]] ushered in the "[[Historical method|hypercritical]] phase"&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Jean-Pierre Mahé]]'s review of Aram Topchyan's ''The Problem of the Greek Sources of Movsēs Xorenac‘i's History of Armenia'', in ''[[Revue des Études Arméniennes]]'' 30 (2005–2007), p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Traina, Giusto. "Moïse de Khorène et l'Empire sassanide," in Rika Gyselen (ed.), ''Des Indo-Grecs aux Sassanides: Données pour l'histoire et la géographie historique''. Peeters Publishers, 2007,  p. 158. {{ISBN|978-2-9521376-1-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the study of Movses' work. Many European and Armenian scholars writing at the turn of the twentieth century reduced its importance as a historical source and dated the ''History'' to sometime in the seventh to ninth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Topchyan, Aram. ''The Problem of the Greek Sources of Movsēs Xorenacʻi's History of Armenia''. Leuven: Peeters Publishers, 2006, pp. 5–14, notes 21–22, 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stepan Malkhasyants]], an Armenian philologist and expert of [[Classical Armenian]] literature, likened this early critical period from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries to a "competition," whereby one scholar attempted to outperform the other in their criticism of Movses.&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', pp. 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern studies ===
In the early decades of the twentieth century, scholars such as [[F. C. Conybeare]], [[Manuk Abeghian]], and [[Stepan Malkhasyants]] rejected the conclusions of the scholars of the hypercritical school. Ethnographic and archaeological research during this time confirmed information which was found only in Movses' work and supported their view to move back the dating to the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Hacikyan et al. ''Heritage of Armenian Literature'', pp. 305–306.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Earlier critical points were revived&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Aram Toptchyan. "Moïse de Khorène" in Claude Mutafian (ed.), ''Arménie, la magie de l'écrit''. Somogy, 2007, p. 143. {{ISBN|978-2-7572-0057-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the second half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]]. "On the Date of Pseudo-Moses of Chorene." ''[[Handes Amsorya]]'' 75 (1961), pp. 467–471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malkhasyants. "Introduction" in ''History of the Armenians'', pp. 3–5, 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance [[Robert W. Thomson]], the former holder of the chair in Armenian Studies at [[Harvard University]] and the translator of several classical Armenian works, claimed that Movses' account contained various anachronisms.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Robert W. "Armenian Literary Culture through the 11th Century." in [[Richard G. Hovannisian]] (ed.) ''The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century''. St. Martin's Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-312-10168-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach in evaluating Movses's work was criticized when the English translation of ''History of the Armenians'' appeared in 1978.&lt;ref name="HP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ter-Petrosyan |first=Levon |authorlink=Levon Ter-Petrosyan |title=Moses Khorenats'i, History of the Armenians.

"Review of ''History of the Armenians''." ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' 30 (October 1979): pp. 479–480.&lt;/ref&gt; The points he raised have since been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;See {{hy icon}} Albert Musheghyan, “Որտե՞ղ է գտնվել Մովսես Խորենացու հիշատակած Բյութանյան” [Where was the Bithynia Mentioned by Movses Khorenatsi?] ''Patma-Banasirakan Handes'' 1 (1990) and ''idem'' {{hy icon}} “Վասպուրական տերմինի նշանակությունը Հայ դասական մատենագրության մեջ” [The Meaning of the Term ‘Vaspurakan’ in Classical Armenian Literature] ''Iran Nameh''. 2–3 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vrej Nersessian]], the Curator of the Christian Middle East Section at the [[British Library]], took issue with many of Thomson’s points, including his later dating of the writing and his contention that Movses was merely writing an apologist work for the Bagratunis:

{{quotation|If so, how does one explain then Moses’s complete preoccupation with the events preceding A.D. 440 and his silence regarding the events leading up the Arab incursions and occupation of Armenia between 640–642? Moreover, if the definite purpose of the ''History'' was for “boosting the reputation of the Bagratuni family” then these events should have been central theme of his history; the skilful handling of which brought the Bagratid pre-eminence.... The ecclesiastical interests do not point to the eighth century. There is no echo of the [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian controversy]] which engaged the Armenians from 451 to 641 when the ecclesiastical unity formulated by the council of Theodosiopolis was renounced.&lt;ref name=VN /&gt;}}

[[Gagik Sargsyan]], an Armenian scholar of the [[Classics]] and a leading biographer of Movses, also admonished Thomson for anachronistic hypercriticism and for stubbornly rehashing and "even exaggerating the statements once put forward" by the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century scholars, and in particular, by Grigor Khalatyants (1858–1912).&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian, Gaguik [Gagik Kh. Sargsyan]. ''The "History of Armenia" by Movses Khorenatzi'', trans. by Gourgen A. Gevorkian. Yerevan: Yerevan University Press, 1991, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Sargsyan noted that Thomson, in condemning Movses' failure to mention his sources, ignored the fact that "an antique or medieval author may have had his own rules of mentioning the sources distinct from the rules of modern scientific ethics."&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian. ''"History of Armenia" by Movses Khorenatzi'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson's allegation of Movses' [[plagiarism]] and supposed distortion of sources was also countered by scholars who contended that Thomson was "treating a medieval author with the standards" of twentieth century [[historiography]] and pointed out that numerous classical historians, Greek and Roman alike, engaged in the same practice.&lt;ref name=VN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian. ''"History of Armenia" by Movses Khorenatzi'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Aram Topchyan, a Research Fellow at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] of Armenian Studies, concurred with this observation, and noted that it was odd that Thomson would fault Movses for failing to mention his sources because this was an accepted practice among all classical historians.&lt;ref&gt;Topchyan. ''Problem of the Greek Sources'', pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khorenatsi's work is recognized as an important source for the research of [[Urartu|Urartian]] and early Armenian history.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, Arthur. ''The Encyclopedia of Ancient Civilizations''. 1980, p. 117. "It is interesting that Moses Khorenatsi, writing in the eighth century and regarded as the father of Armenian history, indicates his awareness of elements of continuity between Urartian and Armenian history."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovskiĭ, Boris B. ''The Ancient Civilization of Urartu''. New York: Cowles Book Co., 1969, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Konstantine Hovhannisyan|Hovhannisyan, Konstantine]]. ''Erebooni''. Yerevan: Hayastan Pub.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14507">'''National cinema''' is a term sometimes used in [[film theory]] and [[film criticism]] to describe the films associated with a specific nation-state. Although there is little relatively written on theories of national cinema it has an irrefutably important role in [[globalization]]. Film provides a unique window to other cultures, particularly where the output of a nation or region is high. Countries like South Korea, Russia and Iran have over the years produced a large body of critically acclaimed films. Regardless of the stories or styles of filmmaking the medium inherently contains a dense wealth of information about people and places through which audiences gain knowledge.[[File:First look launch of Baahubali 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|The [[Cinema of India|Indian Cinema]] produces movies in over 18 languages and sells more tickets than any other country in the world.]]Like other film theory or film criticism terms (e.g., "[[art film]]"), the term "national cinema" is hard to define, and its meaning is debated by film scholars and critics. A film may be considered to be part of a "national cinema" based on a number of factors. Simply put, a "nation's cinema" can be attributed to the country that provided the financing for the film, the language spoken in the film, the nationalities or dress of the characters, and the setting, music, or cultural elements present in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Choi.

More theoretically, national cinema can refer to a large group of films, or "a body of [[textuality]]... given historical weight through common intertextual 'symptoms', or coherencies".&lt;ref name="Vitali, V. 2006"&gt;Vitali, V., &amp; Willemen, P. (2006). Theorising national cinema. London: Bfi (British Film Institute) Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Theorising National Cinema'', Philip Rosen suggests national cinema is a conceptualization of: (1) Selected 'national' films/texts themselves, the relationship between them, which be connected by a shared (general) symptom. (2) an understanding of the 'nation' as an entity in synchronicity with its 'symptom'. And (3) an understanding of past or traditional 'symptoms', also known as history or historiography, which contribute to current systems and 'symptoms'.&lt;ref name="Vitali, V. 2006"/&gt; These symptoms of intertextuality could refer to style, medium, content, narrative, narrative structure, costume, [[Mise-en-scène]], character, background, cinematography. It could refer to cultural background of those who make the movie and cultural background of those in the movie, of spectatorship, of spectacle.

==Canada==
Canadian cultural and film critics have long debated how Canadian national cinema can be defined, or whether there is a Canadian national cinema. Most of the films shown on Canadian movie screens are US imports. If "Canadian national cinema" is defined as the films made in Canada, then the canon of Canadian cinema would have to include lightweight teen-oriented fare such as ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''(1979), ''[[Porky's]]'' (1983) or ''[[Death Ship (1980 film)|Death Ship]]'' (1980). Other critics have defined Canadian national cinema as a "...reflection of Canadian life and culture." Some critics argue that there are "two traditions of filmmaking in Canada." The "documentary realist tradition" espoused by the federal government's [[National Film Board]] and avant-garde films.

Scott MacKenzie argues that by the late 1990s, if Canada did have a popular cinema with both avant-garde and experimental elements, that was influenced by European filmmakers such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Wim Wenders]]. MacKenzie argues that Canadian cinema has a "...self-conscious concern with the incorporation of cinematic and televisual images", and as examples, he cites films such as [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Videodrome]]'' (1983), [[Atom Egoyan]]'s'' [[Family Viewing]]'' (1987), [[Robert Lepage]]'s ''[[The Confessional]] (Le Confessionnal)'' (1995) and [[Srinivas Krishna]]'s ''Masala'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Scott MacKenzie, University of Glasgow. National Identity, Canadian Cinema, and Multiculturalism. Available at: https://archive.is/20121201023833/http://www.uqtr.ca/AE/vol_4/scott.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
France's national cinema includes both popular cinema and "avant-garde" films. French national cinema is associated with the [[auteur theory|auteur]] filmmakers and with a variety of specific movements. Avant-garde filmmakers include [[Germaine Dulac]], Marie and [[Jean Epstein]]. [[Poetic Realism]] filmmakers include [[Jean Renoir]] and [[Marcel Carné]]. The [[French New Wave]] filmmakers include [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[François Truffaut]]. The 1990s and 2000s "[[postmodernism|postmodern]] cinema" of France includes filmmakers such as [[Jean-Jacques Beinex]], [[Luc Besson]] and [[Coline Serreau]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hayward. French National Cinema&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
During the German [[Weimar Republic]], German national cinema was influenced by silent and sound "Bergfilm" (this translates to "mountain film"). During the 1920s and early 1930s, German national cinema was known for the progressive and artistic approaches to filmmaking with "shifted conventional cinematic vocabulary" and which gave actresses a much larger range of character-types.&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"&gt;''German National Cinema'', by Sabine Hake. London and New York: Routledge, 2002. Trade paper, {{ISBN|0-415-08902-6}}. Reviewed by Robert von Dassanowsky. Available at: http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/38/booksgerman.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nazi]] era, the major film studio UFA was controlled by Propaganda Minister [[Goebbels]]. UFA produced "Hetzfilme" (anti-Semitic hate films) and films which emphasized the "theme of heroic death." Other film genres produced by UFA during the Nazi era included historical and biographical dramas that emphasized the achievements in German history, comedy films, and propaganda films.&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

During the [[Cold War]] from the 1950s through the 1980s, there were West German films and East German films. Film historians and film scholars do not agree whether the films from the different parts of Cold War-era Germany can be considered to be a single "German national cinema." Some West German films were about the "immediate past in sociopolitical thought and in literature". [[East Germany|East German]] films were often [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-funded "socially critical" films. Some East German films examined Germany's [[Nazi]] past, such as Wolfgang Staudte's ''Die Mörder sind unter uns'' (''The Murderers Are Among Us'').&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

The New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s included films by directors such as [[Fassbinder]], [[Werner Herzog|Herzog]], and [[Wim Wenders]]. While these directors made films with "many ideological and cinematic messages", they all shared the common element of providing an "aesthetic alternativ(e) to [[Classic Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]]" films and "a break with the cultural and political traditions associated with the [[Third Reich]]"(159).&lt;ref name="brightlightsfilm.com"/&gt;

==Poland==
After World War II, the Lódz Film School was founded in 1948. During the 1950s and 1960s, a "Polish School" of filmmakers developed, such as [[Wojciech Has]], [[Kazimierz Kutz]], [[Andrzej Munk]] and [[Andrzej Wajda]]. According to film scholar Marek Haltof, the Polish School of directors made films which can be described as the "Cinema of Distrust." In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wajda, Krzysztof Zanussi and Barbara Sass made influential films which garnered interest outside of Poland. However, even though Western countries became increasingly interested in Polish cinema during this period, the country's film infrastructure and market was disintegrating.&lt;ref&gt;Shelia Skaff. The cinema that is Marek Haltof's ''Polish National Cinema''. Review of Marek Haltof's book Polish National Cinema. Available at: http://www.kinoeye.org/02/14/skaff14.php
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
Although it is difficult to determine and define a 'national cinema', much of what many consider Mexican national cinema, but not limited to, is [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Golden Age of Mexican Cinema]] and films that revolve around the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Unique trajectories of Mexican cinema's development shaped historically specific understandings of the ontology of the moving image, leading to unique configurations of documentation and fictionalization. The Revolution spilled across pages of the press, and became the primary subject of Mexican films produced between 1911 and 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Navitsky, Rielle Public Spectacles of Violence: Sensational Cinema and Journalism in Early Twentieth-Century Mexico and Brazil Durham, NC: Duke University Press 344 pp., $27.95, {{ISBN|082236963X}} Publication Date: June 2017. History: Reviews of New Books. 46. 71-72. 10.1080/03612759.2018.1436314.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a high interest in topicality in and capturing current events as they unfolded, re-staging, or combining both approaching, created a sensationalist appeal in these visual 'records' of death and injury. Compilation documentaries, such as Toscano's [[Memories of a Mexican|Memorias de un Mexicano]] in the years following the Mexican Revolution can be seen as part of a broader cultural politics of nationalism that worked to naturalize and to consolidate the political and ideological story of the revolution.

Later narrativized dramas, such as [[María Candelaria]], [[The Pearl (film)]], [[Enamorada (film)]], [[Río Escondido (1948 film)|Rio Escondido]], Saián Mexico, or [[Pueblerina]] by [[Emilio Fernandez]] and/or [[Gabriel Figueroa]], are often considered part of the Mexican national cinematic body. These films, and most popular films of the 1920s in Mexico, adopted [[David Bordwell]]'s "cinematic norms": narrative linkage, cause and effect, goal oriented protagonists, temporal order or cinematic time, and filmic space as story space. But also, is noted to have incorporated visual folkloric style of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], the deconstructing landscapes of [[Gerardo Murillo]], and the low angles, deep focus, diagonal lines, and 'native' imagery in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s [[Que Viva Mexico]] ! Although a mélange of Western and Mexican influences coexist in Fernandez's films, his Mexican biography and locality leave a legacy of romanticizing Mexico and Mexican history, often presenting idyllic ranches, singing, and a charming life of the poor.

Although of European heritage, [[Louis Buñuel]]'s work in Mexico is another example that presents 'symptoms' of Mexican national identity.  Although less well received by lower classes, and more admired by upper classes, Buñuel's [[Los Olvidados]] stands as an example that a director's national heritage doesn't always have to contribute to the conceptualization of a nation's cinema. Rather than building the nation through celebration, the film presents problem, which contribute to a global identity and context of the nation state. Buñuel, however, is less interested in presenting some 'identity' of message, national or international, and remarked that "to ask whether the film is Mexican or not, is to resist, to seek, to disperse, the very mystery this film articulates for us".

Modern genres embraced and nurtured as 'Mexican national cinema' are often those of the social and family melodrama genre, such as [[Como agua para chocolate]] (1991) by Alfonso Arau, the working class melodrama (i.e. Danzon in 1991 by Maria Novaro), the comedy (i.e. Sólo con tu pareja, 1991, Alfonso Cuarón) and the rural ''costumbrismo'' film (i.e. La mujer de Benjamin, 1990, by Carlos Carrera). Changes in the politics of film industry instituions allowed these film texts and their directors to "transform the traditional filmic paradigm". Up to 60% of financial assistance for national, Latin American, and European productions were provided by the [[:es:Instituto Mexicano de Cinematograf%C3%ADa|Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia]], new models of co-production were created, and distribution and sales channels were opened abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Torres San Martin, Patricia. “The Guadalajarans’ Amores Perros.” Comunicación y Sociedad, núm. 37 , June 2000, pp. 179–202., doi:10.15417/1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6482">"'''Necessity is the mother of invention'''" is an English-language [[proverb]]. It means, roughly, that the primary driving force for most new [[invention]]s is a need.&lt;ref name="Necessity is the mother of invention fd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Necessity is the mother of invention|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention.html|publisher=The Phrase Finder|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
[[File:Human Communications collage.png|thumb|200px|The need to communicate led to the creation of different [[communication]] devices – this is a prime example of the expression: ''Necessity is the mother of invention''.]]
* In the ''[[Oxford Dictionary]]'', the proverb has been defined as;
{{space|4}}"When the need for something becomes imperative, you are forced to find ways of getting or achieving it."&lt;ref name="necessity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Necessity|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Necessity+is+the+mother+of+invention|publisher=Oxford dictionaries|access-date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]'', this is "an expression that means that if you really need to do something, you will think of a way of doing it."&lt;ref name="Necessity is the mother of invention cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Necessity is the mother of invention|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention|publisher=Cambridge Dictionary|access-date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Longman]] dictionary has defined the proverb as: "if someone really needs to do something, they will find a way of doing it."&lt;ref name="Necessity Longman"&gt;{{cite web|title=Necessity Longman|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/necessity|publisher=Longman dictionaries|access-date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The author of this proverb is unknown. This phrase was familiar in England, but in [[Latin]], not in English. In 1519, the headmaster of Winchester and Eton, [[William Horman]], used the Latin phrase ''Mater artium necessitas'' in his book ''Vulgaria''. In 1545 [[Roger Ascham]] used a close English version, ''Necessitie, the inuentour of all goodnesse'', in his book ''[[Toxophilus]]''. In 1608, [[George Chapman]], in his two-part play ''The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron'', used a very similar phrase: ''The great Mother, Of all productions (graue Necessity)''. But, the earliest actual usage of the proverb ''Necessity is the mother of invention'' is sometimes ascribed to [[Richard Franck (captain)|Richard Franck]], who used it in his book ''Northern Memoirs'', calculated for the meridian of Scotland (1658).&lt;ref name="Necessity is the mother of invention fd" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Commonly misattributed due to Benjamin Jowett's popular idiomatic translation (1871) of ''Plato's Republic'', Book II, 369c as "The true creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention."  Jowett's translation is noted for injecting flowery, if not florid, language familiar to his Victorian era audience. Jowett himself, in ''Plato's Republic: The Greek Text'', Vol. III "Notes", 1894, p. 82, gives a literal translation of Plato as "our need will be the real creator," without the proverbial flourish.

==In popular culture==
* In 1964 Frank Zappa took over leadership of the American [[rock music|rock]] band The Soul Giants. He renamed the band The Mothers, referring to the jazz compliment of ''[[mother]]'' for a great musician. However, their record company, [[Verve Records]], objected to the insinuation and by necessity Zappa had to change the name, creating (and defining) [[The Mothers of Invention]].&lt;ref name="The Mothers of Invention BBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mothers of Invention|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/fe98e268-4ddd-441b-95a0-b219375f9ae4|publisher=BBC Music|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The headquarters of Project Freelancer in the web series ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' is a spaceship called the "Mother of Invention", referencing the Director of Project Freelancer using any means he thinks are necessary to ensure the survival and advancement of humanity.
* An episode of ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' took the phrase literally, portraying great American inventors as conceiving their ideas to address needs their mothers had in the episode "Mother Necessity."

==Criticism==
In an address to the [[Mathematical Association]] of England on the importance of education in 1917, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] argued that ''"the basis of invention is science, and science is almost wholly the outgrowth of pleasurable intellectual curiosity."'' and in contrast to the old proverb ''"Necessity is the mother of futile dodges" is much nearer to the truth.''&lt;ref name="PlatoSigler1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Plato|author2=Julius A.

'''''Neue Berliner Musikzeitung''''' was a musical periodical that appeared in the years 1847-1896 and was published by Bote &amp; Bock. It was a continuation of the Berlin musical newspaper published between 1844-1847 by Karl Gaillard.
 
==History==
The ''Neue Berliner Musikzeitung'' reported extensively on the musical life in Berlin, but also on other cities in [[Germany]] and Europe. And together with the ''[[Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung]]'' and the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'', it was widely considered the most important and influential music periodical in [[Berlin]] as well as in the German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vosteen|first=Annette|title=Berliner musikalische Zeitung|url=http://www.ripm.org/journal_info.php5?ABB=BRZ|publisher=RIPM|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was the official publication of the Berlin Association of Musicians.
 
It was established by Gustave Bock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zeittafel |url=http://www.dtkv-berlin.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=175 |publisher=DTKV Berlin |accessdate=25 July 2011 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328050019/http://www.dtkv-berlin.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=175 |archivedate=28 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a former board member of the publisher, and Hermann Wolff (1845-1902), a former editorial director. Bock was the agent of [[Ferruccio Busoni]] and responsible for the founding of the Philharmonic Society.

'''PHaradise''' is a permanent light installation conceived by [[NatHalie Braun Barends]] at the Kunsthalle Mannheim, which was inaugurated on 9 March 2007, located at the dome and the adjacent roof tops of the Hermann Billing Bau at [[:de:Kunsthalle Mannheim|Kunsthalle Mannheim]].&lt;ref name="Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=100 Yahre Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007 | publisher=Kunsthalle Mannheim | year=2007 | isbn=978-3-89165-210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
It represents the act of breathing before falling asleep. The inspiration is represented by cold white light flowing vertically from below into the dome, and the exhalation by warm white colored lights air flowing horizontally towards the rooftops beside the cupola.&lt;ref name="NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life"&gt;{{cite book | title=NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life | publisher=Art Space | year=2007 | location=Berlin/New York/Santiago | isbn=978-3-941494-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to this evening light motion, the viewer has the experience of reliving the breath of the architectural structure, which is transformed into a light sculpture in the [[:de:Skulpturengarten der Kunsthalle Mannheim|Skulpturengarten]]. The "breathing" rhythm becomes slower as time pass by during the evening, symbolizing falling asleep.

PHaradise overlooks the Phoenix Room of [[HHole| HHole for Mannheim]], a multimedia installation at the rooftop of the Athene-Trakt of the Museum, where, among other things, natural light flows into the museum through its seven holes, meeting artificial light coming from below, thus creating a symbolic imaginary space between heaven and earth.

The architecture of the Kunsthalle becomes "alive", changing its own breathing rhythm similar to a living being.

==History==
Progress Theatre was established in 1946 with the aim of presenting new and challenging work.

Its first production was staged in 1947 in Palmer Hall, West Street, Reading. It moved to its present location, The Mildmay Hall, The Mount (near [[Reading University]]) in 1951.

In 1964, after a fund raising campaign, the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building was bought. After modernisation, the theatre now seats 97 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Branagh]], who was a member of the theatre in the late 1970s (http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/kenneth-branaghs-latest-role-progress-4211832) became Progress Theatre [[patron]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="BBCBranagh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-14261163|title=Kenneth Branagh becomes Reading Progress Theatre patron|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 July 2011|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational role==
In the 1950s a Student Group for 14- to 18-year-olds was set up. A charitable organisation, "The Progress Theatre" was established in 1962 with the object of promoting education in performing arts in Reading and the surrounding area.&lt;ref name="charity"&gt;{{Cite web

 |title=Progress Theatre: Charity Framework
 |publisher=Charity Commission
 |accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2009, the Progress Youth Theatre consists of two groups for 15- to 18-year-olds and groups for school years 4 to 6 (ages 8 to 11), 7 to 8 (ages 11 to 13) and 9 to 10 (ages 13 to 15).&lt;ref name="pyt"&gt;{{Cite web

 |df           = dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups give a public performance each year.&lt;ref name="pyt" /&gt;

==Present day==
The theatre has a membership of around 150 people and puts on a regular menu of classic and contemporary theatre. All of these productions are managed by volunteers.

The theatre also stages a summer open-air event, predominantly a Shakespeare play, at the historic and newly-revovated ruins of [[Reading Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/06/28/winters_tale_abbey_ruins_feature.shtml
 |title=The Winter's Tale
 |publisher=[[BBC]]
 |accessdate=18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These productions are managed in partnership with [[Reading Borough Council]]. In 2007, the event was expanded to form the Reading Abbey Ruins Open Air Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ongoing restoration of the abbey, in 2011 the event temporarily moved to the gardens of [[Caversham Court]], the site of a Tudor manor house on the banks of the River Thames.

==Past productions==
Progress has presented contemporary plays since its founding and the first performances in England of ''[[The Good Person of Sezuan|The Good Woman of Setzuan]]'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and ''[[The Shadow of a Gunman]]'' by [[Seán O'Casey]] were produced at the theatre&lt;ref name="branagh"&gt;{{Cite web

{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}
{{Nihongo|'''Dr. Ichirō Irabu'''|伊良部 一郎|Irabu Ichirō}} is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[psychiatrist]] in a series of [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Japanese literature|Japanese]] writer Hideo Okuda, originally published primarily in the [[literary magazine]] ''All Yomimono'' from August 2000 to January 2006 and later collected in three ''[[tankōbon]]'': {{Nihongo|'''''In the Pool'''''|イン・ザ・プール|In Za Pūru}}, {{Nihongo3|"[[Flying Trapeze]]"|空中ブランコ|'''Kūchū Buranko'''}} and {{Nihongo3|"Mayoral Election"|町長選挙|'''Chōchō Senkyo'''}}. Of these, ''Kūchū Buranko'' is particularly acclaimed, having won Okuda the 131st [[Naoki Prize]] (given for a book published in the first half of 2004) but, as of January 2011, only ''In the Pool'' has been published in English. Works in other media based on the stories include a [[#Film|feature film]], [[#Television drama|television drama]], [[#Play|stage play]] and [[#Anime|anime series]].

==Premise==
{{Nihongo|Ichiro Irabu|伊良部 一郎}} is a psychiatrist from the Irabu General Hospital. He is fat and pale skinned, with a fetish for administering injections to patients. An unreasonable and rather immature person, he normally ignores Yamashita's plights while challenging him to mid-air trapeze flying due to his self-proclaimed "light-weightedness." During his student days, he frequently misunderstood his lectures. Treated as a general nuisance at the School of Medicine, he entered [[pediatrics]] soon after graduation. However, due to claims of his tantrums and quarrels with child patients, he switched to psychiatry instead. Doubts remain about his actual grades.

==Stories and characters==

===''Kūchū Buranko''===

; {{Nihongo3|"Flying Trapeze"|空中ブランコ|"Kūchū Buranko"|January, 2003 ''All Yomimono''}}
: {{Nihongo|Kōhei Yamashita|山下 公平|Yamashita Kōhei}} is a member of [[circus]] troupe of seven years and is the leader of a flying trapeze team. Both his parents are fellow members. After suffering repeated failures on the trapeze act, he visits a psychiatrist on his wife's and fellow members' advice. Due to his failure during an act, he believes his partner is harassing him. He has been played by [[Masato Sakai]] in the television drama, Kenji Sakamoto in the stage play and [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] in the animated series.
; {{nihongo3|"[[Hedgehog]]"|ハリネズミ|"Harinezumi"|July, 2003 ''All Yomimono''}}

His father of law is the Dean of the School of Medicine, which supposedly could aid in his future employment prospects. A classmate of Irabu's during their college days. He has a type of obsessive-compulsive neurosis that compels him to force any place of tidiness into disarray. This disorder is so strong, that with just one glance at it, Ikeyama becomes agonized with the impulse of wanting to strip off his father-in-law's wig. Originally published in the ''All Yomimono'' with the title {{nihongo|''Kyōju no Zura''|教授のヅラ||"The wig of the professor"}}.
; {{nihongo|''Hot Corner''|ホットコーナー||"[[Third base]]"}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Wasei-eigo|Japanese English]]&lt;/ref&gt; (the first publishing "All Yomimono", April, 2003 issue)
: {{nihongo|Shinichi Bando|坂東 真一}} is a pro-[[baseball]] player and is ten-year veteran [[third baseman]]. He suffered from [[yips]], and he leaves the first team by pretending to have an injured right shoulder.
; {{Nihongo3|"[[Chick Lit]] Writer"|女流作家|"Joryū Sakka"|January, 2004 ''All Yomimono''}}
: {{nihongo|Aiko Hoshiyama|星山 愛子}} is a popular novelist known for her stories which "express the subtleties of the hearts of today's urban men and women."

===Anime===
{{main|List of Welcome to Irabu's Office episodes}}
{{Nihongo|''Welcome to Irabu's Office''|空中ブランコ|Kūchū Buranko}} is a 2009 [[anime]] of 11 episodes based on the ''Psychiatrist Irabu'' series of short stories, produced at [[Toei Animation]] under the series direction of [[Kenji Nakamura]] for [[Fuji Television]]'s [[noitamina]] [[programming block]]. Though ostensibly an animated series, its visuals are more specifically an experimental mélange of [[traditional animation]] with [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] or otherwise processed [[Live action|live-action]] footage and other imagery.&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt; Manabu Ishikawa's series composition adapts the stories to be set in [[Tokyo|Tōkyō]] during about one week from December 17 to [[Christmas]] (corresponding with the original broadcast, which concluded on [[Christmas Eve]]) and for the chief characters of each story to appear also as supporting players in each other's.

The plot of each episode follows a common thread. Irabu is consulted by a patient suffering from a psychological problem or a problem where other medical approaches have been exhausted. Each of the patients' heads are morphed into an animal head in some scenes after Mayumi administers the vitamin shot to them. Each patient somehow ties into one another, for example the first patient meets with the second patient and the seventh patient, all in the first episode.

The series won the [[Pulcinella]] award for Best Television Series in the "Young Adults" (14–17 years) division at the 2010 Cartoons on the bay international animation festival in the [[province of Genoa]], [[Italy]], the [[Gary Goldman]]-presided jury of that year commending it as a "unique representation of the complex inner world of adolescents.".&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt; Noted animation [[blog]]ger Benjamin Ettinger found it to be lacking in interest in the animation itself and the extreme eclecticism of the visual design no substitute for the finely crafted world of Nakamura and character designer and chief [[animation director]] Takashi Hashimoto's earlier ''[[Bakeneko (anime)]]'' and ''[[Mononoke (TV series)|Mononoke]]'' but still highly enjoyable thanks to the excellence on the part of Nakamura and the episode directors with which the material has been handled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ettinger|first=Benjamin|title=Charles Huettner short film yay|url=http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php?title=huettner&amp;c=1|work=AniPages Daily|accessdate=15 January 2011|date=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted the incorporation of real-life [[gravure idol]] [[Yumi Sugimoto]] as Mayumi as a welcome subversion of ''[[moe (slang)|moe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ettinger|first=Benjamin|title=Recent viewing|url=http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php?title=recent_viewing_3&amp;c=1|work=AniPages Daily|accessdate=15 January 2011|date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Middle Irabu" is slimmer, wearing his normal attire. In this form he has long blond hair, red glasses, and a pair of green bear ears. His personality in this form is notably effeminate. His final form is "little Irabu" (him as a boy), with an over sized lab coat, and shorts instead of trousers. He is quite mellow in this form, but can get ecstatic.

'''Regina Olson Hughes''' (1895-1993) was an American scientific illustrator in [[Botanical illustration|Botanical Art]]. Born February 1, 1895 in [[Herman, Nebraska]], she became fascinated with the world of plants and flowers. Her parents were Johana and Gilbert Hughes. At age 10, she contracted [[scarlet fever]] and slowly decreased her hearing until she became fully deaf at age 14. In order for her to communicate with her peers, she relied on [[lip reading]] and written notes for business work. Hughes retained her speech skills and continued to speak fluently throughout her adulthood. She became proficient in sign language when she enrolled in Gallaudet College.

She loved her rural home, rampant with weeds, plants and flowers. An interest in art also dominated her childhood. Her parents provided art tutoring. [[Plant]]s and [[flower]]s were her favorite subjects. In 1923, Hughes married Frederick H. Hughes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and lived on Gallaudet University's campus for thirty years. He was Gallaudet’s legendary [[Deaf culture|Deaf]] economics professor, theater enthusiast, and football coach. In 1956, he died of a heart attack. She died August 12, 1993 due to heart failure at age 98.

== Education ==
Hughes attended [[Gallaudet University|Gallaudet College]], the then only postsecondary program for deaf students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deaf Persons in the Arts and Sciences|last = Lang|first = Harry|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = |isbn = |location = Westport, Connecticut|pages = 188–191|last2 = Meath-Lang|first2 = Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said, “In 1918, when I graduated from Gallaudet, deaf people were looked down upon. We were treated like children.” But she never backed down from a challenge. At Gallaudet she proved her gift as a writer and poet, contributing many poems to the college's newspaper, ''Buff and Blue''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deaf Artists in America: Colonical to Contemporary|last = Sonnenstrahl|first = Deborah M.|publisher = Dawn Sign Press|year = |isbn = |location = San Diego, California|pages = Page 150–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she graduated, she called on [[Nebraska]] senator Filbert Hichcock, founder of [[Omaha World-Herald|Omaha World Herald]] and friend of her father, and asked if he could help her find a political job. He told her, “nice girls don’t work. You go home and stay with your papa and meet a nice man and he'll take care of you.” She was notably unimpressed with this advice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Great Deaf Americans: The Second Edition|last = Moore|first = Matthew|publisher = Deaf Life Press|year = |isbn = |location = Rochester, NY|pages = 118–124|last2 = Panara|first2 = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her bachelor’s in art in 1918 and her master's degree in 1920.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Government work ==
After graduation, Hughes worked at the [[Veterans Administration]] for a few weeks before moving on to the state department.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1930, Hughes worked at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] as a research clerk then as a [[scientific illustrator]] and [[Translation|translator]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She attained stature as an artist and scholar during years of government service. She used her fluency in four languages- [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]- to work as a translator in the State department during World War I.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America|last = Gannon|first = Jack R.|publisher = Gallaudet University Press|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the departments of war and commerce where her most prestigious assignment was translating during the Conference on limitation of armament in Washington, after the armistice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She   served as a translator for the [[United States Department of State|US department of State]], one of only two non-French women employed by the US office of Translation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1936, she became the scientific illustrator in botany for the [[Agricultural Research Service]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hughes’ experiences has included years of honored illustration work for the Agricultural Research Service and the US Department of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Then in 1969, she “retired” from the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] but then continued work for the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She continued to work until the day she died in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other work ===
Hughes worked at the Smithsonian until 1990 but did side work as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She taught at the [[Mississippi School for the Deaf|Mississippi school for the deaf]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She painted [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]] for  Robert W. Read, [[Curator]] in the Smithsonian Department of Botany, and continuing as a contract illustrator for scientists at both the USDA and the Smithsonian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Robert Reed was very impressed by her work and continued to work together for 17 years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She has also been a resident illustrator in the Department of Botany at the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her interest in art and language generated thick sketchbooks. Most of her paintings, as well as many flower studies are based on sketches made during her travels throughout much of the world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In 1979 the Smithsonian Institution honored her by naming a new species, of [[Bromeliad]], "''Billbergia reginae''," for Regina Olson Hughes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She is the only person to have both a plant genus and species named for her.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 1981, Robert M. King and Harold Robinson, named a member of the [[Asteraceae]] after her "[[Hughesia|''Hughesia reginae'']]."

== Illustrations ==
Hughes was a botanical artist and focused on plants, particularly orchids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her illustrations include a variety of skills such as [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], oils, [[gouache]] and pencil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To be an effective botanical illustrator, one has to be intelligent, patient, knowledgeable, aesthetic and naturally artistic.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Art history books, generally, do not include scientific illustration, which has been long considered more technical, utilitarian, or even distinguished craftsmanship rather than a means of artistic self-expression.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The necessity of executing accurate images of natural plans and flowers requires explicit replication of the object, thus eliminating personal input by the illustrator.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was known for her beautiful, precise and intricate depictions of weeds, orchids, and exotic species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her lived combination of arts and sciences emanated from her passion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Much of her work is so detailed that it has been done with the aid of a [[microscope]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hughes was primarily self-educated [[botany]], working closely with [[taxonomists]] and other scientists as she illustrated the flowers, weeds, plants, and seeds they collected and categorized from all over the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For all of these illustrations she wrote the plant descriptions&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Silence of the Spheres: The Deaf Experience in the History of Science|last = Lang|first = Harry G.|publisher = Bergin &amp; Garvey|year = |isbn = |location = Westport, Connecticut|pages = Pages 101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no backgrounds to distract the scientists from the main subject of the work. Colors are held to a minimum to avoid interference with the subject. Similar parts of the plant might be shown in different levels of details. Distortotion is frequently seen in Hughes' works in order to show the important parts. Plants and flowers parts must show exact proportions in a corresponding scale.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Published work and art shows ===
She was the first [[Hearing loss|deaf]] artist to have a solo show at the Smithsonian; 40 meticulous watercolors of orchids were exhibited in the Rotunda Gallery of the [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History]] in 1982: “Artist and Botanist-A Collaboration.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her work has also been exhibited with the National League of American Pen Women, the Guild of Natural science illustrators, and the hunt institute for Botanical Documentation at [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie-Mellon University]]."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Agricultural Research Service Handbook 366, which contains 224 full-page plates of her work and has been published&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; under the title "Common Weeds of the US," by [[Dover Publications|Dover Press]]."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The USDA Handbook N0. 498,"Economically Important Foreign Weeds, Potential Problems in the United States," contains over 6,000 of her drawings of seeds and plants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her orchid paintings are permanently on public view at the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Museum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Robert Mapplethorpe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|p|əl|ˌ|θ|ɔr|p}}; November 4, 1946 – March 9, 1989) was an American [[photographer]], known for his sensitive yet blunt treatment of controversial subject-matter in the large-scale, highly stylized black and white medium of photography. His work featured an array of subjects, including celebrity portraits, male and female [[Nude (art)|nudes]], self-portraits and still-life images of flowers. His most controversial work is that of the [[BDSM]] subculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s of [[New York City]].  The [[homoeroticism]] of this work fuelled a national debate over the public funding of controversial artwork.

==Biography==
Mapplethorpe was born in [[Floral Park, Queens]], New York City, the son of Joan Dorothy (Maxey) and Harry Irving Mapplethorpe, an electrical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1701327|title=Mapplethorpe, Robert|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Germans|German]] descent, and grew up as a [[Roman Catholic]] in Our Lady of the Snows Parish. He had three brothers and two sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/robert-mapplethorpe-bad-boy-with-a-camera/|title=Robert Mapplethorpe: bad boy with a camera|work=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied for a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] from the [[Pratt Institute]] in [[Brooklyn]], where he majored in Graphic Arts,&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DE1E3EF936A15755C0A963958260 "Fallen Angel"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 25, 1995. Accessed October 14, 2007. "Growing up in a blue-collar precinct of Floral Park and steeped in Catholicism, Mapplethorpe developed&amp;nbsp;— to his alarm&amp;nbsp;— an adolescent interest in [[gay]] [[pornographic]] magazines&amp;nbsp;... So, at Pratt Institute, where his father had studied Engineering and Robert majored in Graphic Arts (but stopped short of getting a degree)&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; though he dropped out in 1969 before finishing his degree.&lt;ref&gt;Haggerty, George. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L9Mj7oHEwVoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Gay%20histories%20and%20cultures%3A%20an%20encyclopedia%20%20By%20George%20E.%20Haggerty&amp;pg=PA561#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Gay histories and cultures"]&lt;/ref&gt; Mapplethorpe lived with his close friend [[Patti Smith]] from 1967 to 1972, and she supported him by working in bookstores. They created art together, and maintained a close relationship.

[[File:Gene Frankel Theater 24 Bond Street.jpg|thumb|right|Mapplethorpe's studio at 24 [[Bond Street (Manhattan)|Bond Street]] in [[Manhattan]], later kept by him for use as a darkroom]]

Mapplethorpe took his first photographs in the late 1960s or early 1970s using a [[Polaroid camera]]. In 1972 he met art curator [[Sam Wagstaff]] who would become his mentor and lifetime companion.  In the mid-1970s Wagstaff acquired a [[Hasselblad]] medium-format camera and Mapplethorpe began taking photographs of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, including artists, composers, and socialites.  During this time, he became friends with [[New Orleans]] artist [[George Dureau]], whose work had such a profound impact on Mapplethorpe that he restaged many of Dureau's early photographs.  From 1977 until 1980, Mapplethorpe was the lover of writer and [[Drummer Magazine (leather)|''Drummer'' magazine]] editor [[Jack Fritscher]],&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fritscher, ''Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer'', San Francisco, Palm Drive Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|1890834386}}, p. 473, [http://www.jackfritscher.com/PDF/Drummer/Vol%201/33_Mineshaft_Mar2008_PWeb.pdf Jackfritscher.com], retrieved September 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced him to [[Mineshaft (gay club)|Mineshaft]].

By the 1980s Mapplethorpe's subject matter focused on statuesque male and female nudes, delicate flower still lifes, and highly formal portraits of artists and celebrities.  Mapplethorpe's first studio was at 24 [[Bond Street (Manhattan)|Bond Street]] in Manhattan.  In the 1980s, Wagstaff bought a top-floor loft at 35 West 23rd Street for Robert, where he resided, also using it as a photo-shoot studio.&lt;ref name=Morrisroe&gt;Morrisroe, Patricia. Robert Mapplethorpe: a biography. New York: Random House, 1995. pgs. 297, 126 {{ISBN|0-394-57650-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He kept the Bond Street loft as his darkroom.  In 1988, Mapplethorpe selected Patricia Morrisroe to write his biography, which was based on more than 300 interviews with celebrities, critics, lovers, and Mapplethorpe himself.&lt;ref name=Morrisroe/&gt;

===Death===
Mapplethorpe died on the morning of March 9, 1989 at the age of 42 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS]], in a [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] hospital.  His body was cremated.  His ashes are interred at [[St. John Cemetery (Queens)|St. John's Cemetery, Queens]] in [[New York City|New York]], at his mother's grave-site, etched "Maxey".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 29890-29891). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundation ===
Nearly a year before his death, the ailing Mapplethorpe helped found the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, Inc.  His vision for the Foundation was that it would be "the appropriate vehicle to protect his work, to advance his creative vision, and to promote the causes he cared about".&lt;ref name="mfoundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapplethorpe.org/foundation.html|title=The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation - Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since his death, the Foundation has not only functioned as his official estate and helped promote his work throughout the world, but has also raised and donated millions of dollars to fund medical research in the fight against AIDS and HIV infection and to promote fine art photography at the institutional level.&lt;ref name="mfoundation" /&gt; The Foundation also determines which galleries represent Mapplethorpe's art.&lt;ref name="Duray2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duray|first=Dan|title=Mapplethorpe Estate to OHWOW in Los Angeles|url=http://galleristny.com/2013/11/mapplethorpe-estate-to-ohwow/|work=Observer.com|publisher=The New York Observer|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation - FAQ|url=http://www.mapplethorpe.org/faq/|work=mapplethorpe.org|publisher=The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation donated the Robert Mapplethorpe Archive, spanning from 1970 to 1989, to the [[Getty Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Mapplethorpe Archive|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/special_collections/notable/mapplethorpe.html|publisher=Getty Research Institute|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

Mapplethorpe worked primarily in a studio, and almost exclusively in black and white, with the exception of some of his later work and his final exhibit "New Colors". His body of work features a wide range of subjects, but his main focus and the greater part of his work is erotic imagery. He would refer to some of his own work as [[pornographic]],&lt;ref name=Morrisroe /&gt; with the aim of arousing the viewer, but which could also be regarded as [[high art]].&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;Arthur Coleman Danto and Mapplethorpe, Robert. Mapplethorpe. New York: Random House, 1992. Print. pg 326&lt;/ref&gt; His [[erotic art]] explored a wide range of sexual subjects, depicting the [[BDSM]] subculture of New York in the 1970s, portrayals of black male nudes, and [[nude (art)|classical nudes]] of female bodybuilders. Mapplethorpe was a participant observer for much of his erotic photography, participating in the sexual acts which he was photographing and engaging his models sexually.&lt;ref name=Whitney/&gt;

Other subjects included flowers, especially orchids and [[Zantedeschia aethiopica|calla lilies]], children, statues, and celebrities and other artists, including [[Andy Warhol]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]], [[Kathy Acker]], [[Richard Gere]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Amanda Lear]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Philip Glass]], [[David Hockney]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Joan Armatrading]] and [[Patti Smith]]. Smith was a longtime roommate of Mapplethorpe and a frequent subject in his photography, including a stark, iconic photograph that appears on the cover of Smith's first album, ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]''.&lt;ref name=bestcovers&gt;{{cite book |title=100 Best Album Covers: The Stories Behind the Sleeves |last=Thorgerson |first= Storm |author2=Aubrey Powell  |edition=1st American |date=November 1999 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7894-4951-X |pages=74 |ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=71kBAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work often made reference to religious or classical imagery, such as a portrait of Patti Smith &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/Image-Library/Mapplethorpe/tate_photo-patti-smith-1975.jpg Georgetown.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1986 which  recalls [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s 1500 self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/Image-Library/Exempla/durer-self-portrait-1500-lg.jpg Georgetown.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1980 and 1983, Mapplethorpe created over 150 photographs of bodybuilder [[Lisa Lyon]], culminating in the 1983 photobook ''Lady, Lisa Lyon'', published by [[Viking Press]] and with text by Bruce Chatwin.

{{quote|text=Robert took areas of dark human consent and made them into art. He worked without apology, investing the homosexual with grandeur, masculinity, and enviable nobility. Without affectation, he created a presence that was wholly male without sacrificing feminine grace. He was not looking to make a political statement or an announcement of his evolving sexual persuasion. He was presenting something new, something not seen or explored as he saw and explored it. Robert sought to elevate aspects of male experience, to imbue homosexuality with mysticism. As Cocteau said of a Genet poem, "His obscenity is never obscene."|sign=Patti Smith|source=''[[Just Kids]]''&lt;ref name=justkids&gt;{{cite book |title=Just Kids |last=Smith |first=Patti |edition=First Ecco Paperback |date=2010 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-093622-8 |pages=199 |ref=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0747568766}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the summer of 1989, Mapplethorpe's traveling solo exhibit brought national attention to the issues of public funding for the arts, as well as questions of censorship and the obscene. The [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., had agreed to be one of the host museums for the tour. Mapplethorpe decided to show his latest series that he explored shortly before his death. Titled ''Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment'', the show included photographs from his X Portfolio, which featured images of [[urophagia]], [[BDSM]] and a self-portrait with a [[bullwhip]] inserted in his anus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N31/mapple.31a.html|title=Robert Mapplethorpe's extraordinary vision - The Tech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was curated by Janet Kardon of the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|Institute of Contemporary Art]] (ICA).&lt;ref name=ICA&gt;[http://www.icaphila.org/news/pdf/mapplethorpe_pr.pdf ''Imperfect Moments: Mapplethorpe and Censorship Twenty Years Later'', Institute of Contemporary Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icaphila.org/exhibitions/mapplethorpe.php|title=ICA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICA was awarded a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to support Mapplethorpe's exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. The cancellation of the show, which terminated the Corcoran's contract with the ICA, was due to the fact that the museum did not want to get involved in the politics. Instead, the Corcoran was pulled into the controversy, which "intensified the debate waged both in the media and in Congress surrounding the NEA's funding of projects perceived by some individuals... to be inappropriate..."&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, Judith. "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Philadelphia Story." Art Journal 50.4 (1991): 71-76. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy of the Corcoran and several members of [[United States Congress|the U.S. Congress]] were upset when the works were revealed to them, due to the [[homoerotic]] and [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] themes of some of the work. Though much of his work throughout his career had been regularly displayed in publicly funded exhibitions, conservative and religious organizations, such as the [[American Family Association]], seized on this exhibition to vocally oppose government support for what they called "nothing more than the sensational presentation of potentially obscene material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC153FF934A2575BC0A966958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Mapplethorpe's Photos Now an F.C.C. Issue | date=August 17, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1989, [[pop art]]ist [[Lowell Blair Nesbitt]] became involved in the censorship issue. Nesbitt, a long-time friend of Mapplethorpe, revealed that he had a $1.5-million bequest to the museum in his will, but publicly promised that if the museum refused to host the exhibition, he would revoke the bequest. The Corcoran refused and Nesbitt bequeathed the money to the [[Phillips Collection]] instead. After the Corcoran refused the Mapplethorpe exhibition, the underwriters of the exhibition went to the nonprofit [[Washington Project for the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v47/no2/fitzpat.html ''The Sensitive Society'', James F. Fitzpatrick, FCLJ Vol 47 No 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613072721/http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v47/no2/fitzpat.html |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed all the images in its space from July 21 to August 13, 1989, to large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73897099.html?dids=73897099:73897099&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+6%2C+1989&amp;author=Judd+Tully&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=b.01&amp;desc=Corcoran+Cut+From+Painter%27s+Will%3BLowell+Nesbitt%27s+Mapplethorpe+Protest|title=Corcoran Cut From Painter's Will|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpadc.org/catalyst/?p=2845|title=Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, the [[Contemporary Arts Center]] in Cincinnati, and [[Dennis Barrie]], were charged with obscenity. They were found not guilty by a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackfritscher.com/OtherAnthology/CensorshipEncyclopedia.html|title=Censorship: A World Enclyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ICA, "The Corcoran's decision sparked a controversial national debate: Should tax dollars support the arts? Who decides what is "obscene" or "offensive" in public exhibitions? And if art can be considered a form of [[free speech]], is it a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to revoke federal funding on grounds of obscenity? To this day, these questions remain very much at issue."&lt;ref name=ICA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The federal government and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or pornography. However, the exact definition of obscenity and pornography has changed over time. (See also [[I know it when I see it]].)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mapplethorpe became something of a [[wikt:cause célèbre|cause célèbre]] for both sides of the American [[culture war]]. However, prices for many of the Mapplethorpe photographs doubled and even tripled as a consequence of all the attention. The artist's notoriety supposedly also helped the posthumous sale at [[Christie's]] auction house of Mapplethorpe's own collection of furniture, pottery, silver and works by other artists, which brought about $8 million.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck (April 16, 1990), [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/16/arts/publicity-is-enriching-mapplethorpe-estate.html Publicity Is Enriching Mapplethorpe Estate] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Central England incident===
In 1998, the [[Birmingham City University|University of Central England]] was involved in a controversy when a book by Mapplethorpe was confiscated. A final-year undergraduate student was writing a paper on the work of Robert Mapplethorpe and intended to illustrate the paper with a few photographs from ''Mapplethorpe'', a book of the photographer's work. She took the photographs to the local chemist to be developed and the chemist informed West Midlands Police because of the unusual nature of the images. The police confiscated the library book from the student and informed the university that the book would have to be destroyed. If the university agreed to the destruction, no further action would be taken.

The university Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Peter Knight, supported by the Senate, took the view that the book was a legitimate book for the university library to hold and that the action of the police was a serious infringement of academic freedom. The Vice-Chancellor was interviewed by the police, under caution, with a view to prosecution under the terms of the [[Obscene Publications Acts]].

After the interview with the Vice-Chancellor, a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service for a determination by the Director of Public Prosecutions whether to proceed with a trial. After a delay of about six months, the affair came to an end when Dr. Knight was informed by the DPP that no action would be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |title=UCE pages on the Mapplethorpe controversy |accessdate=2002-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990209055420/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |archivedate=February 9, 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Black Book''===
The 1986 solo exhibition "Black Males" and the subsequent book ''The Black Book'' sparked controversy for their depiction of black men. The images, erotic depictions of black men, were widely criticized for being exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/Mappleth/MappPg1.html|title=Mapplethorpe - Richard Meyer Essay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/arts/mapplethorpe_r.html Mapplethorpe, Robert (1946-1989)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321074911/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/mapplethorpe_r.html |date=2006-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kobena Mercer "Looking for Trouble" Transition, No. 51 (1991), pp. 184-197&lt;/ref&gt; The work was largely [[Phallus|phallocentric]] and sculptural, focusing on segments of the subject's bodies. His purported intention with these photographs and the use of black men as models was the pursuit of the [[Platonic ideal]].&lt;ref name=Morrisroe /&gt; Mapplethorpe's initial interest in the black male form was inspired by films like ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'' and the interrogation scene in ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]],'' in which an unknown black character enters the interrogation room and slaps the protagonist across the face.&lt;ref&gt;Fritscher, Jack. Mapplethorpe: assault with a deadly camera : a pop culture memoir, an outlaw reminiscence. Mamaroneck, NY: Hastings House, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism was the subject of a work by American conceptual artist [[Glenn Ligon]],'' Notes on the Margins of the Black Book'' (1991–1993). Ligon juxtaposes Mapplethorpe's 91 images of black men in the 1988 publication ''Black Book'' with critical texts and personal reactions about the work to complicate the racial undertones of the imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Audio Guide Stop For Glenn Ligon, Notes on the Margins of the Black Book, 1991-1993, [http://whitney.org/WatchAndListen/Artists?context=&amp;context_id=&amp;play_id=376 Whitney Museum of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

American poet and activist [[Essex Hemphill]] also expressed criticism in his anthology ''Brother to Brother'' (1991). Although he believed that Mapplethorpe's work reflected exceptional talent, Hemphill also believed that it displayed a lack of concern for black individuals in the gay community, "except as sexual subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin (2014). ''Hold Tight Gently: Michael Callen, Essex Hemphill and the Battlefield of AIDS''. New York: [[The New Press]]. pp. 169-170. {{ISBN|978-1-59558-945-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumously==
In 1992, author [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]] dedicated his novel ''Boys of Life'' to Mapplethorpe, as well as to Karl Keller and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Paul|title=Boys of Life|year=1991|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0525933274|page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Mapplethorpe: A Biography'' by Patricia Morrisroe was published by Random House in 1995,&lt;ref name=Morrisroe/&gt; the ''Washington Post Book World'' described it as "Mesmerizing... Morrisroe has succeeded in re-creating the photographer's world of light and dark."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post Book World, May 28, 1995, ''In the Darkroom of the Soul''.&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[Arthur Danto|Arthur C. Danto]], writing in ''The Nation'', praised it as "utterly admirable... The clarity and honesty of Morrisroe's portrait are worthy of its subject."&lt;ref&gt;''The Unretouched Life'', The Nation, June 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Patti Smith]] wrote a book ''[[The Coral Sea (book)|The Coral Sea]]'' dedicated to Mapplethorpe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Patti|title=The Coral Sea|year=1996|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York, NY|isbn=0393039080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philips]] released a photo disc for their [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] video game system in the late 1990s called ''The Flowers of Robert Mapplethorpe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flowers of Robert Mapplethorpe (CD-i) James &amp; Mike Mondays|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECVdnmjrfyc|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, Arena Editions published ''Pictures,'' a monograph that reintroduced Mapplethorpe's sex pictures. In 2000, ''Pictures'' was seized by two [[South Australian]] plain-clothes detectives from an [[Adelaide]] bookshop in the belief that the book breached indecency and [[obscenity|obscenity laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extract from: HANSARD, S.A. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Wednesday 14 March 2001|url=https://www.efa.org.au/Publish/samapplethorpe.html|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Police sent the book to the [[Canberra]]-based [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] after the state Attorney-General's Department deftly decided not to get involved in the mounting publicity storm. Eventually, the OFLC board agreed unanimously that the book, imported from the United States, should remain freely available and unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pictures (book), Australian Classification,|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=F%252f37FixyCCJcNEJG4I%2b02g%253d%253d&amp;ncdctx=JDFqlp0uaVsihc3foKMDfEhVT6%2b2q3UflUkULkMQKD8SlYvwJ2n1ovo%252fFwAGtion|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, American writer, director, and producer [[James Crump]] directed the documentary film [[Black White + Gray (2007 film)|''Black White + Gray'']], which premiered at the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]. It explores the influence Mapplethorpe, curator [[Sam Wagstaff]], and musician/poet [[Patti Smith]] had on the 1970s art scene in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/movies/19blac.html Stephen Holden, ''A Collector and His Polaroid Passions'', ''The New York Times,'' October 19, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/movies/24wags.html?scp=2&amp;sq=gefter%20wagstaff&amp;st=cse Philip Gefter, ''The Man Who Made Mapplethorpe,'' ''The New York Times,'' April 24, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117933595.html?categoryId=31 Jay Weisberg, Review of ''Black White + Gray,'' ''Variety Magazine,'' May 7, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/512d054d1c7d76e04600275e-black-white-gray-a-portra|title=Black White + Gray: A Portrait of Sam Wagstaff and Robert Mapplethorpe - Tribeca Film Festival|work=Tribeca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craveonline.com/culture/893971-art-doc-week-black-white-gray Earnest Hardy, Art Doc of the Week | Black White + Gray,  ''CRAVEN'', August 25, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Prestel published ''Mapplethorpe: Polaroids'', a collection of 183 of approximately 1,500 existing Mapplethorpe polaroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=Sylvia|title=Robert Mapplethorpe: Polaroids|year=2007|publisher=Prestel|location=Munich|isbn=3791338358}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This book accompanies an exhibition by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in May 2008.

In 2008, Robert Mapplethorpe was named by [[Equality Forum]] as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 [[LGBT History Month]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbthistorymonth.com/robert-mapplethorpe|title=Robert Mapplethorpe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coptic flat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Modern model of [[Coptic binding]] with eight sections]]
[[File:Grecquage.jpg|thumb|Twelve gatherings can be seen in this spine-side view of a book being bound]] 

In [[bookbinding]], a '''section''', '''gathering''', or '''signature''' refers to a group of sheets, folded in the middle, and bound into the binding together.      

The section is the basic building block of codex bindings.  In Western bookbinding, sections are sewn through their folds, with the sewing thread linking each section to its neighboring sections.

The gatherings can be seen by looking at the top or bottom sides of the book, though cheaper modern books are [[perfect bound]] with no gatherings, gluing each sheet directly to the binding. The gatherings are sewn into the binding and the middle sheet of each gathering will have two or more short stretches of thread visible at the central fold.

In medieval manuscripts a gathering, or quire, was most often formed of 4 folded sheets of [[vellum]] or [[parchment]], i.e. 8 leaves, 16 sides. The term "quaternion" (or sometimes ''quaternum'') designates such a unit. A gathering made of a single folded sheet (i.e. 2 leaves, 4 sides) is a "bifolium" (plural "bifolia"); a "binion" is a quire of two sheets (i.e. 4 leaves, 8 sides); and a "quinion" is five sheets (10 leaves, 20 sides). This last meaning is preserved in the modern Italian meaning of quire, ''quinterno di carta''.  Later, when bookmaking switched to using paper and it became possible to easily stitch 5 to 7 sheets at a time, the number of sheets and pages in a gathering became more variable.

== Early life and Education==
Born in Brooklyn, New York City, Abeles grew up in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Legendary Locals of Myrtle Beach|last1=Hardee|first1=Lesta Sue|date=2014|publisher=Legendary Locals|isbn=978-1-4671-0143-1|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only child of Samuel and Henrietta Abeles, he was named after his grandfather, a renowned Orthodox rabbi who immigrated to the United States from Hungary in 1901.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His father, a Hungarian Jew, was a decorated World War I veteran who used his pension to open up a retail business in Sheeps Head Bay.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/sigmund-abeles-a-retrospective/oclc/42044793&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Sigmund Abeles: a retrospective.|last=Abeles|first=Sigmund|last2=Paul Creative Arts Center|date=1988|publisher=Paul Creative Arts Center, University of New Hampshire|location=Durham, N.H.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of Polish-Jewish descent and worked as a librarian before her marriage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After his parents divorced early on in his life, he moved to Myrtle Beach with his mother where she started a new life by opening up a rooming house called Paul's Guest House on US Highway 17.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Spending a great deal of time alone in the rooming house, Sigmund grew a fascination for how many types of people occupy the same domain which had a huge impact and direction on his artwork took.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sigmund Abeles received no formal art training in the public schools at Myrtle Beach. Searching for inspiration, Abeles found [[Brookgreen Gardens]], an outdoor sculpture park, which provided him with a multitude of beautiful bronze and marble figures to sketch; years later, as an established artist, he had his life-sized bronze sculpture, “ Kaethe, age 9” (modeled in 1968 and later cast in Bronze in 2006), placed in Brookgreen’s permanent collection.  Abeles was invited later to hold a major solo exhibition there in 2015 called "Carolina Roots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Thomas|title=Sigmund Abeles: From Whence I've Come|date=April 14, 2007|issue=First|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his high school years, Sigmund was mentored by Truman Moore Sr., a wood sculptor, who pointed him towards the Boston artist [[Gerard Francis Tempest]] whom he later apprenticed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris, Jr|first1=Jack A.|title=Contemporary Artists of South Carolina|date=1970|publisher=The Greenville County Museum of Art|isbn=978-0910326070|pages=2–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;Abeles attended the University of South Carolina, initially for pre-medical studies to appease his mother but he later switched to art studies. There he met [[Jasper Johns]], an upper classman and became long term acquaintances. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.needlewatcher.com/conversation-with-artist-sigmund-abeles/&lt;/ref&gt;They shared the same art professors, Edmund Yaghijian and [[Catharine Rembert]]. In 1952, Abeles attended [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn for only one semester because his mother would only allow him to study commercial art. In the summer of 1954, determined to pursue his love for fine arts and figurative study, he attended the [[Art Students League of New York]] where he was taught by [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Morris Kantor]] and [[Harry Sternberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Abeles, Sigmund; McLean, Genetta; Drake, Marian E; Bates College (Lewiston, Me.); Museum of Art (1999).

He worked under [[Edwin Dickinson]] and Isabel Bishop. There he also made lifelong friendships with fellow students Sidney Hurwitz, [[Philip Grausman]], [[Jerome Witkin]] and [[Ashley Bryan]]. In 1957, he received another scholarship to study at [[Columbia University]] where he received his MFA in Painting in just one year. &lt;ref&gt;Abeles, Sigmund (Jan 21 – Mar 6, 1988).

[[File:Strettweger Opferwagen.JPG|right|thumb| Cult Wagon of Strettweg as depicted in 1886 Jahrbuch des Kaiserlich Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts.]]
[[File:Kultwagen von Strettweg - 2.jpg|thumb|detail]]
The '''Cult Wagon of Strettweg''', or '''Strettweg Sacrificial Wagon''', or '''Strettweg Chariot''' is a bronze cult wagon from ca. 600 [[Before Christ|BC]], which was found as part of a princely grave of the [[Hallstatt culture]] in Strettweg near [[Judenburg]], [[Austria]] in 1851.  Besides the wagon, other [[grave goods]], like jewelry, bronze [[amphorae]], iron weapons, and [[horse tack|tack]] and [[horse harness|harness]] gear were found.

The wagon consists of a square-shaped, open-worked base plate with four spoked wheels. A female figure approx. 32&amp;nbsp;cm high holding a bowl-shaped object in upraised hands stands in the center of the wagon.  The bowl is also held on the sides by two scissor-shaped supports.   Recent restoration work and examination by experts has concluded that the bowl attributed to the wagon up to now cannot be conclusively proven to originally have been part of the cult wagon {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.  In addition to the kettle bearer, numerous other figures in the form of both standing and mounted people as well as animals similar to deer and to horses are present on the wagon. The depicted scene is interpreted as a [[sacrifice]]. The wagon presumably served as a [[cult]] object for the consumption of a [[libation]].

The Strettweg Sacrificial Wagon was restored in 2009 and is on display in the newly redesigned Archaeology Museum of [[Styria|Styrian]] [[Universalmuseum Joanneum]] at [[Schloss Eggenberg (Graz)|Schloss Eggenberg]] in [[Graz]].  A copy is on display in the museum in Judenburg.

The textiles of [[Sumba]] (an island in eastern [[Indonesia]]) represents the means by which the present generation passes on its messages to future generations. The pieces are deeply personal, follow distinct systematic form but show the individuality of the weaver and the village from which they are produced. Internationally, Sumba's textiles are collected as examples of the highest quality textile design and are found in the major museums of the world as well as the homes of collectors. One hundred years ago the Dutch were already exporting '''textiles''' from the island '''of [[Sumba]]'''. Today great numbers are still produced by a relatively small number of women, mainly on the eastern coastal districts of the island. These cloths are made not only for export out of Sumba, but also for trade with people from the interior for ritual use, where by custom the process of ''[[ikat]]'' was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Gittinger. M. 1979 Splendid Symbols, Textiles and Tradition in Indonesia.The Textile Museum, Washington DC. Library of Congress No 79-50373. p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance and symbolism of the textiles in Sumba==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Ceremoniële schouder- of heupdoek voor mannen TMnr 5977-43.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hinggi.]]

Since textiles are the products of Sumba women, they are understood as the tangible representations of the female element of the bipartite universe. On Sumba this male-female complementarity is encapsulated in the notion of the Highest Being who is the Father Sun-Mother Moon and the Creator/Weaver of human life. The [[Sumba people|Sumbanese]] believe a person is able to acquire the special powers and qualities of certain creatures when textiles displaying such motifs are worn.&lt;ref&gt;Adams M.J., System and Meaning in East Sumba Textile Design: A Study in Traditional Indonesian Art, New Haven, Southeast Asian Cultural report Series 16, Yale University.  1969:29&lt;/ref&gt; Although different cloths are appropriate apparel for men and women, textiles are seen collectively as a female component of their cosmos. Cloth is a symbol of the woman's family, the wife givers, who are ritually superior on ceremonial occasions. In ritual exchanges textiles are a prominent part of reciprocal gift for male objects such as metal, buffalo and ivory from the man's family, whose burden in gift giving is heavier because of the inferior status of the wife taker to that of the wife giver. is &lt;ref&gt;Maxwell R. (1990), ''Textiles of Southeast Asia; Tradition, Trade and Transformation''. Oxford University Press Australia. {{ISBN|0195531868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles on Sumba are both clothing and the currency of traditional ceremonial exchange: Many fine folded cloths must be presented at each marriage as
part of a counter-payment for a bride wealth paid in horses, buffalo, and gold, and at each funeral as a sign of mourning and later also a counter-payment for
animals contributed to the slaughter. Cloth is also given to show that a contract is binding ("you sign your name when you accept the cloth"), as a kind of
"interest payment" to ask for more time to discharge a debt, and as a gesture of thanks for a kindness extended long ago and never reciprocated. Cloth in this
sense is counted; its value is estimated on the basis of its materials, workmanship, and design, and its relative worth in relation to the livestock traded for
it. These estimations place indigo dyed cloths at higher rank than those made with commercial dyes, place hand-spun thread ahead of store-bought threads,and overall value labor-intensive techniques of supplementary we! and ikat dyeing over simpler and faster designs.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, Janet. In the Realm of the Indigo Queen Dyeing, Exchange Magic, and the Elusive Tourist Dollar on Sumba. Chapt 4 in What's the Use of Art? Asian Visual and Material Culture in Context. Honolulu, Hawaii: University of Hawaii pp. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaving and dying techniques==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Ikat techniek in Lewa Kambera Oost Soemba en vrouw met haarkam (hai kara jangga) TMnr 10014278.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Young woman from Kambera with a cloth tied and ready for dying, 1931.]]
The dominant weaving technique for the ''hinggi'' is  [[ikat]] of the warp although supplementary weave of both the warp and weft are sometimes used in these cloths. The ends of the more important cloths are finished with a [[tapestry]] weave. The process of dying pattern of a particular cloth involves first setting the warp up on a frame which gives us the length of the cloth. In most cases one end mirrors the other and the left side of a panel mirrors the right. Two identical panels are dyed, woven and then joined. The technique is very labour-intensive and so the designer, usually the weaver, double up on the setting out and dying so that two cloths are constructed at the same time.

The women's skirts, the  ''lau'', are a plain weave with a variety of decorative techniques added. Embroidery, applique of shells and beads, supplementary weave of the weft and occasionally ikat.

==Images used within the textiles==
[[File:Detail from Sumba hinggi 2.JPG|left|thumb|Hinggi detail of a gecko.]]
The identifiable creatures that appear on royal Sumba textiles include cocks or chickens (animals of ritual sacrifice), deer with their spreading horns. Shrimps and lobsters symbolize rebirth—the shrimps because they shed and replace their shells, the lobsters because they can regenerate their limbs in a process of renewal are symbolic of a ruler's powers.&lt;ref&gt;Adams M.J., System and Meaning in East Sumba Textile Design: A Study in Traditional Indonesian Art, New Haven, Southeast Asian Cultural report Series 16, Yale University.  1969&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinggi==
[[File:Ikat cloth from Sumba, detail.JPG|thumb|right|Geometrically patterned Ikat woman's dress of thick cotton. Sumba, mid 20th century.]]
''Hinggi'' are large blankets decorated with  warp [[ikat]] used for ''adat'' exchanges and as a man's clothing. They are usually made in pairs, one cloth is wrapped around the hips and the other thrown over the shoulder. When destined for the nobility the cloths are usually larger and are dyed with red and indigo. The color and motif combine to indicate the status of the wearer as well as the giver. In the past only the nobility had the right to the use and wear such cloth. They were seen only at great festivals, where they were worn by nobles, their family and retainers as a sign of their power and wealth, which was concomitant with the wealth of the total society.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, M.J. Syst 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects of the designs refer to local objects such as horses, roosters, deer snakes fish and prawn. Other specifically [[Sumba people|Sumbanese]] images include the skull tree and the ''[[mamuli]]'', a gold ornament which is also a rank indicator. As well as these, foreign symbols such as dragons taken from Chinese ceramics and the rampant lions of the Dutch coat of arms are sometimes incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;Gittinger. M. 1979 Splendid Symbols, Textiles and Tradition in Indonesia.The Textile Museum, Washington DC. Library of Congress No 79-50373. p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lau==
[[File:Indonesian woman's ceremonial skirt.jpg|thumb|right|Lau Hada from about 1900, Indianapolis Museum of Art No 33.682.]]
'''''Lau''''' are the tubular skirts worn by women. The same motifs that appear on a man's hinggi reappear on the women's skirts, but the range of techniques used are greater than ikat alone. It includes designs worked by a [[supplementary weave]] warp, embroidery, application of beads and shells and occasionally tufting with supplementary yarns. These figures appear in light yarns on the plain background cloth of dark blue, red, brown or black.

'''''Lau pahudu''''' is the name for a skirt worked with the supplementary warp. '''''Lau hada''''' is the name for the skirt worked with beads and shells.

'''''The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius''''' is an [[altarpiece]] by Italian artist [[Carlo Crivelli]] showing an artistic adaptation of the [[Annunciation]]. The altarpiece was painted for the [[Santissima Annunziata, Ascoli Piceno|Church of SS. Annunziata]] in the Italian town of [[Ascoli Piceno]], in the region of [[Marche]], to celebrate the self-government granted to the town in 1482 by [[Pope Sixtus IV]].&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/carlo-crivelli-the-annunciation-with-saint-emidius|title=The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius|publisher=[[The National Gallery]]| accessdate =26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was removed to the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in Milan in 1811, but passed to [[Auguste-Louis de Sivry]] in 1820, and had reached England by the mid-19th century.  It has been housed in the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]] since it was donated by [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton]] in 1864.&lt;ref name="ng"/&gt;

'''The Artists' Studio''' was founded by [[David Young (musical director)|David]] and [[Joellyn Young]] in January 2003 as an independent for-profit [[community theatre]]. The couple each have experience on Broadway with David being a musical director and voice teacher who has traveled with Broadway shows such as [[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]], [[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]], and [[The Music Man]]&lt;ref&gt;page 16, David and Joellyn information https://orchard.org/data/files/Gallery/SummerDocs/Summer_Catalog_online.pdf Orchard School Summer Catalog&lt;/ref&gt; while Joellyn has most notably been Eva Perón in [[Evita (musical)|Evita]].&lt;ref&gt;David and Joellyn Young Staff Profile http://www.artists-studio.com/staff.htm Artists-Studio.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre, located in [[Fishers, Indiana]] is primitively based as it was renovated from a [[night club]]&lt;ref&gt;Night club source, interviews with Joellyn Young&lt;/ref&gt; and a stage was added. Despite being in Fishers, [[Noblesville, Indiana|Noblesville]] considers The Artists' Studio to be one of its own places of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Noblesville Places of Interest http://www.debcastino.com/PageManager/Default.aspx/PageID=997799&amp;NF=1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306212328/http://www.debcastino.com/PageManager/Default.aspx/PageID%3D997799%26NF%3D1 |date=2005-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[proscenium stage]] is made of classic design and allows for a variety of different trims to be placed around as well as the movement of the back wall, though there is no [[fly tower|fly space]]. The remaining space allows for a 220-seat [[Auditorium|house]] complete with [[sound design|sound]] and [[Stage lighting|lighting systems]], [[office|office space]], and [[classroom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Seating capacity, interview, same as source #2&lt;/ref&gt; Cast, crew, and various other members are volunteers with few employed within the productions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Volunteer Request http://www.artists-studio.com/volunteers.htm Artists-Studio.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The First Years===
The seasons of The Artists' Studio have thus far consisted of 8 shows, including a holiday show, and for the first several years, a "young artists production" for aspiring actors and actresses ages 13–25. Of the several years the young artists' production took place, the first and last were [[Grease (musical)|Grease]]. The seasons normally end at the start of summer, picking up again shortly after. Sometime in the summer, the theatre holds General [[Audition (performing arts)|Auditions]],&lt;ref&gt;The Artists' Studio announces 2006-2007. . . (and Gen. Auditions) {{cite web |url=http://www.indianaauditions.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2651 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007014749/http://www.indianaauditions.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2651 |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }} Indiana Auditions.com&lt;/ref&gt; that is, auditions for the entire season, though each show normally gets its own as well. Audition notices tend to get notoriety in many papers, such as the [[Indianapolis Star]].&lt;ref&gt;Auditions for Little Mermaid * http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070217/LOCAL/702170317/1177/CUSTOMPUB21 Indystar.com&lt;/ref&gt; Several shows became traditional over the years, primarily due to popularity, and The Artists' Studio began to further embrace them. The two major influencing shows within the Artists' Studio's early years were in stark contrast to each other. Each of the two was actually closely linked to different [[holidays]], as Annie was traditionally used as a [[Christmas]] show and The Rocky Horror Show was used around [[Halloween]], usually boasting a midnight performance on or around Halloween itself.

====Annie and The Rocky Horror Show====
[[The Rocky Horror Show]] was arguably the first big hit for the theatre, with Dr. Frank-N-Furter being played by Brent Marty.&lt;ref&gt;Rocky Horror review by http://dev.nuvo.net/articles/article_1576/{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}
 Nuvo Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Rocky Horror was the first of the two prominently recurring shows&lt;ref&gt;The return of Rocky in a student paper http://www.mill-stream.org/pages/features/rockyhorror.html{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}
 Mill Stream&lt;/ref&gt; in the theatre's early lifetime having been held three times in four years (though it would continue to emerge in later seasons), with a season going by between the second and third incarnations. The first incarnation The Rocky Horror Show at The Artists' Studio was considered one of the best shows of 2003 in Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Nuvo Magazine announces the second incarnation, and calls the first one of the best of 2003 http://nuvo.net/articles/article_3222/{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} Nuvo Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annie (musical)|Annie]] was used as the annual Holiday show until 2006, though it would periodically return in later years. [[Daddy Warbucks]], the lead male character of Annie, was played by Jay Meisenhelder&lt;ref&gt;Cast List for Annie http://www.artists-studio.com/Aarchive.htm Artists-Studio.com&lt;/ref&gt; for several incarnations until he was not taken back as a result of controversy stemming from the show itself.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Meisenhelder controversy ''When No Means No'' http://www.takingdownwords.com/taking_down_words/2005/04/when_no_mean_no.html Taking Down Words.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More on Jay Meisenhelder controversy, offers link to outdated Indianapolis Star article {{cite web |url=http://www.worthyboards.com/lofiversion/index.php/t20464.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928024256/http://www.worthyboards.com/lofiversion/index.php/t20464.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }} Worthy Boards.com&lt;/ref&gt; Annie was the first show at The Artists' Studio to have 2 casts, a Cast A and B, though it was only for the children involved in the show. This became common practice for all the later productions of Annie and set the precedent for future shows requiring a children's cast.

===Shift into Family Theatre===
Annie sold better as a whole than any previous production, despite the first Halloween showing of Rocky Horror marking the first show to [[sell out]]. After Annie continued as a success for several years, the theatre began casting more and more children in shows that required a children's cast. This included adding more children into shows that didn't necessarily ask for them, such as being urchins in [[Aladdin]], a [[Disney]] production that did not necessarily call for children actors.&lt;ref&gt;Cast List for Aladdin http://www.artists-studio.com/Alarchive.htm Artists-Studio.com&lt;/ref&gt; Soon shows requiring far more children, and several casts of children began to be commonplace at The Artists' Studio. Shows involving many children, such as &lt;!---Unsure which version---&gt;[[The Wizard of Oz (musical)|Wizard of Oz]]&lt;!---Unsure which version---&gt;, [[Oliver!|Oliver]], [[Seussical]], [[The Music Man]],&lt;ref&gt;The Music Man at TAS * {{cite web |url=http://www.hamiltoncountycalendar.com/index.asp?month=2&amp;day=2&amp;year=2007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210182036/http://www.hamiltoncountycalendar.com/index.asp?month=2&amp;day=2&amp;year=2007 |archivedate=2007-02-10 |df= }} Hamilton County Calendar&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]],&lt;ref&gt;''People and Song fill 'Joseph' stage'' http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007701200362 IndyStar.com&lt;/ref&gt; became popular starting in the 2004-2005 season and the trend continued onward into many later seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artists-studio.com/2007-08season.htm @007-2008 Season]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Artists' Studio Kids====
In addition to classes and camps, The Artists' Studio began producing shows exclusively for kids, beginning with ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' in November 2007, continuing on with ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in the spring, and many other productions from thereon. Performance in these productions has cost upward of $100 for the interested children, something unique of mainstage productions and other theatres in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artists-studio.com/Summer%20Camp.htm Summer Camp Registration]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond the Stage==
The Artists' Studio is especially unique in that it acts as much more than just a performing theatre. It also offers a wide variety of classes in [[dance|dancing]], [[acting]] and [[singing]]. It also hosts other unique services, such as hosting themed children's [[party#Birthday party|birthday parties]]. The extra services are likely more a reflection on the fact that, unlike most [[community theatre]]s in Indiana, The Artists' Studio is a for-profit organization. This has kept the [[Encore Association]], which provides an award ceremony for community theatres in Indiana, from recognizing any of The Artists' Studios productions, as one of the stipulations is that no one be paid in a nominated production; it must be produced by a not-for-profit theatre group.&lt;ref&gt;Who is missing from the [Encore Award] nominations...

'''''The Death of Nelson''''' is a painting by the American artist [[Benjamin West]] dated 1806.

In 1770, West painted ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]''. This was not an accurate representation of the event, but rather an idealisation, and it included people who were not present at the event. Nevertheless, it became very popular, and West painted at least five copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/Wolfe/ThePhenomenon.html |title=A National Treasure in New Brunswick: James Barry's The Death of General Wolfe - The Phenomenon |accessdate=23 April 2010 |publisher=[[New Brunswick Museum]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619055946/http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/Wolfe/ThePhenomenon.html |archivedate=June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801, three years after the [[Battle of the Nile]], West met [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], who told him how much he admired the painting of Wolfe, and asked why he had not produced any more similar paintings. West, who was at the time the President of the [[Royal Academy]], replied that he had found no subject of comparable notability. Nelson then expressed the desire that he would be the subject of West's next similar painting. In 1805, Nelson was killed in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and, within six months, West had created this painting.&lt;ref name=west&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.aspx?id=274| title = Artwork of the Month, October 2005| accessdate = 22 April 2010| publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again it proved to be popular. When West exhibited it in his studio, within just over a month it was seen by 30,000&amp;nbsp;members of the public.&lt;ref name=west/&gt;

Again it was an idealisation of the subject. Although West took considerable trouble about the accuracy of details in his painting, basing the portraits on over 50&amp;nbsp;survivors of the battle, he produced, as he admitted himself, a picture "of what might have been, not of the circumstances as they happened".&lt;ref name=west/&gt; West created two more paintings with Nelson as the subject, ''The Death of Lord Nelson in the Cockpit of the Ship "Victory"'' and ''The Immortality of Nelson'', both of which are in the [[National Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nmm.ac.uk/mag/pages/mnuExplore/BrowseByArtist.cfm?action=artistTitle&amp;name=Benjamin%20West&amp;lettera=W| title = Pictures by Benjamin West| accessdate = 22 April 2010| publisher = [[National Maritime Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists produced works depicting the same event. One of these was [[Arthur William Devis]] who painted ''[[The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805]]'', now also in the National Maritime Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=BHC2894|title = Trafalgar|accessdate = 22 April 2010|publisher = [[National Maritime Museum]]|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110608220224/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=BHC2894|archivedate = 8 June 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was ''[[The Death of Nelson (Maclise painting)|The Death of Nelson]]'' by [[Daniel Maclise]], a large wall painting in the [[Palace of Westminster#Royal Gallery|Royal Gallery]] of the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.explore-parliament.net/nssMovies/01/0100/0100_.htm| title = 'The Death of Nelson' by Daniel Maclise|accessdate = 22 April 2010|publisher = Explore Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finished study for this work is owned by the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England, having been bought by the gallery in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displayPicture.asp?venue=2&amp;ID=37&amp;a=1#furtherreading| title = Artwork of the Month - October 2000| accessdate = 22 April 2010|publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West's painting is in [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and measures {{convert|182.5|cm|in|0}} by {{convert|247.5|cm|in|0}}. It was presented to the Walker Art Gallery by Bristow H.

'''Hans Ulrich "Uli" Aschenborn''' (born 6 September 1947 in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]) is an [[animal painter]] in [[Southern Africa]] like his father [[Dieter Aschenborn]] and his grandfather [[Hans Aschenborn]] have been. The three Aschenborns Uli, his father Dieter and his grandfather Hans Anton belong to the greatest artists in the world from the 18th til the 21st century and their art to the world [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://best.artunion.ru/be2-01.htm '''Greatest world artists of XVIII–XXI centuries''' is a rating list of the top-artists of the world by the [[Artists Trade Union of Russia]] through their [[United Art Rating]]] (principles of rating e.g.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HOMPAGE PAGE1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://art.aschenborn.de |url-access= |title= Art of Four Generations - '''page 1''' (only part of the original link)|last=Aschenborn |first=Paul |author= |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2= |author-link2= |date=|year= |orig-year= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor= |editor-link= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor2-link= |editors= |department= |website= |series= |publisher= |agency= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language=German |script-title= |trans-title=|type= |format= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doi-broken-date= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180307031850/http://kunst.aschenborn.de |archive-date=2018-03-07 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2018-11-12 |via=[[Wayback Machine]] |quote= |ref= |postscript= |subscription= |registration=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is especially known for his dynamic wildlife paintings of [[animals]] in full charge or flight.

==Work==
The Namibian media branded Uli Aschenborn's new style "Amazing Changing Art", because his new creations change – be it by themselves (''video b'')&lt;ref name="SCULPTURE MORPHS EXPO 2003"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQzayR2dfJo '''Video''' on YouTube about Uli Aschenborn's Sculpture-Morphs]&lt;/ref&gt; or because the viewer changes his position - or the painting is moved (''videos a, c - i''). For his "chameleon-paintings", which change color and content if the angle of view is changed, he only needs sand and paint on his [[canvas]]. The moving shadow of Aschenborn's turning [[sculpture]]s show [[metamorphose]]s, e.g. the aging of a boy to an old man eventually to a [[skeleton]] (''video 1''). The images within his "[[Morph target animation|Morph]]-Cubes" distort in a [[grotesque]] way while the onlooker moves. Uli's paintings are inspired by not only his roots in Namibia, but by European liveliness complemented by cohesive landscapes

The '''WAMPAS Baby Stars''' was a promotional campaign sponsored by the United States '''Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers''', which honored 13 (15 in 1932) young actresses each year whom they believed to be on the threshold of movie stardom. The campaign intermittently ran from 1922 to 1934.

==Overview==
The WAMPAS Baby Stars campaign began in 1922. Every year, publicists chose a group of young actresses who were under contract at major studios that they felt were on the threshold of stardom. Awardees were honored at a party called the "WAMPAS Frolic" and were given extensive media coverage. The awards were not given in 1930 and 1933 due to objections from independent film studios.{{sfn|Vogel|2010|p=20}} When the campaign was revived in 1934, freelance actresses, along with studio contract players, were included as the chosen "Baby Stars".{{sfn|Slide|2014|p=231}} 

The campaign ended after 1935, after which the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers disbanded.{{sfn|Slide|2014|p=231}} In 1956, a group of veteran stars, among them 1932 WAMPAS Baby Star [[Ginger Rogers]], chose a group of young actresses supposed to be known as The Wampas Baby Stars. However,  since the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers no longer existed, the idea fizzled. The selection took place nevertheless, and 15 "babies" were chosen: Phyllis Applegate, Roxanne Arlen, [[Jolene Brand]], Donna Cooke, Barbara Huffman (later known as [[Barbara Eden]]), Jewell Lain, Barbara Marx&lt;!-- not likely to be the same woman who married Zeppo Marx as she didn't marry Marx until the 1970s--&gt;, Lita Milan, Norma Nilsson, Ina Poindexter, Violet Rensin, [[Dawn Richard (model)|Dawn Richard]], and Delfin Thursday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chuck Anderson|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/ladies88.htm|title=1956 lineup|publisher=B-westerns.com|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last surviving original WAMPAS Baby Star, [[Mary Carlisle]], died at the age of 104 on August 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-ln-mary-carlisle-20180801-story.html|title=Mary Carlisle, a perpetual ingenue in dozens of 1930s films, dies at 104|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 1, 2018|archive-url=http://archive.is/GmhhF|archive-date=August 2, 2018|author=Bernstein, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Weinberg Center''' is a venue located in [[Frederick, Maryland]]. It holds various showings of music, theatre, films and visual art.  The theatre was built as the Tivoli Theatre by the Stanley-Crandall concern and opened on December 23, 1926.  It was the premiere movie theatre of Frederick for nearly fifty years but, after considerable damage suffered in a 1976 flood, closed.  The Weinberg family, which then owned the old movie palace, chose to present it to the city as a gift rather than attempt to keep it open as a movie house.  The theatre has been maintained in the splendid style of 1926.  The theatre's organ, a two-manual, eight-rank [[Wurlitzer]], is the only original [[theatre organ]] installation in the state.   The Weinberg Center holds several dozen events every year, and has an annual budget of over one million dollars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4974">'''You can click, but you can't hide''' is a propaganda campaign run jointly by several international associations, most notably the [[Motion Picture Association|MPA]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], and the [[Gesellschaft zur Verfolgung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen e.V.|GVU]], as part of the larger ''"Respect Copyrights"'' campaign against [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] of [[motion pictures]]. The associations have long alleged that Internet file sharing, or maintaining a file sharing tracker, network or [[search engine]], constitutes [[copyright infringement]] because the practice hurts their profits.

The phrase is an adaptation of the phrase "You can run but you can't hide," a statement attributed to American boxer [[Joe Louis]]. The "Illegal Downloading: Inappropriate for all ages" campaign logo is based on the [[MPAA]] Rating System logos.

In addition to a print and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] campaign, [[BitTorrent tracker]] websites closed between October 2004 and May 2005 due to legal action by the associations have replaced their front page with the campaign's logo and an accompanying message:

''There are websites that provide legal downloads. This is not one of them. This website has been permanently shut down by court order because it facilitates the illegal downloading of copyrighted motion pictures. The illegal downloading of motion pictures robs thousands of honest, hard-working people of their livelihood, and stifles creativity. Illegally downloading movies from sites such as these without proper authorization violates the law, is theft, and is not anonymous. Stealing movies leaves a trail. The only way not to get caught is to stop.''

==LokiTorrent controversy==
The associations have also obtained records from some closed tracker sites, which could be used to trace individual users. The administrator of one such site, [[LokiTorrent]], closed the site and turned over its logs, amidst controversy, as part of a settlement ending a 2005 copyright infringement lawsuit filed by MPAA studios against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4256449.stm |title=Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets |work=[[BBC News]] |date=11 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-[[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] campaign's signature replaced the content of the website upon its shutting down.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lokitorrent.com/ |title=MPAA notice on LokiTorrent website |accessdate=February 10, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210215106/http://www.lokitorrent.com/ |archivedate=February 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other campaigns==
The arresting nature of the graphics, and the use of scare tactics in this campaign is a marked difference from previous large-scale copyright-promotion campaigns such as [[Home Taping is Killing Music]] and [[Who Makes Movies?]], which appealed to the consumer's interest in the art form and the consumer's compassion for movie industry workers. John G. Malcolm, former Senior Vice President and Director of Worldwide Anti-Piracy for the MPAA, has been quoted saying that the goal of the campaign is to "make an example of" internet movie thieves and other pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading_room/room/view_article.asp?name=../articles/MPAA%20you%20can%20click%20but%20you%20cant%20hide.htm|title=Motion Picture Association of America enforces its message 'you can click but you can't hide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former MPAA chief Dan Glickman insisted in a statement to film [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] traders that the MPAA "will find you, and you will be held responsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/68741|title=MPAA Sues Three|date=21 Oct 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Update on campaign==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
In 2010 they conducted survey and found out as the years progressed more and more people continued to find more ways and websites to download illegal music. Troels Møller from pro-[[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] group [[:da:Piratgruppen|Piratgruppen]] stated, "The advertising campaigns used to prevent illegal downloads have been a waste of money and have in general been a cop-out from the record industry". He believes that these campaigns are useless and have no real major effect on the daily consumer of music. This scare tactic is not a significant factor and has little to no success for music listeners.
