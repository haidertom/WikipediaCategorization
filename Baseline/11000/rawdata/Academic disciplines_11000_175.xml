"'''A Cyborg Manifesto'''" is an essay written by [[Donna Haraway]] and published in 1985. In it, the concept of the cyborg is a rejection of rigid boundaries, notably those separating "human" from "animal" and "human" from "machine." She writes: "The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust."&lt;ref name="fulltext" /&gt;

The ''Manifesto'' criticizes traditional notions of feminism, particularly feminist focuses on [[identity politics]], and encouraging instead coalition through affinity. She uses the metaphor of a cyborg to urge feminists to move beyond the limitations of traditional gender, feminism, and politics; consequently, the "Manifesto" is considered one of the milestones in the development of feminist [[posthumanist]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrando|first=Francesca|title=Posthumanism|journal=Kilden Journal of Gender Research|date=2014|volume=2|pages=168–172|url=https://www.academia.edu/8041656/POSTHUMANISM|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major points==
[[File:Donna Haraway and Cayenne.jpg|thumb|Haraway, the author, in 2006]]
Haraway begins the ''Manifesto'' by explaining three boundary breakdowns since the 20th Century that have allowed for her hybrid, cyborg myth: the breakdown of boundaries between human and animal, animal-human and machine, and physical and non-physical. Evolution has blurred the lines between human and animal; 20th Century machines have made ambiguous the lines between natural and artificial; and microelectronics and the political invisibility of cyborgs have confused the lines of physicality.&lt;ref name="fulltext"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120214194015/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html Full text of the article "Cyborg Manifesto"] (an archived copy, in the [[Wayback Machine]]).  It is the full text of the article: {{cite book|last=Haraway|first=Donna Jeanne|authorlink=Donna Haraway|title=Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|chapter=A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century|isbn=0415903866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues with Western patriarchal tenets===
Haraway highlights the problematic use and justification of Western traditions like [[patriarchy]], [[colonialism]], [[essentialism]], and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] (among others). These traditions in turn allow for the problematic formations of taxonomies (and identifications of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]) and what Haraway explains as "antagonistic dualisms" that order Western discourse. These dualisms, Haraway states, "have all been systematic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals... all [those] constituted as others." She highlights specific problematic dualisms of self/other, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man (among others). She explains that these dualisms are in competition with one another, creating paradoxical relations of domination (especially between the One and the Other). However, high-tech culture provides a challenge to these antagonistic dualisms.

===Cyborg theory===
Haraway's cyborg theory rejects the notions of essentialism, proposing instead a chimeric, monstrous world of fusions between animal and machine. Cyborg theory relies on writing as "the technology of cyborgs," and asserts that "cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism." Instead, Haraway’s cyborg calls for a non-essentialized, material-semiotic metaphor capable of uniting diffuse political coalitions along the lines of affinity rather than identity. Following Lacanian feminists such as Luce Irigaray, Haraway’s work addresses the chasm between feminist discourses and the dominant language of Western patriarchy. As Haraway explains, “grammar is politics by other means,” and effective politics require speaking in the language of domination.&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

As she details in a chart of the paradigmatic shifts from modern to postmodern epistemology within the Manifesto, the unified human subject of identity has shifted to the hybridized posthuman of technoscience, from “representation” to “simulation,” “bourgeois novel” to “science fiction,” “reproduction” to “replication,” and “white capitalist patriarchy” to “informatics of domination.”&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt; While Haraway’s “ironic dream of a common language” is inspired by Irigaray’s argument for a discourse other than patriarchy, she rejects Irigaray’s essentializing construction of woman-as-not-male to argue for a linguistic community of situated, partial knowledges in which no one is innocent.

===Criticism of traditional feminism===
Haraway takes issue with some traditional feminists, reflected in statements describing how "women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemological (relating to the theory of knowledge) position potentially." The views of traditional feminism operate under the totalizing assumptions that all men are one way, and women another, whereas "a cyborg theory of wholes and parts," does not desire to explain things in total theory. Haraway suggests that feminists should move beyond naturalism and essentialism, criticizing feminist tactics as "identity politics" that victimize those excluded, and she proposes that it is better strategically to confuse identities. 
Her criticism mainly focuses on socialist and radical feminism. The former, she writes, achieves "to expand the category of labour to what (some) women did" Socialist feminism does not naturalize but rather builds a unity that was non-existent before -namely the woman worker.
On the other hand, radical feminism, according to Catherine MacKinnon, describes a world in which the woman only exists in opposition to the man. The concept of woman is socially constructed within the patriarchal structure of society and woman only exist because men have made them exist. The woman as a self does not exist. 
Haraway criticizes both when writing that "my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice" and "MacKinnon's intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the 'essential' non-existence of women is not reassuring" (299).  H&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

Haraway also indirectly critiques [[white feminism]] by highlighting the struggles of women of color: she suggests that a woman of color “might be understood as a cyborg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities and in the complex political-historical layerings of her ‘biomythography.’"&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

To counteract the essentializing and anachronistic rhetoric of spiritual ecofeminists, who were fighting patriarchy with modernist constructions of female-as-nature and earth mothers, Haraway employs the cyborg to refigure feminism into cybernetic code.

===Call to action===
Haraway calls for a revision of the concept of gender, moving away from Western patriarchal essentialism and toward "the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender," stating that "Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth."&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

Haraway also calls for a reconstruction of identity, no longer dictated by naturalism and [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] but instead by affinity, wherein individuals can construct their own groups by choice. In this way, groups may construct a "post-modernist identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity" as a way to counter Western traditions of exclusive identification.

== Updates and revisions ==
Although Haraway's metaphor of the cyborg has been labelled as a post-gender statement, Haraway has clarified her stance on [[post-genderism]] in some interviews.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Haraway Reader|last=Haraway|first=Donna|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-96688-4|location=|pages=321–341|chapter='Cyborgs, Coyotes, and Dogs: A Kinship of Feminist Figurations' and 'There are Always More Things Going on Than You Thought! Methodologies as Thinking Technologies'|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She acknowledges that her argument in the ''Manifesto ''seeks to challenge the necessity for categorization of gender, but does not correlate this argument to post-genderism. She clarifies this distinction because post-genderism is often associated with the discourse of the utopian concept of being beyond masculinity and femininity. Haraway notes that gender constructs are still prevalent and meaningful, but are troublesome and should therefore be eliminated as categories for identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Applications of ''The Cyborg''==
Although Donna Haraway intended her concept of the cyborg to be a feminist critique, she acknowledges that other scholars and popular media have taken her concept and applied it to different contexts. Haraway is aware and receptive of the different uses of her concept of the cyborg, but admits "very few people are taking what I consider all of its parts".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]]'' overlooked the feminist theory of the cyborg and instead used it to make a more literal commentary about the enmeshment of humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kunzru|first=Hari|title=You Are Cyborg|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffharaway_pr.html|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Haraway also recognizes  that new feminist scholars "embrace and use the cyborg of the manifesto to do what they want for their own purposes".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== "Patchwork Girl" ===
[[File:Shelley Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shelley Jackson]], author of ''Patchwork Girl.'']]

[[Patchwork Girl (hypertext)|Patchwork Girl]], a hypertext work, makes use of elements from ''Cyborg Manifesto''. ''Patchwork Girl's'' "thematic focus on the connections between monstrosity, subjectivity, and new reproductive technologies is apparent from its very first page, when readers, or users, open the hypertext to find a picture of a scarred and naked female body sewn together with a single dotted line...Readers enter the text by clicking on this body and following its 'limbs' or links to different sections of the text."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Jackson's narrative, the Patchwork Girl is an aborted female monster created by [[Victor Frankenstein]] of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus]], ''is an abhorrent and monstrous creature that is "part male, part female, part animal, 175 years old, and 'razed' up through hypertext technology."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The monster, following her destruction by Victor, is sewn back together by [[Mary Shelley]] herself, while simultaneously becoming Mary's lover; she is thus, "a cyborg who is queer, dis-proportioned, and visibly scarred. She both facilitates and undermines preoccupations with the benefits and dangers of reproductive technologies by embracing all of the monstrosities that reproductive/fetal screenings are imagined to 'catch' and one day prevent."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Patchwork Girl embraces Haraway's conception of a cybernetic posthuman being in both her physical multiplicity and her challenge towards "the images and fantasies sustaining reproductive politics."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== "Cyborg Goddesses" ===
Turkish critical scholar Leman Giresunlu uses Haraway's cyborg as framework to examine current science fiction movies such as ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]] ''and [[Resident Evil]] in her essay "Cyborg Goddesses: The Mainframe Revisited".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giresunlu|first=Leman|title=Cyborg Goddesses: The Mainframe Revisited|journal=At the Interface / Probing the Boundaries|year=2009|pages=157–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this essay, she explores how her new concept of the ''cyborg goddess, ''a female figure "capable of inflicting pain and pleasure simultaneously",'' '' can be used to make sense of how female representation is shifting towards a more multidimensional stance. Giresunlu builds from Haraway's cyborg because the ''cyborg goddess'' goes beyond "offering a way out from [the] duality" and instead provides how spirituality and technology work together to form a complex and more accurate representation of women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== "Mind Over Matter" ===
In her essay "Mind Over Matter: Mental Evolution and Physical Devolution in The Incredible Shrinking Man", American critical scholar Ruthellen Cunnally uses Haraway's cyborg to help make sense of how Robert Scott Carey, the protagonist of ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'', transforms into a cyborg in the midst of a metaphor of cold war politics in his home. As Robert continues to shrink, the gendered power dynamic between him and his wife Louise shifts from "the realm of husband/wife into the mode of mother/son".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cunnally|first=Ruthellen|title=Mind Over Matter: Mental Evolution and Physical Devolution in The Incredible Shrinking Man|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|date=March 2013|doi=10.1080/01956051.2012.674070|volume=41|pages=2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Robert finds himself lost in the feminine space of the basement, an area of the house that was reserved for Louise's domestic duties of sewing and washing, he is forced to fight for his life and reclaim his masculinity. Although he is able to conquer some of his foes and regain his "manhood", the gender lines do not become established again because there is no one to share and implement the gendered power structure with. Robert's transformation presents "an existence in which acceptance and meaning are released from the limitations of patriarchal dualisms", which aligns with Haraway's cyborg.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Traditional feminists have criticized "A Cyborg Manifesto" as anti-feminist because it denies any commonalities of the female experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In the ''Manifesto,'' Haraway writes "there is nothing about being 'female' that naturally binds women",&lt;ref name="fulltext" /&gt; which goes against a defining characteristic of traditional feminism that calls women to join together in order to advocate for members of their gender.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Criticism and controversy were built into the essay's publication history: the East Coast Collective of the ''[[Socialist Review]]'' found the piece "a naive embrace of technology" and advocated against its publication, while The Berkeley Collective ultimately insisted that it go to print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Indiana|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay has been described as "controversial" and "viral" in its circulation through multiple academic departments and disciplinary boundaries, contributing to the critical discourse on its claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Joseph|title=Haraway's Viral Cyborg|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=Summer 2012|volume=40|issue=1/2|page=295|jstor=23333459}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This controversiality was matched by its omnipresence; Jackie Orr, Associate Professor of Sociology at the [[Maxwell School of Syracuse University]], writes, "It is hard to be a feminist graduate student in the U.S. humanities or social sciences after 1985 and not be touched in some way by the cyborg manifesto."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Jackie|title=Materializing a Cyborg's Manifesto|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=Summer 2012|volume=40|issue=1/2|page=276|jstor=23333457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid adoption of the article in academic circles also increased the pace of the critical conversation surrounding the work, and in 1990, Haraway felt that the essay had "acquired a surprise half life," which made it "impossible to rewrite" and necessitated revisiting the topic in her subsequent publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandy|first1=Matthew|title=The Persistence of Complexity: Re-reading Donna Haraway's ''Cyborg Manifesto''|journal=AA Files|date=2010|volume=60|page=42|jstor=41378495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critiques of "A Cyborg Manifesto" focus on a basic level of reader comprehension and writing style, such as Orr's observation that "undergraduate students in a science and technology class find the cyborg manifesto curiously relevant but somewhat impenetrable to read." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Jackie|title=Materializing a Cyborg's Manifesto|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=Summer 2012|volume=40|issue=1/2|page=275|jstor=23333457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamner, M. Gail. "The Work of Love: Feminist Politics and the Injunction to Love." ''Opting for the Margins: Postmodernity and Liberation in Christian Theology.'' [[Joerg Rieger]], ed. Oxford University Press. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This is corroborated by Helen Merrick and Margret Grebowicz's observation that scientists who reviewed ''Primate Visions'' had similar issues, particularly as related to Haraway's use of irony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grebowicz|first1=Margret|last2=Merrick|first2=Helen|title=Beyond the Cyborg: Adventures with Donna Haraway.|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York: NY|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWm0w4x1fDEC&amp;dq|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judy Wajcman]], Professor of Sociology at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], suggests in ''TechnoFeminism'' that "the openness of her writing to a variety of readings is intentional," which "can sometimes make Haraway difficult to interpret;" however, it does not seem that Wajcman critiques Haraway's tone for its capability to encompass more possibilities, rather than limit them. Wajcman concludes her chapter "Send in the Cyborgs" on a critical note, claiming that "Certainly, Haraway is much stronger at providing evocative figurations of a new feminist subjectivity than she is at providing guidelines for a practical emancipatory politics." &lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wajcman|first1=Judy|title=TechnoFeminism|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/TechnoFeminism.html?id=I63wvqQyHQcC|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyborgs, Coyotes, and Dogs: A Kinship of Feminist Figurations and There are Always More Things Going on Than You Thought! Methodologies as Thinking Technologies|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96688-4|pages=321–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Haraway have also centered on the accessibility of the thematic topics she discusses in her writing, and according to third-wave feminist readings, her work "assumes a reader who is familiar with North American culture," and posits that "readers without the appropriate cultural capital are...likely to find it infuriatingly obscure and impenetrable."&lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"/&gt; Therefore, Haraway's symbolism is representative of North American culture symbolizing a "non-universalizing vision for feminist strategies" and "has been taken up within cyberfeminism as the symbol of an essential female being." &lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"/&gt; Considering the question of accessibility more broadly, disability studies have focused on Haraway's essay, noting the absence of "any kind of critical engagement with disability...disabled bodies are simply presented as exemplary...requiring neither analysis nor critique"—a gap which Alison Kafer, Professor of Feminist Studies at Southwestern University, attempts to address in ''Feminist, Queer, Crip''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Indiana|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wajcman also argues that Haraway's view of technology in "A Cyborg Manifesto" is perhaps too totalizing, and that the binary of "the cyborg solution and the goddess solution" ultimately "caricatures feminism" by focusing too readily on a dichotomy that may in fact be a false one.&lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"/&gt;

In ''Unfinished Work-From Cyborg to Cognisphere'',  N. Katherine Hayles questions the validity of cyborg as a unit of analysis. She says that because of the complicated situation of technology and media, “cyborg is no longer the individual person – or for that matter, the individual cyborg – is no longer the appropriate unit of analysis, if indeed it ever was.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayles|first=Katherine|date=|title=Unfinished Work: From Cyborg to Cognisphere|url=|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=23.7-8|pages=159–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the relationships between cyborg and religion, Robert A. Campbell argues that “in spite of Haraway's efforts to move beyond traditional Western dualisms and offer a new hope for women, and by extension a of humanity and the world, what she in fact offers is a further legitimation for buying into the not so new American civil religion of high technology.” He says that “in spite of what some may view as a radical critique of the present and a potentially frightening prescription for the future, the stark reality about Haraway's 'postmodern reality' is that there is no such thing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Robert A.|date=2001|title=CYBORG SALVATION HISTORY: Donna Haraway and the Future of Religion|url=|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|volume=26| issue =  1/2|pages=154–173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its presence in academic context, "A Cyborg Manifesto" has also had popular traction including [[Wired Magazine]]'s piece by [[Hari Kunzru]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kunzru|first1=Hari|title=You Are Cyborg|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffharaway_pr.html|website=Wired|publisher=Wired|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mute Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fernandez|first1=Maria|last2=Malik|first2=Suhail|title=Whatever Happened to Cyborg Manifesto?|url=http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/whatever-happened-to-cyborg-manifesto|website=Mute|publisher=Mute|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BuzzFeed]],

=== Sonographic fetus as cyborg ===
Scholar Marilyn Maness Mehaffy writes that the "sonographic fetus is in many ways the ultimate cyborg in that it is 'created' in a space of virtuality that straddles the conventional boundary between an organic body and a digital text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mehaffy | first1 = Marilyn Maness | year = 2000 | title = Fetal attractions: the limit of cyborg theory | url = | journal = Women's Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 177–194 | doi=10.1080/00497878.2000.9979307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it is this cyborg that presents a limit to Haraway's posthuman theory. The sonographic fetus, as posited by scholar Heather Latimer, "is publicly envisioned as both independent of [its mother's] body and as independent of the sonographic equipment used to read this body. We know that fetal images are depictions, yet the sonogram invokes a documentary-like access to fetuses that makes it easy to ignore this, which in turn can limit the authority and agency of pregnant women."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Latimer, Heather. "Reproductive Technologies, Fetal Icons, and Genetic Freaks: Shelley Jackson’s Patchwork Girl and the Limits and Possibilities of Donna Haraway’s Cyborg." Modern Fiction Studies 57.2 (2011): 318-335.&lt;/ref&gt; In positioning the fetus as independent, and consequently oppositional, to the pregnant mother, these reproductive technologies "reinscribe stable meanings to the human/machine dualism they supposedly disrupt."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Valerie Hartouni argues, "most reproductive technologies have assimilated into the 'order of nature'"&lt;ref&gt;Hartouni, Valerie. Cultural Conceptions: On Reproductive Technologies and the Remaking of Life. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; which would make Haraway's vision of a regenerative species, unrestricted by heteronormative conceptions of reproduction, unattainable in the sonographic fetus.

== Publication history ==
Haraway began writing the ''Manifesto ''in 1983 to address the ''[[Socialist Review (US)|Socialist Review]] ''request of American socialist feminists to ponder over the future of [[socialist feminism]] in the context of the early [[Reagan Era|Reagan era]] and the decline of leftist politics. The first versions of the essay had a strong socialist and European connection that the ''Socialist Review ''East Coast Collective found too controversial to publish. The Berkeley ''Socialist Review'' Collective published the essay in 1985 under the editor Jeff Escoffier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The essay was most widely read as part of Haraway's 1991 book ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simians, cyborgs, and women: the reinvention of nature.|last=Haraway|first=Donna Jeanne|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=978-0415903875 |location=New York|pages=149–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Altitudinal zonation''' (or '''elevational zonation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McVicar|Körner|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in mountainous regions describes the natural layering of ecosystems that occurs at distinct elevations due to varying environmental conditions. [[Temperature]], [[humidity]], [[soil]] composition, and [[insolation|solar radiation]] are important factors in determining altitudinal zones, which consequently support different vegetation and animal species.&lt;ref name=daubenmire1943 /&gt;&lt;ref name=frahm1991 /&gt; Altitudinal zonation was first hypothesized by geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] who noticed that temperature drops with increasing elevation.&lt;ref name="Salter 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Salter|Hobbs|Wheeler|Kostbade|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zonation also occurs in [[Intertidal zone|intertidal]] and [[marine environment]]s, as well as on [[shore]]lines and in [[wetlands]]. Scientist [[Clinton Hart Merriam|C. Hart Merriam]] observed that changes in vegetation and animals in altitudinal zones map onto changes expected with increased latitude in his concept of [[life zones]]. Today, altitudinal zonation represents a core concept in [[mountain research]].

== Factors==
[[File:Altitudinal zonation VVP.svg|thumb|300px|Heating of solids, sunlight and shade in different altitudinal zones (Northern hemisphere)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fukarek|Hempel|Hûbel|Sukkov|Schuster|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A variety of environmental factors determines the boundaries of altitudinal zones found on mountains, ranging from direct effects of temperature and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] to indirect characteristics of the mountain itself, as well as biological interactions of the species. The cause of zonation is complex, due to many possible interactions and overlapping species ranges. Careful measurements and statistical tests are required prove the existence of discrete communities along an elevation gradient, as opposed to uncorrelated species ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shipley|Keddy|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
Decreasing air temperature usually coincides with increasing elevation, which directly influences the length the growing season at different elevations of the mountain.&lt;ref name=daubenmire1943 &gt;{{harvnb|Daubenmire|1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nagy2009 &gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|Grabherr|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For mountains located in deserts, extreme high temperatures also limit the ability of large [[deciduous]] or coniferous trees to grow near the base of mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daubenmire|1943|pp=345–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, plants can be especially sensitive to soil temperatures and can have specific elevation ranges that support healthy growth.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|Grabherr|2009|pp=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humidity===
The humidity of certain zones, including precipitation levels, atmospheric humidity, and potential for [[evapotranspiration]], varies with elevation and is a significant factor in determining altitudinal zonation.&lt;ref name=frahm1991 &gt;{{harvnb|Frahm|Gradstein|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important variable is precipitation at various elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daubenmire|1943|pp=349–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; As warm, moist air rises up the windward side of a mountain, the air temperature cools and loses its capacity to hold moisture. Thus, the greatest amount of rainfall is expected at mid-latitudes and can support [[deciduous forest]] development. Above a certain elevation the rising air becomes too dry and cold, and thus discourages tree growth.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Even though rainfall may not be a significant factor for some mountains, atmospheric humidity or [[aridity]] can be more important climatic stresses that affect altitudinal zones.&lt;ref name=stadel1990 &gt;{{harvnb|Stadel|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both overall levels of precipitation and humidity influence soil moisture as well. One of the most important factors that control the lower boundary of the Encinal or forest level is the ratio of [[evaporation]] to soil moisture.&lt;ref name=shreve1922&gt;{{harvnb|Shreve|1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil composition===
The nutrient content of soils at different elevations further complicates the demarcation of altitudinal zones. Soils with higher nutrient content, due to higher decomposition rates or greater weathering of rocks, better support larger trees and vegetation. The elevation of better soils varies with the particular mountain being studied. For example, for mountains found in the [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest regions]], lower elevations exhibit fewer terrestrial species because of the thick layer of [[leaf litter|dead fallen leaves]] covering the forest floor.&lt;ref name=frahm1991 /&gt; At this latitude more acidic, [[humus|humose soils]] exist at higher elevations in the [[montane]] or [[Montane ecology#Subalpine zone|subapline]] levels.&lt;ref name=frahm1991 /&gt; In a different example, [[weathering]] is hampered by low temperatures at higher elevations in the [[Rocky Mountain]] of the western United States, resulting in thin coarse soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daubenmire|1943|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological forces===
In addition to physical forces, biological forces may also produce zonation. For example, a strong competitor can force weaker competitors to higher or lower positions on the elevation gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keddy|2001|p=552}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of competition is difficult to assess without experiments, which are expensive and often take many years to complete. However, there is an accumulating body of evidence that competitively dominant plants may seize the preferred locations (warmer sites or deeper soils).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberg|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two other biological factors can influence zonation: [[grazing]] and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]].  The relative importance of these factors is also difficult to assess, but the abundance of grazing animals, and the abundance of [[mycorrhiza]]l associations, suggests that these elements may influence plant distributions in significant ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keddy|2007|p=666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar radiation===
Light is another significant factor in the growth of trees and other [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] vegetation. The earth’s atmosphere is filled with water vapor, particulate matter, and gases that filter the radiation coming from the sun before reaching the earth’s surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Daubenmire|1943|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the summits of mountains and higher elevations receive much more intense radiation than the basal plains. Along with the expected [[arid]] conditions at higher elevations, shrubs and grasses tend to thrive because of their small leaves and extensive root systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|Grabherr|2009|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, high elevations also tend to have more frequent cloud cover, which compensates for some of the high intensity radiation.

===Massenerhebung effect===
The physical characteristics and relative location of the mountain itself must also be considered in predicting altitudinal zonation patterns.&lt;ref name=frahm1991  /&gt; The [[Massenerhebung effect]] describes variation in the tree line based on mountain size and location. This effect predicts that zonation of rain forests on lower mountains may mirror the zonation expected on high mountains, but the belts occur at lower elevations.&lt;ref name=frahm1991 /&gt; A similar effect is exhibited in the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]] of Arizona, where the basal elevation and the total elevation influence the elevation of vertical zones of vegetation.&lt;ref name=shreve1922/&gt;

===Other factors===
In addition to the factors described above, there are a host of other properties that can confound predictions of altitudinal zonations. These include: frequency of disturbance (such as fire or monsoons), wind velocity, type of rock, topography, nearness to streams or rivers, history of tectonic activity, and latitude.&lt;ref name=daubenmire1943 /&gt;&lt;ref name=frahm1991 /&gt;

==Elevation levels==
[[File:Altitudinal zones of Alps mountains-extended diagram.svg|lang=en|600px|center|Altitudinal zonation in the Alps]]
Elevation models of zonation are complicated by factors discussed above and thus the relative elevations each zone begins and ends is not tied to a specific elevation.&lt;ref name=troll1973 &gt;{{harvnb|Troll|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is possible to split the altitudinal gradient into five main zones used by ecologists under varying names. In some cases these level follow each other with the decrease in elevation, which is called ''vegetation inversion''.
[[File:Grand Tetons11.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Altitudinal zonation of Grand Teton in the [[Rocky Mountains]] (note change in vegetation as elevation increases)]]

* '''Nival level''' (glaciers):&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pauli|Gottfried|Grabherr|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covered in snow throughout most of the year.  Vegetation is extremely limited to only a few species that thrive on silica soils.&lt;ref name=nagy2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=troll1973 /&gt;
* '''Alpine level''':&lt;ref name=nagy2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=troll1973 /&gt; The zone that stretches between the tree line and snowline.  This zone is further broken down into Sub-Nival and Treeless Alpine (in the tropics-Tierra fria; low-alpine)
** Sub-nival:&lt;ref name=troll1973 /&gt; The highest zone that vegetation typically exists. This area is shaped by the frequent frosts that restrict extensive plant colonization. Vegetation is patchy and is restricted to only the most favorable locations that are protected from the heavy winds that often characterize this area.  Much of this region is patchy grassland, [[sedges]] and rush heaths  typical of arctic zones . Snow is found in this region for part of the year.
** Treeless alpine (low-alpine): Characterized by a closed carpet of vegetation that includes alpine meadows, shrubs and sporadic dwarfed trees.  Because of the complete cover of vegetation, frost has less of an effect on this region, but due to the consistent freezing temperatures tree growth is severely limited.
* '''Montane level''':&lt;ref name=nagy2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tang|Ohsawa|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extends from the mid-elevation forests to the tree line.  The exact level of the tree line varies with local climate, but typically the tree line is found where mean monthly soil temperatures never exceed 10.0 degrees C and the mean annual soil temperatures are around 6.7 degrees C.  In the tropics, this region is typified by montane rain forest (above 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft) while at higher latitudes [[coniferous forest]]s often dominate.
* '''Lowland layer''':&lt;ref name="Salter 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pulgar Vidal|1941|pp=145–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lowest section of mountains varies distinctly across climates and is referred to by a wide range of names depending on the surrounding landscape.  Colline zones are found in tropical regions and Encinal zones and desert grasslands are found in desert regions.
** Colline (tropics):&lt;ref name=frahm1991  /&gt; Characterized by deciduous forests when in oceanic or moderately continental areas, and characterized by grassland in more continental regions. Extends from sea level to about 3,000 feet (roughly 900 m). Vegetation is abundant and dense. This zone is the typical base layer of tropical regions.
** Encinal (deserts):&lt;ref name=shreve1922 /&gt; Characterized by open [[evergreen]] oak forests and most common in desert regions. Evaporation and soil moisture control limitation of which encinal environments can thrive. Desert grasslands lie below encinal zones. Very commonly found in the Southwestern United States.
** Desert grassland:&lt;ref name=shreve1922 /&gt; Characterized by varying densities of low lying vegetation, grasslands zones cannot support trees due to extreme aridity. Some desert regions may support trees at base of mountains however, and thus distinct grasslands zones will not form in these areas.
For detailed breakdowns of the characteristics of altitudinal zones found on different mountains, see [[List of life zones by region]].

===Treeline===
{{main|Treeline}}
The most decisive biogeographic and climatic boundary along elevation gradients is the climatic high-elevation treeline. The treeline separates the [[montane]] from the [[alpine zone]] and marks the potential for tree growth, irrespective of whether trees are present or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Körner|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So when trees had been cut or burnt, and thus, are absent from the treeline, it is still in place as defined by the treeline isotherm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paulsen|Körner|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the tree line, tree growth is often sparse, stunted, and deformed by wind and cold [[krummholz]] (German for "crooked wood").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zwinger|Willard|1996|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree line often appears well-defined, but it can be a more gradual transition. Trees grow shorter and often at lower densities as they approach tree line, above which they cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zwinger|Willard|1996|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal zonation==
Animals also exhibit zonation patterns in concert with the vegetational zones described above.&lt;ref name=nagy2009 /&gt; Invertebrates are more clearly defined into zones because they are typically less mobile than vertebrate species. Vertebrate animals often span across altitudinal zones according to the seasons and food availability. Typically animal species diversity and abundance decrease as a function of elevation above the montane zone because of the harsher environmental conditions experienced at higher elevations. Fewer studies have explored animal zonation with elevation because this correlation is less defined than the vegetation zones due to the increased mobility of animal species.&lt;ref name=nagy2009 /&gt;

==Land-use planning and human utilization==
The variability of both natural and human environments has made it difficult to construct universal models to explain [[agriculture|human cultivation]] in altitudinal environments.  With more established roads however, the bridge between different cultures has started to shrink.&lt;ref name=allan1986 &gt;{{harvnb|Allan|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mountainous environments have become more accessible and diffusion of ideas, technology, and goods occur with more regularity.  Nonetheless, altitudinal zonation caters to agricultural specialization and growing populations cause [[environmental degradation]].

===Agriculture===
[[File:Hoehenstufen der anden.en.PNG|thumb|right|Altitudinal zones of Andes Mountains and corresponding communities of agriculture and livestock raised]]
Human populations have developed agricultural production strategies to exploit varying characteristics of altitudinal zones.  Elevation, [[climate]], and soil fertility set upper limits on types of crops that can reside in each zone.  Populations residing in the [[Andes]] Mountain region of South America have taken advantage of varying altitudinal environments to raise a wide variety of different crops.&lt;ref name=stadel1990 /&gt; Two different types of adaptive strategies have been adopted within mountainous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhoades|Thompson|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Generalized Strategy – exploits a series of microniches or [[ecozone]]s at several elevational levels
* Specialized Strategy – focuses on a single zone and specializes in the agricultural activities suitable to that elevation, developing elaborate trade relationships with external populations
With improved accessibility to new farming techniques, populations are adopting more specialized strategies and moving away from generalized strategies. Many farming communities now choose to trade with communities at different elevations instead of cultivating every resource on their own because it is cheaper and easier to specialize within their altitudinal zone.&lt;ref name=allan1986 /&gt;

===Environmental degradation===
Population growth is leading to environmental degradation in altitudinal environments through [[deforestation]] and [[overgrazing]]. The increase in accessibility of mountainous regions allows more people to travel between areas and encourage groups to expand commercial land use.  Furthermore, the new linkage between mountainous and lowland populations from improved road access has contributed to worsening environmental degradation.&lt;ref name=allan1986 /&gt;

==Debate on continuum versus zonation==
Not all mountainous environments exhibit sudden changes in altitudinal zones. Though less common, some tropical environments show a slow continuous change in vegetation over the altitudinal gradient and thus do not form distinct vegetation zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hemp|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6034">'''Automated mineralogy''' is a generic term describing a range of [[analytical solution]]s, areas of [[commercial enterprise]], and a growing field of [[scientific research]] and engineering applications involving largely [[automated]] and [[wikt:quantitative|quantitative]] [[analysis]] of [[mineral]]s, [[rock (geology)|rock]]s and man-made materials.

==Technology==
Automated mineralogy analytical solutions are characterised by integrating largely automated measurement techniques based on [[Scanning Electron Microscopy]] (SEM) and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] (EDS). Commercially available lab-based solutions include [[QEMSCAN]] and Mineral Liberation Analyzer ([[Mineral Liberation Analyzer|MLA]]) from [[FEI Company]], Mineralogic from [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]], INCAMineral from [[Oxford Instruments]], the TIMA  (Tescan integrated mineral analyzer) from [[TESCAN]] and AMICS from [[Bruker]]. The first oil &amp; gas wellsite solution was launched jointly by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] and CGG Veritas in 2011 called RoqSCAN. This was followed approximately 6 months later by the release of QEMSCAN Wellsite by [[FEI Company]].  More recently in 2016, a ruggedized mine site solution for mining and mineral processing was launched by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] called MinSCAN.

==Business==

==History of the use of the term==
The first recorded use of the term ''automated mineralogy'' in technical journals can be traced back to seminal papers in the late eighties early nineties describing [[QEMSCAN]] technology and applications.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, D.,  Gottlieb, P.,  Jackson, R., Wilkie, G., Stewart, P. 1988. Measurement in section of particles of known composition.

'''Black psychology''' (also called '''African psychology''') is an African cosmological lens{{clarifyme|date=January 2013}} applied to social or psychological phenomena.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is approached from two perspectives:
*The first perspective considers these concepts and theories as universal, which means that the lens is appropriate in studying all human beings, not just those of African heritage.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"/&gt;  This approach was embodied in early efforts by black scholars to challenge the assumption that African Americans were inferior.  Over time, it grew to also incorporate the history and the experiences of African Americans, exploring it in a ways considered superior to the traditional models of White psychologists.&lt;ref name="W93"&gt;Whitten, L. (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  
*The second perspective, the Afrocentric scholar approach, considers the lens as only appropriate when applied to people of African descent.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"/&gt;  

Both perspectives agree that African American psychology is a science and that it is structured and organized.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"/&gt;  Both African and African American psychologies study the thoughts, behaviors, feelings, beliefs, attitudes, interactions, and well-being of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Belgrave, F.Z. 2010 p. 5"/&gt; 

Black psychology has critiqued or rejected white psychology, developed [[afrocentric]] models of study and therapy, and intervened in the social struggle for more black and human environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/minority-groups/past_courses/Karenga_Black_Psychology.pdf Black Psychology] From Introduction to Black Studies by Maulena Karenga, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of early black psychologists is lost to many students due the minimal coverage in courses.&lt;ref name="W93"/&gt; However, research performed by early black scholars on the effects of segregation and other racial matters played an important role in American history, like the research by Kenneth Bancroft Clark that was cited in [[Brown v. Board of Education]] by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of psychology programs in black colleges==
Following the end of the Civil War a push for education began to occur in the Black community. Moving away from secret night schools held during the time of slavery, a variety of learning centers and colleges began to open. Many of these schools were established by missionary associations and various Freedman societies. Federal government land grants such as the [[Morrill Act of 1862]]&lt;ref name="G98"&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to support these institutions and the additional aid of religious denominations allowed for the support of these schools. The years following saw the founding of Black colleges across the country including notable institutions such as the first historically black college [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] (1854),
[[Fisk University]] (1865), [[Howard University]] (1867), Morehouse College (1867) and [[Spelman College]] (1881).&lt;ref name="G98"/&gt; By 1940 there were more than one hundred Black colleges in the seventeen southern states offering a variety of degrees with many of the earned degrees in social sciences and education.

==Rise of the psychology program==
Psychology courses became both popular and integral courses in black colleges, with at least one course appearing as early as 1906. Formally trained professors (both black and white) taught courses. Although many universities had programs of great influence, the most prominent was located at Howard University. Howard's successes were due largely to the efforts of [[Francis Cecil Sumner]]. Often considered the father of black psychologists, Sumner structured the psychology program, teaching not only the ideas of [[Edward Titchener]], [[John B. Watson|John Watson]], and [[Sigmund Freud]], but a myriad of courses in topics such as learning, personality, mental hygiene, and experimental psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental focus reflected Sumner's three objectives: to provide students preparation in professional fields, stress the cultural significance of psychology, and prepare students who wish to pursue graduate study. This not only made Howard different from other Black universities, but created a strong program that carried over to graduate studies. Although Howard only offered master's degrees, it offered a strong foundation for those who went on to pursue doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998) pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Although psychology was a popular course in black colleges, only Howard and three other black colleges offered an undergraduate psychology degree by the late 1930s. Emphasis was usually on educational psychology, leaving statistics and experimental focuses by the wayside. This led to a survey conducted by [[Herman George Canady]] between 1930 and 1940 concerning the nature of undergraduate courses, research in psychology, and other areas of concern in black colleges. The survey revealed that fourteen of fifty colleges had a department in psychology and that theoretical and lab courses were rare. Psychology courses were primarily offered by departments of education, allowing the development of educational psychology and emphasizing the focus on practical applications of education.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998) p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences compared to white colleges==
Naturally, psychology was taught differently in white and black colleges due to differences in available funds and materials. Black colleges tended to focus on practical matters due to the need to train students for trades or teaching posts. Conversely, white colleges taught psychology as laboratory science that was very focused on research and instrumentation. Much of the focus in psychology in Black colleges lay in studying similarities among people instead of differences. Professors emphasized that situation and environmental circumstances, not skin color, affected intelligence. This contrasts white colleges and professionals who studied [[IQ]] scores and other [[psychometric]] methods to prove that differences between races lay in skin color. The idea that environmental factors affect intelligence not only helped to remove the stigma in Black communities, but it led to groundbreaking work by Black psychologists later in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a challenge when it comes to teaching psychology involving black students and white instructors. Particularly, in the early years, there was a mismatch  of interactional norms due to the cultural differences that underpin interactional behaviors, which include different backchanneling responses among Black and White Americans. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating Elite Talk: Language, Race, Class and Identity Among African American High Schoolers|last=Clark|first=John Taggart|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781905763214|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be demonstrated in the incidence of "hyperexplanation," wherein an instructor provides lengthy explanation without recognizing affirmative gestures that do not include vocal backchannels such as "I understand you." This can lead to offense on the part of the black student, who could view the explanation as patronizing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Graduate studies and beyond==
Between 1920 and 1970, black colleges around the nation produced more than 1,300 bachelor's degree graduates who eventually earned a doctorate in psychology.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} However, difficulties were encountered in attempts to obtain the degree. Many black students were denied acceptance into southern white schools and looked north for educational opportunities. [[Clark University]] was the foremost in graduating black scholars at the time; its notable alumni include Sumner and J. Henry Alston.  This was not the norm for other schools. Beyond acceptance or provisions that required black students to take on an extra year of undergraduate work to prove their caliber to attending white schools, finances was the most troubling factor. Fees toward tuition, living maintenance, and other expenses caused many to delay or to give up pursuing graduate studies for dependable wages in menial positions. The combination of these factors meant that out of the 3,767 doctorates awarded in psychology between 1920 and 1966 from the ten most prestigious universities in the nation, only eight were awarded to black candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R.V. (1998). p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, a survey of prior studies indicates a consensus among psychologists that black psychology and black psychologists play an important role in addressing race-related issues in America aside from its significance in addressing the concept of the negro personality and the psychological issues it entails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Racism and Psychology: Towards a Reflexive History|last=Richards|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415101409|location=London|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Edward Johnson stressed in ''The Role of the Negro in American Psychology'' that "the black psychologist will regard himself more and more as an agent of social change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=E.E.|date=1969|title=Role of the Negro in American psychology|url=|journal=American Psychologist|volume=24|pages=757-759|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism toward African Americans==
Many of the African contributions were ignored about its origin, taken by Greek cosmologists, and used by the early pioneers of psychology, but even after that the African Americans received more racism instead of credibility.{{Vague|date=January 2017}} Most of this took place after the Civil War, when [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] emerged.&lt;ref name="Holliday, B.G. 2009. p. 318"&gt;Holliday, B.G. (2009). p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Even the Rat was White'', a book published in 1976, encouraged African American psychology. A second edition of this book was published in 1996. The author [[Robert V. Guthrie]] explains the different ways that white American scientists contributed to racists criticism against African Americans. Many of these explained that African Americans are inferior to white Americans. Many scientists did intelligence testing on African Americans and white Americans which resulted in African Americans being the inferior race.&lt;ref&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010). p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin’s natural selection theory was published in 1859. The assumption of this theory was that only the strongest and intelligent individuals or organisms could survive. In the 20th century many studies were done to compare the differences in African Americans and white Americans. The results mainly showed that African Americans were inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010). p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Francis Galton]]’s studies in the 19th century attributed [[Race and intelligence|the racial inferiority of African Americans' intelligence]] to inheritance. Through his theory he predicted that if intelligence is inherited, then it would not be expected for lower intelligence to be improved through ability. Galton thought that through selective mating, the improvement of race could be done controlling the inferior intelligence genetically. The results showed that African Americans and other minorities were considered to be those who were unfit and inferior and white Americans as superior.&lt;ref&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010). p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropology studies were done in 18th and 19th century that compared African Americans' and White Americans' physical characteristics. Qualities such as skin color, hair texture, posture, face structure, and skull structure were assessed in favor of white Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Belgrave, F.Z. &amp; Allison, K.W. (2010). p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]'s theory of instinct created many racist concepts about African Americans. One of his studies characterized African Americans as easygoing, happy, and lazy. Another study was done that tested hearing, vision, taste, acuity, pain, and motor speed of African Americans. The result was that minorities, such as, African American were inferior to white Americans.

==Successes of African Americans==
In 1968, the [[Association of Black Psychologists]] was formed as a protest toward the [[American Psychological Association]]’s lack of interest in African American Psychologists.  In 1974, the Association of Black Psychologists created their official journal called ''The [[Journal of Black Psychology]]''. This journal is directed toward understanding of experiences and behavior of African American populations. It covers many issues in the African American society, such as, HIV, sickle cell disease, racial identity, African American children, and substance abuse prevention. Psychology fields that are covered in this journal are counseling, clinical, social, cognitive, educational, and organizational psychology.&lt;ref name="Holliday, B.G. 2009. p. 318"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2965">In [[fishery|fisheries]] and [[conservation biology]], the '''catch per unit effort''' ('''CPUE''') is an [[Proxy (statistics)|indirect measure]] of the [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] of a target species. Changes in the catch per unit effort are inferred to signify changes to the target species' true abundance. A decreasing CPUE indicates [[overexploitation]], while an unchanging CPUE indicates [[sustainability|sustainable harvesting]].&lt;ref name="Puertas"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kirsten M. Silvius, Richard E. Bodmer &amp; José M. V. Fragoso |year=2004 |title=People in Nature: Wildlife Conservation in South and Central America |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |isbn=978-0-231-12783-7 |author=Pablo E. Puertas &amp; Richard E. Bodmer |chapter=Hunting effort as a tool for community-based wildlife management in Amazonia |pages=123–136 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ghr7KupbQacC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPUE has a number of advantages over other methods of measuring abundance. It does not interfere with routine harvesting operations, and data are easily collected. The data are also easy to [[analysis|analyse]], even for non-specialists, in contrast to methods based on [[transect]]s. This means that decisions about [[stock management]] can also be made by the people doing the harvesting.&lt;ref name="Puertas"/&gt; The [[best practice]] is to standardise the effort employed (''e.g.'' number of traps or duration of searching), which [[Controlling for a variable|controls for]] the reduction in catch size that often results from subsequent efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William J.

The '''dematerialization''' of a product literally means less, or better yet, no material is used to deliver the same level of functionality to the user. Sharing, borrowing and the organization of group services that facilitate and cater for communities needs could alleviate the requirement of [[ownership]] of many products.

In his book ‘'In the Bubble: designing in a complex world'’, John Thakara states that "the average consumer power tool is used for ten minutes in its entire life - but it takes hundreds of times its own weight to [[manufacture]] such an object”. A [[product service system]] with shared tools could simply offer access to them when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Bubble: Designing in a Complex World

| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift from a reliance on [[Product (business)|products]] to [[Service (economics)|services]] is the process of dematerialization. Digital music distribution systems, car clubs, bike hire schemes and laundry services are all examples of dematerialization.

[[File:Horse Manure and Hay Detritus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Horse]] [[feces]] and [[hay]] – detritus used as [[manure]]]]
In [[biology]], '''detritus''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ᵻ|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|t|ə|s}}) is dead particulate [[biotic material|organic material]] (as opposed to [[dissolved organic carbon|dissolved organic material]]).  It typically includes the bodies or fragments of dead [[organism]]s as well as [[feces|fecal]] material. Detritus is typically colonized by communities of [[microorganism]]s which act to [[decomposition|decompose]] (or [[remineralisation|remineralize]]) the material.  In terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, it is encountered as [[plant litter|leaf litter]] and other organic matter intermixed with [[soil]], which is denominated "[[soil organic matter]]".  Detritus of [[aquatic ecosystems]] is organic material suspended in [[water]] and piling up on seabed floors, which is referred to as [[marine snow]].

== Theory ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Sequoiadendron giganteum 08130.JPG|left|thumb|Giant sequoia (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'') cones and foliage, sugar pine and white fir foliage, and other plant litter cover the floor of [[Mariposa Grove]] in [[Yosemite National Park]].]]
Dead plants or animals, material derived from animal tissues (such as skin cast off during moulting etc) gradually lose their form, due to both physical processes and the action of [[decomposers]], including grazers, [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. [[Decomposition]], the process through which organic matter is decomposed, takes place in many stages. Materials like [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[sugars]] with low [[molecular weight]] are rapidly consumed and absorbed by microorganisms and organisms that feed on dead matter. Other compounds, such as [[complex carbohydrate]]s are broken down more slowly. The various microorganisms involved in the decomposition break down the organic materials in order to gain the resources they require for their own survival and proliferation. Accordingly, at the same time that the materials of plants and animals are being broken down, the materials ([[biomass]]) making up the bodies of the microorganisms are built up by a process of [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]]. When microorganisms die, fine organic particles are produced, and if these are eaten by small animals which feed on microorganisms, they will collect inside the [[intestine]], and change shape into large pellets of dung. As a result of this process, most of the materials from dead organisms disappears from view and is not obviously present in any recognisable form, but is in fact present in the form of a combination of fine organic particles and the organisms using them as [[nutrient]]s. This combination is detritus.

In [[ecosystem]]s on land, detritus is deposited on the surface of the ground, taking forms such as the humic soil beneath a layer of fallen leaves. In aquatic ecosystems, most detritus is suspended in water, and gradually settles. In particular, many different types of material are collected together by currents, and much material settles in slowly flowing areas.

Much detritus is used as a source of nutrition for [[animal]]s. In particular, many [[Bottom feeder|bottom feeding]] animals ([[benthos]]) living in [[mud flat]]s feed in this way. In particular, since excreta are materials which other animals do not need, whatever energy value they might have, they are often unbalanced as a source of nutrients, and are not suitable as a source of nutrition on their own. However, there are many [[microorganisms]] which multiply in natural environments. These microorganisms do not simply absorb nutrients from these particles, but also shape their own bodies so that they can take the resources they lack from the area around them, and this allows them to make use of excreta as a source of nutrients. In practical terms, the most important constituents of detritus are [[complex carbohydrate]]s, which are persistent (difficult to break down), and the microorganisms which multiply using these absorb carbon from the detritus, and materials such as nitrogen and phosphorus from the water in their environment to synthesise the components of their own cells.

A characteristic type of [[food chain]] called the [[detritus cycle]] takes place involving detritus feeders ([[detritivores]]), detritus and the microorganisms that multiply on it. For example, mud flats are inhabited by many univalves which are detritus feeders. When these detritus feeders take in detritus with microorganisms multiplying on it, they mainly break down and absorb the microorganisms, which are rich in proteins, and excrete the detritus, which is mostly complex carbohydrates, having hardly broken it down at all. At first this dung is a poor source of nutrition, and so univalves pay no attention to it, but after several days, microorganisms begin to multiply on it again, its nutritional balance improves, and so they eat it again. Through this process of eating the detritus many times over and harvesting the microorganisms from it, the detritus thins out, becomes fractured and becomes easier for the microorganisms to use, and so the complex carbohydrates are also steadily broken down and disappear over time.

What is left behind by the detritivores is then further broken down and recycled by [[decomposer]]s, such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[fungus|fungi]].

This detritus cycle plays a large part in the so-called purification process, whereby organic materials carried in by rivers is broken down and disappears, and an extremely important part in the breeding and growth of [[marine resources]]. In ecosystems on land, far more essential material is broken down as dead material passing through the detritus chain than is broken down by being eaten by animals in a living state. In both land and aquatic ecosystems, the role played by detritus is too large to ignore.

== Aquatic ecosystems ==
{{expand section|date=April 2017}}
In contrast to land ecosystems, dead materials and excreta in aquatic ecosystems are typically transported by water flow; finer particles tend to be transported farther or suspended longer. In freshwater bodies organic material from plants can form a [[silt]] known as ''mulm'' or [[humus]] on the bottom. This material, some called ''undissolved organic carbon'' breaks down into [[dissolved organic carbon]] and can bond to heavy metal ions via [[chelation]]. It can also break down into [[colored dissolved organic matter]] such as [[tannin]], a specific form of [[tannic acid]]. In saltwater bodies, organic material breaks down and forms a [[marine snow]] that slowly settles down to the ocean bottom.

==Terrestrial ecosystems==
Detritus occurs in a variety of terrestrial habitats including forest, chaparral and grassland. In forests the detritus is typically dominated by leaf, twig, and bacteria litter as measured by biomass dominance. This [[plant litter]] provides important cover for seedling protection as well as cover for a variety of arthropods, reptiles&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and amphibians. Some insect larvae feed on the detritus.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Grimaldi, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi and bacteria continue the decomposition process&lt;ref&gt;B.C. Patten, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; after grazers have consumed larger elements of the organic materials, and animal trampling has assisted in mechanically breaking down organic matter. At the later stages of decomposition, [[mesophilic]] [[micro-organism]]s decompose residual detritus, generating heat from exothermic processes; such heat generation is associated with the well known phenomenon of the elevated temperature of [[composting]].

=== Consumers ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
There is an extremely large number of [[detritus feeder]]s in water. After all, a large quantity of material is carried in by water currents. Even if an organism stays in a fixed position, as long as it has a system for filtering water, it will be able to obtain enough food to get by. Many [[Root|rooted]] organisms survive in this way, using developed [[gill]]s or [[tentacle]]s to filter the water to take in food, a process known as [[filter feeding]].

Another more widely used method of feeding, which also incorporates filter feeding, is a system where an organism secretes mucus to catch the detritus in lumps, and then carries these to its mouth using an area of [[cilius|cilia]]. This is called [[mucus feeding]].

Many organisms, including sea slugs and serpent's starfish, scoop up the detritus which has settled on the water bed. Bivalves which live inside the water bed do not simply suck in water through their tubes, but also extend them to fish for detritus on the surface of the bed.

=== Producers ===
In contrast, from the point of view of organisms using photosynthesis such as [[plants]] and [[plankton]], detritus reduces the transparency of the water and gets in the way of this process. Given that these organisms also require a supply of [[nutrient salts]]—in other words [[fertilizer]]—for photosynthesis, their relationship with detritus is a complex one.

In land ecosystems, the waste products of plants and animals collect mainly on the ground (or on the surfaces of trees), and as decomposition proceeds, plants are supplied with fertiliser in the form of inorganic salts. In water ecosystems, relatively little waste collects on the water bed, and so the progress of decomposition in water takes a more important role. Investigating the level of inorganic salts in sea ecosystems shows that unless there is an especially large supply, the quantity increases from winter to spring—but is normally extremely low in summer. As such, the quantity of seaweed present reaches a peak in early summer and then decreases. The thinking is that organisms like plants grow quickly in warm periods and thus the quantity of inorganic salts is not enough to keep up with the demand. In other words, during winter, plant-like organisms are inactive and collect fertiliser, but if the temperature rises to some extent they will use this up in a very short period.

It is not entirely true that their productivity falls during the warmest periods. Organisms such as [[dinoflagellate]] have mobility, the ability to take in solid food, and the ability to photosynthesise. This type of micro-organism can take in substances such as detritus to grow, without waiting for it to be broken down into fertiliser.

== Aquariums ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
In recent years, the word detritus has also come to be used in relation to [[aquarium]]s (the word "aquarium" is a general term for any installation for keeping aquatic animals).

When animals such as fish are kept in an aquarium, substances such as excreta, mucus and dead skin cast off during moulting are produced by the animals and, naturally, generate detritus, and are continually broken down by micro-organisms.

Modern sealife aquariums often use the [[Berlin Method]], which employs a piece of equipment called a [[protein skimmer]], which produces air bubbles which the detritus adheres to, and forces it outside the tank before it decomposes, and also a highly porous type of natural rock called [[live rock]] where many bentos and bacteria live (hermatype which has been dead for some time is often used), which causes the detritus-feeding bentos and micro-organisms to undergo a detritus cycle. The [[Monaco system]], where an anaerobic layer is created in the tank, to [[denitrification|denitrify]] the organic compounds in the tank, and also the other nitrogen compounds, so that the decomposition process continues until the stage where water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen are produced, has also been implemented.

Initially, the filtration systems in water tanks often worked as the name suggests, using a physical filter to remove foreign substances in the water. Following this, the standard method for maintaining the water quality was to convert [[ammonium]] or [[nitrate]]s in excreta, which have a high degree of neurotoxicity, but the combination of [[Detritivore|detritus feeders]], detritus and micro-organisms has now brought aquarium technology to a still higher level.

{{refimprove|date=July 2017}}

'''Earth science''' or '''geoscience''' includes all fields of [[natural science]] related to the [[planet]] [[Earth]]. It is the branch of science dealing with the physical constitution of the earth and its atmosphere. Earth science is the study of our planet’s physical characteristics, from earthquakes to raindrops, and floods to fossils. Earth science can be considered to be a branch of [[planetary science]], but with a much older history. “Earth science” encompasses four main branches of study, the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]], each of which is further broken down into more specialized fields.

There are both [[reductionism|reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. It is also the study of the Earth and its neighbors in space. Some Earth [[Scientist|scientists]] use their knowledge of the Earth to locate and develop energy and mineral resources. Others study the impact of human activity on Earth's environment, and design methods to protect the planet. Some use their knowledge about Earth processes such as [[Volcano|volcanoes]], [[Earthquake|earthquakes]], and [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] to plan communities that will not expose people to these dangerous events. 

The Earth sciences can include the study of [[geology]], the [[lithosphere]], and the large-scale structure of the Earth's interior, as well as the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[biosphere]]. Typically, Earth scientists use tools from [[geography]], [[chronology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth works and evolves. Earth science affects our everyday lives. For example, meteorologists study the weather and watch for dangerous storms. Hydrologists study water and warn of floods. Seismologists study earthquakes and try to predict where they will strike. Geologists study rocks and help to locate useful minerals. Earth scientists mainly work “in the field”—climbing mountains, exploring the seabed, crawling through caves, or wading in swamps. They measure and collect samples (such as rocks or river water), then they record their findings on charts and maps.

== Fields of study ==
The following [[branches of science|fields of science]] are generally categorized within the Earth sciences:
* [[Physical geography]], covers aspects of [[geomorphology]], [[pedology (soil study)|soil study]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], and [[biogeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html|title=1(b). Elements of Geography – 2nd Edition, by M. Pidwirny, 2006|work=physicalgeography.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geology]] describes the [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] parts of the [[Earth's crust]] (or [[lithosphere]]) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are [[mineralogy]] and [[petrology]], [[geochemistry]], geomorphology, [[paleontology]], [[stratigraphy]], [[structural geology]], [[engineering geology]], and [[sedimentology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
name="smith 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geophysics]] and [[geodesy]] investigate the [[figure of the Earth|shape of the Earth]], its reaction to forces and its [[magnetic field|magnetic]] and [[gravity field]]s. Geophysicists explore the [[Inner core|Earth's core]] and [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] as well as the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] and [[Seismology|seismic]] activity of the lithosphere.&lt;ref name="smith 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=geodesy&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h=0|title=WordNet Search – 3.1|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/geodesy/welcome.html|title=NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Global Positioning Tutorial|work=noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geophysics is commonly used to supplement the work of [[geologist]]s in developing a comprehensive understanding of crustal geology, particularly in mineral and petroleum exploration. [[Seismologist]]s use geophysics to understand plate tectonic shifting, as well as predict seismic activity. See [[geophysical survey]].
* [[Soil science]] covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or [[pedosphere]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm Elissa Levine, 2001, The Pedosphere As A Hub] broken link? {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030004610/http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm |date=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major subdisciplines include [[edaphology]] and [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~doetqp-p/courses/env320/lec1/Lec1.html|title=Duane Gardiner, Lecture: Why Study Soils? excerpted from Miller, R.W. &amp; D.T. Gardiner, 1998. Soils in our Environment, 8th Edition|work=nau.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ecology]] covers the interactions between the [[biota (ecology)|biota]], with their natural environment. This field of study differentiates the study of the Earth, from the study of other planets in the [[Solar System]]; the Earth being the only planet teeming with life.
* [[Hydrology]], [[Oceanography]] and [[Limnology]] are a study revolved around the movement, distribution, and quality of the water and involves all the components of the hydrologic cycle on the earth and its atmosphere (or [[hydrosphere]]). "Sub-disciplines of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface water hydrology, hydrogeology, watershed science, forest hydrology, and water chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flatheadwatershed.org/watershed/hydrology.shtml|title=Hydrology of the Watershed|last=Craig|first=Kendall|authorlink=Craig N. Kendall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Glaciology]] covers the [[ice|icy]] parts of the Earth (or [[cryosphere]]).
* [[Atmospheric sciences]] cover the [[gas]]eous parts of the Earth (or [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]) between the surface and the [[exosphere]] (about 1000&amp;nbsp;km). Major subdisciplines include meteorology, climatology, [[atmospheric chemistry]], and [[atmospheric physics]].

[[Plate tectonics]], [[mountain]] ranges, [[volcano]]es, and [[earthquake]]s are [[geology|geological phenomena]] that can be explained in terms of physical and chemical processes in the [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html|title=Earth's Energy Budget|work=ou.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- A diagram is needed here. --&gt;
Beneath the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] lies the [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] which is heated by the [[radioactive decay]] of [[heavy elements]]. The mantle is not quite solid and consists of [[magma]] which is in a state of semi-perpetual [[wikt:convection|convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simison|2007|loc=paragraph 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adams tectonics"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 94–95, 100, 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|pp= 13–17, 218, G-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldroyd tectonics"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldroyd|2006|pp= 101,103,104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics might be thought of as the process by which the Earth is resurfaced. As the result of [[seafloor spreading]], new crust and lithosphere is created by the flow of magma from the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] to the near surface, through fissures, where it cools and solidifies. Through  [[subduction]], oceanic crust and lithosphere returns to the convecting mantle.&lt;ref name="adams tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oldroyd tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of the crust where new crust is created are called ''divergent boundaries'', those where it is brought back into the Earth are ''convergent boundaries'' and those where plates slide past each other, but no new lithospheric material is created or destroyed, are referred to as [[transform fault|transform]] (or conservative) boundaries&lt;ref name="adams tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oldroyd tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earthquakes]] result from the movement of the lithospheric plates, and they often occur near convergent boundaries where parts of the crust are forced into the Earth as part of subduction.&lt;ref name="smith subduction"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|pp= 325–26, 329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- A diagram is needed here. --&gt;
[[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material. Crust material that is forced into the [[asthenosphere]] melts, and some portion of the melted material becomes light enough to rise to the surface—giving birth to volcanoes.&lt;ref name="adams tectonics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smith subduction" /&gt;

== Earth's atmosphere ==
{{Main article|Atmosphere of Earth}}
[[File:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[magnetosphere]] shields the surface of Earth from the charged particles of the [[solar wind]].&lt;!---It is compressed on the day (Sun) side due to the force of the arriving particles, and extended on the night side.---&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(''image not to scale.'')]]
The [[troposphere]], [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], [[thermosphere]], and [[exosphere]] are the five layers which make up Earth's atmosphere. In all, the atmosphere is made up of about 78.0% [[nitrogen]], 20.9% [[oxygen]], and 0.92% [[argon]]. 75% of the gases in the atmosphere are located within the troposphere, the bottom-most layer. The remaining one percent of the atmosphere (all but the nitrogen, oxygen, and argon) contains small amounts of other gases including CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water vapors.&lt;ref name="adams atmosphere"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 107–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water vapors and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allow the Earth's atmosphere to catch and hold the Sun's energy through a phenomenon called the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Heritage|p= 770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Earth's surface to be warm enough to have liquid water and support life. In addition to storing heat, the atmosphere also protects living organisms by shielding some of the Earth's surface from [[cosmic rays]]—of which are often incorrectly thought to be deflected by the [[magnetic field]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parker|first=Eugene|title=Shielding Space|publisher=Scientific American|date=March 2006 |url=https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic field—created by the internal motions of the core—produces the [[magnetosphere]] which protects the Earth's atmosphere from the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Lambert|2006|pp= 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Earth is [[Age of the earth|4.5 billion]] years old,&lt;ref name="age earth"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Pun|2006|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; it would have lost its atmosphere by now if there were no protective magnetosphere.

== Earth's magnetic field ==
An [[electromagnet]] is a magnet that is created by an electric current.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Heritage|p= 576}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth has a solid iron [[Earth core|inner core]] surrounded by fluid [[outer core]] that convects;&lt;ref name="oldroyd core" /&gt; therefore, the Earth is an [[electromagnet]]. The motion of fluid convection [[dynamo theory|sustains]] the Earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref name="oldroyd core"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldroyd|2006|p= 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/~pauld/etc/210BPaper.pdf |title=Dynamo Theory and Earth's Magnetic Field. |author=Demorest, Paul |date=2001-05-21 |accessdate=2007-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221094040/http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/~pauld/etc/210BPaper.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
Methodologies vary depending on the nature of the subjects being studied. Studies typically fall into one of three categories: observational, experimental, or theoretical. Earth scientists often conduct sophisticated computer analysis or go to many of the world's most exotic locations to study Earth phenomena (e.g. Antarctica or hot spot island chains).

A foundational idea within the study Earth science is the notion of uniformitarianism. Uniformitarianism dictates that "ancient geologic features are interpreted by understanding active processes that are readily observed."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In other words, any geologic processes at work in the present have operated in the same ways throughout geologic time. This enables those who study Earth's history to apply knowledge of how Earth processes operate in the present to gain insight into how the planet has evolved and changed throughout deep history.

== Earth's spheres ==
{{Nature timeline}}
Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]];&lt;ref name="wheeling"&gt;[http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html Earth's Spheres] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831022404/http://www2.cet.edu/ete/hilk4/intro/spheres.html |date=August 31, 2007 }}. ©1997–2000. Wheeling Jesuit University/NASA Classroom of the Future. Retrieved November 11, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; these correspond to [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[water]], [[air]] and [[life]]. Also included by some are the [[cryosphere]] (corresponding to [[ice]]) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere and the [[pedosphere]] (corresponding to [[soil]]) as an active and intermixed sphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">In [[electrical engineering]], '''electric machine''' is a general term for [[machine]]s using [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]]s, such as [[electric motor]]s, [[electric generator]]s, and others. They are [[electromechanical]] energy converters: an electric motor converts electricity to [[mechanical power]] while an electric generator converts mechanical power to electricity. The moving parts in a machine can be rotating (''rotating machines'') or linear (''linear machines'').  Besides motors and generators, a third category often included is [[transformer]]s, which although they do not have any [[moving parts]] are also energy converters, changing the [[voltage]] level of an [[alternating current]].&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan. Handbook of Transformer Design and Applications, Chap. 1 p1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric machines, in the form of generators, produce virtually all electric power on Earth, and in the form of electric motors consume approximately 60% of all electric power produced. Electric machines were developed beginning in the mid 19th century and since that time have been a ubiquitous component of the  infrastructure. Developing more efficient electric machine technology is crucial to any global conservation, [[green energy]], or [[alternative energy]] strategy.

==Generator==
[[File:ManitobaHydroPointeduBois Generator.jpg|thumb|Electric generator.]]
{{main|Electric generator}}
An electric generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. A generator forces [[electrons]] to flow through an external [[electrical circuit]].  It is somewhat analogous to a water pump, which creates a flow of water but does not create the water inside.  The source of mechanical energy, the [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]], may be a reciprocating or turbine [[steam engine]], water falling through a [[hydropower|turbine or waterwheel]], an [[internal combustion engine]], a [[wind turbine]], a hand [[crank (mechanism)|crank]], [[compressed air]] or any other source of mechanical energy.

The two main parts of an electrical machine can be described in either mechanical or electrical terms. In mechanical terms, the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] is the rotating part, and the [[stator]] is the stationary part of an electrical machine. In electrical terms, the armature is the power-producing component and the field is the magnetic field component of an electrical machine. The armature can be on either the rotor or the stator. The [[magnetic field]] can be provided by either [[electromagnet]]s or [[permanent magnet]]s mounted on either the rotor or the stator. Generators are classified into two types, [[AC generator]]s and [[DC generator]]s.

===AC generator===
An [[AC generator]] converts mechanical energy into [[AC electricity|alternating current electricity]]. Because power transferred into the field circuit is much less than power transferred into the armature circuit, AC generators nearly always have the field winding on the rotor and the armature winding on the stator.

AC generators are classified into several types.
*In an [[induction generator]], the stator magnetic flux induces currents in the rotor. The prime mover then drives the rotor above the synchronous speed, causing the opposing rotor flux to cut the stater coils producing active current in the stater coils, thus sending power back to the electrical grid. An induction generator draws reactive power from the connected system and so cannot be an isolated source of power. 
*In a [[alternator|Synchronous generator (alternator)]], the current for the magnetic field is provided by a separate [[Excitation (magnetic)|DC current source]].

===DC generator===
An electric generator is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. An electric generator works based on the principle that whenever conductor cuts the magnetic field, an emf is induced which will cause the current to flow if conductor circuit is closed. Take the working of simple loop Generator as an example.

==Motor==
[[File:Silniki by Zureks.jpg|thumb|Electric motor.|236x236px]]
{{main|Electric motor}}
An electric motor converts [[electrical energy]] into [[mechanical energy]]. The reverse process of electrical generators, most [[electric motors]] operate through interacting [[magnetic fields]] and [[electrical conductor|current-carrying conductors]] to generate rotational force. Motors and generators have many similarities and many types of electric motors can be run as generators, and vice versa.
Electric motors are found in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, [[power tools]], and [[hard drive|disk drives]]. They may be powered by direct current or by alternating current which leads to the two main classifications: [[AC motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s.

===AC motor===
{{main|AC motor}}
An [[AC motor]] converts alternating current into mechanical energy. It commonly consists of two basic parts, an outside stationary stator having coils supplied with alternating current to produce a rotating magnetic field, and an inside rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.
The two main types of AC motors are distinguished by the type of rotor used.
*[[induction motor|Induction (asynchronous) motor]], the rotor magnetic field is created by an [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] current. The rotor must turn slightly slower (or faster) than the stator magnetic field to provide the induced current. There are three types of induction motor rotors, which are [[squirrel-cage rotor]], [[wound rotor motor|wound rotor]] and [[solid core rotor]].
*[[Synchronous motor]], it does not rely on induction and so can rotate exactly at the supply frequency or sub-multiple. The magnetic field of the rotor is either generated by direct current delivered through slip rings ([[Excitation (magnetic)|exciter]]) or by a permanent magnet.

===DC motor===
{{main|DC motor}}
The [[brushed DC electric motor]] generates torque directly from DC power supplied to the motor by using internal commutation, stationary permanent magnets, and rotating electrical magnets. Brushes and springs carry the electric current from the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to the spinning wire windings of the rotor inside the motor. [[Brushless DC motor]]s use a rotating permanent magnet in the rotor, and stationary electrical magnets on the motor housing. A motor controller converts DC to [[alternating current|AC]].  This design is simpler than that of brushed motors because it eliminates the complication of transferring power from outside the motor to the spinning rotor.
An example of a brushless, synchronous DC motor is a [[stepper motor]] which can divide a full rotation into a large number of steps.

==Other electromagnetic machines==
Other electromagnetic machines include the [[Amplidyne]], [[Synchro]], [[Metadyne]], [[Adjustable-speed_drive#Eddy_current_drives|Eddy current clutch]], [[Eddy current brake]], [[Dynamometer#Eddy_current_type_absorber|Eddy current dynamometer]], [[Dynamometer#Hysteresis_dynamometers|Hysteresis dynamometer]], [[Rotary converter]], and [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard set]]. A rotary converter is a combination of machines that act as a mechanical rectifier, inverter or frequency converter. The Ward Leonard set is a combination of machines used to provide speed control. Other machine combinations include the Kraemer and Scherbius systems.

==Transformer==
[[File:Trafostation Alter Hellweg IMGP4722.jpg|thumb|Transformer.]]
{{main|Transformer}}
A transformer is a static device that converts [[alternating current]] from one voltage level to another level (higher or lower), or to the same level, without changing the frequency. A transformer transfers [[electrical energy]] from one [[electrical network|circuit]] to another through [[inductive coupling|inductively coupled]] conductors—the transformer's coils.  A varying [[electric current]] in the first or ''primary'' winding creates a varying [[magnetic flux]] in the transformer's core and thus a varying [[magnetic field]] through the ''secondary'' winding. This varying magnetic field [[electromagnetic induction|induces]] a varying [[electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]] or "[[volt]]age" in the secondary winding. This effect is called [[mutual induction]].

There are three types of transformers
# Step-up transformer
# Step-down  transformer
# [[Isolation transformer]]

There are four types of transformers based on structure
# core type
# shell type
# power type
# instrument type

==Electromagnetic-rotor machines==
''Electromagnetic-rotor machines'' are machines having some kind of electric current in the rotor which creates a magnetic field which interacts with the stator windings. The rotor current can be the internal current in a permanent magnet (PM machine), a current supplied to the rotor through brushes (Brushed machine) or a current set up in closed rotor windings by a varying magnetic field (Induction machine).

===Permanent magnet machines===
''PM machines'' have permanent magnets in the rotor which set up a magnetic field. The magnetomotive force in a PM (caused by orbiting electrons with aligned spin) is generally much higher than what is possible in a copper coil. The copper coil can, however, be filled with a ferromagnetic material, which gives the coil much lower [[magnetic reluctance]]. Still the magnetic field created by modern PMs ([[Neodymium magnet]]s) is stronger, which means that PM machines have a better torque/volume and torque/weight ratio than machines with rotor coils under continuous operation. This may change with introduction of superconductors in rotor.

Since the permanent magnets in a PM machine already introduce considerable magnetic reluctance, then the reluctance in the air gap and coils are less important. This gives considerable freedom when designing PM machines.

It is usually possible to overload electric machines for a short time until the current in the coils heats parts of the machine to a temperature which cause damage. PM machines can in less degree be subjected to such overload because too high current in the coils can create a magnetic field strong enough to demagnetise the magnets.

===Brushed machines===
''Brushed machines'' are machines where the rotor coil is supplied with current through brushes in much the same way as current is supplied to the car in an electric [[slot car]] track. More durable brushes can be made of graphite or liquid metal. It is even possible to eliminate the brushes in a "brushed machine" by using a part of rotor and stator as a transformer which transfer current without creating torque. Brushes must not be confused with a commutator. The difference is that the brushes only transfer electric current to a moving rotor while a commutator also provide switching of the current direction.

There is iron (usually [[Transformer#Construction|laminated steel cores]] made of [[sheet metal]]) between the rotor coils and teeth of iron between the stator coils in addition to black iron behind the stator coils. The gap between rotor and stator is also made as small as possible. All this is done to minimize magnetic reluctance of the [[magnetic circuit]] which the magnetic field created by the rotor coils travels through, something which is important for optimizing these machines.

Large brushed machines which are run with DC to the stator windings at synchronous speed are the most common generator in [[power plant]]s, because they also supply [[reactive power]] to the grid, because they can be started by the turbine and because the machine in this system can generate power at constant speed without a controller. This type of machine is often referred to in the literature as a synchronous machine.

This machine can also be run by connecting the stator coils to the grid, and supplying the rotor coils with AC from an inverter. The advantage is that it is possible to control rotating speed of the machine with a fractionally rated inverter. When run this way the machine is known as a [[Doubly fed electric machine#Double fed induction generator|brushed double feed "induction" machine]]. "Induction" is misleading because there is no useful current in the machine which is set up by induction.

===Induction machines===
[[Induction motor|''Induction machines'']] have short circuited rotor coils where a current is set up and maintained by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]]. This requires that the rotor rotates at other than synchronous speed, so that the rotor coils are subjected to a varying magnetic field created by the stator coils. An induction machine is an asynchronous machine.

Induction eliminates the need for brushes which is usually a weak part in an electric machine. It also allows designs which make it very easy to manufacture the rotor. A metal cylinder will work as rotor, but to improve efficiency a "squirrel cage" rotor or a rotor with closed windings is usually used. The speed of asynchronous induction machines will decrease with increased load because a larger speed difference between stator and rotor is necessary to set up sufficient rotor current and rotor magnetic field. Asynchronous induction machines can be made so they start and run without any means of control if connected to an AC grid, but the starting torque is low.

A special case would be an induction machine with superconductors in the rotor. The current in the superconductors will be set up by induction, but the rotor will run at synchronous speed because there will be no need for a speed difference between the magnetic field in stator and speed of rotor to maintain the rotor current.

Another special case would be the [[Doubly fed electric machine#Brushless doubly fed versions|brushless double fed induction machine]], which has a double set of coils in the stator. Since it has two moving magnetic fields in the stator, it gives no meaning to talk about synchronous or asynchronous speed.

==Reluctance machines==
[[Reluctance motor|''Reluctance machines'']] have no windings in rotor, only a ferromagnetic material shaped so that "electromagnets" in stator can "grab" the teeth in rotor and move it a little. The electromagnets are then turned off, while another set of electromagnets is turned on to move stator further. Another name is step motor, and it is suited for low speed and accurate position control. Reluctance machines can be supplied with PMs in stator to improve performance. The “electromagnet” is then “turned off” by sending a negative current in the coil. When the current is positive the magnet and the current cooperate to create a stronger magnetic field which will improve the reluctance machine’s maximum torque without increasing the currents maximum absolute value.

==Electrostatic machines==
In [[Electrostatic motor|''electrostatic machines'']], torque is created by attraction or repulsion of electric charge in rotor and stator.

[[Electrostatic generator]]s generate electricity by building up electric charge.  Early types were [[friction]] machines, later ones were influence machines that worked by [[electrostatic induction]].  The [[Van de Graaff generator]] is an electrostatic generator still used in research today.

==Homopolar machines==
[[Homopolar motor|''Homopolar machines'']] are true DC machines where current is supplied to a spinning wheel through brushes. The wheel is inserted in a magnetic field, and torque is created as the current travels from the edge to the centre of the wheel through the magnetic field.

==Electric machine systems==
For optimized or practical operation of electric machines, today's electric machine systems are complemented with electronic control.

'''Engineering biology''' is the set of methods for designing, building, and testing engineered biological systems which have been used to manipulate information, construct materials, process chemicals, produce energy, provide food, and help maintain or enhance human health and environment

== History ==
Rapid advances in the ability to genetically modify biological organisms have advanced a new engineering discipline, commonly referred to as [[synthetic biology]]. This approach seeks to harness the power of living systems for a variety of manufacturing applications, such as advanced therapeutics, sustainable fuels, chemical feedstocks, and advanced materials. To date, research in synthetic biology has typically relied on trial-and-error approaches, which are costly, laborious, and inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, C. A., Chuang, R. Y., Noskov, V.

Environmental Modelling &amp; Software publishes contributions, in the form of research articles, reviews and short communications, on recent advances in environmental modelling and/or software. The aim is to improve our capacity to represent, understand, predict or manage the behaviour of environmental systems at all practical scales, and to communicate those improvements to a wide scientific and professional audience.

It seeks presentation of: 
• Generic frameworks, techniques and issues which either integrate a range of disciplines and sectors or apply across a range 
• Model development, model evaluation, process identification and applications in diverse sectors of the environment (as outlined below) provided they reveal insights and contribute to the store of knowledge. Insights can relate to the generality and limitations of the modelling, methods, the model application and/or the systems modelled. Insights should be ones that are generalizable in some way and are likely to be of interest to those studying other systems and, preferably, other system types.
• Development and application of environmental software, information and decision support systems
• Real-world applications of software technologies - particularly state-of-the-art environmental software able to deal with complex requirements, conflicting user perspectives, and/or evolving data structures. Aspects related to software usability, reliability, verification and validation should be backed up with quantitative results as much as possible. Development and maintenance costs, and adoption and penetration of the software in the target user groups should be addressed. Licensing issues and open source access should be clearly specified.
• Issues and methods related to the integrated modeling, assessment and management of environmental systems - including relevant policy and institutional analysis, public participation principles and methods, decision making methods, model integration, quality assurance and evaluation of models, data and procedure. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-modelling-and-software

'''Erotic talk''', also known as love talk, dirty talk, gross talk, talking dirty, or talking gross is the practice of using explicit word imagery to heighten sexual excitement before and during (or instead of) physical [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. It is commonly a part of [[foreplay]], and can include vivid erotic descriptions, [[Off-color humor|sexual humor]], sexual commands and [[Profanity|rude words]]. It may be whispered into a partner's ear, spoken over a telephone, or put into text.

When lovers are apart from one another and [[physical intimacy]] is impossible, it can be an important aspect of [[virtual sex]], particularly [[phone sex]] and [[cybersex]]. Additionally, dirty talk is more sexual in nature than [[pillow talk]] and tends to precede rather than follow lovemaking.

The [[Marquis de Sade]], who fancied himself an expert on matters sexual, states in the introduction to ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'' that "among [[libertines]], it is commonly accepted that the most [[voluptuous]] sensations are transmitted by the organs of [[hearing]]" -- that is, that dirty talk is the most arousing form of sex.  One fictional character in [[Pornographic film|porn films]] that became associated with the idea of men using sexual dirty talk with women was actor [[John Leslie (pornographic actor)|John Leslie]]'s character of 'Jack' in ''[[Talk Dirty to Me (film)|Talk Dirty to Me]]'' (1980).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9955">'''Fair trade bananas''' are bananas produced in partnership with an [[alternative trade organization]] which focuses on increasing the price paid to small banana growers and the wages of agricultural workers. This is not a commercial brand, but a marketing strategy.  Fair trade is based on higher prices paid by consumers that allow an equitable distribution of gains from trade over the chain partners.&lt;ref&gt;La Cruz, G. "The Contribution of Fair Trade Towards Market Access by Smallholder Banana Producers." Agro-Food Chains and Networks for Development, 14 (2006): 69-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many of organizations involved in producing fair trade bananas; for example, an organization called Banafair began importing uncertified/unlabeled fair trade bananas into Germany in the mid-1980s (from 500 to 1 000 tonnes annually). In 1997 Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) was established in Bonn, Germany to consolidate various [[Fair trade#Rise of labeling initiatives|labeling initiatives]] and establish worldwide standards for fair trade bananas. The first fair trade labelled bananas imported to Germany were by TransFair in April 1998.

[[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International]], (now renamed Fair Trade International), is a large importer whose bananas bear the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|International FairTrade Certification Mark]]. FLO-CERT is the international body that inspects the farms to ensure they meet the proper social and environmental according to Fair Trade international standards.

==Global banana industry==
Five companies control about 80% of the conventional banana trade.  This situation, plus the intervention of various governments, has kept the price paid to banana growers and wages to workers a small percentage of the supermarket price.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, James. The Banana: Empires, Trade Wars, and Globalization. Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Macdara. "Busting Banana Unions In Belize." Multinational Monitor 17.9 (1996): 27. MasterFILE Premier. Web. 11 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of this effect are the [[Banana Wars|banana wars]]; the formation of the [[United Fruit Company]] (now Chiquita Brands Intl.); the [[Bananagate]] bribery scandal; military coups to establish and maintain [[banana republics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/march99/clinton11.htm Washingtonpost.com: Clinton: Support for Guatemala Was Wrong&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article23211.htm Honduras: Military Coup Engineered By Two US Companies : Information Clearing House - ICH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is ongoing industry conflict with unions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://usleap.org/banana-unions-launch-initiative-against-chiquita Banana Unions Launch Initiative Against Chiquita | USLEAP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/producers/bananas/winfa_2/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fair trade certification ==

FLO has different standards for small banana farms and larger banana plantations. To be eligible to display a Fair Trade Certification Mark, small farmers must create a panel of both workers and management to determine the best use of the fair trade premiums.  Revenues to banana farmers must be equally shared between the working members of the cooperative or association.

On larger plantations, the premiums can only be used for improving working and living conditions. Forced labor and labor of children under 16 years of age is prohibited, as is dangerous work.  Young adults 16 years of age or older must not work so many hours that they have no time for education. Workers must be allowed to join a union, and be paid at least regional industry average or minimum wage.

Although fair trade banana workers’ wages are not significantly above industry averages, they receive wage related benefits which increase their overall livelihood. However, many small banana farmers barely make living wages themselves, and the restriction of premiums to community development projects may prevent them from covering basic living expenses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/includes/documents/cm_docs/2011/F/Fairtrade%20in%20the%20Banana%20Sector_IDS%20Final%20Report%20December%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fair trade price and premium ==

Monetary premiums are paid for fair trade banana growers to improve their communities. In 2013, FairTrade Certified banana producers receive a FairTrade Minimum Premium of $1 US dollar per 18.14 kilogram box of bananas to invest in community projects.  FairTrade farmers are guaranteed a minimum price to help cover the costs of sustainable production, but the price differs between regions and is subject to market fluctuations in the sustainable cost of agricultural production. Although FairTrade minimum prices vary, FairTrade Minimum premiums do not. Both FairTrade prices and premiums are set at the same level for FairTrade certified [[plantation]]s and small farms.

== Environmental impacts ==

The agricultural production of bananas on a large scale often uses more pesticides (and fungicides, fertilizers) than any other fresh fruit commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Koeppel, Dan.Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World. New York: Hudson Street, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair Trade banana production promotes sustainable farming practices,&lt;ref&gt;Frundt, HenryJ. November 20–30, 2000. Toward a Hegemonic Resolution in the Banana Trade, International Political Science Review / Revue internationale de science politique, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Apr., 2005), pp. 215-237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shreck, A. "Resistance, Redistribution, and Power in the Fair Trade Banana Initiative." Agriculture and Human Values, 22.1 (2005): 17-29&lt;/ref&gt; but these result in a higher supermarket price which some consumers are willing to pay for ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Thøgersen, J. (2000), "Promoting green consumer behavior with eco-labels", paper presented at National Academy of Sciences/national Research Council Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change, Washington, DC, November 20–30, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strong, C. (1996), "Features contributing to the growth of ethical consumerism: a preliminary investigation", Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning, Vol. 14, pp. 5-13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahé, Thuriane. "Are Stated Preferences Confirmed by Purchasing Behaviours? the Case of Fair Trade-certified Bananas in Switzerland." Journal of Business Ethics, 92.Suppl 2 (2010): 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and discussion==
Because the banana trade is a large world-wide business, a number of studies have been carried out on various aspects of the fair trade banana market, including political ecology,&lt;ref&gt;GROSSMAN, LS. "The Political Ecology of Banana Exports and Local Food-production in St-vincent, Eastern Caribbean." Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 83.2 (1993): 347-367.&lt;/ref&gt; tariffs and quotas,&lt;ref&gt;Desombre, http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol4_1/desombre.htm&lt;/ref&gt; price competition,&lt;ref&gt;Moberg, M.

Fair trade certification programs have been criticized on several grounds. Griffiths has challenged the ethics of fair trade labels in the [[fair trade debate]], and, in the Journal of Business Ethics, has pointed out instances in which negative research is not published and academics  choose only successful coops or fair trade organizations for study.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Dominican Republic, Shreck found minimum pricing,&lt;ref&gt;Shreck, A. (2002b) Just bananas? A Fair Trade alternative for small-scale producers in the Dominican Republic. PhD Dissertation, Colorado State University&lt;/ref&gt; and exclusivity of certification worsened socioeconomic disparity within farming communities, and limited access for non-certified farmers to the market.&lt;ref&gt;Shreck, A. "Just bananas? Fair Trade banana production in the Dominican Republic." International Journal of Sociology of Agriculture and Food, 10 (2002) 11–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Shrek found that the standards of certification programs prioritized market interests over farmer rights and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrek|first=Aimee|title=What Organic and Fair Trade Labels do not tell us: Towards a place based understanding of certification|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|year=2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank has argued that fair trade initiatives do not generally foster an empowering partnership between consumers and farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, D. (2003) Where are the workers in consumer-worker alliances? Class dynamics and the history of consumer- labor campaigns. Politics and Society, 31, 363–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2082">[[File:Royal Palm Roots.jpg|thumb|Fibrous roots of mature ''[[Roystonea regia]]'' palm, [[Kolkata, India]] ]]

A '''fibrous root system''' is the opposite of a [[taproot]] system. It is usually formed by thin, moderately branching [[root]]s growing from the [[Plant stem|stem]].  A fibrous root system is universal in [[monocotyledon]]ous plants and [[fern]]s. The fibrous root systems look like a mat made out of roots when the tree has reached full maturity.

Most [[tree]]s begin life with a taproot, but after one to a few years change to a wide-spreading fibrous root system with mainly horizontal surface roots and only a few vertical, deep anchoring roots. A typical mature tree 30–50 m tall has a root system that extends horizontally in all directions as far as the tree is tall or more, but well over 95% of the roots are in the top 50 cm depth of soil.

A few plants with fibrous root systems:
* [[Coconut]] palm&lt;ref&gt;Thampan, P.K. (1981). ''Handbook on Coconut Palm''. Oxford &amp; IBH Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Grass]]
* 
Fibrous roots grow fairly close to the surface of the ground.
Leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.

Forages have a fibrous root system, which helps combat erosion by anchoring the plants to the top layer of the soil, and covering the entirety of the field, as it is a non-row crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://homeguides.sfgate.com/advantages-fibrous-root-taproot-systems-104165.html|title=The Advantages of the Fibrous Root &amp; Taproot Systems|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a fibrous root system, the roots grow downwards into the soil, and also branch off sideways throughout the soil. This forms a mass of fine roots, with no distinct tap root, because the embryonic root dies back while the plant is still young and growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cropsreview.com/fibrous-root.html|title=Taproot and Fibrous Root Systems, Specialized Roots|newspaper=CropsReview.Com|author=Bareja, Ben G. |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papermaster. "Membrane properties of living mammalian cells as studied by enzymatic hydrolysis of fluorogenic esters." Proceedings of the national academy of sciences 55.1 (1966): 134-141.&lt;/ref&gt;
The phenomenon is widely used to measure cellular viability of many different species including animals, plants, and microorganisms.  Moreover, fluorochromasia has been observed within organs, embryos, and [[zebrafish]]. Fluorochromasia has many applications including histocompatibility testing, measurement of cytotoxic antibodies, in vitro chemo sensitivity testing of tumors, and fluorochrome intercellular translocation. It has been applied with plants,&lt;ref&gt;Widholm, Jack M. "The use of fluorescein diacetate and phenosafranine for determining viability of cultured plant cells."

== History ==
In 1966, Rotman and Papermaster accidentally discovered fluorochromasia while studying intracellular enzymes using [[fluorogenic substrates]]. They studied its mode of action and presented a molecular model in which intracellular retention of fluorescein depends on the integrity of the cell membrane. Non- polar molecules of fluorescein-esters, such as fluorescein diacetate, readily enter the cell and are hydrolyzed
by non-specific esterases producing fluorescein, as the polar compound.  In viable cells, the intracellular fluorescein is unable to readily pass through the intact membrane (i.e., it leaks slowly),accumulating in the cytoplasm of the cell. Their model is illustrated in Figure 1.

'''Flux balance analysis''' ('''FBA''') is a mathematical method for simulating metabolism in genome-scale reconstructions of [[metabolic network]]s. In comparison to traditional methods of modeling, FBA is less intensive in terms of the input data required for constructing the model. Simulations performed using FBA are computationally inexpensive and can calculate steady-state metabolic fluxes for large models (over 2000 reactions) in a few seconds on modern personal computers.

FBA finds applications in [[bioprocess engineering]] to systematically identify modifications to the metabolic networks of microbes used in fermentation processes that improve product yields of industrially important chemicals such as ethanol and succinic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ranganathan | first1 = Sridhar | last2 = Suthers | first2 = Patrick F. | last3 = Maranas | first3 = Costas D. | year = 2010 | title = OptForce: An Optimization Procedure for Identifying All Genetic Manipulations Leading to Targeted Overproductions | url = | journal = PLoS Comput Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 4| page = e1000744 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000744 | pmid = 20419153 | pmc = 2855329 | bibcode = 2010PLSCB...6E0744R }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used for the identification of putative drug targets in cancer &lt;ref name="genome_scale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis, NE|author2=Abdel-Haleem, AM|title=The evolution of genome-scale models of cancer metabolism|journal=Front.

The thickness of the arrows is proportional to the flux through the reaction.

FBA formalizes the system of equations describing the concentration changes in a metabolic network as the dot product of a matrix of the stoichiometric coefficients (the stoichiometric matrix '''S''') and the vector '''v''' of the unsolved fluxes. The right-hand side of the dot product is a vector of zeros representing the system at [[steady state]]. [[Linear programming]] is then used to calculate a solution of fluxes corresponding to the steady state.

==History==

Some of the earliest work in FBA dates back to the early 1980s. Papoutsakis&lt;ref name="Papoutsakis, ET. 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papoutsakis | first1 = ET | year = 1984 | title = Equations and calculations for fermentations of butyric acid bacteria | url = | journal = Biotech Bioeng | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 174–187 | doi=10.1002/bit.260260210| pmid = 18551704 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that it was possible to construct flux balance equations using a metabolic map. It was Watson,&lt;ref name="Watson, MR. 1984"&gt;Watson MR (1984) Metabolic maps for the Apple II. 12, 1093-1094&lt;/ref&gt; however, who first introduced the idea of using linear programming and an objective function to solve for the fluxes in a pathway. The first significant study was subsequently published by Fell and Small,&lt;ref name="Fell DA and Small JR. 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fell | first1 = DA | last2 = Small | first2 = JR | year = 1986 | title = Fat synthesis in adipose tissue.

FBA is not computationally intensive, taking on the order of seconds to calculate optimal fluxes for biomass production for a typical network (around 2000 reactions). This means that the effect of deleting reactions from the network and/or changing flux constraints can be sensibly modelled on a single computer.

===Gene/reaction deletion and perturbation studies===

====Single reaction deletion====
A frequently used technique to search a metabolic network for reactions that are particularly critical to the production of biomass. By removing each reaction in a network in turn and measuring the predicted flux through the biomass function, each reaction can be classified as either essential (if the flux through the biomass function is substantially reduced) or non-essential (if the flux through the biomass function is unchanged or only slightly reduced).

====Pairwise reaction deletion====
Pairwise reaction deletion of all possible pairs of reactions is useful when looking for drug targets, as it allows the simulation of multi-target treatments, either by a single drug with multiple targets or by drug combinations. Double deletion studies can also quantify the synthetic lethal interactions between different pathways providing a measure of the contribution of the pathway to overall network robustness.

==== Single and multiple gene deletions====
Genes are connected to enzyme-catalyzed reactions by [[Boolean expression]]s known as Gene-Protein-Reaction expressions (GPR). Typically a GPR takes the form (Gene A AND Gene B) to indicate that the products of genes A and B are protein sub-units that assemble to form the complete protein and therefore the absence of either would result in deletion of the reaction. On the other hand, if the GPR is (Gene A OR Gene B) it implies that the products of genes A and B are [[isozymes]].

Therefore, it is possible to evaluate the effect of single or multiple gene deletions by evaluation of the GPR as a Boolean expression. If the GPR evaluates to '''false''', the reaction is constrained to zero in the model prior to performing FBA. Thus gene knockouts can be simulated using FBA.

====Interpretation of gene and reaction deletion results====
The utility of reaction inhibition and deletion analyses becomes most apparent if a gene-protein-reaction matrix has been assembled for the network being studied with FBA. The gene-protein-reaction matrix is a binary matrix connecting genes with the proteins made from them. Using this matrix, reaction essentiality can be converted into gene essentiality indicating the gene defects which may cause a certain disease phenotype or the proteins/enzymes which are essential (and thus what enzymes are the most promising drug targets in pathogens). However, the gene-protein-reaction matrix does not specify the Boolean relationship between genes with respect to the enzyme, instead it merely indicates an association between them. Therefore, it should be used only if the Boolean GPR expression is unavailable.

====Reaction inhibition====
The effect of inhibiting a reaction, rather than removing it entirely, can be simulated in FBA by restricting the allowed flux through it. The effect of an inhibition can be classified as lethal or non-lethal by applying the same criteria as in the case of a deletion where a suitable threshold is used to distinguish “substantially reduced” from “slightly reduced”. Generally the choice of threshold is arbitrary but a reasonable estimate can be obtained from growth experiments where the simulated inhibitions/deletions are actually performed and growth rate is measured.

====Growth media optimization====
To design optimal growth media with respect to enhanced growth rates or useful by-product secretion, it is possible to use a method known as Phenotypic Phase Plane analysis. PhPP involves applying FBA repeatedly on the model while co-varying the nutrient uptake constraints and observing the value of the objective function (or by-product fluxes). PhPP makes it possible to find the optimal combination of nutrients that favor a particular phenotype or a mode of metabolism resulting in higher growth rates or secretion of industrially useful by-products. The predicted growth rates of bacteria in varying media have been shown to correlate well with experimental results.&lt;ref name="Edwards, J. 2001" /&gt; as well as to define precise minimal media for the culture of ''Salmonella typhimurium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raghunathan | first1 = A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Constraint-based analysis of metabolic capacity of ''Salmonella typhimurium'' during host-pathogen interaction | url = | journal = BMC Systems Biology | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 38 | doi=10.1186/1752-0509-3-38 | pmid=19356237 | pmc=2678070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical description==

In contrast to the traditionally followed approach of metabolic modeling using coupled [[ordinary differential equations]], flux balance analysis requires very little information in terms of the enzyme kinetic parameters and concentration of metabolites in the system. It achieves this by making two assumptions, [[steady state]] and optimality. The first assumption is that the modeled system has entered a steady state, where the metabolite concentrations no longer change, i.e. in each metabolite node the producing and consuming fluxes cancel each other out. The second assumption is that the organism has been optimized through evolution for some biological goal, such as optimal growth or conservation of resources. The steady-state assumption reduces the system to a set of linear equations, which is then solved to find a flux distribution that satisfies the steady-state condition subject to the stoichiometry constraints while maximizing the value of a pseudo-reaction (the objective function) representing the conversion of biomass precursors into biomass.

The steady-state assumption dates to the ideas of [[material balance]] developed to model the growth of microbial cells in fermenters in bioprocess engineering. During microbial growth, a substrate consisting of a complex mixture of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen sources along with trace elements are consumed to generate biomass.
The material balance model for this process becomes:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} = \mathrm{Output} + \mathrm{Accumulation} &lt;/math&gt;

If we consider the system of microbial cells to be at steady state then we may set the accumulation term to zero and reduce the material balance equations to simple algebraic equations. In such a system, substrate becomes the input to the system which is consumed and biomass is produced becoming the output from the system. The material balance may then be represented as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} = \mathrm{Output} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} - \mathrm{Output} = \mathrm{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically, the algebraic equations can be represented as a dot product of a matrix of coefficients and a vector of the unknowns. Since the steady-state assumption puts the accumulation term to zero. The system can be written as:
: &lt;math&gt; \qquad A \cdot\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Extending this idea to metabolic networks, it is possible to represent a metabolic network as a stoichiometry balanced set of equations. Moving to the matrix formalism, we can represent the equations as the dot product of a matrix of stoichiometry coefficients (stoichiometric matrix &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) and the vector of fluxes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; as the unknowns and set the right hand side to 0 implying the steady state.

: &lt;math&gt; \qquad S \cdot\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;

Metabolic networks typically have more reactions than metabolites and this gives an under-determined system of linear equations containing more variables than equations. The standard approach to solve such under-determined systems is to apply [[linear programming]].

Linear programs are problems that can be expressed in [[canonical form]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \text{maximize} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{x}\\
&amp; \text{subject to} &amp;&amp; A \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{b} \\
&amp; \text{and} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{x} \ge \mathbf{0}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''x''' represents the vector of variables (to be determined), '''c''' and '''b''' are [[vector space|vectors]] of (known) coefficients, ''A'' is a (known) [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients, and &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[matrix transpose]]. The expression to be maximized or minimized is called the ''objective function'' ('''c'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''x''' in this case). The inequalities ''A'''''x'''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;'''b''' are the constraints which specify a [[convex polytope]] over which the objective function is to be optimized.

Linear Programming requires the definition of an objective function. The optimal solution to the LP problem is considered to be the solution which maximizes or minimizes the value of the objective function depending on the case in point. In the case of flux balance analysis, the objective function '''Z''' for the LP is often defined as biomass production. Biomass production is simulated by an equation representing a lumped reaction that converts various biomass precursors into one unit of biomass.

Therefore, the canonical form of a Flux Balance Analysis problem would be:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \text{maximize} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{v}\\
&amp; \text{subject to} &amp;&amp; S \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0} \\
&amp; \text{and} &amp;&amp; \mathbf{lower bound} \le \mathbf{v} \le \mathbf{upper bound}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; represents the vector of fluxes (to be determined), &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a (known) [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients. The expression to be maximized or minimized is called the ''objective function'' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in this case). The inequalities &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{lower bound} \le \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} \le \mathbf{upper bound}&lt;/math&gt; define, respectively, the minimal and the maximal rates of flux for every reaction corresponding to the columns of the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; matrix. These rates can be experimentally determined to constrain and improve the predictive accuracy of the model even further or they can be specified to an arbitrarily high value indicating no constraint on the flux through the reaction.

The main advantage of the flux balance approach is that it does not require any knowledge of the metabolite concentrations, or more importantly, the [[enzyme kinetics]] of the system; the homeostasis assumption precludes the need for knowledge of metabolite concentrations at any time as long as that quantity remains constant, and additionally it removes the need for specific [[Rate equation|rate laws]] since it assumes that at steady state, there is no change in the size of the metabolite pool in the system. The stoichiometric coefficients alone are sufficient for the mathematical maximization of a specific [[objective function]].

The objective function is essentially a measure of how each component in the system contributes to the production of the desired product. The product itself depends on the purpose of the model, but one of the most common examples is the study of total biomass. A notable example of the success of FBA is the ability to accurately predict the growth rate of the [[prokaryote]] ''[[E. coli]]'' when cultured in different conditions.&lt;ref name="Edwards, J. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = J. | last2 = Ibarra | first2 = R. | last3 = Palsson | first3 = B. | year = 2001 | title = ''In silico'' predictions of Escherichia coli metabolic capabilities are consistent with experimental data | doi = 10.1038/84379| journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 125–130 | pmid=11175725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the metabolic system was optimized to maximize the biomass objective function. However this model can be used to optimize the production of any product, and is often used to determine the output level of some [[Biotechnology|biotechnologically]] relevant product. The model itself can be experimentally verified by cultivating organisms using a [[chemostat]] or similar tools to ensure that nutrient concentrations are held constant. Measurements of the production of the desired objective can then be used to correct the model.

==Model preparation and refinement==
The key parts of model preparation are: creating a metabolic network without gaps, adding constraints to the model, and finally adding an objective function (often called the Biomass function), usually to simulate the growth of the organism being modelled.

===Metabolic network and software tools===
[[File:Prepare for FBA.png|right|thumb|The first six reactions in Glycolysis prepared for FBA through the addition of an objective function (red) and the import and export of nutrients (ATP, ADP, BDG, ADG) across the system boundary (dashed green line).{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

Metabolic networks can vary in scope from those describing a single [[Metabolic pathway|pathway]], up to the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] or [[organism]]. The main requirement of a metabolic network that forms the basis of an FBA-ready network is that it contains no gaps. This typically means that extensive manual curation is required, making the preparation of a metabolic network for flux-balance analysis a process that can take months or years.  However, recent advances such as so-called gap-filling methods can
reduce the required time to weeks or months.

Generally models are created in [[BioPAX]] or [[SBML]] format so that further analysis or visualization can take place in other software although this is not a requirement.

===Constraints===
A key part of FBA is the ability to add constraints to the flux rates of reactions within networks, forcing them to stay within a range of selected values. This lets the model more accurately simulate real metabolism. The constraints belong to two subsets from a biological perspective; boundary constraints that limit nutrient uptake/excretion and internal constraints that limit the flux through reactions within the organism.  In mathematical terms, the application of constraints can be considered to reduce the solution space of the FBA model. In addition to constraints applied at the edges of a metabolic network, constraints can be applied to reactions deep within the network. These constraints are usually simple; they may constrain the direction of a reaction due to energy considerations or constrain the maximum speed of a reaction due to the finite speed of all reactions in nature.

====Growth media constraints====
Organisms, and all other metabolic systems, require some input of nutrients. Typically the rate of uptake of nutrients is dictated by their availability (a nutrient that is not present cannot be absorbed), their concentration and diffusion constants (higher concentrations of quickly-diffusing metabolites are absorbed more quickly) and the method of absorption (such as [[active transport]] or [[facilitated diffusion]] versus simple diffusion).

If the rate of absorption (and/or excretion) of certain nutrients can be experimentally measured then this information can be added as a constraint on the flux rate at the edges of a metabolic model. This ensures that nutrients that are not present or not absorbed by the organism do not enter its metabolism (the flux rate is constrained to zero) and also means that known nutrient uptake rates are adhered to by the simulation. This provides a secondary method of making sure that the simulated metabolism has experimentally verified properties rather than just mathematically acceptable ones.

====Thermodynamical reaction constraints====
In principle, all reactions are reversible however in practice reactions often effectively occur in only one direction. This may be due to significantly higher concentration of reactants compared to the concentration of the products of the reaction. But more often it happens because the products of a reaction have a much lower free energy than the reactants and therefore the forward direction of a reaction is favored more.

For ideal reactions,

: &lt;math&gt; - \infty &lt;  v_i &lt; \infty \, &lt;/math&gt;

For certain reactions a thermodynamic constraint can be applied implying direction (in this case forward)

: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt;  v_i &lt; \infty \, &lt;/math&gt;

Realistically the flux through a reaction cannot be infinite (given that enzymes in the real system are finite) which implies that,

: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; v_i &lt; v_\max \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Experimentally measured flux Constraints====

Certain flux rates can be measured experimentally (&lt;math&gt;v_{i,m}\,&lt;/math&gt;) and the fluxes within a metabolic model can be constrained, within some error (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\,&lt;/math&gt;), to ensure these known flux rates are accurately reproduced in the simulation.

: &lt;math&gt;v_{i,m} - \varepsilon &lt; v_i &lt;v_{i,m}+ \varepsilon\,&lt;/math&gt;

Flux rates are most easily measured for nutrient uptake at the edge of the network. Measurements of internal fluxes is possible using radioactively labelled or NMR visible metabolites.

Constrained FBA-ready metabolic models can be analyzed using software such as the COBRA toolbox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becker | first1 = S.A. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2007 | title = Quantitative prediction of cellular metabolism with constraint-based models: the COBRA Toolbox | url = | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 727–38 | doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.99| pmid = 17406635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;(available implementations in [[MATLAB]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), SurreyFBA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gevorgyan | first1 = A | last2 = Bushell | first2 = ME | last3 = Avignone-Rossa | first3 = C | last4 = Kierzek | first4 = AM | year = 2011 | title = SurreyFBA: a command line tool and graphics user interface for constraint-based modeling of genome-scale metabolic reaction networks | url = | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 433–4 | pmid = 21148545 | doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq679}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the web-based FAME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boele | first1 = J | last2 = Olivier | first2 = BG | last3 = Teusink | first3 = B | year = 2012| title = FAME: the Flux Analysis and Modeling Environment | url = | journal = BMC Syst Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 1| page = 8 | pmid = 22289213 | doi=10.1186/1752-0509-6-8 | pmc=3317868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional software packages have been listed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/ | title=CoBRA Methods - Constraint-based analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive review of all such software and their functionalities has been recently reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakshmanan|first=M|author2=Koh, G |author3=Chung, BK |author4= Lee, DY |title=Software applications for flux balance analysis.|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=Jan 2014|volume=15|issue=1|pages=108–22|pmid=23131418 |doi=10.1093/bib/bbs069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An open-source alternative is available in the [[R (programming language)]] as the packages abcdeFBA or sybil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gelius-Dietrich | first1 = G. | last2 = Amer Desouki | first2 = A. | last3 = Fritzemeier | first3 = C.J. | last4 = Lercher | first4 = M.J. | year = 2013 | title = sybil – Efficient constraint-based modelling in R. | url = | journal = BMC Systems Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1| page = 125 | doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-7-125 | pmid = 24224957 | pmc = 3843580 }} Software available at https://cran.r-project.org/package=sybil&lt;/ref&gt; for performing FBA and other constraint based modeling techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Gangadharan A. Rohatgi N. abcdeFBA: Functions for Constraint Based Simulation using Flux Balance Analysis and informative analysis of the data generated during simulation. Available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abcdeFBA/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objective function===
FBA can give a large number of mathematically acceptable solutions to the steady-state problem &lt;math&gt;(S\vec v=0)&lt;/math&gt;. However  solutions of biological interest are the ones which produce the desired metabolites in the correct proportion. The objective function defines the proportion of these metabolites. For instance when modelling the growth of an organism the objective function is generally defined as biomass. Mathematically, it is a column in the stoichiometry matrix the entries of which place a "demand" or act as a "sink" for biosynthetic precursors such as fatty acids, amino acids and cell wall components which are present on the corresponding rows of the '''S''' matrix. These entries represent experimentally measured, dry weight proportions of cellular components. Therefore, this column becomes a lumped reaction that simulates growth and reproduction. Therefore, the accuracy of experimental measurements plays an essential role in the correct definition of the biomass function and makes the results of FBA biologically applicable by ensuring that the correct proportion of metabolites are produced by metabolism.

When modeling smaller networks the objective function can be changed accordingly. An example of this would be in the study of the [[Glycolysis|carbohydrate metabolism]] pathways where the objective function would probably be defined as a certain proportion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADH]] and thus simulate the production of high energy metabolites by this pathway.

====Optimization of the objective/biomass function====
Linear programming can be used to find a single optimal solution. The most common biological optimization goal for a whole-organism metabolic network would be to choose the flux vector &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; that maximises the flux through a biomass function composed of the constituent metabolites of the organism placed into the stoichiometric matrix and denoted &lt;math&gt;v_\textrm{biomass}&lt;/math&gt; or simply &lt;math&gt;v_b&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 
\max_{ \vec v}\ v_b  \qquad \textrm{s. t.} \qquad \mathbf{S} \, \vec v=0
&lt;/math&gt;

In the more general case any reaction can be defined and added to the biomass function with either the condition that it be maximised or minimised if a single “optimal” solution is desired. Alternatively, and in the most general case, a vector &lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; can be introduced, which defines the weighted set of reactions that the linear programming model should aim to maximise or minimise,

: &lt;math&gt; 
\max_{ \vec v}\ \vec v \cdot \vec c \qquad \textrm{s. t.} \qquad \mathbf{S}\,\vec{v}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of there being only a single separate biomass function/reaction within the stoichiometric matrix &lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; would simplify to all zeroes with a value of 1 (or any non-zero value) in the position corresponding to that biomass function. Where there were multiple separate objective functions &lt;math&gt;\vec c&lt;/math&gt; would simplify to all zeroes with weighted values in the positions corresponding to all objective functions.

=== Reducing the solution space – biological considerations for the system ===
The analysis of the null space of matrices is implemented in software packages specialized for matrix operations such as Matlab and Octave. Determination of the null space of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; tells us all the possible collections of flux vectors (or linear combinations thereof) that balance fluxes within the biological network.  The advantage of this approach becomes evident in biological systems which are described by differential equation systems with many unknowns. The velocities in the differential equations above - &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; - are dependent on the reaction rates of the underlying equations. The velocities are generally taken from the [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|Michaelis–Menten kinetic theory]], which involves the kinetic parameters of the enzymes catalyzing the reactions and the concentration of the metabolites themselves. Isolating enzymes from living organisms and measuring their kinetic parameters is a difficult task, as is measuring the internal concentrations and diffusion constants of metabolites within an organism. Therefore, the differential equation approach to metabolic modeling is beyond the current scope of science for all but the most studied organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kotte | first1 = O. | last2 = Zaugg | first2 = J. B. | last3 = [[Matthias Heinemann|Heinemann]] | first3 = M. | year = 2010 | title = Bacterial adaptation through distributed sensing of metabolic fluxes | journal = Molecular Systems Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 355| page = 355 | doi = 10.1038/msb.2010.10 | pmid=20212527 | pmc=2858440}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBA avoids this impediment by applying the homeostatic assumption, which is a reasonably approximate description of biological systems.

Although FBA avoids that biological obstacle, the mathematical issue of a large solution space remains. FBA has a two-fold purpose. Accurately representing the biological limits of the system and returning the flux distribution closest to the natural fluxes within the target system/organism. Certain biological principles can help overcome the mathematical difficulties. While the stoichiometric matrix is almost always under-determined initially (meaning that the solution space to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{S} \, \vec v = 0&lt;/math&gt; is very large), the size of the solution space can be reduced and be made more reflective of the biology of the problem through the application of certain constraints on the solutions.

==Extensions==

The success of FBA and the realization of its limitations has led to extensions that attempt to mediate the limitations of the technique.

===Flux variability analysis===
[[Image:FVA1TomForth.png|right|thumb|Visual and numerical representation of FVA on a complete network.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

The optimal solution to the flux-balance problem is rarely unique with many possible, and equally optimal, solutions existing. Flux variability analysis (FVA), built into some analysis software, returns the boundaries for the fluxes through each reaction that can, paired with the right combination of other fluxes, estimate the optimal solution.

[[Image:FVA2TomForth.png|right|thumb|Visual and numerical representation of FVA on a network with non-lethal deletion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}]]

Reactions which can support a low variability of fluxes through them are likely to be of a higher importance to an organism and FVA is a promising technique for the identification of reactions that are important.

===Minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA)===

When simulating knockouts or growth on media, FBA gives the final steady-state flux distribution. This final steady state is reached in varying time-scales. For example, the predicted growth rate of ''E. coli'' on glycerol as the primary carbon source did not match the FBA predictions; however, on sub-culturing for 40 days or 700 generations, the growth rate adaptively evolved to match the FBA prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ibarra | first1 = Rafael U. | last2 = Edwards | first2 = Jeremy S. | last3 = Palsson | first3 = Bernhard O. | year = 2002 | title = Escherichia Coli K-12 Undergoes Adaptive Evolution to Achieve in Silico Predicted Optimal Growth | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 420 | issue = 6912| pages = 186–189 | doi = 10.1038/nature01149 | pmid=12432395| bibcode = 2002Natur.420..186I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is of interest to find out what is the immediate effect of a perturbation or knockout, since it takes time for regulatory changes to occur and for the organism to re-organize fluxes to optimally utilize a different carbon source or circumvent the effect of the knockout. MOMA predicts the immediate sub-optimal flux distribution following the perturbation by minimizing the distance (Euclidean) between the wild-type FBA flux distribution and the mutant flux distribution using quadratic programming. This yields an optimization problem of the form.

&lt;math&gt;
\min\ ||\mathbf{v_w} - \mathbf{v_d}||^2 \qquad s. t.\quad \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{v_d}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_w}&lt;/math&gt; represents the wild-type (or unperturbed state) flux distribution and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_d}&lt;/math&gt; represents the flux distribution on gene deletion that is to be solved for. This simplifies to:

&lt;math&gt;
\min\ \frac{1}{2}\,{\mathbf{v_d}}^T\,\mathbf{I}\,\mathbf{v_d} + (\mathbf{-v_w})\cdot\mathbf{v_d} \qquad s. t.\quad \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{v_d}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the MOMA solution which represents the flux distribution immediately post-perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Segrè | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Vitkup | first2 = Dennis | last3 = Church | first3 = George M. | year = 2002 | title = Analysis of Optimality in Natural and Perturbed Metabolic Networks | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = 23| pages = 15112–15117 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.232349399 | pmid = 12415116 | pmc=137552| bibcode = 2002PNAS...9915112S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory on-off minimization (ROOM)===
ROOM attempts to improve the prediction of the metabolic state of an organism after a gene knockout. It follows the same premise as MOMA that an organism would try to restore a flux distribution as close as possible to the wild-type after a knockout. However it further hypothesizes that this steady state would be reached through a series of transient metabolic changes by the regulatory network and that the organism would try to minimize the number of regulatory changes required to reach the wild-type state. Instead of using a distance metric minimization however it uses a mixed integer linear programming method.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomi, Tomer, Omer Berkman, and Eytan Ruppin. "Regulatory On/off Minimization of Metabolic Flux Changes After Genetic Perturbations." ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' 102, no. 21 (May 24, 2005): 7695–7700. doi:10.1073/pnas.0406346102.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic FBA===
Dynamic FBA attempts to add the ability for models to change over time, thus in some ways avoiding the strict steady state condition of pure FBA. Typically the technique involves running an FBA simulation, changing the model based on the outputs of that simulation, and rerunning the simulation. By repeating this process an element of feedback is achieved over time.

==Comparison with other techniques==

FBA provides a less simplistic analysis than Choke Point Analysis while requiring far less information on reaction rates and a much less complete network reconstruction than a full dynamic simulation would require. In filling this niche, FBA has been shown to be a very useful technique for analysis of the metabolic capabilities of cellular systems.

===Choke point analysis===

Unlike [[choke point analysis]] which only considers points in the network where metabolites are produced but not consumed or vice versa, FBA is a true form of [[metabolic network modelling]] because it considers the metabolic network as a single complete entity ([[Stoichiometry#Stoichiometry matrix|the stoichiometric matrix]]) at all stages of analysis. This means that network effects, such as chemical reactions in distant pathways affecting each other, can be reproduced in the model. The upside to the inability of choke point analysis to simulate  network effects is that it considers each reaction within a network in isolation and thus can suggest important reactions in a network even if a network is highly fragmented and contains many gaps.

===Dynamic metabolic simulation===

Unlike [[dynamic metabolic simulation]], FBA assumes that the internal concentration of metabolites within a system stays constant over time and thus is unable to provide anything other than steady-state solutions. It is unlikely that FBA could, for example, simulate the functioning of a nerve cell. Since the internal concentration of metabolites is not considered within a model, it is possible that an FBA solution could contain metabolites at a concentration too high to be biologically acceptable. This is a problem that dynamic metabolic simulations would probably avoid. One advantage of the simplicity of FBA over dynamic simulations is that they are far less computationally expensive, allowing the simulation of large numbers of perturbations to the network. A second advantage is that the reconstructed model can be substantially simpler by avoiding the need to consider enzyme rates and the effect of complex interactions on enzyme kinetics.

The '''Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue''' ('''FIIRD''') was founded in 1999, sponsored by the [[Levant Foundation]] with the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland "to pursue its scholarly and humanistic goals with the main objective of fostering understanding of the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism."  The main program of the FIIRD is to enhance knowledge and the critical examination of the wellsprings of each religious tradition and then to acquire the linguistic and strategic tools needed to study the normative scriptures of these religions without syncretism or proselytism.

'''''God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It''''' is a 2005 book by author [[Jim Wallis]]. The book focuses on the role of religious hypocrisy in politics, and critiques both the so-called "[[Christian right|religious right]]" and the "[[secular left]]" while noting that the vast majority on the "left" have families who embrace both family values and religion. His criticism includes quotations from the [[Bible]], as he accuses U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and many at [[Fox News]] such as [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Sean Hannity]] of practicing bad [[theology]], noting that [[Jesus]] was strictly [[nonviolent]] particularly when it comes to invading other countries such as Iraq where over 600,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed due to the U.S. invasion, while Jesus said more about [[social justice]] while he never said anything against [[homosexuality]]. He defends religion in general, and challenges organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] for overreacting to public displays of religion, although the Founding Fathers of the U.S. clearly intended separation of church and State.

'''Helicopter dynamics''' is a field within [[aerospace engineering]] concerned with theoretical and practical aspects of [[helicopter]] flight. Its purpose is the knowledge of forces and [[torque]]s which appear in helicopter flight.

==History==
The development of helicopter dynamics arose from the necessity to improve the first helicopters.
Measuring dynamics of helicopter rotors is very challenging due to wiring and data transmission problems. Researchers have recently used [[stereophotogrammetry]] to measure dynamics of a helicopter rotor during hover &lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-6546-1_44 Using Stereophotogrammetry to Measure Dynamics of a Robinson R44 rotor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized cryptographic electronics, [[microprocessor]], [[Random-access memory|memory]], and [[Random number generation|random number generator]] housed within a tamper-responding environment provide a highly secure subsystem in which [[data processing]] and [[cryptography]] can be performed.

It has achieved PCI-HSM certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/popups/pts_device.php?appnum=4-20333|title=PCI Security Standards - PCI-HSM certification for IBM 4768|last=|first=|date=|website=PCI Security Standards Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBM 4768 data sheet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc3/pdf/4768_PCIe_Data_Sheet.pdf|title=IBM 4768 Data Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the coprocessor in detail.

IBM supplies two cryptographic-system implementations:

* The PKCS#11&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/|title=Cryptsoft|website=www.cryptsoft.com|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; implementation creates a high-security solution for application programs developed for this industry-standard API.
* The IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) implementation provides many functions of special interest in the finance industry, extensive support for distributed key management, and a base on which custom processing and cryptographic functions can be added.

Applications may include financial PIN transactions, bank-to-clearing-house transactions, EMV transactions for integrated circuit (chip) based credit cards, and general-purpose cryptographic applications using [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key algorithms]], [[hashing algorithm]]s, and [[public key algorithm]]s.

The operational keys (symmetric or RSA private) are generated in the coprocessor and are then saved either in a keystore file or in application memory, encrypted under the master key of that coprocessor. Any coprocessor with an identical master key can use those keys. Performance benefits include the incorporation of [[Elliptic-curve cryptography|elliptic curve cryptography]] (ECC) and [[Format-preserving encryption|format preserving encryption]] (FPE) in the hardware.

IBM supports the 4768 on certain IBM Z mainframes as Crypto Express6S (CEX6S) - feature code 0893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/form/anonymous/api/wiki/33d270cb-c060-40f6-99f3-956c3cb452a3/page/885fd4df-c77d-4bb8-a43b-f4f44100b3ac/attachment/7fd7adad-44dd-43c9-90d7-5c97650da544/media/IBM%20z14%20technology%20Pitch.pdf|title=IBM z14 Hardware Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4768 / CEX6S is part of IBM's support for pervasive encryption&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8270590/|title=Enabling pervasive encryption through IBM Z stack innovations - IBM Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://briandcolwell.com/2017/07/ibm-z14-enforcing-data-as-the-new-perimeter-enabling-scale-for-the-cloud/.html|title=IBM z14: Enforcing Data As The New Perimeter, Enabling Scale For The Cloud|date=2017-07-17|work=Brian D.

==Background==
When a school district fails its legal obligations to students with disabilities, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] permits the parent to seek a hearing before an impartial hearing officer.  A school district may also request a due process hearing against parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-698.ZO.html/ Schaffer v Weast], Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49 (2005) (Justice O’Connor, Opinion of the Court).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   Hearings are rare.  Only 5 in 10,000 students seek a hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03897.pdf/ GAO 03-0897], United States Government Accountability Office.  “GAO Report 03-897,” September 2003.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Expert witnesses have a critical role at due process hearings.  They provide the technical expertise about the student’s disability and the care and educational services the student needs in the classroom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; 

In 1986, Congress passed the Handicapped Children’s Protection Act, allowing parents who prevail in due process hearings and litigation under the IDEA to recover their legal fees and costs.  The language was modeled on similar provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5k).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/94-970.pdf/ CRS Report 2008], Henry Cohen.  “Awards of Attorneys' Fees by Federal Courts and Federal Agencies” (Congressional Research Service), June 20, 2008.  Retrieved 18 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress’ Joint Conference Committee Report explained that the courts would have discretion to award attorneys’ fees as part of the costs of litigation.  It noted that “The conferees intend that the term ‘attorneys’ fees as part of the costs’ include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian’s case in the action or proceeding.”&lt;ref&gt;132 Congressional Record 16823-25 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;  The statute also directed the GAO to study the costs to parents, including costs of “attorneys and
consultants” in IDEA proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-18.ZD.html/ Murphy J. Souter Opinion] Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 (2006) (Justice Souter, Dissent) (quoting Handicapped Children’s Protection Act, Public Law 99-372, Section 4(b)(3), 100 Stat. 796, 797–98 (1986)).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, however, the Supreme Court decided the case of [[Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy]].  The Court ruled that because the statutory text of the IDEA did not explicitly state that expert witness fees were covered, parents could not recover them.  The Court reasoned that because the IDEA was enacted under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, the law must “unambiguously” give notice in its statutory text that parents could recover fees.  This meant Congress had to declare in the body of the statute that parents could recover expert witness fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-18.ZO.html/ Murphy Majority Opinion] Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 (2006) (Justice Alito, Opinion of the Court).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will amend the statutory text of the IDEA to permit recovery of expert witness fees. Until Congress does, parents must pay their own expert witness fee expenses, even when they prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autcom.org/pdf/briefing-memo-idea-fairness.pdf Analysis IDEA Fairness Act] Autism National Committee.  Analysis, IDEA Fairness Restoration Act.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the Bill==

The IDEA permits parents who prevail in IDEA cases to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html/ 20 USC 1415] 20 United States Code 1415(i)(3)(B).&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will enable them to also recover the reasonable costs of expert witnesses.  It will amend Section 615(i)(3) of the IDEA by adding the following at the end, “Inclusion of expert witness fees and other expenses as attorneys' fees. In this paragraph, the term ‘attorneys' fees’ shall include the fees of expert witnesses, including the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian's case in the action or proceeding.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
Parents can recover expert witness fees only when they prevail, and the school system has been found, after an impartial hearing, to have wrongfully denied a child an appropriate education as defined in IDEA. fees.  Parents cannot recover fees if they do not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=E2419&amp;dbname=2007_record/ Cong Rec 2007], Congressman Chris Van Hollen.  “Introduction of the IDEA Fairness Restoration Act,” Congressional Record, November 14, 2007.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill will align the IDEA with other civil rights statutes that permit recovery of expert witness fees, including Title VII,&lt;ref&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21/ Title VII] 42 United States Code 2000e-5(k).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12205-/ ADA] 42 United States Code 12205.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several federal laws permit recovery of expert witness fees, including Voting Rights Act of 1965, Consumer Product Safety Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud Abuse and Prevention Act, Endangered Species Act, the Patent and Copyright Acts, PROTECT Act, Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, Presidential and Executive Office Accountability Act, and the Whistleblower Protections for Contractor Employees of Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Act.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Statement of Senator Harkin on introduction==
When Senator Harkin introduced the bill, he explained the reasons for enactment. He said, “This critical legislation will remove the financial barrier that families, especially low- and middle-income families, face as they pursue their children's rights to the free, appropriate public education they deserve and are entitled to under the Fourteenth Amendment...There are . . .times when schools have not fulfilled their responsibilities to provide an appropriate education. In these cases, IDEA provides parents the right to challenge the schools through mediation and due process. To make their argument, families often need access to expert witnesses who can assess the student's needs and testify about whether the current IEP meets those needs. These expert witnesses are a resource that many families cannot afford, but without access to them, families may be unable to make their case. ”&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=S1834&amp;dbname=2011_record/ Cong Rec 2011]  Senator Tom Harkin,   Congressional Record, March 17, 2011.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2002 study found that more than 1/3 of children with disabilities lived in households with incomes of $25,000 or less, compared to 24% of the general population, and 2/3 of children with disabilities lived in families that earned less than $50,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seels.net/designdocs/SEELS_Children_We_Serve_Report.pdf.

Such words are usually terms that do not have a clear definition but are used to give the impression of a clear meaning. An ideograph in rhetoric often exists as a building block or simply one term or short phrase that summarizes the orientation or attitude of an ideology. Such examples notably include &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom]]&gt;, &lt;[[democracy]]&gt; and &lt;[[rights]]&gt;. Rhetorical critics use chevrons or angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) to mark off ideographs.

The term ideograph was coined by rhetorical scholar and critic [[Michael Calvin McGee]] (1980) describing the use of particular words and phrases as political language in a way that captures (as well as creates or reinforces) particular ideological positions.  McGee sees the ideograph as a way of understanding of how specific, concrete instances of political discourse relate to the more abstract idea of political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, J. (2001).  ''Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robertson defines ideographs as “political slogans or labels that encapsulate ideology in political discourse.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, [[Celeste Condit]] and [[John Lucaites]], influenced by McGee, explain, “Ideographs represent in condensed form the normative, collective commitments of the members of a public, and they typically appear in public argumentation as the necessary motivations or justifications for action performed in the name of the public.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=xxii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideographs are common in [[advertising]] and political discourse.

==Definition==
McGee uses the term in his seminal article “The ‘Ideograph’: A Link Between Rhetoric and Ideology” which appeared in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Speech]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=McGee&gt;McGee, M.C. (1980). The “ideograph”: A link between rhetoric and ideology. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 66'', 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He begins his essay by defining the practice of [[ideology]] as practice of political language in specific contexts—actual discursive acts by individual speakers and writers. The question this raises is how does this practice of [[ideology]] create social control.

McGee’s answer to this is to say that “political language which manifests ideology seems characterized by slogans, a vocabulary of ‘ideographs’ easily mistaken for the technical terminology of [[political philosophy]].”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;  He goes on to offer his definition of “ideograph”:  “an ideograph is an ordinary-language term found in political discourse.  It is a high order abstraction representing commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

An ideograph, then, is not just any particular word or phrase used in political discourse, but one of a particular subset of terms that are often invoked in political discourse but which does not have a clear, univocal definition.  Despite this, in their use, ideographs are often invoked precisely to give the sense of a clearly understood and shared meaning. This potency makes them the primary tools for shaping public decisions. It is in this role as the [[vocabulary]] for public values and decision-making that they are linked to [[ideology]].

== Examples ==
There is no absolute litmus test for what terms are or are not ideographs. Rather, this is a judgment that must be made through the study of specific examples of discourse. However, McGee (and others who have followed him) have identified several examples of ideographs or virtue words in Western liberal political discourse, such as &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom of speech]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, and &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;. In each case, the term does not have a specific [[referent]].  Rather, each term refers to an [[abstraction]] which may have many different meanings depending on its [[context (language use)|context]].  It is in their mutability between circumstances that give the terms such rhetorical power.  If the definition of a term such as &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt; can be stretched to include a particular act or condition, then public support for that act or condition is likely to be stronger than it was previously.

By encapsulating values which are perceived to be widely shared by the community, but which are in fact highly abstract and defined in very different ways by individuals, ideographs provide a potent persuasive tool for the political speaker. McGee offers the example of [[Richard Nixon]]’s attempt to defend his decision not to turn over documents to Congress during the [[Watergate scandal]] by invoking “the principle of [[confidentiality]].” Recognizing that his refusal to submit to Congress could be seen as a violation of the "[[rule of law]]", Nixon pitted "the principle of [[confidentiality]]” against the “[[rule of law]],” despite the fact that these two ideographs would, in the abstract, not likely be seen as in conflict with one another.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt; Nixon, in an attempt to expand the understanding of “the principle of [[confidentiality]]” to cover his own specific refusal to cooperate with Congress, used the abstractness of the term to his benefit, claiming that right to confidentiality was the more central term.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

While the term has remained mostly in this sphere of academic [[rhetorical criticism]], some [[political consulting|political consultants]] and practitioners are becoming savvy to this art.

Ideographs appear in [[advertising]] and [[political campaigns]] regularly, and are crucial to helping the public understand what is really being asked of them. For example, “[[Social equality|equality]]” is a term commonly used in political discourse and rarely defined. It can refer to a situation in which all people have the same opportunities, or a condition in which social resources are distributed uniformly to different individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is the more commonly used definition in US history, according to Condit &amp; Lucaites, although in a socialist or left-leaning political state, the term may refer foremost to the distribution of social resources. Condit and Lucaites depict the racial facet of equality as the dominant meaning in an American context of political discourse, since 1865.&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important ideograph used specifically by U.S. presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks is &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;. The term does not have a clear or specific definition, but when applied to the context in the fear-stricken country after the devastating attacks in 2001, this term held significant weight and meaning to Americans all across the country. Kelly Long explores Obama’s discourse on the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; and states that “by developing an ideological justification for the conflicts that the United States was involved in at the time, Obama remedied much of the damage done by the Bush administration”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=90|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama justified the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; by addressing the nation and saying that in order to protect the &lt;[[rule of law]]&gt; and &lt;democratic values&gt;, we must fight against &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;.  Obama used this term to his advantage and made &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt; appear to be a common enemy and fighting back was the common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=91|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the ideograph unified the country creating a sense of identity for American citizens, “defining what the nation stands for and against. The term divides those who are civilized from those who are uncivilized, those who defend economic freedom from those who would attack America’s way of life and those who support democracy from those who would disrupt it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Carol|title=In the Name of Terrorism: Presidents on Political Violence in the Post-World War II Era|date=2006|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York|page=2|edition=SUNY series on the Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNXc1s_BKSoC&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;ots=YOlgZgkKFn&amp;dq=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marouf Hasian discusses how key ideographs representative of a society’s commitments change over time, particularly in the name of &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;, or &lt;[[privacy]]&gt; epitomized in [[eugenics]]. From the 1900s-1930s, Americans justified the restriction of reproductive rights based on medical, social, economic, and political considerations, but were appalled when the [[Nazis]] used some of the same arguments in their creation of the “perfect race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasian|first=M.A.|title=The rhetoric of eugenics in Anglo-American thought|year=1996|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While rhetorical critics identify these terms as ideographs, political leaders viewed each other’s terms as "[[glittering generalities]],” as Lincoln first identified his opponent's words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|title=Lincoln to Henry Pierce|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/pierce.htm|publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to practitioners, [[marketing|corporate marketing]] and [[political consulting]] use key terms in this way, concentrating on the [[image]] and [[brand management|branding]] of terms. For example, [[Frank Luntz]] tests audience reaction to certain words or phrases using dial technology, a mechanism which instantaneously shows moment by moment reactions to speeches or presentations. This research has been extremely beneficial to his clients, as they can utilize ideographs as "trigger words" in an [[advertising campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luntz|first=Frank|title=Words that work: It’s not what you say, it’s what people hear|year=2007|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
There are three primary ways in which the concept of the ideograph is important to rhetorical critics.  First, it suggests a way of studying political ideology using concrete instances of language use.  By showing how looking at specific uses of key words and phrases in political language reveal underlying ideological commitments, McGee offers a concrete method for understanding the highly abstract concept of ideology.

Second, the definition of the ideograph makes clear that the [[rhetoric|rhetorical study]] of a term is different from a legal, historical, or etymological study of a term. Unlike other perspectives that focus on how a term has changed over time, a rhetorical study of a term focuses on the forces involved in the creation of these meanings. In short, a rhetorical study of a term is the study of the use of that term in practice.

This leads to a third key aspect of what the concept of the ideograph offers to rhetorical critics.  McGee notes that the study of a term must not, and should not, be limited to its use in “formal discourse.” Instead, the critic is much more likely to gain a better understanding of an ideograph by looking at how it is used and depicted in movies, plays, and songs, as well as how it is presented in educational texts aimed at children.  This moves the study of ideology beyond the limits of social philosophy or even political discourse as traditionally conceived (i.e., “great speeches by great men”).

==Cultural variability==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An ideograph is a culturally biased, abstract word or phrase drawn from ordinary language, which serves a constitutional value for a historically situated collectivity."&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There exists a culturally-specific understanding in each culture about what an ideograph means. Ideographs in rhetoric are culturally specific but recur inter-culturally; meaning the understanding of one ideograph can be used and interpreted differently across cultures.  The idea may be different from culture to culture, but this doesn’t mean some aspects won’t be the same in one or more cultures.  Such as the concept of [[femininity]] that exists cross-culturally to define ideas about women, yet one can expect these ideas from culture to culture.

==Critical use==
At the end of his essay defining the ideograph, McGee says that
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
“A complete description of an ideology . . . will consist of (1) the isolation of a society’s ideographs, (2) the exposure and analysis of the [[Synchronic analysis|diachronic]] structure of every ideography, and (3) characterization of [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] relationships among all the ideographs in a particular context.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such an exhaustive study of any ideology has yet to materialize, but many scholars have made use of the ideograph as a tool of understanding both specific [[rhetorical situations]] as well as a broader scope of ideological history. As a teacher, McGee himself made use of the ideograph as a tool for structuring the study of the rise of liberalism in British public address, focusing on ideographs such as &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[patriarchy]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;. Other scholars have made a study of specific uses of ideographs such as &lt;[[family values]]&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, D. L. (1998).  The rhetoric of &lt;family values&gt;: Scapegoating, utopia, and the privatization of social responsibility.  ''Western Journal of Communication, 62'', 387-419.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;[[Egalitarianism|equality]]&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Condit, C. M. &amp; Lucaites, J. L. (1993).  ''Crafting quality: America’s Anglo-African word''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have gone beyond the idea that an ideograph must be a verbal symbol and have expanded the notion to include [[photographs]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. L. &amp; Winkler, C. K. (1997). Representative forms and the visual ideograph: The Iwo Jima image in editorial cartoons.  ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 83'', 289-310.&lt;/ref&gt; and objects represented in [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. P. (1996).  The cigarette as representative ideograph in the debate over environmental tobacco smoke.  ''Communication Monographs, 64'', 47-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Institute of Information Systems (IISYS) - Hof University
Temporary location at Hof University
Category: Research institute
Institute of Hof University
Location: Hof/Saale
Research type: Applied Sciences
Subject: Computer science
Fields of research: Analytical information systems, information management, multimedia information systems, system integration
Basically funded by: EU, Bavarian Government, Oberfrankenstiftung (foundation in Upper Franconia)
Executive Board: Richard Göbel, Jörg Scheidt, Claus Atzenbeck
Employees: 50
Homepage: www.iisys.de--&gt;

The '''Institute of Information Systems''' (iisys) represents the central research center for informatics of [[University of Applied Sciences Hof]]. It is financed by the free state of Bavaria, the Upper Franconia Foundation and the European Union. Current research projects are focused on integrated information systems designed to support operational business procedures.

By conducting technology projects with international partners, the institute is expanding its expertise in the area of information systems and can ensure the connection for international research and progresses. Building on this expertise, the institute is conducting application projects in cooperation with software and system houses, as well as the IT-Departments of large companies.

The goal of these projects is to generate new products and services to directly improve the management and data usage of mid-size companies. The software and system houses represent a multiplicator with the result that a large number of companies can use this expertise. The following research groups represent the institute:
*Analytical Information Systems
*Sustainability, Compliance and IT Laws
*System Integration
*Visual Analytics
*Cyber-Physical Systems
*Multimedia Information Systems

The institute is a competence center for operational applications of informational systems. Iisys’ main task is to prove results of international research projects for practicality, to adjust them and to make them available for economy and society. It represents the connection between international research and development in this area and the actual practice in companies.

Especially the following project has particular trans-regional importance:
*Migraine Radar: The goal of this research project is the systematic analysis of factors responsible for episodic headache diseases like migraine or tension headache. One important research objective is the examination of the correlation between increased migraine attack rates and changing weather conditions. In 2011 Migraine Radar was one of the winners in the competition "Was macht gesund?" ('What makes healthy?') by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany). The migraine data are recorded via a web-based form as well as smartphone apps throughout Germany since June 2011. The second project phase has been started in June 2015 in cooperation with the Migraine and Headache Clinic Königstein and the Institute of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology at University of Rostock. Furthermore, the migraine data acquisition was also extended to Austria and Switzerland.

iisys includes also projects which are serving the direct economic promotion:
*Your Way into the Cloud (completed): As part of the sponsored project of the European Social Funds (ESF), iisys is providing assistance for software producers interested in offering cloud services and SMU's interested in using them.
*eBusiness-Lotse Upper Franconia (completed): As part of the funding initiative "eKompetenz-Netzwerk für Unternehmen", iisys and the IGZ Bamberg, with the eBusiness-Lotsen Oberfranken, are providing vendor neutral and practical information for the eBusiness of companies, especially SMU and handcraft. Specifically, topics like Online-Marketing, cloud and information systems for resource efficient processes are in focus.
*Enterprise 4.0 for SME - The Digital Transformation (WiMiT): This project is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and pays particular attention to foster research, technological development and innovation. WiMiT´s purpose is to contribute to more technological transfer between universities and SMEs. The idea is to support SMEs on their way to digitisation.

The scientific administration of the institute is represented by Valentin Plenk and the deputy by René Peinl, both professors of Hof University of Applied Sciences. Anne-Christine Habbel is the managing director.

Richard Göbel build up the iisys and was the first scientific head from 2010-2017.

{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
The '''Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare''' (ISEW) is an [[economics|economic]] indicator intended to replace the [[Gross Domestic Product]], which is the main macroeconomic indicator of System of National Accounts (SNA).
Rather than simply adding together all expenditures like the [[gross domestic product]], [[consumer expenditure]] is balanced by such factors as income distribution and cost associated with pollution and other  unsustainable costs. It is similar to the [[Genuine progress indicator|Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)]].

The Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) is roughly defined by the following formula.

''ISEW'' = ''personal consumption''&lt;br&gt;+ ''public non-defensive expenditures''&lt;br&gt;- ''private defensive expenditures''&lt;br&gt;+ ''capital formation''&lt;br&gt;+ ''services from domestic labour''&lt;br&gt;- ''costs of [[environmental degradation]]''&lt;br&gt;- ''depreciation of [[natural capital]]''

==History==
GDP is misleading as an indicator or even as a proxy of the welfare of a nation, let alone as a measure of people’s well-being,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wuppertal Institute |title=Alternatives to GDP for Measuring Progress |url=https://https//epub.wupperinst.org/files/3486/WS42.pdf |website=Wuppertal Institute |accessdate=6 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the makers of economic policy commonly think to the contrary. This problem already became apparent in practical economic policies in most{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} industrialised countries in the early 1970s. The most famous examples of this development are the MEW index developed by [[William Nordhaus]] and [[James Tobin]] in their [[Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW)]] in 1972, the Japanese Net National Welfare (NNW) indicator in 1973, the Economic Aspects of Welfare index (EAW)  index of Zolatas in 1981, the ISEW indicator of Daly and Cobb in 1989 and the UN’s human development index, or HDI, in 1990{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. They are all based on neoclassical welfare economics and use as the starting point the System of National Accounts (SNA). The basic idea behind all these approaches is the inclusion of nonmarket commodities, positive and negative, to yield an aggregated macroindicator in monetary terms.

The EAW index, applied to the United States for the period from 1950 to 1977, showed that the economic aspects of social welfare are a diminishing function of economic growth in industrially mature, affluent societies{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. The percentage increases in social welfare over time are smaller than the corresponding increases in the GDP, and are diminishing{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. When the elasticity of the EAW/GDP ratio reaches zero, economic welfare will have attained its maximum value. Beyond that point any further increase in the GDP would lead to an absolute decline in economic welfare.

The ISEW was originally developed in 1989 by leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] and theologian [[John B. Cobb]], but later they went on to add several other "costs" to the definition of ISEW{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. This later work resulted in yet another macroeconomic indicator [[Genuine progress indicator|Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)]]: see [[sustainability measurement]]. The GPI is an extension of ISEW that stresses genuine and real progress of the society and seeks especially to monitor welfare and the ecological sustainability of the economy. The ISEW and GPI summarise economic welfare by means of a single figure according to the same logic by which GDP summarises economic output into a single figure. Beside economic issues, social and environmental issues in monetary terms are included.

==Trend of ISEW in the United States==

The calculation of the ISEW in the United States from 1950 to 1986 was done by Cobb and Daly in 1989. The results reveal that the increase in economic welfare of an average American has stabilised after the 1970s although the economy, measured by GDP, has continued to grow. According to Cobb and Daly’s calculations the external effects of production and the inequity of income distribution are the main reasons for this development in which an increase in production does not necessarily lead to an increase in welfare.

==Other countries to adopt ISEW==

Besides the USA there have been at least seven other countries or regions which have attempted to implement the ISEW, namely the UK (Jackson &amp; Marks 1994), Germany (Diefenbacher 1994), The Netherlands (Rosenberg &amp; Oegema 1995), Austria (Stockhammer et al. 1995), British Columbia (Gustavson &amp; Lonergan 1994), Sweden (Jackson &amp; Stymne 1996), Chile (Castaneda 1999) and Finland (Hoffrén 2001).

==Progress of the Finnish ISEW ==

The calculation of the ISEW for Finland has been done by Dr. Jukka Hoffrén at Statistics Finland in 2001 [http://tampub.uta.fi/handle/10024/67162]. Today the time period covered is extended to years from 1945 to 2010. According to results sustainable economic welfare rose steadily in the 1970s and early 1980s, but has since declined and stabilised. One of the underlying reasons for this development was effective income distribution which apportioned evenly the welfare derived from increased production. In the mid-1980s income disparities started to grow again, flows of capital (investments) abroad increased and environmental hazards escalated, resulting in a decline in the weighted personal consumption.

'''Limit state design''' ('''LSD'''), also known as '''load and resistance factor design''' ('''LRFD'''), refers to a design method used in [[structural engineering]]. A '''limit state''' is a condition of a structure beyond which it no longer fulfills the relevant design criteria.&lt;ref name="EN1990"&gt;EN 1990:2002 E, Eurocode - Basis of Structural Design, CEN, November 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The condition may refer to a degree of [[Structural load|loading]] or other actions on the structure, while the criteria refer to structural integrity, fitness for use, durability or other design requirements. A structure designed by LSD is proportioned to sustain all actions likely to occur during its design life, and to remain fit for use, with an appropriate level of [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] for each limit state. Building codes based on LSD implicitly define the appropriate levels of reliability by their prescriptions.

The method of limit state design, developed in the USSR and based on research led by Professor N.S. Streletski, was introduced in USSR building regulations in 1955.

==Criteria==
Limit state [[design]] requires the [[structure]] to satisfy two principal criteria: the [[ultimate limit]] state (ULS) and the [[serviceability limit]] state (SLS).&lt;ref&gt;[[#McCormac2008|McCormac 2008]], p. 50. ''"The term limit state is used to describe a condition at which a structure or part of a structure ceases to perform its intended function. There are two categories of limit states: strength and serviceability."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Any design process involves a number of assumptions. The [[Structural load|load]]s to which a structure will be subjected must be estimated, sizes of members to check must be chosen and design criteria must be selected. All engineering design criteria have a common goal: that of ensuring a safe structure and ensuring the functionality of the structure.

==Ultimate limit state (ULS)==
A clear distinction is made between the ultimate state (US) and the ultimate limit state (ULS). The US is a physical situation that involves either excessive deformations leading and approaching collapse of the component under consideration or the structure as a whole, as relevant, or deformations exceeding pre-agreed values. It involves, of course, considerable inelastic (plastic) behavior of the structural scheme and residual deformations. While the ULS is not a physical situation but rather an agreed computational condition that must be fulfilled, among other additional criteria, in order to comply with the engineering demands for strength and stability under design loads. The ULS condition is computationally checked at a certain point along the behavior function of the structural scheme, located at the upper part of its elastic zone at approximately 15% lower than the elastic limit. That means that the ULS is a purely elastic condition, located on the behavior function far below the real Ultimate point, which is located deep within the plastic zone. The rationale for choosing the ULS at the upper part of the elastic zone is that as long as the ULS design criteria are fulfilled, the structure will behave in the same way under repetitive loadings, and as long as it keeps this way, it proves that the level of safety and reliability assumed as the basis for this design is properly maintained and justified, (following the probabilistic safety approach). A structure is deemed to satisfy the ultimate limit state criterion if all factored [[bending]], [[shear stress|shear]] and [[Tensile stress|tensile]] or [[Compressive stress|compressive]] stresses are below the factored resistances calculated for the section under consideration. The factored stresses referred to are found by applying Magnification Factors to the loads on the section. Reduction Factors are applied to determine the various factored resistances of the section.

The limit state criteria can also be set in terms of load rather than stress: using this approach the structural element being analysed (i.e. a [[beam (structure)|beam]] or a [[column]] or other load bearing elements, such as walls) is shown to be safe when the "Magnified" loads are less than the relevant "Reduced" resistances.

Complying with the design criteria of the ULS is considered as the minimum requirement (among other additional demands) to provide the proper structural safety.

==Serviceability limit state (SLS)==
1) limit state of deflection

2) limit state of cracking

3) limit state of vibration

In addition to the ULS check mentioned above, a Service Limit State (SLS) computational check must be performed. As for the ULS, here also the SLS is not a physical situation but rather a computational check. The aim is to prove that under the action of Characteristic design loads (un-factored), and/or whilst applying certain (un-factored) magnitudes of imposed deformations, settlements, or vibrations, or temperature gradients etc. the structural behavior complies with, and does not exceed, the SLS design criteria values, specified in the relevant standard in force. These criteria involve various stress limits, deformation limits (deflections, rotations and curvature), flexibility (or rigidity) limits, dynamic behavior limits, as well as crack control requirements (crack width) and other arrangements concerned with the durability of the structure and its level of everyday service level and human comfort achieved, and its abilities to fulfill its everyday functions. In view of non-structural issues it might also involve limits applied to acoustics and heat transmission that might also affect the structural design. To satisfy the serviceability limit state criterion, a structure must remain functional for its intended use subject to routine (read: everyday) loading, and as such the structure must not cause [[occupant discomfort]] under routine conditions. This calculation check is performed at a point located at the lower half of the elastic zone, where characteristic (un-factored) actions are applied and the structural behavior is purely elastic.

==Factor development==
The load and resistance factors are determined using statistics and a pre-selected probability of failure. Variability in the quality of construction, consistency of the construction material are accounted for in the factors. Generally, a factor of unity (one) or less is applied to the resistances of the material, and a factor of unity or greater to the loads. Not often used, but in some load cases a factor may be less than unity due to a reduced probability of the combined loads. These factors can differ significantly for different materials or even between differing grades of the same material. Wood and masonry typically have smaller factors than concrete, which in turn has smaller factors than steel. The factors applied to resistance also account for the degree of scientific confidence in the derivation of the values — i.e. smaller values are used when there isn't much research on the specific type of failure mode). Factors associated with loads are normally independent on the type of material involved, but can be influenced by the type of construction.

In determining the specific magnitude of the factors, more deterministic loads (like dead loads, the weight of the structure and permanent attachments like walls, floor treatments, ceiling finishes) are given lower factors (for example 1.4) than highly variable loads like earthquake, wind, or live (occupancy) loads (1.6). Impact loads are typically given higher factors still (say 2.0) in order to account for both their unpredictable magnitudes and the dynamic nature of the loading vs. the static nature of most models. While arguably not philosophically superior to permissible or [[allowable stress design]], it does have the potential to produce a more consistently designed structure as each element is intended to have the same probability of failure. In practical terms this normally results in a more efficient structure, and as such, it can be argued that LSD is superior from a practical engineering viewpoint.
==Example treatment of LSD in building codes==
The following is the treatment of LSD found in the [[National Building Code of Canada]]:

 NBCC 1995 Format
 φR &gt; α&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;D + ψ γ {α&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;L + α&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;Q + α&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;T}

 where φ = Resistance Factor
       ψ = Load Combination Factor
       γ = Importance Factor
       α&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = Dead Load Factor
       α&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Live Load Factor
       α&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; = Earthquake Load Factor
       α&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = Thermal Effect (Temperature) Load Factor

Limit state design has replaced the older concept of [[permissible stress design]] in most forms of [[civil engineering]]. A notable exception is [[transportation engineering]]. Even so, new codes are currently being developed for both geotechnical and transportation engineering which are LSD based. As a result, most modern buildings are designed in accordance with a code which is based on limit state theory. For example, in Europe, structures are designed to conform with the [[Eurocode]]s: [[Steel]] structures are designed in accordance with [[EN 1993]], and [[reinforced concrete]] structures to [[EN 1992]]. Australia, Canada, China, France, Indonesia, and New Zealand (among many others) utilise limit state theory in the development of their design codes. In the purest sense, it is now considered inappropriate to discuss [[safety factor]]s when working with LSD, as there are concerns that this may lead to confusion.

==In the United States==
The United States has been particularly slow to adopt limit state design (known as Load and Resistance Factor Design in the US). Design codes and standards are issued by diverse organizations, some of which have adopted limit state design, and others have not.

The [[ACI 318 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete]] uses Limit State design.

The ANSI/[[AISC 360 Specification for Structural Steel Buildings]], the ANSI/[[AISI S-100 North American Specification for the Design of Cold Formed Steel Structural Members]], and [[The Aluminum Association]]'s [[Aluminum Design Manual]] contain two methods of design side by side:  
# Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD), a Limit States Design implementation, and
# Allowable Strength Design (ASD), a method where the nominal strength is divided by a safety factor to determine the allowable strength. This allowable strength is required to equal or exceed the required strength for a set of ASD load combinations. ASD is calibrated to give the same structural reliability and component size as the LRFD method with a live to dead load ratio of 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Steel Construction Manual Fourteenth Edition|year=2011|publisher=AISC|isbn=1-56424-060-6 |pages=16.1–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, when structures have a live to dead load ratio that differs from 3, ASD produces designs that are either less reliable or less efficient as compared to designs resulting from the LRFD method.

In contrast, the ANSI/[[AWWA D100 Welded Carbon Steel Tanks for Water Storage]] and [[API 650 Welded Tanks for Oil Storage]] still use [[allowable stress design]].

==In Europe==
In Europe, the limit state design is enforced by the [[Eurocodes]].

'''Mental process''' or '''mental function''' are all the things that individuals can do with their [[mind]]s. These include [[perception]], [[judgement]] [[memory]], [[thought|thinking]] (such as [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]], [[imagination]], [[belief]], [[reasoning]], etc.), [[Volition_(psychology)|volition]], and [[emotion]].

Sometimes the term ''[[cognitive function]]'' is used instead.

A specific instance of engaging in cognitive [[Cognition]] process is a [[mental event]]. The ''event'' of perceiving something is different from the entire process, or ''capacity'' of perception — one's ability to perceive things. In other words, an instance of perceiving is different from the ability that makes those instances possible.

==Definitions==

Jean-Émile Gombert, teaching genetic psychology at Dijon University, France, states that one thing is to find an adequate way to treat the comprehension and the production of language, and another is to successfully adopt a reflexive attitude regarding the language objects and their manipulation. This is the second time that a psycholinguistic tradition recently developed has been given the name metalinguistics.

The linguist Noam Chomsky defines the field of metalinguistics as the subject knowledge of the characteristics and the operation of language or, from a more functionalist perspective, of its structure, its operation and its use. The relevant psychological description cannot be based on abstraction, it requires that the researchers and theorists widen their scopes till the point they can embrace the importance of the behavioural actions in the cognitive context of the subjects that realise them. The French linguist [[Jules Gilliéron]] wrote that ''All consciousness is necessarily 'meta' from the vantage point of the beholder, as it is not based on the real, but on its intelligibility of the real''.

==Literacy development==
Metalinguistic skills involve amplified and logical understanding of the rules used to govern language. Scholar Patrick Hartwell points out how substantial it is for students to develop these capabilities, especially heightened [[phonological awareness]], which is a key precursor to literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/376562|title=Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar|author=Patrick Hartwell|publisher=College English|volume=47|date=February 1985|pages=105–127|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An essential aspect to language development is focused on the student being aware of language and the components of language.

This idea is also examined in the article, 'Metalinguistic Awareness and Literacy Acquisition in Different Languages',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED391147&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED391147 |title=Metalinguistic Awareness and Literacy Acquisition in Different Languages. Technical Report No. 618|author1=Nagy, William E.|author2=Anderson, Richard C.|publisher=Eric.ed.gov |date=1964-05-15 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that centers on how the construction of a language and writing strategy shape an individual's ability to read. It also discusses the manner in which bilingualism increases particular elements of metalinguistic awareness.

Published research studies by Elizabeth McAllister have concluded that metalinguistic abilities are associated to cognitive development and is contingent on metalinguistic awareness which relates to reading skill level, academic success and cultural environment that starts at infancy and continues through preschool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED308489&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED308489 |title=The Literacy of Metalinguistic Awareness|date=1989|author=McAllister, Elizabeth|publisher=Eric.ed.gov|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Text in Education and Society'', some examples of metalinguistic skills include discussing, examining, thinking about language, grammar and reading comprehension. The text also states that a student's recognition or self-correction of language in verbal and written form helps them further advance their skills. The book also illustrates manners in which literature can form connections or create boundaries between educational intelligence and practical knowledge.

Gail T. Gillion wrote the book, ''Phonological Awareness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDWymkbfP30C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Metalinguistics+awareness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RiL7T5XJu2&amp;sig=wAewxCdualj97xznyWOgxhJshas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MImxS-zkOYaKNPWLvKME&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Metalinguistics%20awareness&amp;f=false |title=Phonological Awareness: From Research to Practice|author=Gail T. Gillon|date=2004 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which illustrates the connection between phonological awareness and metalinguistic awareness's in literacy learning. It essentially states that a student's ability to understand the spoken word and their ability to recognize a word and decode it are dependent on each other. The text also discusses ways in which students struggling with speech impairments and reading difficulties can improve their learning process.

==In linguistics==
[[Linguists]] use this term to designate activities associated with ''[[metalanguage]]'', a language composed of the entirety of words forming linguistic terminology (for example, [[syntax]], [[semantics]], [[phoneme]], [[lexeme]]... as well as terms in more current usage, such as word, sentence, letter, etc.) Metalinguistics is used to refer to the language, whether natural or formalized (as in [[logic]]), which is itself used to speak of language; to a language whose sole function is to describe a language.  The language itself must constitute the sole sphere of application for the entire vocabulary.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TMuhVO7LBdAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ots=YAATKdlPLa&amp;sig=W2K52EEyrK6GnmtQxQnAf3G0-BE#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=true |title=Metalinguistic Development |author=Jean Émile Gombert|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|date=1992|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Experts are undecided about the value of awareness of metalanguage to language learners, and some "schools of thought" in language learning have been heavily against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott|title=An A-Z of ELT (Methodology)|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|location=Oxford|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalinguistic awareness and bilingualism==
[[Metalinguistic awareness]]  refers to the understanding that language is a system of communication, bound to rules, and forms the basis for the ability to discuss different ways to use language (Baten, Hofman, &amp; Loeys, 2011). In other words, it is the ability to consciously analyze language and its sub-parts, to know how they operate and how they are incorporated into the wider language system (Beceren, 2010). An individual with such ability is aware that linguistic forms and structure can interact and be manipulated to produce a vast variety of meanings. Words are only arbitrarily and symbolically associated with their referents, and are separable from them. For example, a dog is named "Cat", but the word "Cat" is only a representation for the animal, dog. It does not make the dog a cat.

The term was first used by Harvard professor Courtney Cazden in 1974 to demonstrate the shift of linguistic intelligence  across languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{dubious|date=December 2014}} Metalinguistic awareness in [[bilingual]] learners is the ability to objectively function outside one language system and to objectify languages’ rules, structures and functions. [[Code-switching]] and translation are examples of bilinguals’ metalinguistic awareness. Metalinguistics awareness was used as a construct in research extensively in the mid 1980s and early 1990s.
 
Metalinguistic awareness is a theme that has frequently appeared in the study of bilingualism. It can be divided into four subcategories, namely phonological, word, syntactic and pragmatic awareness (Tunmer, Herriman, &amp; Nesdale, 1988). Amongst the four, phonological and word awareness are the two aspects of metalinguistic awareness that have garnered the greatest attention in bilingual literacy research. Research has shown metalinguistic awareness in bilinguals to be a crucial component because of its documented relationship and positive effects on language ability, symbolic development and literacy skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/jmora/moramodules/MetaLingResearch.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225082333/http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/jmora/moramodules/MetaLingResearch.htm|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many studies investigating the impact of bilingualism on phonological and word awareness have indicated a positive bilingual effect (Baten, et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2004; Goetz, 2003; Kang, 2010; Ransdell, Barbier, &amp; Niit, 2006; Whitehurst &amp; Lonigan, 1998). Bilinguals are simultaneously learning and switching between two languages, which may facilitate the development of stronger phonological awareness. It is postulated that bilinguals’ experiences of acquiring and maintaining two different languages aid them in developing an explicit and articulated understanding of how language works (Adesope, Lavin, Thompson, &amp; Ungerleider, 2010). Hence they are equipped with stronger metalinguistic awareness as compared to their monolingual counterparts.

In their book ''Literacy and Orality'',&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VKSIC5H8sd8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ots=roD1IxtB-e&amp;sig=oWlgDG1nC_elQbjBs9kxB_IZgbc#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=false |title=Literacy and Orality|author1=Olson, David R.|author2=Torrance, Nancy |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1991-07-26 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  scholars David R. Olson and Nancy Torrance explore the relationship between literacy and metalinguistic awareness, citing a link that arises from the fact that, in both reading and writing, language can become the object of thought and discussion.  Prose reading and writing can be an instrument of metalinguistic reflection and in those cases one must assess the particular meaning of terms and of grammatical relations between them in order, either to understand such texts or write them.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

'''Nanowood''' is heat-insulating material made from wood that is considered a slightly better insulator than [[Styrofoam]]. Unlike Styrofoam, the material is more environmentally friendly and [[biodegradable]]. It is considered light, strong and created entirely from stripped-down wood fibers.&lt;ref name="phys_This"&gt;{{Cite web| title = This is 'nanowood,' an invention that could reduce humanity's carbon footprint| author = Khan, Amina| work = phys.org| date = 2018-03-12| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = https://phys.org/news/2018-03-nanowood-humanity-carbon-footprint.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The material was invented by engineer, Liangbing Hu and his team at [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. The material "when exposed to the solar spectrum" reflected approximately 95% of radiation energy absorbing only approximately 2%. Silica aerogel "absorbed approximately 20% and transmits approximately 60% of the radiative heat" according to study authors.&lt;ref name="lati_This"&gt;{{Cite web| title = This is 'nanowood,' a new invention that could greatly reduce humanity's carbon footprint| last = Khan | first = Amina| work = latimes.com| date = 10 March 2018| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-nanowood-20180309-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanowood could potentially save "billions in energy costs" according to Tian Li, a team member.&lt;ref name="smit_Coul"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Could 'Nanowood' Replace Styrofoam?| last = Matchar | first = Emily| work = Smithsonian| date = 2018-03-26| accessdate = 2018-05-07| url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/could-nanowood-replace-styrofoam-180968575/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21894">Even though [[intimacy]] has been broadly defined in terms of [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] and [[sexual desire and intimate relationships|sexual desire]], the '''[[neuroanatomy]] of intimacy''' needs further explanation in order to fully understand their neurological functions in different components within intimate relationships, which are romantic love, lust, attachment, and rejection in love.  Also, known functions of the neuroanatomy involved can be applied to observations seen in people who are experiencing any of the stages in intimacy.  Research analysis of these systems provide insight on the [[biological basis of love|biological basis of intimacy]], but the neurological aspect must be considered as well in areas that require special attention to mitigate issues in intimacy, such as violence against a beloved partner or problems with social bonding.

== Components of intimacy and neuroanatomy==

===Attachment===
[[Pair bonding]], or intense social attachment, normally initiates partner preference in sexual situations and monogamy in many mammalian species.  Monogamous species generally exhibit an exclusive responsibility to each other as well as co-parenting to their offspring.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Larry J|author2=Wang, Zuoxin|title=The neurobiology of pair bonding|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=October 2004|volume=7|issue=10|pages=1048–1054|doi=10.1038/nn1327}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies using monogamous [[prairie vole]]s (''Microtus ochrogaster'') showed that forming a pair bond stimulated the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway.  In this pathway, [[dopamine]] is released from the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) to the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[prefrontal cortex]], which then signals the [[ventral pallidum]] to complete reward processing in the pathway.&lt;ref name="Anatomy and neurochemistry - Young"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Larry J.|last2=Murphy Young|first2= Anne Z.|last3= Hammock|first3= Elizabeth A.D.|title=Anatomy and neurochemistry of the pair bond|journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|date=5 December 2005|volume=493|issue=1|pages=51–57|doi=10.1002/cne.20771|pmid=16255009}}&lt;/ref&gt;      
[[File:Dopamine Pathways.png|thumb|Dopamine Pathways | The dopamine pathway starts at the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and is routed to the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex for ultimate dopamine release that yields reward and reinforcement.  This helps in feeling pleasure or enjoyment of a certain stimuli and reinforcing that positive feeling when that initial stimuli occurs again.]]
Two important neuropeptides that mediated pair bond formation were [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin|arginine vasopressin (AVP)]].  Even though both males and females have both molecules, oxytocin was shown to be predominantly in females and vasopressin predominantly promoted pair bonding in males.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding" /&gt;  Receptor specificity was shown essential for mating by activating the [[dopamine receptor D2|dopamine D2 receptors]] in the nucleus accumbens in both male and female prairie voles.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding" /&gt;  Other locations that were also activated in the study were gender specific, such as oxytocin receptors (OTR) in the prefrontal cortex and AVP 1a receptors (V1aR) in the ventral pallidum.&lt;ref name="The neurobiology of pair bonding" /&gt;

[[File:Love-triangle.jpg|thumb| The [[Triangular theory of love]] by psychologist [[Robert Sternberg]] to describe the interpersonal aspects of love.]]

===Romantic love===
Romantic love is described as involving an individual who pays closer attention to another individual in special ways, involving attention on traits worthy to pursue.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Helen|author2=Aron, Arthur |author3=Brown, Lucy L. |title=Romantic Love: A Mammalian Brain System for Mate Choice|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=29 December 2006|volume=361|issue=1476|pages=2173–2186|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1938|pmid=17118931|pmc=1764845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), studies have shown that the right ventral tegmental area (VTA) is stimulated when subjects are shown a picture of their beloved.  As part of the reward mechanism, the VTA signals to other parts of the brain, such as the [[caudate nucleus]] to release dopamine for reward.&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aron|first=Arthur|author2=Fisher, Helen |author3=Mashek, Debra J. |author4=Strong, G. |author5=Li, Haifang |author6= Brown, Lucy L. |title=Reward, Motivation, and Emotion Systems Associated with Early-Stage Intense Romantic Love|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=31 May 2005|volume=94|issue=1|pages=327–337|doi= 10.1152/jn.00838.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Constudoverbrain - 2.png|thumb|Constudoverbrain|Neuroanatomical structures involved in romantic love are closely related to structures that are involved in motivation and emotion.]]
Older studies have generally attributed love to the [[limbic system]] consisting of the [[temporal lobe]]s, [[hypothalamus]], [[amygdala]] as well as the [[hippocampus]].  These functional components of the limbic system are important components of emotional processing, motivation, and memory.&lt;ref name=Amen&gt;{{cite book|last=Amen, M.D.|first=Daniel G.|title=Change Your Brain, Change Your Life|year=1998|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8129-2998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, current research also suggests components, such as the hypothalamus, as playing a role in romantic love because it possesses the penchant for bonding in mammals by secreting the neuropeptides, oxytocin and vasopressin.&lt;ref name=Beauregard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beauregard|first=Mario|author2=Courtemanche, Jerome |author3=Paquette, Vincent |author4= St-Pierre, Evelyne L. |title=The neural basis of unconditional love|journal=Psychiatry Research- Neuroimaging|date=15 May 2009|volume=172|issue=2|pages=93–98|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2008.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has implicated [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF), a neurotrophin that is fundamental in the neuron survival and development in the nervous system, in early-stage romantic love in subjects experiencing euphoria and emotional dependency, which is often a characteristic in romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Emanuele|first=E|author2=Politi, P |author3=Bianchi, M |author4=Minoretti, P |author5=Bertona, M |author6= Geroldi, D |title=Raised plasma nerve growth factor levels associated with early-stage romantic love|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=April 2006|volume=31|issue=3|pages=288–294|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.09.002|pmid=16289361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lust===
[[Lust]], also known as libido, is defined as pursuing [[sexual gratification]].&lt;ref name="Fisher 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Helen E.|author2=Aron, Arthur |author3=Mashek, Debra |author4=Li, Haifang |author5= Brown, Lucy L. |title=Defining the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction, and Attachment|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=2002|volume=31|issue=5|pages=413–419|doi=10.1023/A:1019888024255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is primarily driven by the endocrine system, but the brain is also involved in neural processing.  Specifically, the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal]] (HPG) and [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal]] (HPA)  axes play primary roles in the priming for sex as well as the stress response, respectively.&lt;ref name="Neuroendocrine Perspectives"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sue Carter|first=C|title=Neuroendocrine Perspectives on Social Attachment and Love |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=November 1998|volume=23|issue=8|pages=779–818|doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(98)00055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Larry|title=The chemistry between us : love, sex, and the science of attraction|year=2012|publisher=Current|location=New York|isbn=1591845130|author2=Alexander, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because intimacy is motivated by the reward system, steroid hormones activate desire to promote partner preference and social attachment in the process of sexual union.&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us" /&gt; Dopamine is then released when an individual is aroused, which associates lust as a product of the dopaminergic reward system.

However, interactions of sex and romantic love do not have the same goal orientation, which helps to confirm the difference in brain activation patterns.  Contrasting with the primary goal of romantic love, copulation can occur without two individuals being in romantic love or having a monogamous bond.  Sometimes, copulation might not even occur in romantic love relationships.  However, it still does play a role in successful reproduction when it is supplemented with romantic love.&lt;ref name="Fisher 2006" /&gt;

===Rejection in love===
Rejection in love is considered [[unrequited love|unrequited or unreciprocated love]].&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love" /&gt;   Separation from a loved one can cause grief and sometimes lead to an individual expressing characteristics of depression.  In a study, symptoms seen in nine women who had experienced a recent breakup suggested involvement of certain neuroanatomy.&lt;ref name="Women grieving" /&gt; Eating, sleeping, and neuroendocrine regulation was associated with the hypothalamus, [[anhedonia]] was associated with the ventral [[striatum]] and the amygdala was associated with emotional processing in these women.&lt;ref name="Women grieving" /&gt;   
[[File:Medial surface of cerebral cortex - gyri.png|thumb|Medial surface of cerebral cortex - gyri| The neuroanatomy of the medial surface of the cerebral cortex are implicated in rejection in love.  Regular functions of many of the anatomical structures connect rejection in love to motivation, emotions, deep thinking, and reward.]]
Other neuroanatomy that registered unrequited love included the [[cerebellum]], [[insular cortex]], [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name="Women grieving" /&gt;  All of the areas that were activated showed decreased activity when subjects emotionally reflected about the beloved rejecter.&lt;ref name="Women grieving"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Najib|first=A.|title=Regional Brain Activity in Women Grieving a Romantic Relationship Breakup|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 December 2004|volume=161|issue=12|pages=2245–2256|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2245|pmid=15569896}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
In contrast, another study observed significant increase in activation in the VTA as well as the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;  Further, those rejected in love had higher stimulation in the right nucleus accumbens and ventral putamen/pallidum compared to subjects who were in romantic love &lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=H. E.|author2=Brown, L. L. |author3=Aron, A. |author4=Strong, G. |author5= Mashek, D. |title=Reward, Addiction, and Emotion Regulation Systems Associated With Rejection in Love|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=5 May 2010|volume=104|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1152/jn.00784.2009 |pmid=20445032}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study ultimately showed that areas that are activated in romantic love are also activated in rejection in love.&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love" /&gt;  Results from this study suggest that rejected lovers have same stimulation of brain regions because they are still "in love" with their rejecters.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;  Since romantic love follows the dopaminergic reward system, the anticipatory nature of receiving a reward as well as deciding on losses and gains in decision making, allows the neural circuitry to become adaptable.  This allows the rejected to change their behavior through two stages.  The first is the "protest" stage where they try to win back the rejecter.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;  The second stage or the "rejection" stage is where they feel resignation and despair, eventually leading to continuing life without the rejecter.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love"/&gt; On the other hand, the involvement of the reward gain/loss pathways intrinsic to survival provides insight on behaviors of stalking, suicide, obsessiveness and depression.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Rejection in Love" /&gt;

==Other neurological implications of intimate brain systems ==

===Mother–child pair bond===
An attachment between a mother and child arises from behavioral changes during birth, which includes lactation.&lt;ref name="Neuroendocrine Perspectives" /&gt;  Release of oxytocin is important in the birthing process for the mother–child pair bond to occur in both individuals. Lactation relies on the constant release of oxytocin for the release of milk in the breast, which strengthens the first social bond of the infant and the mother.&lt;ref name="Neuroendocrine Perspectives" /&gt;

Although this is considered another type of social attachment that activates the same reward system, maternal attachment activates different regions of the brain compared to those in partner attachment.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;  In one study, overlap of activated brain regions with romantic love was found to include the nucleus accumbens, [[putamen]], caudate nucleus, which are important in social attachment.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;  However, the only regions that were specific to maternal love were the orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal cortex as well as the occipital and lateral fusiform cortex.&lt;ref name="Bartels Maternal Love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartels|first=Andreas|author2=Zeki, Semir|title=The neural correlates of maternal and romantic love|journal=NeuroImage|date=March 2004|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1155–1166|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.11.003|pmid=15006682}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Moreover, oxytocin is important between the mother and her offspring, so it is suggested that oxytocin deficiency can influence how successfully the offspring is able to form a monogamous pair bond with another individual in the future. This may provide insight on issues with formation of pair bonds as well as psychological problems from an inefficient upbringing.&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartels Maternal Love"/&gt;

===Addictiveness===

[[File:PET - Human Addiction.jpg|thumb|PET - Human Addiction| [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scans of brains that are normal in comparison to brains of an obese subject, alcoholic subject, and cocaine user.  Love is suggested to simulate patterns of a cocaine user in brain activation.]]
Love activates the same neural circuitry as maladaptive drugs, such as cocaine. Dopaminergic reward pathways are involved to elicit a response of gaining a reward and reinforcement, thereby leading some researchers to believe that love is addictive.&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;  Love and drugs of abuse stimulate similar levels of dopamine for reward and reinforcement from the VTA.&lt;ref name="The Chemistry Between Us" /&gt; Actions between the two mental states are very similar with those in love experiencing excessive exhilaration, insomnia, anxiety, and loss of appetite also seen in drug users.&lt;ref name="Aron - Romantic Love" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher - Defining the Brain systems" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beauregard|first=Mario|author2=Courtemanche, Jérôme |author3=Paquette, Vincent |author4= St-Pierre, Évelyne Landry |title=The neural basis of unconditional love|journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging|date=May 2009|volume=172|issue=2|pages=93–98|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2008.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Larry J.|author2=Lim, Miranda M. |author3=Gingrich, Brenden |author4= Insel, Thomas R. |title=Cellular Mechanisms of Social Attachment|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=September 2001|volume=40|issue=2|pages=133–138|doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, brain activity observed through [[single-photon emission computed tomography| single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)]] showed that dopamine release in the [[basal ganglia]] of a subject who was romantically in love appeared similar to a subject addicted to cocaine.&lt;ref name=Amen /&gt;  Although love is suggested to be addictive based on its neurological circuitry, it cannot be simplified as addictive because it is expressed in different ways across a wide spectrum.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Gender differences in the intimate brain===

====Emotional processing====
The amygdala, a key player in emotional processing, is suggested different between men and women.  In males, emotions are considered to be primarily directed from the right hemisphere; on the other hand, it is primarily directed from the left hemisphere in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Medina|first=John|title=Brain rules : 12 principles for surviving and thriving at work, home, and school|year=2009|publisher=Pear Press|location=Seattle, Wash.|isbn=0979777747|edition=1st Pear Press trade pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FrontalCapts.png|thumb|FrontalCapts|Many of the [[gyrus|gyri]] of the brain are implicated in the emotional processing of valenced words in males and females.]]
One study that tested positively and negatively valenced words on both male and female subjects found that emotional processing was indeed gender specific. In males, positively valenced words activated the left sensimotor cortex, angular gyrus, left hippocampus, left frontal eye field and the right cerebellum, while females had activations in the right putamen, right superior temporal gyrus, left [[supramarginal gyrus]], left inferior frontal gyrus and the left sensorimotor cortex.  By contrast, negatively valenced words stimulated greater activation in the right supramarginal gyrus in males, while greater activation in the left part of the hippocampus with negative stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofer|first=Alex|author2=Siedentopf, Christian M. |author3=Ischebeck, Anja |author4=Rettenbacher, Maria A. |author5=Verius, Michael |author6=Febler, Stephan |author7= Wolfgang Fleischhacker, W. |title=Sex differences in brain activation patterns during processing of positively and negatively valenced emotional words|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=12 October 2006|volume=37|issue=01|pages=109|doi=10.1017/S0033291706008919 |pmid=17038205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, different brain regions in males and females could allude to differential responses emotional processing in intimate situations.

====Jealousy====
[[File:Gender Differences in Jealousy When Looking at Actual Infidelity.png|thumb|Gender Differences in Jealousy When Looking at Actual Infidelity| Induction of jealousy through emotional and sexual imagery of their partner elicited differential responses in males and females.]]

Known as the insecure feeling of a partner in regards to losing their loved one to another,  [[jealousy]] can result in extreme situations such as violence and abuse from the insecure partner to their beloved.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  In one study, men and women were shown sentences that suggested sexual and emotional infidelity and rated the intensity of jealousy that they felt.&lt;ref name="Gender differences"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=Hidehiko|author2=Matsuura, Masato |author3=Yahata, Noriaki |author4=Koeda, Michihiko |author5=Suhara, Tetsuya |author6= Okubo, Yoshiro |title=Men and women show distinct brain activations during imagery of sexual and emotional infidelity|journal=NeuroImage|date=September 2006|volume=32|issue=3|pages=1299–1307|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.05.049 |pmid=16829139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sexual infidelity=====
In males, activation of brain areas that were induced by sexual infidelity laden statements included the [[visual cortex]], middle temporal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, and [[claustrum]].  In females, the visual cortex, middle frontal gyrus, thalamus, and cerebellum were activated.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  It was found that males showed more stimulation in the amygdala in regards to sexual infidelity, while females showed greater activation in the visual cortex and thalamus.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  The regions in the male brain provided insight on neuroanatomy associated with sexual and aggressive behavior.  These regions could be studied further in increased violent cases against partners, which are commonly due to male aggression.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;

=====Emotional infidelity=====
In males, the visual cortex, medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, cingulate cortex, insula, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, hypothalamus, and cerebellum were shown to be activated.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt;  In females, activations in the visual cortex, medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, thalamus, and cerebellum were noted.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt; Male activations were greater in the precentral gyrus, insula, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum, while women shower greater activations in the visual cortex, angular gyrus, and thalamus.  Regions in the female brain have been implicated in detection of intention, deception, and trustworthiness of others.&lt;ref name="Gender differences" /&gt; It is ultimately suggested that the different emotional processing in males and females contributes to the different responses in issues in intimate relationships.

'''Out-of-box experience''' ('''OOBE''' pronounced oo-bee) is the experience a consumer (or user) has when preparing to first use a new product. In relation to computing, this includes the setup process of installing and/or performing initial configuration of a piece of [[computer hardware|hardware]] or [[software]] on a [[computer]]. This generally follows the [[point-of-sale]] or the interaction of an expert user.

==Overview==
The out-of-box experience is typically the first impression a product creates, such as the ease with which a buyer can begin using the product. For hardware products, a positive OOBE can be created with logical easy-to-follow instructions and good quality of manufacturing.

For software, this often means easy [[software installation|installation]] and "Welcome" or "Initial Configuration" [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] screens that simplify elaborate set-up. The OOBE can also include the complete lack of such wizards.

The process of installing [[Microsoft Windows]] is a common example for OOBE. While the installation is largely automatic, the user must proceed through multiple screens to acknowledge software license terms, specify [[Disk partitioning|partition]] settings for the [[hard disk]], enter the "[[product key]]", select international settings, a [[time zone]], and also configure [[Computer networking|network]] settings. After the installation is complete, Microsoft Windows launches the "out-of-box application that presents a full-screen [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] to assist the user with critical first steps of using Windows, such as creating a user account, registering the software with Microsoft (optional), configuring Internet connectivity, and product activation. Although this Microsoft application is named after OOBE, the real OOBE began when the user first turned on a new computer and was taken through the initial setup.

== Negative experiences ==
For poor out-of-box experiences, the specific term [[Out of box failure|out-of-box failure]] (OOBF or OBF) has been coined to describe immediate product failures.

The questions are arranged in six areas: home energy and water, transportation, consumerism, waste, advocacy, and demographics. 

==Conception==
Lotter, at the time a graduate student in ecology at the [[University of California, Davis]], developed the PEIA methodology while teaching a course on the History of Western Consciousness in the UC Davis Experimental College.  He realized that, while individuals in contemporary Western society generally have an enormous [[environmental impact]], there is very little awareness of it and no method for its quantification or [[environmental impact assessment|assessment]].

==Development==
The first software version of the PEIA methodology was the [[DOS]]-based EnviroAccount software, written in [[QuickBasic]] and completed in 1992. The basic PEIA algorithms were then transferred to [[Windows 3.1]] based EarthAware software, released in 1996.

EarthAware is still available for [http://donlotter.net/earthaware.html download] and runs on Windows 32-bit computers.

Lotter also authored a book on the topic, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Earthscore-Personal-Environmental-Audit-Guide/dp/0962906964 EarthScore: Your Personal Environmental Audit and Guide]''.

PEIA is similar in concept to the [[Ecological footprint]].

In the fields of [[urban planning]], [[urban regeneration]] and [[e-government]], the term '''''piazza telematica''''' has been used in Italy since the early 1990s by a number of [[community network]] and local institutions for promoting the insertion, inside the urban upgrading processes, of the principles of [[sustainable development]] and of [[accessibility]] for all to [[Information technology|IT]] tools for assuring the Right of [[Citizenship]]: the possibilities to participate in public decision processes, to access to the knowledge and training, to take part of the social [[local community]] life.

The term piazza telematica evokes a hybrid space indebted in equal parts to the real (with territorial components) and the [[Virtuality|virtual]] space that has to be considered as a whole, a new [[glocal]] (global – local) [[public space]] with a great symbolic value for the [[democracy|democratic]] interaction and for the social life.

The word “[[piazza]]” underlines the semantic significance of a [[public space]] traditionally located in the heart of  the [[town]] centre or of  a [[village]] and dedicated to [[communication]], [[meeting]], and the exchange of material goods and, at present, through the use of telematics systems and services, to the exchange also of immaterial goods (new virtual services and functions: [[Telecommuting]], [[Coworking]], online [[Training]] through [[Multi-monitor]], [[Telemedicine]], [[Electronic commerce]] and the new [[Sustainable mobility]] services such as [[Bike sharing]] and [[Car sharing]].

== History ==
*1990 - The term Piazza Telematica is used for the first time in newspapers and magazines in order to describe the telematics systems and services set up for the journalists in the 12 Italian cities hosting the [[FIFA World Cup 1990]].
*1994 - Participation to the ACT-VILL project of the Direction XII [[Science]] and Technology of the [[European Union]] for the city of the 21st century corresponding to new concepts synthesised in three scenarios:
**[[Sustainable city]], a city that internalise the problems it generates, solving them instead of transferring to other or to the future. 
**"[[Glocal]]" city (global/local), a city with a better balance between the [[globalisation]] process and the ability to use local resources. 
**Post-modern or [[agora]] city, a human centred city with a harmonic relationship between the [[citizen]] and the [[urban design]].
*1995 - Participation to the European conference ''Urban utopias: new tools for the [[European Urban Renaissance]], promoted by the Direction XII [[Science]] and Technology of the [[European Union]] and hosted by the Municipality of [[Berlin]].
*2004 - The first pilot project of a Piazza Telematica, supported by the European Union (div. XVI for social cohesion and sustainable development) is opened to the general public in [[Naples]] (Italy) in the bourough of Scampia.

In some other pilot projects, as is the case for the Piazza Telematica of the Municipality of Provaglio d'Iseo, the term Piazza Telematica is used in order to evoke a virtual space on the Internet open to all citizens for the exchange of ideas, proposals and participation, through [[Internet forum|forum]] and other [[World Wide Web|web]] instruments, to the socio-cultural and economic life of the [[community]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14043">'''Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score''' ('''PDCAAS''') is a method of evaluating the [[protein quality|quality of a protein]] based on both the [[amino acid]] requirements of humans and their ability to digest it.

The PDCAAS rating was adopted by the [[US FDA]] and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/[[World Health Organization]] (FAO/WHO) in 1993 as "the preferred 'best'" method to determine [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] quality.&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U5900t/u5900t07.htm Boutrif, E., Food Quality and Consumer Protection Group, Food Policy and Nutrition Division, FAO, Rome: "Recent Developments in Protein Quality Evaluation" ''Food, Nutrition and Agriculture'', Issue 2/3, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].

==Methodology==
Using the PDCAAS method, the protein quality rankings are determined by comparing the amino acid profile of the specific food protein against a standard amino acid profile with the highest possible score being a 1.0. This score means, after [[digestion]] of the protein, it provides per unit of protein 100% or more of the [[Essential amino acid|indispensable amino acids]] required.

The formula for calculating the PDCAAS percentage is: (mg of [[limiting amino acid]] in 1 g of test protein / mg of same amino acid in 1 g of reference protein) x fecal true digestibility percentage.&lt;ref name=pmid10867064/&gt;

The PDCAAS value is different from measuring the quality of protein from the [[Protein efficiency ratio|protein efficiency ratio (PER)]] and the [[biological value]] (BV) methods.&lt;ref name="Best"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Jay R.|last2=Falvo|first2=Michael J.|year=2004|title=Protein – Which is Best|url=http://www.jssm.org/vol3/n3/2/v3n3-2pdf.pdf|journal=Journal of Sports Science and Medicine|volume=3|issue=3|pages=118–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PER was based upon the amino acid requirements of growing rats, which noticeably differ from those of humans. The PDCAAS allows evaluation of food protein quality based on the needs of humans as it measures the quality of a protein based on the amino acid requirements (adjusted for digestibility) of a 2- to 5-year-old child (considered the most nutritionally demanding age group). The BV method uses nitrogen absorption as a basis. However, it does not take into account certain factors influencing the digestion of the protein and is of limited use for application to human protein requirements because what is measured is maximal potential of quality and not a true estimate of quality at requirement level. Nevertheless, BV can be used to assess requirements of protein derived from foods with known quality differences and measure the proportion of absorbed nitrogen which is retained and presumably used for protein synthesis as an accurate indicator for protein measurement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM Srikantia, S. G., University of Mysore, Mysore:  "The Use Of Biological Value Of A Protein In Evaluating Its Quality For Human Requirements", ''Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements EPR 81 29'', Rome, Aug 1981.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA gave two reasons for adopting the PDCAAS in 1993: 1) PDCAAS is based on human amino acid requirements, which makes it more appropriate for humans than a method based on the amino acid needs of animals. 2) The Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) had previously recommended PDCAAS for regulatory purposes.

==Limitations==
===Digestion===
Amino acids that move beyond the terminal [[ileum]] in the body are less likely to be absorbed for use in [[protein synthesis]]. They may pass out of the body, or may be absorbed by [[bacteria]], thus will not be present in the feces, and will appear to have been digested. The PDCAAS takes no account of where the proteins have been digested.

Similarly, amino acids that are lost due to [[antinutritional factor]]s present in many foods are assumed to be digested according to the PDCAAS.

Due to this in 2013 the FAO proposed changing to [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org/food-technology/daily-news/2013/march/07/fao-proposes-new-protein-quality-measurement.aspx FAO proposes new protein quality measurement. March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Focus on single proteins===
The PDCAAS method may also still be considered incomplete, since human diets, except in times of [[famine]], almost never contain only one kind of [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]. However, calculating the PDCAAS of a diet solely based on the PDCAAS of the individual constituents is impossible, because one food may provide an abundance of an amino acid that the other is missing, in which case the PDCAAS of the diet is higher than that of any one of the constituents. To arrive at the final result, all individual amino acids would have to be taken into account, though, so the PDCAAS of each constituent is largely useless.

For example, grain protein has a PDCAAS of about 0.4 to 0.5, limited by [[lysine]]. On the other hand, it contains more than enough [[methionine]]. [[Bean|White bean]] protein (and that of many other [[pulses]]) has a PDCAAS of 0.6 to 0.7, limited by methionine, and contains more than enough lysine. When both are eaten in roughly equal quantities in a diet, the PDCAAS of the [[protein combining|combined constituent]] is 1.0, because each constituent's protein is complemented by the other.

A more extreme example would be the combination of [[gelatine]] (which contains virtually no [[tryptophan]] and thus has a PDCAAS of 0) with isolated tryptophan (which, lacking all other essential amino acids, also has a PDCAAS of 0). Despite individual scores of 0, the combination of both in adequate amounts has a positive PDCAAS, with the limiting amino acids [[isoleucine]], [[threonine]], and [[methionine]]. Further, according to a 2000 study by Gerjan Schaafsma, "The questions about the validity of the amino acid scoring pattern and the application of the true fecal rather than the true ileal&lt;!-- not an error, adj of ileum --&gt; digestibility correction, as well as the truncation of PDCAAS values warrant a critical evaluation of PDCAAS in its current form as a measure of protein quality in human diets."&lt;ref name=pmid10867064/&gt; Also, the scientific community has raised critical questions about the validity of PDCAAS (the validity of the preschool-age child amino acid scoring pattern, the validity of the true fecal digestibility correction and the truncation of PDCAAS values to 100%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=Impact of amino acid availability on the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score|journal=Bulletin|publisher=International Dairy Federation|volume=336|pages=46–50|issn=0259-8434|vauthors=Darragh AJ, Schaafsma G, Moughan PJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Dairy Foundation on Nutrition and Health Proceedings of the International Workshop on Nutritional Aspects of Milk Proteins in Comparison with Other Proteins, organized by the Dutch Foundation on Nutrition and Health, Utrecht, the Netherlands, March 13–14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capped score===
In addition, the fact that four proteins, all with different amino acid profiles, receive identical scores of 1.0 limits its usefulness as a comparative tool. Since they have different compositions, it is natural to assume that they perform differently in the human body and should have different scores. In short, this method, however, gives no distinction of their performance relative to each other, because after they pass a certain point, they are all capped at 1.0 and receive an identical rating.&lt;ref name="Best" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sarwar G|date=May 1997|title=The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method overestimates quality of proteins containing antinutritional factors and of poorly digestible proteins supplemented with limiting amino acids in rats|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9164998|journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=127|issue=5|pages=758–64 |pmid=9164998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schaafsma G|year=2005 |title=The Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)--a concept for describing protein quality in foods and food ingredients: a critical review|journal=Journal of AOAC International |volume=88|issue=3|pages=988–94|pmid=16001875}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in 1990 at a FAO/WHO meeting, it was decided that proteins having values higher than 1.0 would be rounded or "leveled down" to 1.0 as scores above 1.0 are considered to indicate the protein contains essential amino acids in excess of the human requirements.&lt;ref name="FAOWHO1990"&gt;FAO/WHO [1990].

==Reference pattern==

This reference pattern is based on the essential amino acid requirements for preschool children aged 1-3 years as published in [https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12 Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (2005)]. Adults aged 18+ will have [https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12#687 slightly lower requirements].

All living cells produce [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) as a byproduct of metabolism.  ROS are reduced oxygen intermediates that include the [[superoxide]] radical (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and the [[hydroxyl radical]] (OH•), as well as the non-radical species [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Chemical background ==

In sea water, ROS can be generated through abiotic as well as biotic processes, among which are the radiolysis and photolysis of water molecules and cellular respiration.  According to a model proposed by Fan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marchem.2008.01.005 |title=Photochemical and biochemical controls on reactive oxygen and iron speciation in the pelagic surface ocean |year=2008 |last1=Fan |first1=Song-Miao |journal=Marine Chemistry |volume=109 |pages=152–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the prediction of ROS in surface waters, the biochemistry mediated by phytoplankton may be just as important for the production of ROS as photochemistry.

First, ROS concentrations are generally low (nanomoles) in seawater.  Second, they may react with other hard to identify molecules that occur in low quantities, resulting in unknown products.  Finally, they are (for the most part) transient intermediates, having lifetimes as little as microseconds.&lt;ref name="Blough"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blough |first1=Neil |last2=Zepp |first2=Richard G. |title=Active oxygen in chemistry |year=1995 |publisher=Blackie Acad. &amp; Professional |location=London |isbn=9780751402926 |editor=Christopher S.

===Superoxide production===

According to Blough &amp; Zepp,&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt; superoxide is one of the hardest reactive oxygen species to quantify because it is present in low concentrations: 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; M in the open ocean and up to 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;M in coastal areas.  The main sources of biological superoxide in the ocean come from the reduction of oxygen at the cell surface and metabolites released into the water.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lo.2005.50.4.1172 |title=Extracellular production of superoxide by marine diatoms: Contrasting effects on iron redox chemistry and bioavailability |year=2005 |last1=Kustka |first1=Adam B. |last2=Shaked |first2=Yeala |last3=Milligan |first3=Allen J. |last4=King |first4=D.

M. |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=1172–80|bibcode=2005LimOc..50.1172K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In marine systems, superoxide most often acts as a one-electron reductant, but it can also serve as an oxidant and may increase the normally slow oxidation rates of environmental compounds.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;   Superoxide is very unstable, with between 50 and 80% of its concentration of anions spontaneously disproportionating to hydrogen peroxide.  At its peak, this reaction occurs with a rate constant on the order of 2.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; – 4.5×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; L mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;  The dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide can also be catalyzed by the antioxidant enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]] with a rate constant on the order of 2×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; L mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1104/pp.106.082040 |title=Production and Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species in Chloroplasts and Their Functions |year=2006 |last1=Asada |first1=K. |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=391–6 |pmid=16760493 |pmc=1475469}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these fast acting processes, the steady state concentration of superoxide is very small. Since superoxide is also moderately reactive towards trace metals and dissolved organic matter, any remaining superoxide is thought to be removed from the water column through reactions with these species.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt; As a result, the presence of superoxide in surface waters has been known to result in an increase of reduced iron.&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moffett"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es00162a012 |title=Reaction kinetics of hydrogen peroxide with copper and iron in seawater |year=1987 |last1=Moffett |first1=James W. |last2=Zika |first2=Rod G. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=804–810|bibcode=1987EnST...21..804M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, serves to enhance the availability of iron to phytoplankton whose growth is often limited by this key nutrient.  As a charged radical species, superoxide is unlikely to significantly affect an organism's cellular function since it is not able to easily diffuse through the cell membrane.  Instead, its potential toxicity lies in its ability to react with extracellular surface proteins or carbohydrates to inactivate their functions.&lt;ref name="Fridovich"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3010872 |year=1986 |last1=Fridovich |first1=I |title=Biological effects of the superoxide radical |volume=247 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |doi=10.1016/0003-9861(86)90526-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although its lifetime is fairly short (about 50 microseconds), superoxide has the potential to reach cell surfaces since it has a diffusion distance of about 320&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Cadenas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fridovich" /&gt;

===Hydrogen peroxide production===

The reduction product of superoxide is hydrogen peroxide, one of the most studied reactive oxygen species because it occurs in relatively high concentrations, is relatively stable, and is fairly easy to measure.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;  It is thought that algal [[photosynthesis]] is one of the major modes of hydrogen peroxide production, while the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by stressed organisms is a secondary source.&lt;ref name="Palenik" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palenik_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt; In marine systems, hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) exists at concentrations of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; M in the photic zone,&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt; but has been found in double those concentrations in parts of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0967-0645(01)00026-1 |title=The distribution of hydrogen peroxide in the southern and central Atlantic ocean |year=2001 |last1=Yuan |first1=Jinchun |last2=Shiller |first2=Alan M |journal=Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography |volume=48 |issue=13 |pages=2947–2970|bibcode=2001DSRII..48.2947Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lifetime, ranging from hours to days in coastal waters, can be as long as 15 days in Antarctic seawater.&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is important in aquatic environments because it can oxidize dissolved organic matter and affect the redox chemistry of iron, copper, and manganese.&lt;ref name="Moffett" /&gt;  Since hydrogen peroxide, as an uncharged molecule, diffuses easily across biological membranes it can directly damage cellular constituents (DNA and enzymes) by reacting with them and deactivating their functions.&lt;ref name="Fridovich_a" /&gt;  In addition, hydrogen peroxide reduces to the hydroxyl radical, the most reactive radical and the one with the greatest possibility for damage.&lt;ref name="Cadenas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fridovich_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KeiberDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blough" /&gt;

===Hydroxyl radical production===

Even though the superoxide and the hydrogen peroxide radicals are toxic in their own right, they become potentially more toxic when they interact to form the hydroxyl radical (OH•).  This proceeds through the iron and copper catalyzed [[Haber–Weiss reaction]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Klebanoff |first=S.J. |editor=Furth, Ralph van |title=Mononuclear phagocytes: functional aspects |year=1980 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |location=Boston |pages=1105–1141 |isbn=9789024722112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because the radical is so reactive, there is likely not enough time for transport to the cell surface (mean diffusion distance of 4.5&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;  Thus, direct effects to organisms of externally generated hydroxyl radicals are expected to be minimal.  Indirectly, the hydroxyl radical can result in significant biogeochemical changes in marine systems by influencing the cycling of dissolved organic matter and trace metal speciation.  Both intracellular and extracellular reactive oxygen species can be removed from the environment by antioxidants produced biologically as a defense mechanism. Many phytoplankton, for instance, have been found to have numerous superoxide-scavenging (superoxide dismutase) and hydrogen peroxide-scavenging enzymes (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=K. |first=Asada |author2=Baker, N.R. |author3=Boyer, J.B. |year=1994 |chapter=Mechanisms for scavenging reactive molecules generated in chloroplasts under light stress |title=Photoinhibition of photosynthesis: from molecular mechanisms to the field |publisher=Bios Scientific Publishers |location=Oxford, UK |pages=129–142 |isbn=9781872748030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09670269600651471 |title=Production, scavenging and toxicity of hydrogen peroxide in the green seaweed ''Ulva rigida'' |year=1996 |last1=Collén |first1=Jonas |last2=Pedersén |first2=Marianne |journal=European Journal of Phycology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=265–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14622986 |year=2003 |last1=Barros |first1=MP |last2=Granbom |first2=M |last3=Colepicolo |first3=P |last4=Pedersén |first4=M |title=Temporal mismatch between induction of superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase correlates with high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in seawater from clofibrate-treated red algae ''Kappaphycus alvarezii'' |volume=420 |issue=1 |pages=161–8 |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |doi=10.1016/j.abb.2003.09.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-0981(03)00042-X |title=Responses of marine macroalgae to hydrogen-peroxide stress |year=2003 |last1=Dummermuth |first1=A.L |last2=Karsten |first2=U |last3=Fisch |first3=K.M |last4=König |first4=G.M |last5=Wiencke |first5=C |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=289 |pages=103–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2003.08.007 |title=Oxidative stress tolerance in the filamentous green algae Cladophora glomerata and Enteromorpha ahlneriana |year=2004 |last1=Choo |first1=Kyung-sil |last2=Snoeijs |first2=Pauli |last3=Pedersén |first3=Marianne |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=298 |pages=111–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The antioxidant superoxide dismutase catalyses the formation of hydrogen peroxide from the superoxide anion through the following reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3315461 |year=1987 |last1=Bannister |first1=JV |last2=Bannister |first2=WH |last3=Rotilio |first3=G |title=Aspects of the structure, function, and applications of superoxide dismutase |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=111–80 |journal=Critical Reviews in Biochemistry |doi=10.3109/10409238709083738}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ↔ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Controls of ROS production in algae==

Many algal species have been shown to not only produce reactive oxygen species under normal conditions but to increase production of these compounds under stressful situations.  In particular, ROS levels have been shown to be influenced by cell size, cell density, growth stage, light intensity, temperature, and nutrient availability.

===Cell size===

Oda ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Oda" /&gt; found that differences in the production of ROS were due to the size of the cell.  By comparing four species of flagellates, they showed that the larger species Ichatonella produced the most superoxide and hydrogen peroxide per cell than ''[[Heterosigma akashiwo]]'', ''Olisthodiscus luteus'', and ''Fibrocapsa japonica''.  In a comparison of 37 species of marine microalgae, including dinoflagellates, rhaphidophytes, and chlorophytes, Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt; also found a direct relationship between cell size and the amount of superoxide produced.  The largest cells, ''Chattonella marina'', produced up to 100 times more superoxide than most other marine algae (see figure in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3354/meps09036 |title=Ichthyotoxicity of gymnodinioid dinoflagellates: PUFA and superoxide effects in sheepshead minnow larvae and rainbow trout gill cells |year=2011 |last1=Mooney |first1=BD |last2=Dorantes-Aranda |first2=JJ |last3=Place |first3=AR |last4=Hallegraeff |first4=GM |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |volume=426 |pages=213–224|bibcode=2011MEPS..426..213M }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The authors suggest that since ROS is produced as a byproduct of metabolism, and larger cells are more metabolically active than smaller cells, it follows that larger cells should produce more ROS.  Similarly, since photosynthesis also produces ROS, larger cells likely have a greater volume of chloroplasts and would be expected to produce more ROS than smaller cells.

===Algal density===

The production of ROS has also been shown to be dependent on algal cell density. Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt; found that for ''Chattonella marina'', higher concentrations of cells produced less superoxide per cell than those with a lower density.  This may explain why some raphydophyte blooms are toxic at low concentration and non-toxic in heavy blooms.&lt;ref name="Twiner"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/plankt/22.10.1961 |title=Possible physiological mechanisms for production of hydrogen peroxide by the ichthyotoxic flagellate ''Heterosigma akashiwo'' |year=2000 |last1=Twiner |first1=M. J. |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1961–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tang &amp; Gobler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.hal.2008.10.001 |title=Characterization of the toxicity of ''Cochlodinium polykrikoides'' isolates from Northeast US estuaries to finfish and shellfish |year=2009 |last1=Tang |first1=Ying Zhong |last2=Gobler |first2=Christopher J. |journal=Harmful Algae |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=454–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; also found that cell density was inversely related to ROS production for the alga Cochlodinium polykrikoides.  They found, in addition, that increases of ROS production were also related to the growth phase of algae.  In particular, algae in exponential growth were more toxic than those in the stationary or late exponential phase.  Many other algal species (''[[Heterosigma akashiwo]]'', ''Chattonella marina'', and ''Chattonella antiqua'') have also been shown to produce the highest amounts of ROS during the exponential phase of growth.&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PortuneKevin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2010.00906.x |title=Antioxidant Enzyme Response and Reactive Oxygen Species Production in Marine Raphidophytes1 |year=2010 |last1=Portune |first1=Kevin J. |last2=Craig Cary |first2=Stephen |last3=Warner |first3=Mark E. |journal=Journal of Phycology |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1161–1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oda ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Oda" /&gt; suggest this is due to actively growing cells having higher photosynthesis and metabolic rates.  Resting stage cells of ''[[Chattonella antiqua]]'' have been shown to generate less superoxide than their motile counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/plankt/16.2.161 |title=Generation of superoxide anion radicals by the marine phytoplankton organism, ''Chattonella antiqua'' |year=1994 |last1=Tanaka |first1=Kazuko |last2=Muto |first2=Yoshinori |last3=Shimada |first3=Masahisa |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=161–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light levels===

Since superoxide is produced through the auto-oxidation of an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis, one would expect a positive relationship between light levels and algal ROS production.&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;  This is indeed what has been shown: in the diatom ''[[Thallasia weissflogii]]'', an increase in light intensity caused an increase in the production of both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lom.2009.7.706 |title=Real-time detection of reactive oxygen species generation by marine phytoplankton using flow injection—chemiluminescence |year=2009 |last1=Milne |first1=Angela |last2=Davey |first2=Margaret S. |last3=Worsfold |first3=Paul J. |last4=Achterberg |first4=Eric P. |last5=Taylor |first5=Alison R. |journal=Limnology and Oceanography: Methods |volume=7 |pages=706–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in the flagellates ''[[Chattonella marina]]'', ''Prorocentrum minimum'', and ''Cochlodinium polykrikoides'', decreases in light levels resulted in decreases in superoxide production,&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s002270100614 |title=Possible involvement of the glycocalyx in the ichthyotoxicity of ''Chattonella marina'' (Raphidophyceae): Immunological approach using antiserum against cell surface structures of the flagellate |year=2001 |last1=d(-k.). |first1=Kim |last2=t. |first2=Okamoto |last3=t. |first3=Oda |last4=k. |first4=Tachibana |last5=k.s. |first5=Lee |last6=a. |first6=Ishimatsu |last7=y. |first7=Matsuyama |last8=t. |first8=Honjo |last9=t. |first9=Muramatsu |journal=Marine Biology |volume=139 |issue=4 |pages=625–632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12601-009-0018-z |title=Physiological and biochemical responses of Prorocentrum minimum to high light stress |year=2010 |last1=Park |first1=So Yun |last2=Choi |first2=Eun Seok |last3=Hwang |first3=Jinik |last4=Kim |first4=Donggiun |last5=Ryu |first5=Tae Kwon |last6=Lee |first6=Taek-Kyun |journal=Ocean Science Journal |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=199–204|bibcode=2009OSJ....44..199P }}&lt;/ref&gt; with higher levels produced during the day.  However, because many studies have found ROS production to be relatively high even in the dark, metabolic pathways other than photosynthesis are likely more important for production.&lt;ref name="PortuneKevin" /&gt;  For instance, Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jembe.2007.03.007 |title=Effects of nutrients, salinity, pH and light:dark cycle on the production of reactive oxygen species in the alga ''Chattonella marina'' |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Wenhua |last2=Au |first2=Doris W.T. |last3=Anderson |first3=Donald M. |last4=Lam |first4=Paul K.S. |last5=Wu |first5=Rudolf S.S. |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=346 |pages=76–86|url=http://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/1764/1/algal%20ROS%20production%20JEMBE%20revised%206_3_07.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  found that ROS production was regulated by iron concentration and pH.  From this evidence they suggest that ROS production is most likely due to a plasma membrane enzyme system dependent on iron availability.  Similarly, in Heterosigma akashiwo, the depletion of iron and an increase in temperature, not light intensity, resulted in enhanced production of ROS.&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;  Liu ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Liu" /&gt;  found the same relationship with temperature.

==Functions of algal produced ROS==

The active release of reactive oxygen species from cells has a variety of purposes, including a means to deter predators, or a chemical defense for the incapacitation of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1568-9883(02)00048-3 |title=The toxigenic marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense as the probable cause of mortality of caged salmon in Nova Scotia |year=2002 |last1=Cembella |first1=A.D |last2=Quilliam |first2=M.A |last3=Lewis |first3=N.I |last4=Bauder |first4=A.G |last5=Dell'Aversano |first5=C |last6=Thomas |first6=K |last7=Jellett |first7=J |last8=Cusack |first8=R.R |journal=Harmful Algae |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=313–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-42-4-406.1 |title=Allelopathy in phytoplankton - biochemical, ecological and evolutionary aspects |year=2003 |last1=Legrand |first1=Catherine |last2=Rengefors |first2=Karin |last3=Fistarol |first3=Giovana O. |last4=Granéli |first4=Edna |journal=Phycologia |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=406–419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graneli"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Granéli |first1=E. |last2=Hansen |first2=P.

===Chemical defense===

It is not surprising that ROS production may be a form of chemical defense against predators, since at low levels it can damage DNA and at high levels lead to cell necrosis.&lt;ref name="Lesser" /&gt;  One of the most common mechanisms of cellular injury is the reaction of ROS with lipids, which can disrupt enzyme activity and ATP production, and lead to apoptosis.&lt;ref name="Halliwell" /&gt;  Reactions of ROS with proteins can modify amino acids, fragment peptide chains, alter electrical charges, and ultimately inactivate an enzyme's function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0968-0004(86)90221-5 |title=Oxidation of proteins by mixed-function oxidation systems: Implication in protein turnover, ageing and neutrophil function |year=1986 |last1=Stadtman |first1=E.R. |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=11 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3036875 |year=1987 |last1=Davies |first1=KJ |title=Protein damage and degradation by oxygen radicals.

Reactive oxygen species produced by phytoplankton have been linked to deaths of fish, shellfish, and protists, as well as shown to reduce the viability and growth of bacteria.&lt;ref name="IshimatsuAtsushi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24176 |year=1978 |last1=Babior |first1=BM |title=Oxygen-dependent microbial killing by phagocytes (first of two parts) |volume=298 |issue=12 |pages=659–68 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197803232981205 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KimDaekyung"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Daekyung |last2=Nakamura |first2=Atsushi |last3=Okamoto |first3=Tarou |last4=Komatsu |first4=Nobukazu |last5=Oda |first5=Tatsuya |last6=Ishimatsu |first6=Atsushi |last7=Muramatsu |first7=Tsuyoshi |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |title=Toxic potential of the raphidophyte Olisthodiscus luteus: mediation by reactive oxygen species |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=1017–27 |year=1999 |issn=0142-7873 |doi=10.1093/plankt/21.6.1017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a study by Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt; showed that four algal species used as bivalve feed produced significantly lower concentrations of superoxide, suggesting that ROS production by other algal species may be a way to decrease grazing by bivalves.  The most direct evidence for ROS as a defense mechanism is the fact that many icthyotoxic algae produce greater concentrations of ROS than nonichthyotoxic strains.&lt;ref name="Oda" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;

===Enhancement of toxic exudates===

It is possible that ROS may not be the actual toxic substance, but may in fact work to make other exudates more toxic by oxidizing them.&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okaichi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okaichi |first1=Tomotoshi |last2=Mark Anderson |first2=Donald |last3=Nemoto |first3=Takahisa |title=Red tides: biology, environmental science, and toxicology |year=1989 |publisher=Elsevier |location=New York |isbn=9780444013439 |pages=145–176 |chapter=Proceedings of the first international symposium on Red tides}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ROS from ''Chattonella marina'' have been shown to enhance the toxic effects of fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on exposed fishes.&lt;ref name="Marshall_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okaichi" /&gt;  Similarly, free-fatty acids released from diatom biofilms as products of ROS oxidation of EPA are known to be toxic to zooplankters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.00130.x |title=Liberation of 5,8,11,14,17-Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Other Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids from Lipids As a Grazer Defense Reaction in Epilithic Diatom Biofilms |year=2001 |last1=Juttner |first1=Friedrich |journal=Journal of Phycology |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=744–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Fontana ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17886321 |year=2007 |last1=Fontana |first1=A |last2=d'Ippolito |first2=G |last3=Cutignano |first3=A |last4=Romano |first4=G |last5=Lamari |first5=N |last6=Massa Gallucci |first6=A |last7=Cimino |first7=G |last8=Miralto |first8=A |last9=Ianora |first9=A |title=LOX-induced lipid peroxidation mechanism responsible for the detrimental effect of marine diatoms on zooplankton grazers |volume=8 |issue=15 |pages=1810–8 |doi=10.1002/cbic.200700269 |journal=ChemBioChem}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the interaction of ROS and diatom exudates (such as fatty acid hydroperoxides) are responsible for inhibiting embryonic development and causing larval abnormalities in copepods.  Finally, ROS oxidation of algal polyunsaturated fatty acids have also been shown to deter grazers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ikawa |first=M. |title=Algal polyunsaturated fatty acids and effects on plankton ecology and other organisms |url=http://www.cfb.unh.edu/PDF/2004/UNHCFBR-6-2-2004.pdf |journal=UNH Center for Freshwater Biology Research |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=17–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitive advantage===

In addition to impacting predator-prey interactions, the production of ROS may also help an alga get an advantage in the competition for resources against other algae, be a way to prevent fouling bacteria, and act as a signaling mechanism between cells.&lt;ref name="Graneli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KimDaekyung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oda_a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00356297 |title=Oxygen-radical-mediated toxic effects of the red tide flagellate Chattonella marina on Vibrio alginolyticus |year=1992 |last1=Oda |first1=T. |last2=Ishimatsu |first2=A. |last3=Shimada |first3=M. |last4=Takeshita |first4=S. |last5=Muramatsu |first5=T. |journal=Marine Biology |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=505–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ROS can inhibit photosynthesis in algae&lt;ref name="Lesser" /&gt;  Thus an alga that is more tolerant of ROS than another may produce and release it as a means of decreasing the other species competitive ability.  In addition, ''Chattonella marina'', the most well studied raphydophyte for ROS production, may produce a boundary of ROS that deters other marine microalgae from using nutrients in its vicinity.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;  Similarly, this boundary could also be a way to discourage bacteria fouling, since the production of ROS is known to inhibit growth and bioluminescent ability in the bacteria ''[[Vibrio alginolyticus]]'' and ''[[Vibrio fischeri]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name="KimDaekyung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oda_a" /&gt; Lastly, Marshall ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; showed that ''Chattonella marina'' cells were able to change their rate of superoxide production in as little as one hour when in different cell densities, increasing the rate from 1.4 to 7.8 times the original. They suggest that this quick response in altering rates of production may be a form of chemical signaling between cells that works to provide information about cell density.

===Reduction of metals===

ROS may be useful in the oxidation or reduction of necessary or toxic metals.  Since iron is necessary for phytoplankton growth, the auto-reduction of reactive oxygen species may be a way for algae to get usable iron from free or organically bound ferric iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0304-4203(95)00035-p |title=Iron uptake and growth limitation in oceanic and coastal phytoplankton |year=1995 |last1=Sunda |first1=William G. |last2=Huntsman |first2=Susan A. |journal=Marine Chemistry |volume=50 |pages=189–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Cakman ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Cakman"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16665677 |year=1987 |last1=Cakmak |first1=I |last2=Van De Wetering |first2=DA |last3=Marschner |first3=H |last4=Bienfait |first4=HF |title=Involvement of superoxide radical in extracellular ferric reduction by iron-deficient bean roots |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=310–4 |pmc=1054247 |journal=Plant Physiology |doi=10.1104/pp.85.1.310}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that ROS may increase the amount of iron available through extracellular ferric reduction.  It is thought that the high reducing power of this reaction is maintained through the electron-rich superoxide ion.&lt;ref name="Cakman" /&gt;  In several studies on the ROS production of ''Heterosigma akashiwo'', hydrogen peroxide production was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of iron available.&lt;ref name="Twiner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4319/lo.2001.46.6.1400 |title=Toxic effects of Heterosigma akashiwo do not appear to be mediated by hydrogen peroxide |year=2001 |last1=Twiner |first1=Michael J. |last2=Dixon |first2=S. Jeffrey |last3=Trick |first3=Charles G. |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1400–05|bibcode=2001LimOc..46.1400T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Cornish and Page in 1998 found that phytoplankton produce more ROS when there are lower levels of extracellular iron.  They suggested that when intracellular iron is limiting, the phytoplankton respond by producing more ROS as a way to increase the reducing potential around the cell and thus be better able to reduce that iron to a usable form.  Similarly, lower ROS production would suggest that the intracellular iron is at sufficiently high levels for cellular function.

Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, but 2015 was the first year when investment in non-hydro renewables, was higher in developing countries, with $156 billion invested, mainly in China, India, and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;FS-UNEP Collaborating Centre, [http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/publications/globaltrendsinrenewableenergyinvestment2016lowres_0.pdf Global trends in renewable energy investment], 2016 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developing countries have abundant [[renewable energy]] resources, including [[solar energy]], [[wind power]], [[geothermal energy]], and [[biomass]], as well as the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these. By developing such energy sources developing countries can reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas, creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises. In many circumstances, these investments can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems.&lt;ref name=mdg&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, [[electricity grid]] extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the [[diesel generator]]s that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as [[kerosene lamp]]s and [[biomass|traditional biomass]].&lt;ref name=reeee/&gt;

[[Kenya]] is the world leader in the number of [[solar power]] systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small [[solar panel]]s, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"&gt;http://en.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=38323&amp;TId=97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for renewable energy==
In 2009, about 1.4 billion of people in the world lived without electricity, and 2.7 billion relied on wood, charcoal, and dung for home energy requirements. This lack of access to modern energy technology limits income generation, blunts efforts to escape poverty, affects people's health, and contributes to global deforestation and climate change. Small-scale renewable energy technologies and [[distributed energy]] options, such as onsite solar power and improved cookstoves, offer rural households
modern energy services.&lt;ref name=verlaw&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2198045 |title=Deploying Off-Grid Technology to Eradicate Energy Poverty |author=Sovacool, Benjamin K., |date=5 October 2012 |work=Science (vol. 338, 47-48)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries. In rural and remote areas, transmission and distribution of energy generated from [[fossil fuels]] can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf Power for the People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330120425/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/publications/pdf/renewable_energy.pdf |date=2012-03-30 }} p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy doesn't always have to come from a developing country. The Developing Areas Study Group session is a group of speakers from all over the energy businesses discusses the potential ideas to get developing countries the renewable energy that they need. Papers written by W. Morgan, R. Moss and P. Richard discuss the opportunities of renewable resources that lie within the developing country as well. Morgan and Richard claim firewood and agriculture could play a great role in an alternative energy solution in developing countries, while Richards claims that efficient use of agriculture could lead to renewable energy. Morgan also points out that green plants could play a great role in producing synthetic fuel alcohol, which would not only impact the developing country but the world as a whole in providing an alternative fuel source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor= 20001554 |title= Energy in Developing Countries |last= McDonald |first= Paul |date= 1980 |journal= Area |accessdate= |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in renewable energies has increased in recent years due to environmental concern about [[global warming]] and [[air pollution]], reduced costs of the technologies themselves, and improved efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt; In recent years, supportive programs from governments, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and community cooperatives have expanded access to these off-grid technologies and the energy services they provide. Program planners should select “low-hanging fruit” first, aiming for maximum access to modern energy services with the least effort.&lt;ref name=verlaw/&gt;

==Use of renewables==
Collectively, developing countries have more than half of global renewable power capacity. China and India are rapidly expanding markets for renewable energy. Brazil produces most of the world’s sugar-derived ethanol and has been adding new biomass and wind power plants. Many renewable markets are growing at rapid rates in countries such as Argentina, Costa Rica, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay.&lt;ref name=ren9&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In isolated rural areas, electricity grid extensions are often not economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the diesel generators that would be otherwise be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass.&lt;ref name="reeee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Renew_Policies.pdf |title=Renewable Energy |author=IEA |year=2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |author= Kevin Bullis |date= January 27, 2012 |work= Technology Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.&lt;ref name=re10&gt;REN21 (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }} p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf |title=The Rise of Renewable Energy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-hydro systems configured into village-scale or county-scale mini-grids serve many areas. More than 30 million rural households get lighting and cooking from biogas made in household-scale systems. These stoves are being manufactured in factories and workshops worldwide, and more than 160 million households now use them.&lt;ref name = re10/&gt;

===Poverty alleviation===
{{See also|Energy poverty}}
Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty alleviation]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

===Education===
Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children spend out of school collecting fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/grameen08 |title=Grameen Shakti installs efficient stoves as well as solar home systems |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
2.4 billion people use only traditional biomass, such as wood, residues and dung, for cooking and heating. The constant use of these types of energy sources exposes them to indoor particulate and carbon monoxide concentrations many times higher than [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) standards. "Traditional stoves using dung and charcoal emit large amounts of carbon monoxide and other noxious gases. Women and children suffer most, because they are exposed for the longest periods of time. Acute respiratory illnesses affect as much as 6% of the world population. The WHO estimates that 2.5 million women and young children in developing countries die prematurely each year from breathing the fumes from indoor biomass stoves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull442/44204002429.pdf|title=IAEA BULLETIN, 44/2/2002|pages=28, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Renewable energy can improve this situation by reducing exposure to indoor pollutants.

Furthermore, renewable can also provide energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment in rural areas where the access to electricity is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashdenawards.org/winners/kxn |title=PV-powered vaccine fridges |author=Ashden Awards |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also provide power to supply the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;

==Government policies==
{{Further|Renewable energy policy}}
More developing countries are implementing the public policies needed for the widespread development of renewable energy technologies and markets, which have traditionally been dominated by Europe, Japan, and North America. The exceptions include countries like Brazil, which has built the world’s leading [[biofuel]]s industry, [[Renewable energy in China|China]], India, which are leaders in developing decentralized renewable sources such as [[small hydro]], small wind, biogas, and solar water heating.&lt;ref name=mdg/&gt;
However, policies like [[feed-in tariff]] are applied. Besides, with the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the program called the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) that allows for industrialized nations to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/adaptation_fund/items/3659.php Adaptation Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing-country Governments need to steer resources mobilized for large-scale investments into new production sectors and new technologies. Some argue that policies should base on active industrial policies, combining large scale investments and active policy interventions. There is a need of subsidizing these type of energy services to make them affordable to the major part of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/desa/desalert/2009/WESS_overview_en.pdf|title=World Economic and Social Survey 2009 Promoting Development, Saving, 2009, the Planet|pages=4, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Renewable Energy in the Philippines}}
[[File:Bangui Wind Mills.JPG|thumb|[[Bangui Wind Farm]] in [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Philippines]]]] The [[Philippines|Philippine]] government sees the growth of the renewable energy sector essential for national energy security. The Philippines' fossil fuel sector is unsustainable, being dependent on the import of nonrenewable fuel, including petroleum, but has significant potential in the renewable energy sector. Based on a report of an Australian consulting firm, International Energy Consultants, the Philippines has the highest electricity rate in Asia, followed by [[Japan]]. Transmitting power and transporting fuel throughout the Philippine archipelago is problematic due to very high cost.&lt;ref name=manila.b&gt;http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/325264/the-right-mix-the-philippines-achieving-its-renewable-energy-goals&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines could be considered a world leader in renewable energy, with its 30 percent of its power generation being powered by the renewable energy sector. the Philippines is the world's second largest generator of geothermal energy and was the first [[Southeast Asia]]n nation to invest in large-scale solar and wind technologies.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;

Promotion and support of renewable energy in the country was intensified with the passing of the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 which made a feed-in-tariff and a renewable portfolio standard. The Philippines aims to triple renewable energy supply by 2030.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/06/14/11/philippines-lifts-2030-renewable-energy-target&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the government has concluded agreements with private developers for extensive projects in Oriental Mindoro with an eventual output of 48 MW, with plans for even larger development in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://samueldalsanto.com/2012/04/14/samuel-helps-philippines-wind-power-project-get-presidential-approval/&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite government efforts, some investors have criticized the government's lack of firmness in its feed-in-tariff policy, and the solar industry accused the government for hampering its progress in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbiz.asia/story/policy-problems-hamper-philippine-renewables-growth&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2011, Algeria launched the National Development Programme for new and renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article937] Adoption of the Algerian program of renewable energy and energy conservation policy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?rubrique44] Algerian Development Programme for new and renewable energy and energy efficiency&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which spans the period from 2011 to 2013, aims to produce 22,000 MW of electricity from solar and wind power which 10,000 MW for export.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portail.cder.dz/spip.php?article1155] Algerian Development Programme for new and renewable energy and energy efficiency (List of projects)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
{{Main|Renewable energy in Kenya}}
In [[Kenya]], the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum&lt;ref&gt;The Ministry of Energy http://www.energy.go.ke/?page_id=2&lt;/ref&gt; is in charge of renewable energy policies. In March 2008, the country adopted the [[feed-in tariff]] policy. In January 2010, the policy was revised to urge private sectors to invest in electricity generation from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/feed%20in%20tarriffs2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenya was the first African country to use [[geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal power]], and still has the largest installed capacity of geothermal power in Africa at 200 MW, with a potential of up to 10 GW.&lt;ref name="en.ccchina.gov.cn"/&gt; The only other country in Africa utilising geothermal power is [[Ethiopia]].

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita (but not the number of watts added). More than 30,000 small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually. For an investment of as little as $100 for the panel and wiring, the PV system can be used to charge a car battery, which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day. More Kenyans are turning to solar power every year rather than making connections to the country’s electric grid. This is due to the high connectivity costs and the fact that there is an abundance of solar power in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rael.berkeley.edu/files/2006/Kammen-SciAm-Renewables-9-06.pdf The Rise of Renewable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Renewable energy in Brazil}}
[[Renewable energy]] accounted for more than 85.4% of the domestically produced electricity used in Brazil, according to preliminary data from the 2009 National Energy Balance, conducted by the Energy Research Corporation (EPE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2009/12/brazils-wind-power-auction-spurs-more-clean-energy-development.html Renewable energy in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt; After the oil shocks of the 1970s, Brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy, mainly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|sugarcane ethanol]]. Its large sugarcane farms helped. In 1985, 91% of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol. The success of [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s, introduced in 2003, together with the mandatory E25 blend throughout the country, have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by February 2008.&lt;ref name="ANP07_2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|title=ANP: consumo de álcool combustível é 50% maior em 2007|author=Agência Brasil|date=2008-07-15|publisher=Invertia|accessdate=2008-08-09|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226014527/http://br.invertia.com/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200807152306_ABR_77211977|archivedate=2008-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redebrasilatual.com.br/temas/economia/gabrielli-etanol-reduzira-mercado-de-gasolina-a-17-ate-2020 90% of cars produced in Brazil are Flexfuel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Repetition priming can occur without a person being aware of either the repeats or the improvements in his/her response, so it is generally thought to involve [[implicit memory]] processes that are dissociable from [[explicit memory]] processes.&lt;ref name="Rugg 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rugg|first1=M.D|last2=Mark|first2=R.E|last3=Walla|first3=P|last4=Schloerscheidt|first4=A.M|last5=Birch|first5=C.S|last6=Allan|first6=K|title=Dissociation of the neural correlates of implicit and explicit memory|journal=Nature|date=1998|volume=392|issue=6676|pages=595–598|doi=10.1038/33396}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has support from findings that [[amnesic]] patients with damage to [[limbic]] and/or [[diencephalic]] structures show measurable repetition priming effects but have deficits on explicit measures of memory.&lt;ref name="Kinder &amp; Shanks"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kinder|first1=A|last2=Shanks|first2=D.R|title=Amnesia and the declarative/nondeclarative distinction: A recurrent network model of classification, recognition, and repetition priming|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2001|volume=13|issue=5|pages=648–669|doi=10.1162/089892901750363217|pmid=11506662}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleischman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleischman|first1=D.A|title=Repetition priming in aging and Alzheimer's disease: an integrative review and future directions|journal=Cortex|date=2007|volume=43|issue=7|pages=889–897|doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70688-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some researchers suggest that implicit and explicit memory systems are not in fact separate.&lt;ref name=Reder&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reder|first1=L.M|last2=Park|first2=H|last3=Kieffaber|first3=P.D|title=Memory systems do not divide on consciousness: Reinterpreting memory in terms of activation and binding|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2009|volume=135|issue=1|pages=23–49|doi=10.1037/a0013974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Repetition priming has also been associated with attentional processes,&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsson|first1=J|last2=Smith|first2=A.T|title=fMRI repetition suppression: neuronal adaptation or stimulus expectation?|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=2012|volume=22|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr119|pmc=3278317}}&lt;/ref&gt; stimulus expectation&lt;ref name=Summerfield&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Summerfield|first1=C|last2=Egner|first2=T|last3=Greene|first3=M|last4=Koechlin|first4=E|last5=Mangels|first5=J|last6=Hirsch|first6=J|title=Predictive codes for forthcoming perception in the frontal cortex|journal=Science|date=2006|volume=314|issue=5803|pages=1311–1314|doi=10.1126/science.1132028|pmid=17124325}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[episodic memory]].&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neill|first1=W.T|title=Episodic retrieval in negative priming and repetition priming|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1997|volume=23|issue=6|pages=1291–3105|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.23.6.1291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into repetition priming has been used to investigate the nature of mechanisms underlying the behavioural effects of rapid learning.  In utilizing measures of ''repetition suppression'', the putative neural correlate of repetition priming, and measuring changes in the neural response associated with changing the presented stimuli, researchers are attempting to index regions and their processing biases along perceptual, conceptual and response dimensions.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector &amp; Malach 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grill-Spector|first1=K|last2=Malach|first2=R|title=fMR-adaptation: a tool for studying the functional properties of human cortical neurons|journal=Acta Psychologia|date=2001|volume=107|issue=1|pages=293–321|doi=10.1016/s0001-6918(01)00019-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This area of research is based on multiple measurement methods from single cell recordings&lt;ref name=Sobotka&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobotka|first1=S|last2=Ringo|first2=J.L|title=Stimulus specific adaptation in excited but not in inhibited cells in inferotemporal cortex of macaque|journal=Brain Research|date=1994|volume=646|pages=95–99|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(94)90061-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to multi-regional measurements using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI),&lt;ref name="Buckner &amp; Koustaal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckner|first1=R.L|last2=Koustaal|first2=W|title=Functional neuroimaging studies of encoding, priming, and explicit memory retrieval|journal=Proc.

== Theories and models ==
Numerous models have been put forward to explain behavioural efficiencies that are gained with repeated presentations of the same or similar stimuli.  These are outlined below.

===''Fatigue''===
In this model the attenuation of a neural response is hypothesised to be due to an overall reduction in the [[amplitude]] of a neuron's firing.&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohn|first1=A|last2=Movshon|first2=J.A|title=Neuronal adaptation to visual motion in area MT of the macaque|journal=Neuron|date=2003|volume=39|issue=4|pages=681–691|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether this reduction occurs across all neurons that responded to the initial stimulus or just the critical subset of those that initially responded maximally, is still unclear.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grill-Spector|first1=K|last2=Henson|first2=R|last3=Martin|first3=A|title=Repetition and the brain: neural models of stimulus-specific effects|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, evidence does suggest that a mechanism like this reduces redundant neural firing and enhances efficiencies in processing in the early visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dragoi|first1=V|last2=Sharma|first2=J|last3=Miller|first3=E.K|last4=Sur|first4=M|title=Dynamics of neuronal sensitivity in visual cortex and local feature discrimination|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=2002|volume=5|issue=9|pages=883–891|doi=10.1038/nn900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sharpening''===
Along similar lines is the idea that repetition causes the neurons that are less relevant to the representation of the stimulus to stop firing when that stimulus is repeated.&lt;ref name=Wiggs&amp;Martin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiggs|first1=C.L|last2=Martin|first2=A|title=Properties and mechanisms of perceptual priming|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=1998|volume=8|pages=227–233|doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(98)80144-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way the representation is supported by a gradually sparser response, resulting in an adaptive reduction in metabolic requirements and increased efficiencies in information transmission through the neural hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector 2006" /&gt;  This could be the result of lateral inhibition within representational levels in a competitive [[Hebbian]] learning system, where strong connections get stronger and inhibit the weaker connections.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector 2006" /&gt;  Much of the evidence for this comes from primate studies of the [[inferotemporal cortex]]&lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=D.J|last2=Riesenhuber|first2=M|last3=Poggio|first3=T|last4=Miller|first4=E.K|title=Experience-dependent sharpening of visual shape selectivity in inferior temporal cortex|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=2006|volume=16|issue=11|pages=1631–1644|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhj100|pmid=16400159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and single cell recordings with long training periods.&lt;ref name=Sigala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigala|first1=N|last2=Logothetis|first2=N.K|title=Visual categorization shapes feature selectivity in the primate temporal cortex|journal=Nature|date=2002|volume=415|issue=6869|pages=318–320|doi=10.1038/415318a|pmid=11797008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, decreases in firing rate over short-term training on repeated stimuli appear to be greatest in those cells that initially respond with the highest activation rate,&lt;ref name="Li miller desimone"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=L|last2=Miller|first2=E.K|last3=Desimone|first3=R|title=The representation of stimulus familiarity in anterior inferior temporal cortex|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=1993|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1918–1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with the fatigue model above.

===''Facilitation''===
The key concept in this model is that information travels faster through the network when the current stimulus representation overlaps with a previous representation, driven by more rapid onset of neural activation with repeated presentations.&lt;ref name="James &amp; Gauthier 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=T.W|last2=Gauthier|first2=I|title=Repetition‐induced changes in BOLD response reflect accumulation of neural activity|journal=Human Brain Mapping|date=2006|volume=27|issue=1|pages=37–46|doi=10.1002/hbm.20165|pmid=15954142}}&lt;/ref&gt; fMRI studies have been used in an attempt to measure these potential latency differences but the temporal resolution is not very precise&lt;ref name="Gagnepain 2008" /&gt; and single cell recordings typically do not show shortened latencies to repeated stimuli.&lt;ref name=Pedreira&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pedreira|first1=C|last2=Mormann|first2=F|last3=Kraskov|first3=A|last4=Cerf|first4=M|last5=Fried|first5=I|last6=Koch|first6=C|last7=Quiroga|first7=R.Q|title=Responses of human medial temporal lobe neurons are modulated by stimulus repetition|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=2010|volume=103|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1152/jn.91323.2008|pmid=19864436|pmc=2807242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another possible explanation of facilitation is synaptic potentiation within an [[attractor network|attractor neural network]] model where repetition decreases the settling time as the attractor basin deepens and so increases the overall speed of processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=S|last2=Moscovitch|first2=M|last3=Behrmann|first3=M|last4=Joordens|first4=S|title=Long-term semantic priming: a computational account and empirical evidence|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=1997|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1059–1082|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.23.5.1059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Reduced prediction error/stimulus expectation''===
When a stimulus is repeated top-down feedback modulates the neural response of earlier processing regions,&lt;ref name="Friston 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friston|first1=K|title=A theory of cortical responses|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2005|volume=360|issue=1456|pages=815–836|doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1622|pmid=15937014|pmc=1569488}}&lt;/ref&gt; with reduced neural activation and improved behavioural responses reflecting fulfilled expectations.&lt;ref name=Summerfield /&gt;  The idea for this comes from [[predictive coding]] theories and Bayesian statistics&lt;ref name="Rao &amp; Ballard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rao|first1=R.P|last2=Ballard|first2=D.H|title=Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects|journal=Nature Neuroscience|date=1999|volume=2|issue=1|pages=79–87|doi=10.1038/4580|pmid=10195184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has some support in fMRI studies manipulating stimulus expectation.&lt;ref name=Summerfield /&gt;  However, the results may also reflect the involvement of attention, which seems to have a modulatory effect on the extent of priming elicited.&lt;ref name=Larsson /&gt;

===''Neural synchrony''===
This theory is based on the idea that because downstream neurons are sensitive to both the firing rates and the timing of those inputs, efficiencies in processing may be gained through synchronised activation.&lt;ref name="Gilbert Gotts Carver"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=J.R|last2=Gotts|first2=S.J|last3=Carver|first3=F.W|last4=Martin|first4=A|title=Object repetition leads to local increases in the temporal coordination of neural responses|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2010.00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence of synchronisation associated with repeated stimuli include phase locking found between two regions of the cat visual cortex while measuring spike synchronisation for trained compared with novel stimuli&lt;ref name="von Stein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Stein|first1=A|last2=Chiang|first2=C|last3=Konig|first3=P|title=Top-down processing mediated by interareal synchronization|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=2000|volume=97|pages=14748–14753|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.26.14748|pmid=11121074|pmc=18990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suppressed firing and increased synchrony of spikes with repetition of odour puffs to locust's antennae.&lt;ref name=Stopfer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stopfer|first1=M|last2=Laurent|first2=G|title=Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics|journal=Nature|date=1000|volume=402|pages=664–668|doi=10.1038/45244|pmid=10604472}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence using [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] suggests that stimulus repetition in humans results in increased synchrony between distinct cortical regions, often the same regions that show reduced local neural activity (see repetition suppression below).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghuman|first=Avniel S.|last2=Bar|first2=Moshe|last3=Dobbins|first3=Ian G.|last4=Schnyer|first4=David M.|date=2008-06-17|title=The effects of priming on frontal-temporal communication|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=105|issue=24|pages=8405–8409|doi=10.1073/pnas.0710674105|issn=1091-6490|pmc=2448849|pmid=18541919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gotts Chow &amp; Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gotts|first1=S.J|last2=Chow|first2=C.C|last3=Martin|first3=A|title=Repetition priming and repetition suppression: A case for enhanced efficiency through neural synchronization|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2012|volume=3|issue=4|pages=227–237|doi=10.1080/17588928.2012.670617|pmc=3491809}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, the timing of this across-region synchronization predicted the amount of behavioral facilitation seen with repetition priming, suggestive of a close link between synchrony and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===''Stimulus-response binding''===
This theory suggests that repetition priming is a result of binding the initial stimulus directly to the response while bypassing the intervening layers of computation.&lt;ref name="Dobbins 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobbins|first1=I.G|title=Cortical activity reductions during repetition priming can result from rapid response learning|journal=Nature|date=2004|volume=428|pages=316–319|doi=10.1038/nature02400}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mechanism mediating this direct binding has not been clarified but several hypotheses have been put forward.  One theory explains it as a race between automatic activation of a previous stimulus-response route and the reengagement of the "algorithmic" route&lt;ref name=Logan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Logan|first1=G.D|title=Repetition priming and automaticity: Common underlying mechanisms?|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=1990|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–35|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(90)90002-l}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another theory suggests the operation of an "action-trigger" where repeated stimuli trigger the previous response through perceptual or conceptual associations with the original stimulus.&lt;ref name=Kunde&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunde|first1=W|title=Conscious control over the content of unconscious cognition|journal=Cognition|date=2003|volume=88|pages=223–242|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00023-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In support of this theory is evidence of a response congruency effect, which would be expected from these stimulus-response bindings.&lt;ref name="Henson 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henson|first1=R.N|last2=Eckstein|first2=D|last3=Waszak|first3=F|last4=Frings|first4=C|last5=Horner|first5=A.J|title=Stimulus–response bindings in priming|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2014|volume=18|issue=7|pages=376–384|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2014.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased synchrony between regions discussed above could be a neural correlate of stimulus-response binding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Neural correlates ==

=== Repetition suppression ===
The phenomenon of ''repetition suppression'', a reduction in neural activity when stimuli are repeated, is thought to depend on processing overlaps between repeated items&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=R.A|last2=Parker|first2=W.E|last3=Feiler|first3=A.M|title=Two kinds of fMRI repetition suppression?

As such it has been used extensively in research investigating the nature of representations across various levels of the visual processing hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Grill-Spector &amp; Malach 2001" /&gt;  In doing so researchers have found that repetition suppression appears to occur on multiple processing levels; dependent on the stimuli being processed and the processing level at which the experimental manipulation is directed; with reductions in neural activity to repeated stimuli occurring in regions involved with the initial processing of those features.&lt;ref name=Kristjansson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristjánsson|first1=Á|last2=Campana|first2=G|title=Where perception meets memory: A review of repetition priming in visual search tasks|journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|date=2010|volume=72|issue=1|pages=5–18|doi=10.3758/app.72.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, care must be taken in interpreting the results of these studies as the relationship between repetition suppression and repetition priming has not been definitively established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMahon|first1=D.B|last2=Olson|first2=C.R|title=Repetition suppression in monkey inferotemporal cortex: relation to behavioral priming|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=2007|volume=97|issue=5|pages=3532–3543|doi=10.1152/jn.01042.2006|pmid=17344370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repetition enhancement ===
Although repetition priming is most often associated with neural attenuation for repeated presentation of stimuli, increases in neural responses have also been measured in a number of experimental contexts.  For example, when performing mathematical calculations,&lt;ref name=Salimpoor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salimpoor|first1=V.N|last2=Chang|first2=C|last3=Menon|first3=V|title=Neural basis of repetition priming during mathematical cognition: repetition suppression or repetition enhancement?|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=790–805|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21234|pmc=4366146}}&lt;/ref&gt; when repeated stimuli are degraded,&lt;ref name="Horner &amp; Henson 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horner|first1=A.J|last2=Henson|first2=R.N|title=Priming, response learning and repetition suppression|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=2008|volume=46|issue=7|pages=1979–1991|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.01.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in studies involving a backward masking paradigm&lt;ref name="James &amp; Gauthier 2006" /&gt; and when stimuli have no pre-existing associations or meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henson|first1=R.N|last2=Shallice|first2=T|last3=Dolan|first3=R|title=Neuroimaging evidence for dissociable forms of repetition priming|journal=Science|date=2000|volume=287|issue=5456|pages=1269–1272|doi=10.1126/science.287.5456.1269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roberta Perkins'''&amp;nbsp;(1949 – 26 June 2018) was an Australian [[sociologist]], writer, and [[transgender]] rights and [[sex worker]] rights activist. She wrote several books and multiple academic articles on the semi-nomadic lives of transgender sex workers, and established the first assistance center for transgender people in Australia.

== Biography ==
Perkins completed her doctoral dissertation at [[Macquarie University]] in Sydney, in 1981. Her dissertation surveyed the lives and experiences of drag queens and transsexuals, and was one of the first ever doctoral works by an openly transgender woman.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Roberta Perkins (1940–2018) sociologist, activist |url=https://zagria.blogspot.com/2018/07/roberta-perkins-1940-2018-sociologist.html |website=A Gender Variance Who's Who |accessdate=14 September 2018 |date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, she was an early member of the then newly-created Australian Transsexual Association, which supported trans people by lobbying for social and legal reform.

In 1983, she published her first book, ''The Drag Queen Scene: Transsexuals in Kings Cross'', a survey of 146 drag queens based upon her dissertation. [[Frank Walker (Australian politician)|Frank Walker]], [[New South Wales]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Assembly person and at that time Minister for Youth and Community Services, read the book, and invited Perkins to meet. She told him about the poverty, homelessness and violence experienced by transgender sex workers, many of them youths; about the rape, beatings, harassment, and evictions, and how trans women could find no aid in either men's or women's shelters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gendercentre.org.au/resources/news-affecting-the-community/item/vale-roberta-perkins-1940-2018 Roberta Perkins (1940–2018)], Katherine Cummings, June 2018. Retrieved 14 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

&amp;nbsp;Walker understood the gravity of the situation, and expressed his commitment to help. As a result, Perkins received a grant of AU$80,000 to open a center that would operate as a shelter for transgender sex workers. The home, originally called "Tiresias House", opened in Sydney with 12 beds, which were immediately filled. The center quickly grew, and within a few years included four houses, and had on permanent staff a registered nurse and a community worker. After six years, its name changed to the Gender Centre.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/trans-sex-worker-activist-roberta-perkins-mourned-community/169935 Trans Sex Worker Activist Roberta Perkins Mourned By Community], Jesse Jones, Star Observer, 28 June 2018. Retrieved 14 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins left the Gender Centre in 1985, to concentrate on writing and publishing books and articles in academic publications about transgender women and sex workers. She was a noted figure in the struggle for [[sex worker rights]]&amp;nbsp;in New South Wales and Australia as a whole. She was a founding member of the&amp;nbsp;Australian Prostitutes Collective NSW, which advocated for [[decriminalization]] of sex work and for the improvement of sex workers' lives. The collective's work is continued today by the Sex Worker Outreach Project (SWOP) NSW.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Perkins died on 26 June 2018, at the age of 78. Her obituaries called her a "trail-blazer"&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and "a woman of action" who laid the groundwork for sex worker advocacy in her country, and benefited "countless" trans people and sex workers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

==Discovery==
Markus Schmid from the Strous lab first discovered S. wagneri in a landfill [[leachate]] treatment plant located in [[Pitsea]], UK on August 1, 2001.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; These bacteria doubled in number about every three weeks in laboratory conditions, which made them very difficult to isolate.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; Therefore, the researchers used 16S [[rRNA]] ([[ribosomal RNA]]) gene analysis on the [[biofilm]] of wastewater samples to detect the presence of these bacteria.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; They amplified and isolated the 16S rRNA gene from the biofilm using [[PCR]] and [[gel electrophoresis]]. Then, they [[TOPO cloning|cloned]] the DNA into TOPO [[Cloning vector|vectors]].&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; Once the researchers sequenced the DNA, they aligned the 16S rRNA gene sequences to a [[genome]] database and found that the sequences are related to the anammox bacteria.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; One of the sequences showed a 93% similarity to ''Candidatus'' Scalindua sorokinii, which suggests that this sequence belonged to a new species within the genus Scalindua and the researchers named it ''Candidatus'' Scalindua wagneri after Michael Wagner, a microbial [[ecologist]].&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt;

==Metabolism==
S. wagneri is an obligate [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[chemolithoautotroph]] and undergoes [[anaerobic ammonium oxidation]] (anammox) in the intracytoplasmic compartment called an [[anammox]]osome.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="van Niftrik 2004" /&gt; During the anammox process, [[ammonium]] is oxidized using [[nitrite]] as an [[electron acceptor]] and forms [[dinitrogen]] gas as a product.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; It is proposed that this mechanism occurs through the production of a [[hydrazine]] intermediate using [[hydroxylamine]], which is derived from nitrite.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; In addition, S. wagneri uses nitrite as an [[electron donor]] to fix [[carbon dioxide]] and forms [[nitrate]] as a byproduct.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; To the test the [[metabolic]] properties of S. wagneri, Nakajima ''et al''. performed anammox activity tests using nitrogen compounds labeled with the &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;[[Isotopes of nitrogen#Nitrogen-15|N isotopes]] and measured &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations after 15 days.&lt;ref name="Nakajima 2008" /&gt; The researchers found that the concentrations of the &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gases increased significantly.&lt;ref name="Nakajima 2008" /&gt; These results suggest that ammonia and nitrite is used in equal amounts to make &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[denitrification]] concurrently occurs with anammox metabolism.&lt;ref name="Nakajima 2008" /&gt;

==Genome==
Currently, genomic information about S. wagneri is very limited.&lt;ref name=NCBI /&gt; Current genome sequences were collected from DNA isolated from the bacteria growing in a marine anammox bacteria (MAB) reactor.&lt;ref name="Nakajima 2008" /&gt; Then, the 16S rRNA genes on the DNA were amplified using a specific [[oligonucleotide]] [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] for ''Planctomycetales'', separated using gel electrophoresis, and sequenced using a CEQ 2000 DNA Sequencer.&lt;ref name="Nakajima 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakajima|first1=J|last2=Sakka|first2=M|last3=Kimura|first3=T|last4=Furukawa|first4=K|last5=Sakka|first5=K|  title=Enrichment of anammox bacteria from marine environment for the construction of a bioremediation reactor.|journal= Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|date=2008|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1159–1166|doi=10.1007/s00253-007-1247-7|pmid=17965857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was performed using the GENETYX program, and the alignments and phylogenetic trees were made using [[BLAST]], [[Clustal|CLUSTALW]] and [[neighbor joining]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Nakajima 2008" /&gt; To have a better understanding of the [[genome]], S. wagneri can be compared to one of its better-known relatives. For example, ''Candidatus'' Scalindua profunda has a genome length of 2.7 billion base pairs with a [[GC content]] of 39.1%.&lt;ref name="Vossenberg 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van de Vossenberg|first1=Jack|last2=Woebken|first2=Dagmar|last3=Maalcke|first3=Wouter J.|last4=Wessels|first4=Hans J.

However, there are hundreds of 476 base pair partial sequences for its 16S rRNA gene.&lt;ref name=NCBI&gt;{{cite web|title=Scalindua wagneri|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=scalindua%20wagneri|website=NCBI|publisher=NCBI|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) analysis, a technique used to detect specific DNA sequences on [[chromosomes]], researchers were not able to detect hybridization between the chromosome of S. wagneri and the putative anammox DNA probe.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; This suggests that S. wagneri is not very similar to the known anammox bacteria, so the researchers categorized the bacterium into its own genus.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt;

==Ecology==
Although researchers are unable to isolate pure [[cultures]] of S. wagneri, it is believed to encompass a broad [[Ecological niche|niche]].&lt;ref name="Li 2010" /&gt; Using 16S rRNA gene analysis, Schmid first found evidence of the bacteria in wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; Other researchers also found 16S rRNA gene evidence in a petroleum reservoir held at a temperature range between 55&amp;nbsp;°C and 75&amp;nbsp;°C in addition to [[freshwater]] and [[Marine biology|marine]] [[ecosystems]], such as [[estuaries]].&lt;ref name="Li 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Hui|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|last3=Mu|first3=Bo-Zhong|last4=Gu|first4=Ji-Dong|title=Molecular Detection of Anaerobic Ammonium-Oxidizing (Anammox) Bacteria in High-Temperature Petroleum Reservoirs|journal=Microbial Ecology|date=26 August 2010|volume=60|issue=4|pages=771–783|doi=10.1007/s00248-010-9733-3|pmid=20740282|pmc=2974184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penton 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penton|first1=C.

==Importance and useful applications==
S. wagneri allows wastewater treatment plants to reduce operation costs while reducing the adverse effects of [[nitrification]] and [[denitrification]] on the environment.&lt;ref name="Jetten 2004" /&gt; These bacteria contribute to the development of new technologies for wastewater management by aiding in the efficient removal of [[Nitrogen#Nitrogen compounds|nitrogenous compounds]] in wastewater.&lt;ref name="Schmid 2003" /&gt; Usually, nitrogen reactors use both nitrification and denitrification to remove nitrogenous wastes.&lt;ref name="Jetten 2004" /&gt; These processes have high operation costs due to the continuous maintenance of [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] conditions in the reactor.&lt;ref name="Jetten 2004" /&gt; Denitrification also produces [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which is a greenhouse gas that is detrimental to the environment.&lt;ref name="Hu 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Z.|last2=Lotti|first2=T.|last3=de Kreuk|first3=M.|last4=Kleerebezem|first4=R.|last5=van Loosdrecht|first5=M.|last6=Kruit|first6=J.|last7=Jetten|first7=M.

'''Standard time''' is the amount of time that should be allowed for an average [[worker]] to process one [[work unit]] using the standard method and working at a normal pace. The standard time includes some additional time, called the [[contingency allowance]], to provide for the worker's personal needs, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and unavoidable delays during the shift.

== Prerequisite for Valid Time Standards ==
*The task is performed by an average worker
*The worker's pace represents standard performance
*The worker uses the standard method
*The task is performed on a standard work unit

== Calculating the Standard Time ==

The standard time (Ts) is calculated from multiplying the observed time (To) by the performance rating (R) and the personal need, fatigue and unavoidable delays (PFD):
Ts = To*R*(1+PFD)

== Usages for Standard Time ==
*Estimate the quantity of the production
*Determine workforce size and equipment requirement
*Compare alternative methods
*Evaluate worker's performance
*Plan and schedule production and estimate costs

'''Svend Nielsen''' (1919–2013) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] born [[architect]] and [[Architectural engineering|architectural engineer]]. Nielsen with his partner, Carl Johnson, founded the firm Johnson and Nielsen. Nielsen was influential in the construction of many important structures in Southern California, including the [[Discovery Cube Orange County|Discovery Cube]] in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]],&lt;ref name="ocreg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Earley|first1=Christopher|title=Newport engineer leaves mark on landscape|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/nielsen-513374-johnson-newport.html|accessdate=August 3, 2016|publisher=Orange County Register|date=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Coussoulis Arena]] in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] (notable for its "spider-like" exterior frame work) and, most famously, the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Forum]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood, CA]], which was the first structure of its kind to be built without support pillars.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Svend H. Nielsen's Obituary on The Press-Enterprise|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/pe/obituary.aspx?pid=165203056|website=The Press-Enterprise|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering of the Forum was quite a feat as the structural design allowed no obstructed seats in the entire arena.

Within the City of [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], three separate structures have been declared City Landmarks, including the Set Free Thrift Store on 14th Street, the Riverside Office Supply Store on 14th Street (refaced in 2013) and a garage on Market Street (demolished for redevelopment in 2012). All of these structures feature [[Mid-century modern|Mid Century Modern style architecture]] that was indicative of Nielsen's Danish influences.&lt;ref name="propview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Address search - City of Riverside, California|url=http://olmsted.riversideca.gov/propertyviewer/|website=olmsted.riversideca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen also designed and engineered the Danish Lutheran Church and Cultural Center located in Yorba Linda, California,&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt; the Bachelor Quarters for the U.S. Naval base in Long Beach&lt;ref name="LAtimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Naval Quarters to Be Finished in June|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-29/realestate/re-1746_1_naval-quarters|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 29, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 5,000 other buildings.&lt;ref name="ocreg" /&gt;

In addition to his work in architecture and engineering, Nielsen was one of the founding members of the California Seismic Review Board, which would generate the guidelines that would later become the foundation for Chapter 34, of the existing building and structures code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calstate.edu/cpdc/ae/review/documents/2003-2004.pdf|accessdate=8/3/2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, [[Nielsen Pool House|Nielsen's own home]] in Riverside, California has been named a City of Riverside City of Riverside Landmark (City of Riverside Landmark #134). The unique home, fully designed and constructed by Nielsen himself, was completed in 1966 and is considered to be quintessentially representative of Mid Century Modern Architecture. Built on to a slope overlooking a lake on the 12th hole of the Victoria Country Club Golf Course, the home features large concrete columns, some as high as 20 feet, which support the home above the slope. However, the most notable feature of the home is its design, in which it is built entirely around an indoor swimming pool. The swimming pool room is over 2,000 square feet and features 20' tall ceilings and a retractable roof that opens to the sky.&lt;ref name="meeting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting of Cultural Heritage Board on 7/20/2016|url=https://riversideca.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=496574&amp;GUID=94075157-2898-4C06-BF96-20D22CFC9DD1&amp;Options=info&amp;Search=|website=City of Riverside|date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5191">In [[engineering]], '''technical peer review''' is a type of engineering review. Technical peer reviews are a well defined review process for finding and fixing defects, conducted by a team of peers with assigned roles. Technical peer reviews are carried out by peers representing areas of life cycle affected by material being reviewed (usually limited to 6 or fewer people). Technical peer reviews are held within development phases, between milestone reviews, on completed products or completed portions of products.&lt;ref name = "NASA-6105"&gt;{{cite book| title=NASA Systems Engineering Handbook| id=SP-610S | year=2007|publisher=[[NASA]]|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080008301_2008008500.pdf}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

A technical peer review may also be called a ''engineering peer review'', a ''product peer review'', a ''peer review/inspection'' or an ''inspection.''

== Overview ==
The purpose of technical peer reviews is to remove defects as early as possible in the development process. By removing defects at their origin (e.g., requirements and design documents, test plans and procedures, software code, etc.), technical peer reviews prevent defects from propagating through multiple phases and work products, and reduce the overall amount of rework necessary on projects.

In addition, improved team efficiency is a side effect of technical peer reviews (e.g., by improving team communication, integrating the viewpoints of various engineering specialty disciplines, more quickly bringing new members up to speed, and educating project members about effective development practices).

In [[CMMI]], peer reviews are used as a principal means of verification in the Verification process area and as an objective evaluation method in the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area. The results of technical peer reviews can be reported at milestone reviews. (See [[Milestone (project management)]].)

==Roles of participants==
;Moderator
Responsible for conducting the technical peer review process and collecting inspection data. Plays key role in all stages of the technical peer review process except rework. Required to perform several duties during a technical peer review in addition to inspector’s tasks.

;Inspectors
Responsible for finding defects in work product from a general point of view, as well as defects that affect their area of expertise.

;Author
Provides information about work product during all stages of process. Responsible for correcting all major defects and any minor and trivial defects that cost and schedule permit. Performs duties of an inspector.

;Reader
Guides team through work product during the technical peer review meeting. Reads or paraphrases work product in
detail. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to reader’s role.

;Recorder
Accurately records each defect found during inspection meeting on the Inspection Defect List. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to recorder’s role.

== Vested interest of reviewers ==
There are two philosophies about the vested interest of the inspectors in the product under review. On one hand, project personnel who have a vested interest in the work product under review have the most knowledge of the product and are motivated to find and fix defects. On the other hand, personnel from outside the project
who do not have a vested interest in the work product bring objectivity and a fresh viewpoint to the technical peer review team. 

Each inspector is invited to disclose vested interests to the rest of the technical peer review panel so the Moderator can exercise sound judgement in evaluating the inspector's inputs.

== Distinction from other types of technical review ==
Peer reviews are distinct from management reviews, which are conducted by management representatives rather than by colleagues, and for management and control purposes rather than for technical evaluation. They are also distinct from [[software audit review]]s, which are conducted by personnel external to the project, to evaluate compliance with specifications, standards, contractual agreements, or other criteria.

A [[software peer review]] is a type of technical peer review. The [[IEEE]] defines formal structures, roles, and processes for software peer reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[[IEEE]] Std. 1028-1997, "IEEE Standard for Software Reviews"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management involvement ==
Management representatives are typically not involved in the conduct of a peer review. This is especially true of line managers of the author or other participants in the review. A policy of encouraging management to stay out of peer reviews encourages the peer review team to concentrate on the product being reviewed and not on the people or personalities involved.

The '''Vancouver system''', also known as '''Vancouver reference style''' or the '''author–number system''', is a [[citation]] style that uses numbers within the text that refer to numbered entries in the reference list. It is popular in the [[physical sciences]] and is one of two referencing systems normally used in medicine, the other being the [[Harvard referencing|author–date, or "Harvard", system]].&lt;ref name="BMA"&gt;{{vcite web|title=Reference styles|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/library/library-guide/reference-styles|date=|accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Hundreds of [[scientific journals]] use author-number systems. They all follow the same essential logic (that is, numbered citations pointing to numbered list entries), although the trivial details of the output mask, such as [[punctuation]], [[letter case#Case styles|casing of titles]], and [[italic type|italic]], vary widely among them. They have existed for over a century; the names "Vancouver system" or "Vancouver style" have existed since 1978. The latest version of the latter is ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', per the ''References &gt; Style and Format'' section of the ICMJE Recommendations.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations&gt;{{Citation |author=ICMJE |title=Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals |url=http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broad sense, the Vancouver system refers to any author-number system regardless of the formatting details.  A narrower definition of the Vancouver system refers to a specific author-number format specified by the [[ICMJE Recommendations]] (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts, URM).  For example, the [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA reference style]] is Vancouver style in the broad sense because it is an author-number system that conforms to the URM, but not in the narrow sense because its formatting differs in some minor details from the NLM/PubMed style (such as what is italicized and whether the citation numbers are bracketed).

==History==
Author–number systems have existed for over a century and throughout that time have been one of the main types of [[citation]] style in [[scientific journal]]s (the other being [[parenthetical referencing|author–date]]). In 1978, a committee of editors from various [[medical journal]]s, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), met in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC, Canada]] to agree to a unified set of requirements for the articles of such journals. This meeting led to the establishment of the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] (URMs). Part of the URMs is the reference style, for which the ICMJE selected the long-established author–number principle.

The URMs were developed 15 years before the [[World Wide Web]] debuted. During those years, they were published as articles or supplements in various ICMJE member journals. These included the 1991 BMJ publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=2001512 |pmc=1669007 |year=1991 |month=Feb |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=302 |issue=6772 |pages=338–341 |issn=0959-8138 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |doi=10.1136/bmj.302.6772.338}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1995 ''[[CMAJ]]'' publication&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=7728695 |pmc=1337910 |year=1995 |month=May |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals.  | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=152 |issue=9 |pages=1459–1473 |issn=0820-3946 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1997 ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=8992922 |year=1997 |month=Jan |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. |author=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=36–47 |issn=0003-4819 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8992922 |format=Free full text |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-126-1-199701010-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s and early 2000s, journals were asked to cite the 1997 ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' version&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=9062335 |year=1997 |month=Mar |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=277 |issue=11 |pages=927–934 |issn=0098-7484 |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association |doi=10.1001/jama.277.11.927}}&lt;/ref&gt; when reprinting the ''Uniform requirements''.

In the early 2000s, with the Web having become a major force in academic life, the idea gradually took hold that the logical home for the latest edition of the URMs would be the [http://www.icmje.org/ ICMJE website] itself (as opposed to whichever journal article or supplement had most recently published an update). For example, as of 2004, the editors of ''[[Haematologica]]'' decided simply to invite their authors to visit www.icmje.org for the 2003 revision of the ''Uniform requirements''.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=15020262 |year=2004 |month=Mar |author=International Committee Of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) |title=Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: writing and editing for biomedical publication |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=264 |issn=0390-6078 |journal=Haematologica |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15020262 |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early to mid-2000s, the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (which runs [[MEDLINE]] and [[PubMed]]) has hosted the ICMJE's "Sample References" pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html |author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors | title = Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Sample References | accessdate = 2006-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2007, the NLM created ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', its [[style guide]] for citation style, as a new home for the style's details. The ICMJE Recommendations now point to ''[[Citing Medicine]]'' as the home for the formatting details of Vancouver style.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt; For example, in the December 2013 edition of the ICMJE Recommendations, the relevant paragraph is IV.A.3.g.ii. (''References &gt; Style and Format'').&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt;

==Sample usage==

===Labelling citations===
References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text – they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] in [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]''' (1)''', [[square brackets]]''' [1]''', [[superscript]]'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''', or a combination'''&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The number usually appears at the end of the material it supports, and an entry in the reference list would give full bibliographical information for the source:

{{quote|Blood loss and the number of patients requiring post-operative blood transfusions were significantly greater, but operation and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter, for the DHS versus the PFNA group&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

And the entry in the reference list would be: 1. {{cite journal|vauthors=Xu YZ, Geng DC, Mao HQ, Zhu XS, Yang HL|title=A comparison of the proximal femoral nail antirotation device and dynamic hip screw in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fracture.|pmid=20925999|journal=J Int Med Res|date=2010|volume=38|pages=1266–1275}}

===Placing citations===
Several descriptions of the Vancouver system say that the number can be placed ''outside'' the text punctuation to avoid disruption to the flow of the text, ''or'' be placed ''inside'' the text punctuation, and that there are different cultures in different traditions.&lt;ref name="url_Leicester"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www2.le.ac.uk/library/help/citing/vancouver-numbered-system | title = Vancouver (Numbered) System | publisher = University of Leicester  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlmedind.nic.in"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://medind.nic.in/jbc/t04/i1/jbct04i1p21.pdf | title = Reference systems deciphered for you | publisher = Department of Forensic Medicine, Govt. Medical College, Patiala }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first method is recommended by some universities and colleges,&lt;ref name="urllibrary.vcc.ca"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | title = Vancouver Citation Style | publisher = Vancouver Community College | quote = The citation in brackets is placed after any commas and periods, and before any colons and semi-colons | accessdate = 2015-01-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209043418/http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | archivedate = 2015-02-09 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter method is required by scientific publications such as the [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA]]&lt;ref name="urlMLA Citation Style | Cornell University Library"&gt;{{vcite web | url = https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation/mla | title = MLA Citation Style | publisher =  Cornell University Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IEEE]]&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt; except for in the end of a block quotation. (IEEE are using Vancouver style labels within brackets, for example [1] to cite the first reference in the list, but otherwise refer to [[Chicago Style Manual]].)&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | title = IEEE Citation Reference | format =  | work = IEEE | quote = References ... appear on the line, in square brackets, inside the punctuation. | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110408195511/http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | archivedate = 2011-04-08 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Vancouver system documents (the [[ICMJE recommendations]] and Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals) do not discuss placement of the citation mark.

===Format of citations===
Different formats exist for different types of sources, e.g. books, journal articles etc. Author names are abbreviated to at most two initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/ |title=Citing Medicine: The NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors, and Publishers [Internet] | edition=2nd | first = K | last = Patrias | editor-first  = D | editor-last = Wendling |location=Bethesda, MD | publisher = National Library of Medicine (US) | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2012-02-22 | quote = Convert given (first) names and middle names to initials, for a maximum of two initials following each surname | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Citing Medicine'' does not explicitly mandate merging initials (e.g. "R. K." would be merged into "RK"), the examples used throughout the book do.

====Journal articles====

=====Standard journal articles=====
* Leurs R, Church MK, Taglialatela M. H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-antihistamines: inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects. Clin Exp Allergy. 2002 Apr;32(4):489-498.
* Tashiro J, Yamaguchi S, Ishii T, Suzuki A, Kondo H, Morita Y, Hara K, Koyama I. Inferior oncological prognosis of surgery without oral chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer in clinical settings. World J Surg Oncol. 2014 May 10;12(1):145. [Epub ahead of print]

As an option, if a journal carries continuous pagination throughout a volume (as many medical journals do), the month and issue number may be omitted.

* Thomas MC. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs – the triple whammy. Med J Aust. 2000;172:184-185.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] lists all authors for all articles, because it is appropriate for capturing all authors and all of their publications in the MEDLINE database to be found by searches. However, in the reference lists of articles, most journals truncate the list after 3 or 6 names, followed by "[[et al.]]" (which most medical journals do not italicize):

* Guilbert TW, Morgan WJ, Zeiger RS, Mauger DT, Boehmer SJ, Szefler SJ, et al. Long-term inhaled corticosteroids in preschool children at high risk for asthma. N Engl J Med. 2006 May 11;354(19):1985-1997.

Optionally, a unique identifier (such as the article's [[digital object identifier|DOI]] or [[PubMed#PubMed identifier|PMID]]) may be added to the citation:

* von Itzstein M, Wu WY, Kok GB, Pegg MS, Dyason JC, Jin B, et al. Rational design of potent sialidase-based inhibitors of influenza virus replication. Nature. 1993 Jun 3;363(6428):418-423. {{PMID|8502295}}.

NLM elides ending page numbers and uses a hyphen as the range indicating character (184-5). Some journals do likewise, whereas others expand the ending page numbers in full (184-185), use an en dash instead of a hyphen (184–5), or both (184–185).

Virtually all medical journal articles are published online. Many are published online only, and many others are published online ahead of print. For the date of online publication, at the end of the citation NLM puts "[Epub Year Mon Day]" (for online-only publication) or "[Epub ahead of print]" for online ahead of print (with the month and day following the year in its normal position). In contrast, [[AMA style]] puts "[published online Month Day, Year]" at the end of the article title. It no longer uses the term "Epub" and no longer includes the words "ahead of print". It omits the year from its normal location after the journal title abbreviation if there is no print data to give (online-only publication).

The titles of journals are abbreviated. There are no periods in the abbreviation. A period comes after the abbreviation, delimiting it from the next field. The abbreviations are standardized. The standardization was formerly incomplete and internal to organizations such as NLM. It is now formalized at the [[supraorganization]]al level by documents including [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7251/ ''Citing Medicine'' at Appendix A: Abbreviations for Commonly Used English Words in Journal Titles], [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Z39.5, [[ISO 4|ISO 4: Information and documentation -- Rules for the abbreviation of title words and titles of publications]], and the [http://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-the-ltwa/ ISSN.org List of Title Word Abbreviations (LTWA)].

=====Articles not in English=====
As per journal articles in English:

* Forneau E, Bovet D. Recherches sur l'action sympathicolytique d'un nouveau dérivé du dioxane. Arch Int Pharmacodyn. 1933;46:178-191. French.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] adds an English translation of the title enclosed in square brackets right after the title. The language is specified in full after the location (pagination), followed by a period.&lt;!-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/box/A33262/?report=objectonly --&gt;
