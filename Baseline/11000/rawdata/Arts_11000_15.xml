In [[geometry]] of the Euclidean plane, the '''3-4-6-12 tiling''' is one of 20 [[2-uniform tiling]]s of the [[Euclidean plane]] [[Tiling by regular polygons|by regular polygons]], containing regular [[triangle]]s, [[square]]s, [[hexagon]]s and [[dodecagon]]s, arranged in two [[vertex configuration]]: 3.4.6.4 and 4.6.12.&lt;ref&gt;Critchlow, pp. 62–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grünbaum and Shephard 1986, pp. 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/papers/Demiregular.pdf In Search of Demiregular Tilings] #4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chavey (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has [[hexagonal tiling|hexagonal]] [[List of planar symmetry groups#Wallpaper groups|symmetry]], p6m, [6,3], (*632). It is also called a [[demiregular tiling]] by some authors.

== Geometry==
Its two [[vertex configuration]]s are shared with two 1-uniform tilings:
{| class=wikitable
![[rhombitrihexagonal tiling]]
![[truncated trihexagonal tiling]]
|- align=center
|[[File:1-uniform_n6.svg|160px]]&lt;BR&gt;3.4.6.4
|[[File:1-uniform_n3.svg|160px]]&lt;BR&gt;4.6.12
|}

It can be seen as a type of [[Diminishment (geometry)|diminished]] [[rhombitrihexagonal tiling]], with dodecagons replacing periodic sets of hexagons and surrounding squares and triangles. This is similar to the [[Johnson solid]], a [[diminished rhombicosidodecahedron]], which is a [[rhombicosidodecahedron]] with faces removed, leading to new decagonal faces.

== Related ''k''-uniform tilings of regular polygons==
The hexagons can be dissected into 6 triangles, and the dodecagons can be dissected into triangles, hexagons and squares.

|}

=== Dual tiling===
The dual tiling has [[right triangle]] and [[Kite (geometry)|kite]] faces, defined by [[face configuration]]s: V3.4.6.4 and V4.6.12, and can be seen combining the [[deltoidal trihexagonal tiling]] and [[kisrhombille tiling]]s.

An '''[[art]] exhibition''' is traditionally the space in which [[art objects]] (in the most general sense) meet an [[audience]].  The exhibit is universally understood to be for some temporary period unless, as is rarely true, it is stated to be a "permanent exhibition".  In [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]], they may be called "exhibit", "exposition" (the French word) or "show".  In UK English, they are always called "exhibitions" or "shows", and an individual item in the show is an "exhibit".

Such expositions may present [[picture]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[Video art|video]], [[Sound art|sound]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[Performance art|performance]], [[interactive art]], [[new media art]] or [[sculpture]]s by individual artists, groups of artists or collections of a specific form of art.

The art works may be presented in [[museum]]s, art halls, art clubs or private [[art gallery|art galleries]], or at some place the principal business of which is not the display or sale of art, such as a [[coffeehouse]]. An important distinction is noted between those exhibits where some or all of the works are for sale, normally in private art galleries, and those where they are not.  Sometimes the event is organized on a specific occasion, like a birthday, anniversary or commemoration.

==Types of exhibitions==
[[Image:Empty exhibit space.jpg|thumb|left|Exhibition space being readied for a show at the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]]]]

There are different kinds of art exhibitions, in particular there is a distinction between commercial and non-commercial exhibitions. A commercial [[exhibition]] or [[trade fair]] is often referred to as an '''art fair''' that shows the work of artists or art dealers where participants generally have to pay a fee. A [[vanity gallery]] is an exhibition space of works in a gallery that charges the artist for use of the space.  Temporary museum exhibitions typically display items from the museum's own collection on a particular period, theme or topic, supplemented by loans from other collections, mostly those of other museums.  They normally include no items for sale; they are distinguished from the museum's permanent displays, and most large museums set aside a space for temporary exhibitions. 

Exhibitions in commercial galleries are often entirely made up of items that are for sale, but may be supplemented by other items that are not.  Typically, the visitor has to pay (extra on top of the basic museum entrance cost) to enter a museum exhibition, but not a commercial one in a gallery. [[Retrospective]]s look back over the work of a single artist; other common types are [[solo show (art exhibition)|individual expositions or "solo shows"]], group expositions ([[group show|collective exhibitions or "group shows"]]), or expositions on a specific theme or topic ("[[survey show]]s"). The [[Biennale]] is a large exhibition held every two years, often intending to gather together the best of international art; there are now many of these. A [[travelling exhibition]] is another category of art exhibition.

Exhibitions of new or recent art can be juried, invitational, or open.  
* A [[juried (competition)|juried]] exhibition, such as the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in London, or the [[Iowa Biennial]], has an individual (or group) acting as judge of the submitted artworks, selecting which are to be shown. If prizes are to be awarded, the judge or panel of judges will usually select the prizewinners as well.
* In an invitational exhibition, such as the [[Whitney Biennial]], the organizer of the show asks certain artists to supply artworks and exhibits them.
* An open or "non-juried" exhibition, such as the [[Kyoto Triennial]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kiwa.net/ Kyoto Triennial]&lt;/ref&gt; allows anybody to enter artworks and shows them all.  A type of exhibition that is usually non-juried is a [[mail art]] exhibition.

[[File:Sloan cubism.jpg|thumb|"A Slight Attack of Third Dimentia Brought on by Excessive Study of the Much Talked of Cubist Pictures in the International Exhibition at New York," drawn by [[John French Sloan]] in April 1913, satirizing the [[Armory Show]].]]

The art exhibition has played a crucial part in the market for new art since the 18th and 19th centuries.  The [[Paris Salon]], open to the public from 1737, rapidly became the key factor in determining the reputation, and so the price, of the French artists of the day. The [[Royal Academy]] in London, beginning in 1769, soon established a similar grip on the market, and in both countries artists put great efforts into making pictures that would be a success, often changing the direction of their style to meet popular or critical taste.  The [[British Institution]] was added to the London scene in 1805, holding two annual exhibitions, one of new British art for sale, and one of loans from the collections of its aristocratic patrons.  These exhibitions received lengthy and detailed reviews in the press, which were the main vehicle for the [[art criticism]] of the day.  Critics as distinguished as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[John Ruskin]] held their readers attention by sharply divergent reviews of different works, praising some extravagantly and giving others the most savage put-downs they could think of.  Many of the works were already sold, but success at these exhibitions was a crucial way for an artist to attract more commissions.  Among important early one-off loan exhibitions of older paintings were the [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857]], and the [[Exhibition of National Portraits]] in London, at what is now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], held in three stages in 1866-68.

As the [[academic art]] promoted by the Paris Salon, always more rigid than London, was felt to be stifling French art, alternative exhibitions, now generally known as the [[Salon des Refusés]] ("Salon of the Refused") were held, most famously in 1863, when the government allowed them an annex to the main exhibition for a show that included [[Édouard Manet]]'s [[The Luncheon on the Grass|''Luncheon on the Grass'' ''(Le déjeuner sur l’herbe)'']] and [[James McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler's]] [[:Image:Whistler.white.393pix.jpg|''Girl in White'']].  This began a period where exhibitions, often one-off shows, were crucial in exposing the public to new developments in art, and eventually [[Modern art]].  Important shows of this type were the [[Armory Show]] in New York City in 1913 and the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] in 1936.

Museums started holding large loan exhibitions of historic art in the late 19th century, as also did the Royal Academy, but the modern "blockbuster" museum exhibition, with long queues and a large illustrated catalogue, is generally agreed to have been introduced by the [[exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun]] held in several cities in the 1970s. Many exhibitions, especially in the days before good photographs were available, are important in stimulating research in [[art history]]; the [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|exhibition held in Bruges in 1902]] (poster illustrated below) had a crucial impact on the study of [[Early Netherlandish painting]].

In 1968 Art fairs in Europe became quite the fashion with the advent of the Cologne Art Fair which was sponsored by the Cologne Art Dealers Association. Because of the high admission standards of the Cologne fair a rival fair was organized in Düsseldorf which enabled less regarded galleries opportunity to meet with an international public. The fairs took place during the fall months. This rivalry continued for a few years which provided the Basel Art Fair the opportunity to interject the Basel fair in early summer. These fairs became extremely important to galleries, dealers and publishers as they provided the possibility of worldwide distribution. Düsseldorf and Cologne merged their efforts. Basel soon became the most important art fair.

In 1976, the Felluss Gallery under the direction of Elias Felluss, in Washington DC organized the first American dealer art fair. "The Washington International Art Fair" or "Wash Art" for brevity. This American fair met with fierce opposition by those galleries interested in maintaining distribution channels for European artwork already in place. The Washington fair introduced the European idea of dealer fairs to art dealers throughout the United States. Following the advent of Wash Art, many fairs developed throughout the United States.

==Preservation issues==
{{main| Preservation (library and archival science)}}

Although preservation issues are often disregarded in favor of other priorities during the exhibition process, they should certainly be considered so that possible damage to the [[Collection (museum)|collection]] is minimized or limited. As all objects in the library exhibition are unique and to some extent vulnerable, it is essential that they be displayed with care. Not all materials are able withstand the hardships of display, and therefore each piece needs to be assessed carefully to determine its ability to withstand the rigors of an exhibition. In particular, when exhibited items are [[archive|archival artifacts]] or paper-based objects, preservation considerations need be emphasized because damage and change in such materials is cumulative and irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Todd Glaser, "Protecting Paper and Book Collections During Exhibition," Northeast Document Conservation Center, [http://www.nedcc.org/plam3/tleaf25.htm NEDCC.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828202915/http://www.nedcc.org/plam3/tleaf25.htm |date=August 28, 2008 }}, (accessed August 9, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Two trusted sources – the National Information Standard Organization's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niso.org/home NISO.org]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Environmental Conditions for Exhibiting Library and Archival Materials,'' and the [[British Library|British Library's]] ''Guidance for Exhibiting Library and Archive Materials'' – have established indispensable criteria to help curtail the deleterious effects of exhibitions on library and archival materials. These criteria may be divided into five main preservation categories: Environmental concerns of the exhibition space; Length of the exhibition; Individual cases; Display methods used on individual objects; and Security.

===Environmental concerns of the exhibition space===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The main concerns of exhibition environments include [[List of light sources|light]], [[relative humidity]], and [[temperature]].

;Light
[[File:Vaade näituselt "Muutuv Tartu neljas vaates" Tartu Kunstimuuseumis.jpg|thumb|Light is used to draw attention to the exhibits. Interior of [[Tartu Art Museum]] with the exhibition "Changing Tartu in Four Views".]]
Light [[wavelength]], [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], and duration contribute collectively to the rate of material degradation in exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;National Preservation Office, ''Guidance for Exhibiting Library and Archive Materials'', Preservation Management Series (London: British Library, 2000), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of visible light in the display space should be low enough to avoid object deterioration, but bright enough for viewing. A patron’s tolerance of low level [[illumination (lighting)|illumination]] can be aided by reducing ambient light levels to a level lower than that falling on the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;National Preservation Office, ''Guidance for Exhibiting Library and Archive Materials'', Preservation Management Series (London: British Library, 2000), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Visible light levels should be maintained at between 50 [[lux]] and 100 lux depending on the light sensitivity of objects.&lt;ref&gt;National Information Standards Organization, ''Environmental Conditions for Exhibiting Library and Archival Materials'' (Bethesda, MD: NISO Press., 2001), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; An items level of toleration will depend on the [[ink]]s or [[pigment]]s being exposed and the duration of the exhibition time. A maximum exhibition length should initially be determined for each exhibited item based on its light sensitivity, anticipated light level, and its cumulative past and projected exhibition exposure.

Light levels need to be measured when the exhibition is prepared. [[ultraviolet|UV]] light meters will check radiation levels in an exhibit space, and data event loggers help determine visible light levels over an extended period of time. Blue wool standards cards can also be utilized to predict the extent to which materials will be damaged during exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Thompson, ''The Museum Environment'', 2nd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1986), 183.&lt;/ref&gt; UV [[radiation]] must be eliminated to the extent it is physically possible; it is recommended that light with a wavelength below 400 [[nanometre|nm]] (ultraviolet radiation) be limited to no more than 75 [[watt|microwatts]] per [[lumen (unit)|lumen]] at 10 to 100 lux.&lt;ref&gt;NISO, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, exposure to [[sunlight|natural light]] is undesirable because of its intensity and high UV content. When such exposure is unavoidable, preventative measures must be taken to control UV radiation, including the use of blinds, shades, curtains, [[UV filter]]ing films, and UV-filtering panels in windows or cases. [[List of light sources|Artificial light]] sources are safer options for exhibition. Among these sources, [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent lamps]] are most suitable because they emit little or no UV radiation.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Adcock, ''IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material'' (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fluorescent lamp]]s, common in most institutions, may be used only when they produce a low UV output and when covered with plastic sleeves before exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Adcock, ''IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material'' (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though [[Incandescent light bulb#Halogen lamps|tungsten-halogen lamps]] are currently a favorite artificial lighting source, they still give off significant amounts of UV radiation; use these only with special UV filters and dimmers.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Adcock, ''IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material'' (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lights should be lowered or turned off completely when visitors are not in the exhibition space.

;Relative humidity (RH)
The exhibition space's relative humidity (RH) should be set to a value between 35% and 50%.&lt;ref&gt;NISO, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum acceptable variation should be 5% on either side of this range. Seasonal changes of 5% are also allowed. The control of relative humidity is especially critical for [[vellum]] and [[parchment]] materials, which are extremely sensitive to changes in relative humidity and may contract violently and unevenly if displayed in too dry an environment.

;Temperature
For preservation purposes, cooler temperatures are always recommended. The temperature of the display space should not exceed 72&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Adcock, ''IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material'' (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A lower temperature of down to 50&amp;nbsp;°F can be considered safe for a majority of objects. The maximum acceptable variation in this range is 5&amp;nbsp;°F, meaning that the temperature should not go above 77&amp;nbsp;°F and below 45&amp;nbsp;°F. As temperature and relative humidity are interdependent, temperature should be reasonably constant so that relative humidity can be maintained as well. Controlling the environment with 24-hour air conditioning and dehumidification is the most effective way of protecting an exhibition from serious fluctuations.

===Length of the exhibition===
[[File:AM. Lynen.jpg|thumb|Poster, Bruges, 1902]]
One factor that influences how well materials will fare in an exhibition is the length of the show. The longer an item is exposed to harmful environmental conditions, the more likely that it will experience deterioration. Many museums and libraries have [[permanent exhibition]]s, and installed exhibitions have the potential to be on the view without any changes for years.

Damage from a long exhibition is usually caused by light. The degree of deterioration is different for each respective object. For paper-based items, the suggested maximum length of time that they should be on display is three months per year, or 42 [[lux|kilolux]] hours of light per year – whichever comes first.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Adcock, ''IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material'' (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition log report, including records of the length of the exhibition time and the light level of the display, may prevent objects from being exhibited too frequently. Displayed items need to be inspected regularly for evidence of damage or change.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Adcock, ''IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material'' (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended that high-quality facsimiles of especially delicate or fragile materials be displayed in lieu of originals for longer exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Nelly Balloffet, and Jenny Hille, ''Preservation and Conservation for Libraries and Archives'' (Chicago: ALA, 2005), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual cases===
Library or archival materials are usually displayed in [[display case]]s or [[Frame and panel|frames]]. Cases provide a physically and chemically secure environment. Vertical cases are acceptable for small or single-sheet items, and horizontal cases can be used for a variety of objects, including three-dimensional items such as opened or closed books, and flat paper items. All these objects can be arranged simultaneously in one horizontal case under a unified theme.

Materials used for case construction should be chosen carefully because component materials can easily become a significant source of [[air pollution#Pollutants|pollutants]] or harmful fumes for displayed objects. [[Outgassing]] from materials used in the construction of the exhibition case and/or fabrics used for lining the case can be destructive. Pollutants may cause visible deterioration, including discoloration of surfaces and [[corrosion]]. Examples of evaluative criteria to be used in deeming materials suitable for use in exhibit display could be the potential of contact-transfer of harmful substances, [[Solubility|water solubility]] or [[dye transfer|dry-transfer of dyes]], the dry-texture of paints, [[pH]], and [[abrasive]]ness.&lt;ref&gt;NISO, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

New cases may be preferred, constructed of safe materials such as metal, plexiglass, or some [[sealant|sealed]] woods.&lt;ref&gt;Nelly Balloffet, and Jenny Hille, ''Preservation and Conservation for Libraries and Archives'' (Chicago: ALA, 2005), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Separating certain materials from the display section of an exhibition case by lining relevant surfaces with an [[Permeation|impermeable]] barrier film will help protect items from damage. Any fabrics that line or decorate the case (e.g. polyester blend fabric), and any adhesives used in the process, should also be tested to determine any risk. Using internal [[pH buffer|buffer]]s and pollutant absorbers, such as [[silica gel]], [[activated carbon]], or [[zeolite]], is a good way to control [[relative humidity]] and pollutants. Buffers and absorbers should be placed out of sight, in the base or behind the backboard of a case. If the case is to be painted, it is recommended [[oil paint]]s be avoided; [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]] or [[Latex (polymer)|latex]] paint is preferable.

===Display methods===
[[File:Glazunov-exhibition2010Manezh1.JPG|thumb|right|A photography exhibition in Moscow, 2010]]
There are two kinds of objects displayed at the library and archival exhibition – bound materials and unbound materials. Bound materials include [[book]]s and [[pamphlet]]s, and unbound materials include [[manuscript]]s, cards, drawings, and other two-dimensional items. The observance of proper display conditions will help minimize any potential physical damage. All items displayed must be adequately supported and secured.

;Unbound materials
Unbound materials, usually single-sheet items, need to be attached securely to the mounts, unless matted or encapsulated. Metal fasteners, pins, screws, and thumbtacks should not come in direct contact with any exhibit items.&lt;ref&gt;Nelly Balloffet, and Jenny Hille, ''Preservation and Conservation for Libraries and Archives'' (Chicago: ALA, 2005), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, [[photo corners]], [[polyethylene]], or [[polyester]] film straps may hold the object to the support. Objects may also be encapsulated in polyester film, though old and untreated acidic papers should be professionally [[Mass deacidification|deacidified]] before encapsulation.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser, [http://www.nedcc.org/plam3/tleaf25.htm NEDCC.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828202915/http://www.nedcc.org/plam3/tleaf25.htm |date=August 28, 2008 }}, (accessed August 09, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Avoid potential slippage during encapsulation – when possible, use ultrasonic or heat seals. For objects that need to be hung (and that may require more protection than lightweight polyester film), matting would be an effective alternative.

Objects in frames should be separated from harmful materials through [[Mat (picture framing)|matting]], [[glazing (window)|glazing]], and backing layers. Matting, which consists of two pH-neutral or alkaline boards with a window cut in the top board to enable the object to be seen, can be used to support and enhance the display of single sheet or folded items. Backing layers of archival cardboard should be thick enough to protect objects. Moreover, any protective glazing used should never come in direct contact with objects.&lt;ref&gt;Gail E. Farr, ''Archives and Manuscripts: Exhibits'' (Chicago: Society of American Archivists, 1980), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Frames should be well-sealed and hung securely, allowing a space for air circulation between the frame and the wall.

;Bound materials
The most common way to display bound materials is closed and lying horizontally. If a volume is shown open, the object should be open only as much as its [[Bookbinding|binding]] allows. Common practice is to open volumes at an angle no greater than 135°.&lt;ref&gt;NISO, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are some types of equipment that help support volumes as they displayed openly: blocks or wedges, which hold a book cover to reduce stain at the book hinge; cradles, which support bound volumes as they lay open without stress to the binding structure; and polyester film strips, which help to secure open leaves. Textblock supports are best used in conjunction with book cradles where the textblock is greater than 1/2&amp;nbsp;inch, or where the textblock noticeably sags.&lt;ref&gt;NPO, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of its method of support, however, it is worth noting that any book that is kept open for long periods can cause damage. One should turn an exhibited book's pages every few days in order to protect pages from overexposure to light and spread any strain on the binding structure.

===Security===
Because exhibited items are often of special interest, they demand a high level of security to reduce the risk of loss from theft or vandalism. Exhibition cases should be securely locked. In addition, cases may be glazed with a material that hinders penetration and that when broken does not risk shards of glass falling on the exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;Nelly Balloffet, and Jenny Hille, ''Preservation and Conservation for Libraries and Archives'' (Chicago: ALA, 2005), 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever possible, the exhibition area should be patrolled; a 24-hour security presence is recommended when precious treasures are exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;Gail E. Farr, ''Archives and Manuscripts: Exhibits'' (Chicago: Society of American Archivists, 1980), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the exhibition is best protected when equipped with [[Burglar alarm|intruder alarms]], which can be fitted at entry points to the building and internal areas.

'''Artificial leather''' is a material intended to substitute for [[leather]] in fields such as [[upholstery]], clothing, footwear and [[fabrics]] and other uses where a leather-like finish is desired but the actual material is cost-prohibitive or unsuitable. Artificial leather is marketed under many names, including "leatherette", "faux leather", "vegan leather", "PU leather" and "pleather".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Shaeffer|title=Sew Any Fabric: A Quick Reference to Fabrics from A to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTadZIhgtUoC&amp;pg=PA37|date=10 November 2003|publisher=Krause Publications Craft|isbn=1-4402-2033-6|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Synthetic PU leather HC1.jpg|thumb|Steps to make synthetic [[polyurethane]] leather:&lt;br&gt; 1) The base fabric&lt;br&gt; 2) A polyurethane coating is applied&lt;br&gt; 3)A color coat is added&lt;br&gt; 4) A textured finish is added&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gofar.co.kr/eng/info/info_12_2.php|title=PU Synthetic Leather||website=Gofar Synthetic Co., Ltd  |accessdate=11 May 2005  |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511001137/http://www.gofar.co.kr/eng/info/info_12_2.php|archivedate=11 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many different methods for the manufacture of imitation leathers have been developed.

One of the earliest was ''[[Presstoff]]''. Invented in 19th century Germany, it is made of specially layered and treated paper pulp. It gained its widest use in Germany during the Second World War in place of leather, which under wartime conditions was rationed. ''Presstoff'' could be used in almost every application normally filled by leather, excepting items like footwear that were repeatedly subjected to flex wear or moisture. Under these conditions ''Presstoff'' tends to delaminate and lose cohesion.

''Poromerics'' are made from a plastic coating (usually a [[polyurethane]]) on a fibrous base layer (typically a [[polyester]]). The term poromeric was coined by [[DuPont]] as a derivative of the terms ''porous'' and ''polymeric''. The first poromeric material was DuPont's Corfam, introduced in 1963 at the Chicago Shoe Show. Corfam was the centerpiece of the DuPont pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] in New York City. After spending millions of dollars marketing the product to shoe manufacturers, DuPont withdrew Corfam from the market in 1971 and sold the rights to a company in [[Poland]].

''Leatherette'' is also made by covering a fabric base with a plastic. The fabric can be made of natural or synthetic fiber which is then covered with a soft [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] layer. Leatherette is used in [[bookbinding]] and was common on the casings of 20th century cameras.

Cork leather is a natural-fiber alternative made from the bark of [[cork oak]] trees that has been compressed, similar to ''Presstoff''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://goblackwood.co.uk/cork-leather/|title=Cork Leather – The Best Alternative to Animal Leather?|last=Oskar|first=Zieba|date=5 July 2017|work=Blackwood Blog|access-date=3 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803212739/https://goblackwood.co.uk/cork-leather/|archive-date=3 August 2017|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fermentation method of making [[collagen]], the main chemical in real leather, is under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/modern-meadow-and-evonik-are-brewing-leather-in-a-lab.html|title=This leather is made in a lab, not from livestock|last=Kolodny|first=Lora|date=2018-03-09|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clothing and fabric uses==
[[File:HM Queen Paola, Princess of Belgium.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Paola of Belgium]] wearing artificial leather]]
Artificial leathers are often used in clothing fabrics, furniture upholstery, and automotive uses.&lt;ref name=faux&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mitchellfauxleathers.com/Default/ViewPoint/Read/faux-leather-viewpoint/2014/04/07/what-is-faux-leather|title=What is Faux Leather?|first=Jim|last=Blesius|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One disadvantage of plastic-coated artificial leather is that it is not porous and does not allow air to pass through; thus, sweat can accumulate if it is used for clothing, car seat coverings, etc. One of its primary advantages, especially in cars, is that it requires little maintenance in comparison to leather, and does not crack or fade easily.&lt;ref name=faux/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8955">The '''As d'Or''' (''Golden Ace'') is a games award given out by a jury at the '''Festival International des Jeux''' in [[Cannes, France]].

The awards were established in 1988. From 1989 to 2003, a jury of journalists allotted "Golden Aces" by category to games presented by their editors.  A special prize, the ''Super As d'Or'', was allotted to the best game from any category.

In 2003, the process was modified to give more autonomy to the jury.  A single As d'Or was awarded, and 10 nominees were announced.

In 2005, the award merged with the [[Jeu de l'Année]].  It was decided that the combined award should be named after the year of awarding rather than year of publication, so the first combined award was the 2005 ''As d'Or Jeu de l'Année'' with awards in three categories: general public/family games, experts, and children. In 2012, the ''As d'Or Prix du Jury'' was added.

The '''Azelin chandelier''' ({{lang-de|Azelinleuchter}}) is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[wheel chandelier]], made in the 11th century for the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] in [[Hildesheim]], Germany, a UNESCO [[World Cultural Heritage]] site since 1985. It is the oldest of four extant wheel chandeliers from that period, along with the [[Hezilo chandelier]], also in Hildesheim, the [[Barbarossa chandelier]] in the [[Aachen Cathedral]], and the Hartwig chandelier in the [[Comburg|Abbey of Comburg]]. It was believed to be donated by [[list of bishops of Hildesheim|Bishop]] [[Azelin]], however his predecessor [[Thietmar of Hildesheim|Thietmar]] is more likely to be the patron. Therefore, the chandelier is also called the Thietmar chandelier (''Thietmarleuchter'').

== Description ==

[[File:Hildesheim Azelinleuchter Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail]]
A wheel chandelier is also called a ''{{lang|la|corona}}'' (crown) and circular chandelier.&lt;ref name="Crafts"&gt;Julia de Wolf Addison: [http://www.digilibraries.com/html_ebooks/102380/18212/www.digilibraries.com@18212@18212-h@18212-h-0.htm Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503014439/http://www.digilibraries.com/html_ebooks/102380/18212/www.digilibraries.com%4018212%4018212-h%4018212-h-0.htm |date=2014-05-03 }} Medieval Histories&lt;/ref&gt; Like the later and larger Hezilo chandelier, the Azelin chandelier is a circular hoop of gilt copper and [[tinning|tinplate]], decorated with twelve towers and twelve gatehouses. However, the decoration is much sparser, limited to a [[braid]]ed bar in the middle of the hoop and an [[openwork]] wreath of foliage on the upper edge of the hoop. The twelve gatehouses, to which the ropes holding the chandelier up are attached, are basically rectangular in shape with rounded arches and roofing. It is possible that they once held figures, but these would have had to have been very small and flat. The twelve towers are more elaborate, with a hexagonal groundplan. On the outside there are three niches closed with openwork doors, on the inside there is one niche flanked by two (alternately round or square) towers decorated with battlements and imitation brickwork. The spires of the towers extend above the top of the chandelier's hoop and are alternately round or hexagonal, with openwork windows in imitation of [[roof lantern]]s.

The Azelin chandelier has been repeatedly altered by additions, removals, and repairs over the centuries. The overall image of the [[New Jerusalem]], lit up and floating in the air, which all works of this type present, has been maintained. An important and meticulous restoration of the chandelier was carried out between 1982 and 1989, repairing damage of World War II.&lt;ref name="Niedersachsen" /&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Hildesheim St Antonius Inneres.jpg|thumb|The chandelier in the church of St. Antonius, 2008]]
The Azelin chandelier, named for its supposed donor, the bishop [[Azelin]] (1044–1054) is the predecessor of the Hezilo chandelier, which was probably commissioned by Azelin's successor [[Hezilo of Hildesheim|Hezilo]]. Perhaps the two wheel chandeliers were originally planned as a set, just as they then hung in the cathedral for centuries: the Hezilo chandelier in the nave, the Azelin chandelier (which is about half the size) in the [[choir (architecture)|choir]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallistl, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The chandeliers were created after the devastating fire of 1046, in which the cathedral of [[Altfrid]] and many nearby buildings in the [[Domhof, Hildesheim|Domhof]] were destroyed. Before this, a gold and silver wheel chandelier, gifted by [[Bernward of Hildesheim]] had hung in the nave. This earlier chandelier was definitely destroyed in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Elbern, ''Dom und Domschatz in Hildesheim'', Königstein 1979, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The chandelier was thought to have been commissioned by Bishop Azelin after this fire, but according to a lost document from the 16th century his predecessor [[Thietmar of Hildesheim]] was the patron.&lt;ref name="Niedersachsen"&gt;[http://www.welterbe-niedersachsen.de/content/der-thietmarleuchter-0 Der Thietmarleuchter] Weltkulturerbe in Niedersachsen. Retrieved 9 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear, in that case, how the chandelier survived the fire of 1046.

From 1960, when the cathedral and the adjacent buildings were rebuilt, the chandelier hung in the church of St. Antonius, adjacent to the [[cloisters]] of the cathedral. After the completion of extensive restorations of the cathedral, reopened on 15 August 2014, and the conversion of St. Antonius to a part of the Cathedral museum, the Azelin chandelier was returned to the cathedral and placed again above the altar in the crossing, while the Hezilo chandelier, which hung there before, was returned to its original location in the nave.&lt;ref name="Niedersachsen" /&gt;

'''''Babouk''''' is a political-themed novel by [[Guy Endore]], a fictionalized account of the [[Haitian Revolution]] told through the eyes of its titular slave. Though virtually unknown today, ''Babouk'' has gained some notoriety in academic circles through its attempted linking of the [[slave trade]] with [[capitalism]], and one professor has suggested that it would make a valuable addition to [[post-colonial]] literary discourse.  A committed leftist and opponent of racism, Endore spent many months in [[Haiti]] researching the story that would become ''Babouk'', and much of his findings make their way into the text, either in the form of epigraphs or explicitly noted in the text itself. ''Babouk'' is also notable for the digressions the [[narrator]] makes from the main narrative, to expound his political sympathies.

==Background==
Endore, a popular writer and staunch socialist, had in 1933 published his book ''[[The Werewolf of Paris]]'', which became a financial success. Hoping to profit on his newfound bankability, he was contracted by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] to write another novel that would be in the same mystery vein. Endore, who spoke French, decided to write a romance set against the backdrop of the [[Haitian Revolution]], and went to Haiti to conduct research on the [[slave trade]]. Horrified by what he learned, he became particularly interested in the story of a rebellious slave named [[Dutty Boukman]], who many consider to be the catalyst behind the Haitian slave rebellion. Endore created a fictionalized version named Babouk, but he also used his story to try to tell an anti-capitalist parable that borrowed much of its philosophy from [[Karl Marx]]. The resulting manuscript was dubbed by the publishing house of Simon and Schuster to be, "a powerful, moving piece of work. It won't sell because it's just too horrible." The book was not successful, and it languished in obscurity until it was chosen by the leftist journal [[Monthly Review]] to be published as part of its "Voices of Resistance" series. The republished novel included a foreword by writer [[Jamaica Kincaid]] and an afterword by historians David Barry Gaspar and [[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]]. It was published in 1991 by [[Monthly Review]] Press.&lt;ref name ="mrev"&gt;Good Reads,[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/322253.Babouk], "Babouk: Voices of resistance"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Babouk is a slave renowned by many tribes for his excellent storytelling abilities. He is captured by the French and taken to Saint Domingue to work on the sugar cane fields. Unaware of the reasons for his capture and hoping to be reunited with  his lost love Niati, Babouk escapes his slave compound and wanders into the forest, only to meet some [[indigenous Americans]]. He is soon captured by a group of runaway slaves who had agreed to turn in other runaways on the condition that they are allowed their freedom and returned to the compound, where his ear is cut off. Such a traumatic experience forces him to remain absolutely silent for several years, doing his labor without complaint but also without much energy. He eventually can maintain his silence no longer, and he re-establishes himself as a great storyteller. Unhappy with the way the slave masters treat him (although they claim otherwise), Babouk becomes the figurehead for a group of slaves that intend to revolt against their masters. Babouk and his group are initially successful in their endeavors, but are eventually held back by the combined might of the French and British military. Babouk's arm is severed after he tries to stop a cannon from firing by sticking his hand into it; he is then beheaded and his head is put on a pike as a warning to other slaves who might try to draw inspiration from Babouk. The novel ends with an impassioned statement from Endore that warns of the inevitability of a [[race war]] as the result of the white man's transgressions.

==Major themes==
''Babouk'' explicitly highlights the supposed relationship between the slave trade and capitalism. Endore often removes himself from the principal narrative involving Babouk in order to talk about certain historical accounts he researched for the book itself, and he liberally passes severe judgment over those who were either involved in the slave trade or, more controversially, those whom he supposed passively continued its existence by not questioning the capitalist system. Endore also makes the point of comparing racist practices of the eighteenth century with contemporary ones, and rejects the notion that men are treated equally in the United States, even if that is what the Constitution claims. ''Babouk'''s narrative voice is also heavily infused with irony, often taking the side of the slave masters or pro-slavery ideologues in an effort to further highlight what he sees as the absurdity of their position. He also openly mocks the production of what he believes to be useless objects to project status, such as jewelry.

==Critical reception==
The handful of critics who reviewed ''Babouk'' gave it lukewarm reviews at the time of its 1934 release, recoiling at its brazenness and unflattering portrayal of whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUjVbbwpNIwC|title=Remembering Scottsboro: The Legacy of an Infamous Trial|last=Miller|first=James A.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691140472|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; even from sources normally sympathetic to the anti-slavery part of his message. Generally, book critics agreed that Babouk's story had "epic possibilities" that did not reach fruition. The ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' wrote, "'Babouk' is a horrible and an unforgettable book, but it somehow misses being a great, tragic or memorable one."  ''[[The Nation]]'' declared that "The book is full...of interesting facts, observations, and descriptions. But...the denunciation of capitalism as slavery...is bad writing, almost fake poetry." Paul Allen authored the harshest review when he rejected the linkage of the voluntary exchange of capitalism and the forced labor of slavery, and wrote: "the heavy irony and the strident shrieking about the brotherhood of man culminating, on the last two pages of the book, in gibberish and exclamation points, practically ruins the book as either literature or propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;Book Review Digest. Bronx, New York: H.W. Wilson Co., 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in the [[NAACP]] house organ ''[[The Crisis]]'' lauded ''Babouk'', stating "Here is a book that should be in the bookcase of every Negro
family...speaking through Babouk, and seeing through the slaves' eyes, the author punctures all the cruelty, greed, pomp
and vainglory of whites with deadly rapier thrusts".&lt;ref&gt;''The Crisis'', December 1934. Quoted in

by Joseph G. Ramsey. ProQuest, 2007. {{ISBN|0-549-13005-5}}  (p.131).&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evaluations of the book have been more favorable, and have brought the once-obscure book to wider attention.  In 1991, it was reprinted with a foreword by renowned Caribbean-American author [[Jamaica Kincaid]], and has received scholarly treatment in anthologies and literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBUt35zw1NsC|title=A Companion to the Modern American Novel 1900 - 1950|last=Matthews|first=John T.|date=2013-03-25|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118661635|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qUjVbbwpNIwC|title=Remembering Scottsboro: The Legacy of an Infamous Trial|last=Miller|first=James A.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691140472|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/blogs/guy-endore-s-dialectical-werewolf|title=Guy Endore's dialectical werewolf - Le Monde diplomatique - English edition|website=mondediplo.com|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ancient Egypt]]ians regarded beauty as a sign of holiness. Everything the ancient Egyptians used had a spiritual aspect to it, including cosmetics. Traders traded makeup often, especially in the upper classes. In tombs, cosmetic palettes were found buried with the deceased as grave goods which further emphasized the idea that cosmetics were not only used for aesthetic purposes but rather [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] and [[religious]] purposes.

==Chemistry of ancient Egyptian cosmetics==

The two main forms of eye makeup were grepond eye paint and black [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]. The green eye paint was made of [[malachite]], a copper carbonate pigment, and the black kohl was made from [[galena]], a dark grey [[ore]]. Crushed charcoal was also used in this process. Mesdemet or Kohl was used for lining the eyes and were revealed to bring along potent health benefits in the form of protection from disease, bugs and sun rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makeupandbeautyguides.com/create-an-alluring-look-with-egyptian-eye-makeup-tricks/|title=Egyptian Eye Makeup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical uses of ancient Egyptian cosmetics ==

The ancient Egyptians were not entirely misguided in believing that kohl would prevent eye infections because it actually did help to prevent bacterial infections [http://www.revoptom.com/content/d/news_review/i/1018/c/19409/ ocular infection] associated with flood waters from the [[Nile]]. The lead-based substances in the kohl promoted the production of [[nitric oxide]] in their skin, which helped strengthen their [[immune systems]] against diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.revoptom.com/content/d/news_review/i/1018/c/19409/|title=How the Pharaohs Fought Ocular Infection|last=Staff|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[soot]] in kohl helped in reducing the damaging effects of sun glare on their eyes. The ancient Egyptians created a remedy for burns by mixing the cheek and lip stain and other remedies for improving skin with red natron, northern salt and [[honey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Luxuries|last=Manniche|first=Lise|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=134, 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Egyptians strongly believed that the healing effects of these cosmetics were magical rather than medical.

== Cosmetic palettes and jars ==

Cosmetics palettes were used to grind makeup. The earliest examples were rectangular in shape and date back to 5000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/s-OMbtkESJ6aV6_k6o86oA|title=BBC - A History of the World - Object : Cosmetic Palette|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palettes later adopted a rounder shape like the [http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/narmerspalette.htm Narmer palette]. [[Narmer Palette|King Narmer’s palette]] was the earliest piece of its kind. It has decorations of the King smiting the enemies of Egypt and the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, as well as a cavity for the grinding of cosmetics, making it a double purposed palette. These later developed into fish shaped palettes. They might have chosen the fish shape as the fish was a symbol of resurrection and new life. The fish shaped palettes were usually adorned with precious stones for royalty. These palettes have developed into [http://www.egyptianmyths.net/baboon.htm baboon shaped containers] to hold the kohl which held symbolic meanings for the ancient Egyptians.

== Use of cosmetics in different social classes  ==
The use of cosmetics in Egypt varied slightly between social classes, where more make-up was worn by higher class individuals as wealthier individuals could afford more cosmetics. Although there was no prominent difference between the make-up styles of the upper and lower class, noble women were known to pale their skin using creams and powders. This was due to pale skin being a sign of nobility as lighter skin meant less exposure to the sun whereas dark skin was associated with the lower class who tanned while taking part in menial labor such as working in the fields. Thus, paler skin represented the non-working noble class, as noble women would not work in the sun.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyembalmed.org/ancient-egyptian-makeup.htm|title=Ancient Egyptian Makeup|last=|first=|date=|website=historyembalmed.org|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2006">A '''book token''' is a type of gift [[voucher]] redeemable in hundreds of participating [[bookshop]]s as an alternative to [[cash]].

== History ==
The term "book token" was first coined in the 1920s by Harold Raymond, an English publisher who noticed that for Christmas his friends had received a collective total of only three books out of 119 total gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,,2210824,00.html |title=An appreciation of a token |date=2007-11-17|accessdate=2007-12-25 |last=Mangan |first=Lucy |coauthors= |publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that some sort of coupon could be used to take the risk out of book gift giving. Book tokens were officially distributed in 1932. They were sold that November, just in time for the holidays.  

In the 1990s, "lick and stick" stamps were replaced with tokens in voucher form, to resemble British currency.

== Current versions ==
=== UK ===
{{main|National Book Tokens}}
Book Tokens Ltd (part of the Booksellers Association Group of Companies) was established as the sole issuer of book tokens in the UK. They have now grown into one of the largest multi-retail gift cards in the UK and Ireland and were renamed "National Book Tokens" in 2000, the year the tokens were also sold online for the first time by firstbookshop.com. The seller of electronic book tokens promises the gift card will be able to be used at any time at all reputable book sellers with the exception of airports and some train stations. The cards do expire every two years but can be replaced for free. Gift givers can choose from different designs and receive promotions such as free books by Penguin when spending more than a certain amount.

=== Other countries ===

National book voucher schemes are also run in the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]].

'''Brutal Truth''' was an American [[grindcore]] band from [[Rochester, New York]], formed by ex-[[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Nuclear Assault]], and [[Stormtroopers of Death]] bass guitarist [[Dan Lilker]] in 1990. The group disbanded in 1999, but reformed in 2006 and continued to release music until 2014.

==History==
Brutal Truth was formed in 1990 in [New York City, New York]. The band was originally signed to [[Earache Records]], on which they released two albums, ''[[Extreme Conditions Demand Extreme Responses]]'' and ''[[Need to Control]]'', as well as an EP entitled ''[[Perpetual Conversion]]'', and 7" singles for the songs "Ill Neglect" and "Godplayer". During this time, music videos were made for the songs "Ill Neglect", "Collateral Damage" and "Godplayer". Brutal Truth were frustrated with Earache Records and switched to [[Relapse Records]], known for its roster of [[grindcore]] acts, with whom they stayed until the band's demise.

With Relapse, they released the mini album ''[[Kill Trend Suicide]]'', a full-length release entitled ''[[Sounds of the Animal Kingdom]]'' and a [[double CD]] [[live album]] called ''[[Goodbye Cruel World (Brutal Truth album)|Goodbye Cruel World]]''. The band has also released many split 7" singles on smaller labels, with most of these being out of print and difficult to find. The songs from these 7" singles were collected on the second disc of ''Goodbye Cruel World''.

In 2001, the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' awarded Brutal Truth the record for "shortest music video" for their video "Collateral Damage", which is 2.18 seconds long and consists of 48 still images in rapid succession followed by a clip of an explosion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

[[File:BrutalTruth by Christian Misje.jpg|thumb|left|Richard Hoak, Hole In The Sky 2008]]
Drummer Richard Hoak also provides vocals and drums for a project titled Total Fucking Destruction. [[Kevin Sharp (heavy metal)|Kevin Sharp]] released an album with [[Venomous Concept]] in 2004, a [[hardcore punk]] band featuring members from [[The Melvins]] and [[Napalm Death]]. He was also a member of Australian grind band [[Damaged (band)|Damaged]] for a little over a year in 1999. He is also currently involved with the Atlanta-based hardcore-metal, grindcore band, Primate, with guitarist Bill Kelliher from Mastodon.  Dan Lilker now plays for a host of bands and is currently bassist for the re-united [[Nuclear Assault]].

Brutal Truth re-formed in 2006 with three-quarters of the final lineup returning (Lilker, Hoak and Sharp); Erik Burke (of [[Lethargy (band)|Lethargy]]) replaced Brent McCarty on guitar.

On July 8, 2008, four new Brutal Truth tracks were released on the ''This Comp Kills Fascists'' compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/08/may/05Brutal_Truth_Return_To_Kills_Fascists.shtml|title=Brutal Truth Return To Kills Fascists - antiMUSIC News|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first new material from the band in almost ten years.

On January 21, 2009, it was announced that Brutal Truth had finished recording a new album, entitled ''[[Evolution Through Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRUTAL TRUTH Completes Work On New Album|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/brutal-truth-completes-work-on-new-album/|publisher=Blabbermouth.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on April 14 in North America, April 17 in Germany and on April 20 worldwide. The band have also made the entire album available via  [[Streaming media|streaming]] from their website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apeshit.org/news/brutal-truths-new-album-posted-for-streaming/&lt;/ref&gt; A video for "Sugardaddy/Branded" was released on July 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://revolverblips.dailyradar.com/story/brutal_truth_sugardaddy_video_released_july_17_2009/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719024341/http://revolverblips.dailyradar.com/story/brutal_truth_sugardaddy_video_released_july_17_2009/ |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2014, Lilker announced that he would be retiring from being a full-time recording and touring musician on October 18, 2014, which was his 50th birthday. As a result, Brutal Truth disbanded on this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRUTAL TRUTH/Ex-ANTHRAX Bassist DAN LILKER To 'Retire' From Being Full-Time Musician|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/brutal-truthex-anthrax-bassist-dan-lilker-to-retire-from-being-full-time-musician/|publisher=Blabbermouth.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Caravaggio to Canaletto" is the title of a temporary exhibition in the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Budapest]]. It's open from 26 October 2013 until 16 February 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homepage of the Caravaggio to Canaletto exhibition in Museum of Fine Arts|url=http://www.szepmuveszeti.hu/exhibitions/caravaggio-to-canaletto-1015|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 140 artworks by 100 masters from the Museum of Fine Arts, other collections from abroad and private collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2013/11/08/car%C2%ADavaggio-to-canaletto/ Caravaggio to Canaletto]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition provides a panoramic view of the era from the end of the 16th century until 1760 in Italy: it treats the effect of [[Caravaggio]] on the [[Italian Baroque|Italian Baroque painting]], and shows the way towards [[Roccoco]], [[Classicism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]. It presents the most popular genres from the Biblical themes through [[still life]]s to [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]]. It's composed of the following sections, generally in temporary order:

1. Face-to-face With Reality: Caravaggio's early paintings, and popular themes in [[Caravaggism]]

2. Divine Light - Diabolic Shadow: Biblical themes, life of [[Jesus]] and other saints, scenes from the [[Old Testament]]

3. Ideal and Norm: classicising ambitions by [[Guido Reni]] and his followers

4. Eloquence, Illusion, Splendour: monumental Baroque Biblical themes

5. Natura Morta - Natura Viva: new tendencies in still lifes and portraits - from [[trompe l'oeil]] to social portraiture

6. Poetry and Virtuosity in the Settecento: from the Classicism and Roccoco to "almost [[Biedermeier]]"

7. Swansong in Venice: from the most monumental religious paintings to the scenes of everyday life

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4724">== History ==
Chinese embroidery has a long history since the Neolithic age. Because of the quality of silk fibre, most Chinese fine embroideries are made in silk. Some ancient vestiges of silk production have been found in various Neolithic sites dating back 5,000–6,000 years in China.  Currently the earliest real sample of silk embroidery discovered in China is from a tomb in Mashan in Hubei province identified with the [[Zhanguo]] period (5th–3rd centuries BC). After the opening of [[Silk Route]] in the [[Han dynasty]], the silk production and trade flourished. In the 14th century, the Chinese silk embroidery production reached its high peak. Several major silk embroidery styles had been developed, like Song Jin (宋锦 Song embroidery) in Suzhou, Yun Jin (云锦 Cloud embroidery) in Nanjing and Shu Jin (蜀锦 Shu embroidery) in Sichuan.

Today, most handwork has been replaced by machinery, but some very sophisticated production is still hand-made. Modern Chinese silk embroidery still prevails in southern China.

== Genres ==

=== Major styles ===
[[Image:Shuzhou.manufaktura.jedwabny.haft.artystyczny.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Screen with Suzhou embroidery.]]
* '''Su Xiu''' (苏绣) – Suzhou embroidery is crafted in areas around [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]] Province, having a history dating back 2,000 years. It is famous for its beautiful patterns, elegant colours, variety of stitches, and consummate craftsmanship. Its stitching is meticulously skillful, coloration subtle and refined. Suzhou artists are able to use more than 40 needlework and a 1,000 different types of threads to make embroidery, typically with nature and environment themes such as flowers, birds, animals and even gardens on a piece of cloth.
**A rare subset is Su double-sided embroidery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suembroidery.com/articles/double_sided_embroidery.htm|title=Chinese double-sided embroidery introduction, two-faced embroidery or double sides embroidery|website=www.suembroidery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires ultimate skill and artistry. The front and back of the piece may have different designs, but the ends are not knotted but woven in so the back can't be distinguished.
* '''[[Xiang embroidery|Xiang Xiu]]''' (湘绣) – Hunan embroidery comes from areas around [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] Province. It is distinct for its starkly elegant black, white and gray colouration. Its emphasis is on contrasts of light and shade that highlight the pattern texture to give a three-dimensional effect. Xiang embroidery composition combines void and solid imagery, utilizing empty space in the same way as Chinese [[ink and wash painting]]s.
* '''[[Cantonese embroidery|Yue Xiu/Guang Xiu]]''' (粤绣/广秀) – Guangdong embroidery is crafted in [[Chaozhou]], [[Guangdong]] Province. It is composed of intricate but symmetrical patterns, vibrant colours, varied stitches and a defined weave. Its use of primary colors, light and shade are reminiscent of western paintings.
* '''Shu Xiu''' (蜀绣) – Sichuan embroidery comes from areas around [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]] Province. It is oldest known embroidery style in Chinese embroidery history. Its raw materials are satin and colored silk, its craftsmanship painstaking and refined. The emphasis is on even stitching, delicate coloration, and local flavor. Sichuan embroidery is used to decorate quilt covers, pillowcases, garments, shoes and painted screens.

=== Other styles ===
[[File:Gu embroidery.jpg|thumb|Gu embroidery being created.]]
* '''Gu Xiu''' (顾绣) – Gu embroidery is rather a family style than a local style originated from Gu Mingshi's family during the Ming Dynasty in Shanghai. Gu embroidery is also named Lu Xiang Yuan embroidery after the place where the Gu family lived. Gu embroidery is different from other styles as it specialized in painting and calligraphy. The inventor of Gu embroidery was a concubine of Gu Mingshi's first son, Gu Huihai. Later, Han Ximeng, the wife of the second grandson of Gu Mingshi developed the skill and was reputed as "Needle Saint" (针圣). Some of her masterpieces are kept in the Forbidden City. Today Gu embroidery has become a special local product in Shanghai.

=== Ethnic styles ===
Other Chinese ethnic groups, like [[Bai people|Bai]], [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] people also have their own style of embroidery, which usually depicts a mythical or religious topic.

The '''Classical Mandolin Society of America Inc.''', or CMSA, is a 501 (C)(3) not for profit corporation committed to promoting the playing and study of [[mandolin]] instruments in the [[United States]]. The organization was founded in 1986 by Norman Levine.

The organization works to promote knowledge and interest in the mandolin family of fretted instruments; ([[mandolin]], [[mandola]], [[mandocello]], [[mando-bass]]) and guitar, with a focus on Classical Mandolin.  It actively sponsors grants and scholarships for mandolin education and instruction for children and adults in North America. Currently, there are over 400 members worldwide.  The CMSA holds a Convention in a different city in North America each year.  Among other functions, the CMSA Convention hosts an '''En Masse Orchestra''', which for its brief existence each year, is the largest [[mandolin orchestra]] in the United States, and has historically included as many as 180  musicians. The CMSA serves as a source of information about how to find or create mandolin ensembles around the United States, Canada and the world.

The organization is staffed by unpaid volunteers and is structured with Officers of the corporation (President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer), and a Board of Directors, which currently has nine members. The CMSA membership votes on candidates to fill Officer and Board Member positions in accordance with its bylaws.

The CMSA publishes a quarterly newsletter, The Mandolin Journal, which contains legal notifications for the corporation and current organizational news, along with contributed articles and music. The organization also maintains an internet website that contains information on the organization and its activities, membership application forms and convention registration forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16684">The '''conservation and restoration of Ancient Greek pottery''' is a sub-section of the broader topic of [[conservation and restoration of ceramic objects]]. [[Ancient Greek pottery]] is one of the most commonly found types of artifacts from the ancient Greek world. The information learned from vase paintings forms the foundation of modern knowledge of ancient Greek art and culture. Most ancient Greek pottery is [[terracotta]], a type of earthenware [[ceramic]], dating from the 11th century BCE through the 1st century CE. The objects are usually excavated from archaeological sites in broken pieces, or shards, and then reassembled. Some have been discovered intact in tombs. Professional [[conservator-restorer]]s, often in collaboration with [[curators]] and [[conservation scientist]]s, undertake the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation-restoration]] of ancient Greek pottery.

== History of conservation and restoration approaches ==
=== Ancient ===
Ancient repairs were made to damaged pottery using metal pins or staples, which could be made of copper, lead, or bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal or vegetable based adhesives may have also been used. Fragments from other vessels were sometimes used to replace damaged or missing sections of an object.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/&lt;/ref&gt; The decorative elements on the replacement pieces may or may not have matched the rest of the vase.

[[File:Greek - Black-figure Kylix with Sirens - Walters 4837 - Side B.jpg|thumb|Greek - Black-figure Kylix with Sirens - Walters 4837 - Side B. Several small holes around the handles were used for repairs in antiquity.]]

=== 18th to early 20th century ===
Restoration methods used during the 18th through early 20th century generally attempted to restore vessels to a near pristine state and hide any evidence of past damage.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological discoveries and a surge in the popularity of ancient Greek art in the 18th and 19th centuries created a high demand for objects and artifacts. The customary restoration method started with reassembling vessel fragments. Missing fragments were replaced with new glazed and fired pieces of pottery and gaps were filled in with plaster. The surface was then painted, sometimes extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Materials used included [[shellac]], protein glues, oil paints, gypsum, plaster of Paris, barium sulphate, calcite, clay, kaolin, and waterglass (calcium silicate).&lt;ref&gt;Conservation Project: Greek Vases. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation/feature_greekvases&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, decorative imagery was censored and painted over, in order to appeal to the tastes of contemporary society and potential collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern ===
The modern approach to conservation generally involves using non-destructive methods to evaluate objects and restoration techniques which emphasize the difference between areas of modern repair and ancient craftsmanship. Reversible adhesives, paint, and other materials are used in restorations.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation departments at museums such as the Getty Villa approach conservation of ancient pottery with the goal to "visually integrate filled areas and make them less obtrusive while still distinguishing them from the original ceramic and preserving an object's history."&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==
Most ancient Greek pottery is terracotta, a type of earthenware fired clay ceramic. The composition of minerals, metal, organic and other inorganic materials in the clay varies depending on its source. These variations impact the color of the clay before and after firing. Iron is the most common material found in clay, and can add red, grey, or buff coloring to the object.&lt;ref&gt;Care of Ceramics and Glass - Canadian Conservation Institute  http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170205&lt;/ref&gt; Pottery can be course wares, which are undecorated or only minimally decorated utilitarian vessels, or fine wares, which are decorated, finely potted, and used for a variety of purposes, including ceremonial use. Vase paintings were primarily created using slip, a thin, transparent layer of clay which turned color after firing. Other materials used in vase paintings include added pigment, added clay to create a relief on the surface, or dilute gloss that added color after firing.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, John H. The Greek Vase: Art of the Storyteller (London: British Museum, 2013), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Unevenly applied gloss or misfiring also created variations in color or surface texture. Gilding was also sometimes added after firing.

== Agents of deterioration ==
Ceramics, and ancient ceramics in particular, can suffer a variety of types of damage. Most agents of deterioration are due to environment and are inherent to the materials, however the most common damage is caused by human action.

=== Physical damage ===
Breaks, losses, or abrasions can be caused by improper handling, impact (dropping), or excavation. Ceramics are strong in compression, but weak under tension, meaning they are fragile and susceptible to mechanical shock.&lt;ref&gt;Buys, Susan and Victoria Oakley, Conservation and Restoration of Ceramics (Routledge, 2014), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soluble salts ===
If a piece of pottery has been buried in salty or alkaline soil or submersed in seawater, the clay may have soaked up soluble salts, such as sulphite, nitrates, or chlorides. Changes in [[relative humidity]] can cause the salts to react and dissolve (in high humidity) or recrystallize (in low humidity).&lt;ref&gt;Care of Ceramics and Glass - Canadian Conservation Institute http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170205&lt;/ref&gt;  These reactions can cause pottery to suffer surface losses or delamination.&lt;ref&gt;Conservation Project: Greek Vases. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation/feature_greekvases&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Previous restorations ===
Previous restorations can cause unintended damage over time. Metal pins or staples can corrode and deteriorate. Plaster repairs may become unstable. In-painting may fade or discolor. Intentional over-painting from past conservation efforts is another form of damage. Scenes were sometimes altered in order to appeal to current tastes. A common example is a fig leaf being painted over a nude figure. Overly aggressive cleaning with acid can also cause damage. Acid cleaning is meant to remove insoluble salts and minerals from the surface of archaeological ceramics. Pottery that has been improperly cleaned and damaged by acid may have pitted, cracked, powdery, or flaking surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. "Long-term Effects of acid-cleaning on archaeological ceramics," Conserve-O-Gram (September 1999) https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/06-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventative conservation ==
Preventative conservation measures can help slow further deterioration or damage.

=== Handling ===
As with any fragile ceramic object, proper handling techniques will help prevent accidental damage. Objects should be handled as little as possible. When handling is necessary, objects should be held at their strongest points only. Pressure on the weakest points, such as handles, necks, or areas with existing damage, should be avoided. Objects should be handled with clean, dry hands, or with nitrile gloves. Cotton gloves are not recommended, because the fabric prevents a stable grip and threads can snag on rough surfaces. Objects on display in museums are secured with mounts or protected by cases to prevent unwanted or accidental contact. Vessels may be displayed upright or at an angle, depending on the decorative elements on display. Any mounts should keep the object stable without putting pressure on any fragile areas.

=== Environmental conditions ===
Despite being dried and fired, pottery clay is still a porous material which will react to changes in environmental conditions. Avoiding extreme changes in temperature can help maintain the condition of ancient Greek pottery. As discussed above in the section on damage from Soluble Salts, preventing extreme fluctuations in relative humidity can also help prevent further deterioration. Objects should be protected from water and dirt.

== Examination ==
The following techniques are used by conservators to evaluate the condition of ancient Greek pottery and determine appropriate treatment. Examination is the first step in the conservation process.

=== Visual inspection ===
Conservators begin the evaluation of an object with careful visual inspection to identify areas of weakness, loss, delamination, discoloration, or old repairs. Further examination with a low power microscope can help conservators identify materials and technical features, such as pigment, gilding, or added clay.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultraviolet (UV) visible fluorescence ===
When exposed to invisible [[UV light]], many types of materials will display certain colors of visible light. This can enable conservators to identify areas of different media throughout the object.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== X-radiography ===
X-rays can reveal breaks, internal features, or hidden ancient repairs, such as pins.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Another type of x-ray, called X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectroscopy can reveal the elemental and chemical composition of a material. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy can reveal the iron oxidation states in pottery (the factor that determines black and red color) and X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses can provide information on the molecular structure of iron minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Melissa. "Deciphering the Elements of Iconic Pottery," National Science Foundation (March 28, 2011) https://www.nsf.gov/mobile/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=119082&amp;org=NSF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation treatment ==
After evaluation is completed, conservator-restorers can determine the most appropriate form of treatment. Treatments can range from non-invasive techniques, such as cleaning, to more invasive conservation such as disassembly, reconstruction, and restoration.

[[File:Ancient Greek pottery from Cyclades, shard with painting, 7th c BC, AM Paros, 143923.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek pottery from Cyclades, shard with painting, 7th c BC, AM Paros, 143923]]

=== Cleaning ===
Basic mechanical cleaning can remove dirt, dust, and grime. Cleaning solvents and water can also be used to remove dirt, varnish, wax, in-painting, or adhesives. Acids should be used with caution. [[Desalination]] is a cleaning method that removes as much soluble salt from the porous fired clay as possible. Fragments are soaked in highly purified water for multiple days. The water is changed regularly until salt levels are reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Usui, Emiko and Julia Gaviria, Eds., Conservation and Care of Museum Collections (Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, 2011), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disassembly ===
For vessels that have been previously conserved and reassembled, shards may need to be disassembled in order to remove old restoration materials and complete conservation. Adhesives and fill are systematically removed, revealing the original pottery and allowing the vessel to be deconstructed.

=== Reconstruction and restoration ===
Separated shards are carefully reassembled. Conservators use identifying clues such as shape, texture, and decorative pattern or painted scenes to piece together fragments. Missing shards can be recreated out of plaster and replaced. In-painting is used to disguise areas of repair. In modern conservation treatment, the media used by conservators is reversible and can easily be distinguished from ancient material. Different conservators, or conservation departments, may have different policies regarding in-painting. Some conservators leave replacement fragments completely undecorated in order to easily distinguish them as modern additions. Some conservators paint silhouettes of missing figures, using existing fragments, scene narrative, and other extant vases as examples. This approach helps show the narrative of the painted scene, while still distinguishing the modern restoration from the original fragments. Some conservators use more extensive in-painting to recreate missing decoration.

== Notable examples ==
The Affecter Amphora, in the collection of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland, is a case study for the history of conservation of Greek vases. The black figured Attic (meaning from Athens region) vessel was created around 540 BCE by a well documented vase painter known as the [[Affecter|Affecter Painter]]. Treatment of the vase in the 1980s provided the conservation field with significant insight into the history of the restoration of Greek vases. Conservators discovered that the amphora had been broken and repaired in antiquity. Samples of burial dirt found within holes in the vase proved that the repairs were made prior to the vase being used in an ancient funeral. Conservators also discovered that the vase was restored in the late19th century with materials and methods typical of the time period. Plaster, replacement pieces of terracotta, and extensive overpainting had been used in the restoration. Overpainting disguised repairs and also altered the appearance of nude satyrs on the decorative panels. The 1980s conservation revealed the original work of the Affecter Painter and restored the vase to a stable condition.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986).

The [[Francois Vase]], in the collection of the National Archaeological Museum in Florence, Italy, is a large Attic volute krater, which is both a superb example of black-figure pottery from c. 570-560 BCE, as well as an example of extensive conservation work. The vase was discovered in a tomb in 1844. In the year 1900, a member of the museum staff smashed the display case and the vase shattered into over 600 pieces. It was restored by 1902, and then restored again in 1973, with previously missing pieces.

The '''Contemporary Art Society''' is an Australian organisation formed in 1938 to promote non-representative forms of art. It has autonomous branches in each State of the Commonwealth.

==Victoria==
The Contemporary Art Society was established on 13 July 1938, by [[George Bell (painter)|George Bell]], in protest at the perceived conservatism of the dominant Australian Academy of Art, with primary and paramount objectives being the fostering and promotion of contemporary art, to further the understanding of it, and to encourage and stimulate artists. George Bell was President from 1938 to 1940.

Its first exhibition was held in the National Gallery, Victoria, in June 1939, with work from all states. After disagreement over the direction of the Society, George Bell and 83 other members seceded in 1940, and [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]] was elected president. Membership of the Contemporary Art Society brought together some of Melbourne's young radical artists – [[Arthur Boyd]], [[John Perceval]], [[Harry de Hartog]], [[Albert Tucker (artist)|Albert Tucker]], [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Victor O'Connor |Vic O'Connor]], [[Yosl Bergner]] and [[Noel Counihan]]. In 1947, after personal and political differences, C.A.S. suspended activities.

John Reed revived C.A.S. in 1954, and in 1956 established the Gallery of Contemporary Art (later the Museum of Modern Art and Design of Australia), as the C.A.S. head office. In 1955 the annual subscription of ten shillings was increased to one pound. In 1956, [[Georges Mora]] was elected President. Artists donated paintings towards an inaugural fundraising exhibition in 1957, and the Victorian Government made available a grant. In 1960 [[Edwin Tanner]] was elected vice-president, 1961 [[David Boyd (artist)|David Boyd]] as president and John Perceval as vice-president. In 1963 C.A.S. rented premises at 9 Collins Street, Melbourne, then 1 Fitzroy St, St Kilda in 1967.

From 1967 to 1987, presidents elected were: 1967 – [[Robert Grieve#Family|Robert Grieve]], 1972 – [[Heather Johnson]], 1975 – [[Joan Gough]], 1980 – [[Sue McDougall]], 1982 – [[Louise Foletta]], 1984 – [[Anthony Syndicas]], 1985 – [[Marek Dobieki]] and 1987 – [[Jan Delaney]]. From 1972, members were able to rent exhibition space at Joan Gough's studio in Kew, and later her studio in South Yarra, until early 1989.

In a change of direction, the Society's July 1989 Annual Exhibition, judged by [[Erica McGilchrist]], was held in the "Old Court House Gallery" in Seymour, Victoria. In June 1989, Robert Lee became President. The C.A.S. held its Council and Members' meetings at members' homes, and local hotels. In October 1989, the Members' Exhibition was held in the "Sky" Gallery in Collingwood.

In February 1990, the C.A.S. gained use of the Ola Cohn Centre in East Melbourne, as a base for its activities. Many successful artists' evenings and discussion nights were held over the next seven years. 1990 also saw exhibitions held at the State Bank Galleria and AMP Square, Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History Contemporary Art Society of Victoria (Inc.)|url=http://www.contemporaryartsociety.org.au/home/history|website=Contemporary Art Society of Victoria|publisher=Contemporary Art Society of Victoria (Inc.)|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New South Wales==
Founded 1939 with Rah Fizelle president and Peter Bellew secretary. The NSW CAS's founding members promoted abstraction as a revolutionary art form and positioned the Society as an oppositional artist's group dedicated to the production of experimental art, attacking the values of the mainstream artist's groups such as the [[Society of Artists (Australia)|Society of Artists]]. The NSW branch had its first exhibition in Sydney in 1940. The Society purportedly differed from other local societies, in that it "concentrates on unconventional and experimental work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17702286 |title=LIVELY PICTURES. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 September 1940 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, as a protest against the [[Archibald Prize]], which it regarded as being biased, boring and of a low standard, the Contemporary Art Society initiated its own awards, with [[Michael Kmit]] the first nominated winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=E3bYX10wulgC&amp;dq=Contemporary+Art+Society+michael+kmit&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Andrew Sibley: An Epic of the Everyman | publisher=Macmillan Education | author=David, Thomas | year=2004 | pages=132 | isbn=9781876832155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first building of any importance in Courtenay Place was built shortly after 1900 by local butcher and businessman, [[John William Rod (New Zealand)|John Rod]] JP.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''Evening Post'',13 Jan 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a heritage listed building, originally designed by T S Lambert, situated on the eastern corner of Allen Street and Courtenay Place. Of brick construction, it originally had three stories and a large cellar, with stables at the rear (now 23 Allen street).&lt;ref&gt;Original Plans held by Wellington City Archives&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been reduced to two stories, probably due to earthquake damage. In 2015, the ground floor and cellars accommodate a bar and restaurant.

==The arts==

Every two years Courtenay Place is home to many of the [[New Zealand International Arts Festival]] events.

'''[[Bats Theatre]]''' is a venue for the development of new theatre practitioners and plays.

'''[[Downstage Theatre]]''', founded in 1964, is New Zealand's first professional theatre.

'''[[Embassy Theatre (Wellington)|Embassy Theatre]]''' ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' movie ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' had its world premiere at the Embassy Theatre at the head of Courtenay Place. The movies ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' both had their [[Australasia]]n premiere at the Embassy (Event Slide Shows). Both events were broadcast live to the world for many hours, involving the movement of record amounts of data by [[CityLink Limited|CityLink]]. The theatre is on the Wellington City Council's heritage list in the District Plan. [[Heritage New Zealand]] has recognised its heritage values with Category One registration, indicating a place of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'. It was originally known as the 'De Luxe' and was built in 1924. Designed by Llewellyn Williams and constructed of reinforced concrete, it included classical external and internal architectural details. The name changed to the Embassy in 1945. A long list of theatre identities has been associated with the theatre, including [[William Kemball]], who formed the [[De Luxe Theatre Company]] in 1923, and [[Sir Robert Kerridge]]. [[Kerry Robins]], leaseholder of the Paramount Theatre in Wellington, took over the lease of the Embassy in 1996. It was purchased by the [[Embassy Theatre Trust]] in 1997 with financial underwriting of the refurbishment programme by Wellington City Council. Ownership was transferred to the WCC under the terms of the agreement. Embassy Theatre Trust subsidiary Company Financial report: Audit report In October 2005 Wellington film exhibitor Kerry Robins sold the operational management of the Embassy to Village SkyCity Cinemas.

'''Paramount Theatre''' (no longer operational) is the oldest surviving cinema in Wellington, still with its original name. Originally a part of Te Aro beach, in August 1916 the location of the Paramount was purchased by [[John James Williamson]]. He arranged for architect [[James Bennie]] to design a picture house.

'''Reading Courtenay Central Complex''' contains shops, restaurants and a ten-screen multiplex cinema. The 8,000 m² development links Courtenay Place with the waterfront and was designed to complement the existing character of the strip. This project won the 2003 Property Council NZ Entertainment Excellence Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ignite-direct.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060402210211/http://ignite-direct.com/ |date=2 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was originally bulldozed in the mid-1980s by [[Chase Corporation]] for the proposed Wakefield Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vertical Living: The Architectural Centre and the Remaking of Wellington|author=Julia Gatley, Kunal Hari, Damian Skinner, Justine Clark|page=|year=2014|publisher=Auckland University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the company fell victim to the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 sharemarket crash]], the site remained derelict for years until it was purchased by Reading Cinemas. The complex was temporarily shut down for safety reasons, after a large earthquake in late 2016 damaged an adjacent parking building beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/nz-earthquake/88029844/big-bertha-crane-moves-in-for-reading-cinema-car-park-demolition|title='Big Bertha' crane moves in for Reading Cinema car park demolition|date=2016-12-30|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision]]''' (aka NZ Film Archive) is on the corner of Ghuznee St and Taranaki St, a block from Courtenay Place.

'''[[Opera House (Wellington)|The Opera House]]'''

'''[[St James Theatre (Wellington)|St James Theatre]]'''. Formerly His Majesty's (and more recently the Westpac St James Theatre), the St. James was designed for [[John Fuller and Sons Ltd]] by Mr [[Henry Eli White]] Architect, structural engineer and contractor. It was the first steel-framed concrete-coated proscenium-arched theatre in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The steel frame allowed for an unsupported 80&amp;nbsp;ft (25 m) span roof structure and also provided good resistance to earthquake damage.

In July 2011, Positively Wellington Venues, an integration between the Wellington Convention Centre and the St James Theatre Trust, began managing this theatre as well as The Opera House, Wellington.

There are two other theatres that sit just outside the Courtenay Place district, '''Circa Theatre''' which sits on the waterfront near Te Papa; and '''Capital E''', home of the National Theatre for Children, which is in Civic Square.

==Events==
In 2017, [[TEDxWellington]] hosted 13 speakers and 1,000 delegates at the [[St. James Theatre, Wellington|St. James Theatre]] on Courtenay Place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/92717745/Hasbro-toy-designer-among-list-of-TEDxWellington-speakers&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Landau established the art collective – BZAZ Foundation – in which they created full-length media shows. These shows toured in Germany, Hungary, Belgium, Mexico, Spain, England and Israel, receiving positive critic by the media and the audiences.&lt;ref name=" Tal Perry"/&gt;

Landau lived in the Netherlands for ten years.&lt;ref name=" Tal Perry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sotn.it/library/daniel-landau Daniel Landau] in State of the Net site&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Landau returned to Israel.

In 2008, in collaboration with artists, dancers, engineers and designers, Landau created the stage piece One-Dimensional Man. This show was a British-Israeli production.&lt;ref name=" Rafi Barbiro"/&gt; The show was a direct continuation of Landau’s interest in the complex relationship between the human body and technology.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' in popular culture}}

''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D'') is a fantasy [[role-playing game]] first published in 1974. As the popularity of the game grew throughout the late-1970s and 1980s, it became referenced in popular culture more frequently. The complement of games, films and cultural references based on ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' or similar fantasies, characters, and adventures became ubiquitous after the end of the 1970s.

''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', and [[tabletop role-playing games]] in general, have exerted a deep and persistent impact on the development of all types of [[video game]]s, from "[[first-person shooter]]s to [[real-time strategy]] games and [[massively multiplayer online game]]s",&lt;ref name=tychen2006/&gt; which in turn play a significant and ongoing role in modern [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name=rausch2004/&gt;

In online culture, the term ''dungeon'' has since come to mean a virtual location where people can meet and collaborate. Hence, [[multi-user dungeon]]s emerged throughout the 1970s and 1980s as a form of [[social network]]s or a social virtual reality.&lt;ref name="steels2004" /&gt; By creating a means for players to assemble and explore an imaginary world, the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rules provided a transition from fantasy literary settings, such as those of author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], to fully [[virtual world]]s.&lt;ref name="heider2009" /&gt;

[[Public figure]]s who play or have played ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' include comedians [[Stephen Colbert]] and [[Chris Hardwick]], musician [[Moby]], and actors [[Vin Diesel]], [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Wil Wheaton]], and [[Robin Williams]].&lt;ref name="shanafelt05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tonjes05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dnd30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oswalt07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="myers04" /&gt;

==Literature==
=== Books ===
{{See also|Dungeons &amp; Dragons (novels)}}
Independent fiction derived from the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' game appeared with the ''[[Endless Quest]]'' series of books, published by [[TSR, Inc]] between 1982 and 1987. The ''Endless Quest'' books provided a form of [[interactive fiction]] in the style of the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] series.&lt;ref name=tresca2010/&gt; The continuing success of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' then sparked an even more extensive series of novels, also published by TSR, Inc. The first of these were based upon the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' campaign setting, and were released in 1984.&lt;ref name=mackay2001/&gt; There proved to be a lucrative market for these works, and by the 2000s a significant portion of all fantasy paperbacks were being published by [[Wizards of the Coast]], the American game company that acquired TSR, Inc in 1997.&lt;ref name=buker2002/&gt;

The impact of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' on players and culture has inspired reflective non-fiction works:
* ''Fantasy Freaks and Gaming Geeks: An Epic Quest for Reality Among Role Players, Online Gamers, and Other Dwellers of Imaginary Realms'', by journalist and gamer [[Ethan Gilsdorf]]; a travel memoir about ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', role-playing games, and other fantasy and gaming subcultures.&lt;ref name=dont_escape/&gt;
* ''The Elfish Gene: Dungeons, Dragons and Growing Up Strange'', by novelist [[Mark Barrowcliffe]]; a memoir of playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and other role playing games in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=harrison20081107/&gt;
* Author [[Shelly Mazzanoble]] wrote a humorous self-help guide called ''Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Dungeons &amp; Dragons: One Woman's Quest to Trade Self-help for Elf-help''. This followed her guide book, ''Confessions of a Part-time Sorceress: A Girl's Guide to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game''.&lt;ref name=wired20070926/&gt;
* ''American Nerd: The Story of My People'' is [[Time magazine]] writer [[Benjamin Nugent]]'s study of the history and culture of people labeled nerds. It includes insights into why people play and enjoy ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=nugent2009/&gt;

Several characters created for playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or games derived from ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', have later spawned popular fantasy series.&lt;ref name=carlisle2009/&gt; Other novels make off-hand references to the game:

=== Comics ===
Begun in 1986, the comic books ''The Adventurers'' and ''[[Redfox (comics)|Redfox]]'' were inspired by ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=booker2010/&gt; Several commercial [[comic strip]]s are based entirely upon the game or make reference to the game in specific panels.
* ''[[Knights of the Dinner Table]]'' is a multiple award-winning&lt;ref name=panzeri2006/&gt; comic-sized magazine featuring comic strips with a variety of characters who play "HackMaster," a parody of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''. (''[[HackMaster]]'' would later go on to become an actual role-playing game.) Early strips appeared in the official ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' magazine ''[[Dragon]]''.
* The ''[[Order of the Stick]]'' is an award-winning&lt;ref name=comics_village08/&gt; satirical webcomic that features a cast of characters in a world that loosely operates by the rules of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.&lt;ref name=grossman070131/&gt;
* ''[[Penny Arcade]]'', A longstanding webcomic, created by ''[[Jerry Holkins]]'' and ''[[Mike Krahulik]]'', references and even depicts humorous instances of bizarre campaigns, and other ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' subject matter; implementing dice-rolling humor and other game dynamics.

=== Film ===
{{Main|Dungeons &amp; Dragons (film series)}}

Several films include instances of characters playing the game of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.

* The ''Futurama'' film ''[[Bender's Game]]'' includes ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' as a crucial plot device, in which the main characters end up in a fantasy realm much like the game.

The film included parodies of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''-influenced films.&lt;ref name=wired20081104/&gt;
* The short film ''[[Fear of Girls]]'' is a spoof of two heavy ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' gamers. The filmmakers used viral marketing to attract attention to the film.&lt;ref name=lees2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=mst20070128/&gt;
* The films ''[[The Gamers (film)|The Gamers]]''&lt;ref name=nt20021203/&gt; and ''[[The Gamers: Dorkness Rising]]''&lt;ref name=jainchill2006/&gt; by the Dead Gentlemen are parodies of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''.

== Players ==
[[Stephen Colbert]] developed an intense interest in the game during his youth, which he later credited for his talent at character creation.&lt;ref name=carter2010/&gt; Ethan Gilsdorf credited the game for bestowing upon him "gifts of creativity and self-actualization".&lt;ref name=gilsdorf2011/&gt; Actor Vin Diesel, in his introduction to the book ''Thirty Years of Adventure'', wrote that he was "attracted to the artistic outlet the game provided" and that the game was "a training ground for our imagination and an opportunity to explore our own identities".&lt;ref name=diesel2004/&gt; Vin Diesel, Mike Myers, and Robin Williams also participated in the 2006 [[Worldwide Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game Day]], demonstrating that the game was then still a lively and active hobby.&lt;ref name=game_day07/&gt;

Director Chris Weitz pointed out that there "are a lot of people who played and are horribly embarrassed about it and won't admit it, because it's part of their lives they put behind". He developed a fervent interest in the game, even greater than in making movies, and said the experience "had such an influence on his life".&lt;ref name=scott2005/&gt; Director Jon Favreau was drawn into the game by the fantasy elements and the sense of story, saying "it gave me a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance".&lt;ref name=favreau08/&gt;

Political reporter John J. Miller said that ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' was a big part of his life during his school years, and argued that, "there's a lot to admire about ''D&amp;D'' and what it can do for kids by encouraging them to read, do math, and think creatively".&lt;ref name=miller2004/&gt; Fantasy author China Miéville said that playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' as a youth was one of the most enduring influences on his writing. The two things that particularly influenced him were "the mania for cataloging the fantastic" and "the weird fetish for systematization", in that everything is reduced to "game stats".&lt;ref name=gordon2003/&gt; In contrast, author Mark Barrowcliffe considers his years playing ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' to be a wasted youth and all of the players to be nerds. He has tried to put the experience behind him.&lt;ref name=barrowcliffe2008/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13369">[[File:Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Piazza Navona) September 2015-1.jpg|thumb|The ''Fountain of the Four Rivers'']]
'''Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi''' (''Fountain of the Four Rivers'') is a fountain in the [[Piazza Navona]] in [[Rome]], Italy. It was designed in 1651 by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] for [[Pope Innocent X]] whose family palace, the [[Palazzo Pamphili]], faced onto the piazza as did the church of [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]] of which Innocent was the sponsor.

The base of the fountain is a basin from the centre of which travertine rocks rise to support four river gods and above them, a copy of an [[Egypt]]ian [[obelisk]] surmounted with the Pamphili family emblem of a dove with an olive twig. Collectively, they represent [[four rivers (disambiguation)|four major rivers]] of the [[four continents]] through which papal authority had spread: the [[Nile]] representing Africa, the [[Danube]] representing Europe, the [[Ganges]] representing Asia, and the [[Río de la Plata]] representing the Americas.

==Design==
Bernini's design was selected in competition. The circumstances of his victory are described as follows in [[Filippo Baldinucci]]'s ''The life of Cavaliere Bernini'' (1682):
{{quote|text=So strong was the sinister influence of the rivals of Bernini on the mind of Innocent that when he planned to set up in Piazza Navona the great [[obelisk]] brought to Rome by the Emperor Caracalla, which had been buried for a long time at [[Capo di Bove]] for the adornment of a magnificent fountain, the Pope had designs made by the leading architects of Rome without an order for one to Bernini. Prince [[Niccolò Ludovisi]], whose wife was niece to the pope, persuaded Bernini to prepare a model, and arrange for it to be secretly installed in a room in the Palazzo Pamphili that the Pope had to pass. When the meal was finished, seeing such a noble creation, he stopped almost in ecstasy. Being prince of the keenest judgment and the loftiest ideas, after admiring it, said: "This is a trick … It will be necessary to employ Bernini in spite of those who do not wish it, for he who desires not to use Bernini’s designs, must take care not to see them."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20060927102116/http://www.mcah.columbia.edu/arthumanities/pdfs/arthum_bernini_reader.pdf The life of Cavaliere Bernini]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Public fountains in Rome served multiple purposes: first, they were highly needed sources of water for neighbors in the centuries prior to home plumbing. Second, they were monuments to the papal patrons. Earlier Bernini fountains had been the [[Fountain of the Triton]] in [[Palazzo Barberini|Piazza Barberini]], the [[Fontana del Moro|Fountain of the Moor]] in the southern end of Piazza Navona erected during the Barberini papacy, and the [[Neptune and Triton]] for Villa Peretti Montalto, whose statuary now resides at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]].

Each has animals and plants that further carry forth identification, and each carries a certain number of [[allegories]] and [[metaphors]] with it. The Ganges carries a long oar, representing the river's [[navigability]]. The Nile's head is draped with a loose piece of cloth, meaning that no one at that time knew exactly where the Nile's source was. The Danube touches the [[Papal coats of arms|Pope's personal coat of arms]], since it is the large river closest to Rome. And the [[Río de la Plata]] is sitting on a pile of coins, a symbol of the riches America could offer to Europe (the word ''[[:wiktionary:plata|plata]]'' means "silver" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). Also, the Río de la Plata looks scared by a [[snake]], showing rich men's fear that their money could be stolen. Each is a [[river god]], semi-prostrate, in awe of the central tower, epitomized by the slender Egyptian [[obelisks in Rome|obelisk]], symbolizing by Papal power surmounted by the Pamphili symbol (dove). In addition, the fountain is a theater in the round, a spectacle of action, that can be strolled around. Water flows and splashes from a jagged and pierced mountainous disorder of [[travertine marble]]. A legend, common with tour-guides, is that Bernini positioned the cowering Rio de la Plata River as if the sculpture was fearing the facade of the [[Sant'Agnese in Agone|church of Sant'Agnese]] by his rival [[Borromini]] could crumble against him; in fact, the fountain was completed several years before Borromini began work on the church.

The obelisk, made of [[Aswan]] [[granite]], has an interesting history. It is connected with the emperor [[Domitian]], and was originally thought to have come from the [[Serapeum]], which the emperor rebuilt in A.D. 80. However, it is equally plausible that the obelisk might have originated from the [[Temple of the gens Flavia|Temple of the Gens Flavia]] on the [[Quirinal Hill]], built by Domitian dedicated to his [[Flavia (gens)|family cult]]. The [[hieroglyph]]ic inscriptions on the obelisk were of Roman authorship, offering a hymn to Domitian, and the deified emperors [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]], possibly on the occasion of something being restored. In the fourth century, the obelisk was relocated to the [[Circus of Maxentius|Circus]] of the emperor [[Maxentius]], located between the [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Church of St. Sebastian]] and the [[Tomb of Caecilia Metella|tomb of Cecilia Metella]] along the [[Appian Way]], where it was found and moved to the Fountain. The circus – as well as the nearby [[Mausoleum of Maxentius|villa and mausoleum]] – was first believed to be attributed to the emperor [[Caracalla]], until excavations carried out by [[Antonio Nibby]] in 1825, in which an inscription identifying the ownership of the site was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rome – an Oxford Archaeological Guides|last=Claridge|first=Amanda|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=0192880039|location=New York|pages=211, 336–40|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At each of the four sites of the obelisk is a tablet, containing Kircher's translation into Latin of its hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777122590/3573_obelisk_lg.html|title=FATHOM: Image Gallery|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamic fusion of architecture and sculpture made this fountain revolutionary when compared to prior Roman projects, such as the stilted designs [[Acqua Felice]] and [[Acqua Paola|Paola]] by [[Domenico Fontana]] in [[San Bernardo alle Terme|Piazza San Bernardo]] (1585–87) or the customary embellished geometric floral-shaped basin below a jet of water such as the [[Fontanina]] in Piazza Campitelli (1589) by [[Giacomo della Porta]]. [[Bernini]]'s design was influenced by the design of the [[Monument of the Four Moors]] (''Monumento dei Quattro mori'') and it may have also been influenced by a fountain in [[Marino, Lazio]] which was constructed to commemorate the defeat of the Ottomans at Lepanto in 1571.&lt;ref name="BindmanGates2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bindman|author2=Henry Louis Gates|author3=Karen C.

==Unveiling==

The Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi was unveiled to the populace of Rome on 12 June 1651. According to a report from the time,&lt;ref name = "multiple"&gt;{{cite book|first=Antonio |last=Bernal|title=Copiosissimo Discorso della Fontana, e Guglia Eretta in Piazza Navona, per ordine della Santità di Nostro Signore Innocentio X dal Signor Cavalier Bernini ...|location=Rome|year=1651}}&lt;/ref&gt; an event was organised to draw people to the [[Piazza Navona]]. Beforehand, wooden scaffolding, overlaid with curtains, had hidden the fountain, though probably not the obelisk, which would have given people an idea that something was being built, but the precise details were unknown. Once unveiled, the full majesty of the fountain would be apparent, which the celebrations were designed to advertise. The festival was paid for by the [[Pamphili]] family, to be specific, [[Innocent X]], who had sponsored the erection of the fountain. The most conspicuous item on the Pamphili crest, an olive branch, was brandished by the performers who took part in the event.

The author of the report, Antonio Bernal, takes his readers through the hours leading up to the unveiling. The celebrations were announced by a woman, dressed as the allegorical character of [[pheme|Fame]], being paraded around the streets of Rome on a carriage or float. She was sumptuously dressed, with wings attached to her back and a long trumpet in her hand. Bernal notes that "she went gracefully through all the streets and all the districts that are found among the seven hills of Rome, often blowing the round bronze [the trumpet], and urging everyone to make their way to that famous Piazza." A second carriage followed her; this time another woman was dressed as the allegorical figure of [[Curiosity]]. According to the report, she continued exhorting the people to go towards the piazza. Bernal describes the clamour and noise of the people as they discussed the upcoming event.

The report is actually less detailed about the process of publicly unveiling the fountain. However, it does give ample descriptions of the responses of the spectators who had gathered in the Piazza. Once there, Bernal notes, the citizens of the city were overwhelmed by the massive fountain, with its huge lifelike figures. The report mentions the "enraptured souls" of the population, the fountain, which "gushes out a wealth of silvery treasures" causing "no little wonder" in the onlookers. Bernal then continues to describe the fountain, making continuous reference to the seeming naturalism of the figures and its astonishing effect on those in the piazza.

The making of the fountain was met by opposition by the people of Rome for several reasons. First, Innocent X had the fountain built at public expense during the intense famine of 1646–48. Throughout the construction of the fountain, the city murmurred and talk of riot was in the air. [[Pasquinade]] writers protested the construction of the fountain in September 1648 by attaching hand-written invectives on the stone blocks used to make the obelisk. These pasquinades read, "We do not want Obelisks and Fountains, It is bread that we want. Bread, Bread, Bread!" Innocent quickly had the authors arrested, and disguised spies patrol the Pasquino statue and Piazza Navona&lt;ref&gt;the diary of Giacinto Gigli, ''Diario di Rome'', vol. II, pp. 533–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The streetvendors of the market also opposed the construction of the fountain, as Innocent X expelled them from the piazza. The Pamphilij pope believed they detracted from the magnificence of the square. The vendors refused to move, and the papal police had to chase them from the piazza. Roman Jews, in particular, lamented the closing of the Navona, since they were allowed to sell used articles of clothing there at the Wednesday market.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesco Cancellieri]], ''Il Mercato, il Lago dell'Acqua Vergine, ed il Palazzo Panfiliano nel circo agonale, detto volgarmente Piazza Navona''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frida Kahlo de Rivera'''&lt;!--Don't change the spelling; Kahlo was officially "Frida" from birth, although she preferred the German spelling "Frieda" until the 1930s--&gt; ({{IPA-es|ˈfɾiða ˈkalo}}; born '''Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón'''; 6 July 1907 – 13 July 1954) was a [[Mexican art]]ist who painted many portraits, [[self-portrait]]s and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico. Inspired by [[Culture of Mexico|the country's popular culture]], she employed a [[Naïve art|naïve]] [[folk art]] style to explore questions of identity, [[postcolonialism]], gender, class and race in Mexican society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 women artists you should know|last=Christiane|first=Weidemann|date=2008 [1970]|publisher=Prestel|others=Larass, Petra., Klier, Melanie|isbn=978-3791339566|location=Munich|oclc=195744889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary ''[[Mexicayotl]]'' movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a [[surrealist]] or [[magical realist]].

Born to a German father and a ''[[mestizo|mestiza]]'' mother, Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at her family home in [[Coyoacán]], [[Frida Kahlo Museum|La Casa Azul]], now known and publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum. She was disabled by [[polio]] as a child. Until a traffic accident at age eighteen caused lifelong pain and medical problems, she had been a promising student headed for medical school. During her recovery, she returned to her childhood hobby of art with the idea of becoming an artist.

Kahlo's interests in politics and art led to the next stage of her life. In 1927, she joined the [[Mexican Communist Party]], through which she met fellow Mexican artist [[Diego Rivera]], whom she married in 1928. The relationship was volatile and included a year-long divorce; both had extramarital affairs. Kahlo spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States with Rivera. During this time, she developed her own style as an artist, drew her main inspiration from [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexican folk culture]], and painted mostly small self-portraits which mixed elements from pre-Columbian and [[Catholic]] mythology. Her paintings raised the interest of Surrealist artist [[André Breton]], who arranged for Kahlo's first solo exhibition at the [[Julien Levy Gallery]] in New York in 1938. The exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939. While the French exhibition was less successful, the [[Louvre]] purchased a painting from Kahlo, ''[[The Frame (painting)|The Frame]]'', making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection. Throughout the 1940s, Kahlo participated in exhibitions in Mexico and the United States. She taught at the [[Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda"]] and became a founding member of the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana. Kahlo's always fragile health began to decline in the same decade. She had her first solo exhibition in Mexico in 1953, shortly before her death in 1954 at the age of 47.

Kahlo was mainly known as Rivera's wife until the late 1970s, when her work was rediscovered by art historians and political activists. By the early 1990s, she had become not only a recognized figure in art history, but also regarded as an icon for [[Chicano Movement|Chicanos]], the [[feminism]] movement and the [[LGBTQ]] movement. Kahlo's work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and [[indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.&lt;ref name="broude"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History|author1=Broude, Norma|author2=Garrard, Mary D|date=1992|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón{{efn|Kahlo was given her first two names so that she could be baptized according to Catholic traditions, but was always called Frida. She preferred to spell her name "Frieda" until the late 1930s, when she dropped the 'e' as she did not wish to be associated with Germany during [[Hitler]]'s rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Burrus|1y=2005|1p=202|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=10–11}}}} was born on 6 July 1907 in [[Coyoacán]], a village on the outskirts of [[Mexico City]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burrus|1y=2005|1p=199|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=3–4|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3p=17}} Kahlo stated that she was born at the family home, [[Frida Kahlo Museum|La Casa Azul]] (The Blue House), but according to the official birth registry, the birth took place at the nearby home of her maternal grandmother.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=15}} Kahlo's parents were photographer [[Guillermo Kahlo]] (1871–1941) and Matilde Calderón y González (1876–1932). Originally from Germany, Guillermo had [[German immigration to Mexico|immigrated to Mexico]] in 1891, after [[epilepsy]] caused by an accident ended his university studies.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=4–9|2a1=Ankori|2y=2002|2p=17}} Although Kahlo claimed that her father was [[Jewish]], he was in fact a [[Lutheran]].{{sfn|Deffebach|2015|p=52}}&lt;ref name="jerpost1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ronnen|first=Meir|title=Frida Kahlo's father wasn't Jewish after all|pages=|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=2006-04-20|url=https://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Books/Frida-Kahlos-father-wasnt-Jewish-after-all|accessdate=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matilde was born in [[Oaxaca]] to an [[indigenous peoples of Mexico|Indigenous]] father and a mother of [[Spaniards in Mexico|Spanish]] descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=4–9|2a1=Ankori|2y=2002|2pp=17–18|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=199}} In addition to Kahlo, the marriage produced daughters Matilde (''c.'' 1898–1951), Adriana (''c.'' 1902–1968), and [[Cristina Kahlo|Cristina]] (''c.'' 1908–1964).{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=10–11|2a1=Ankori|2y=2002|2p=18}} She had two half-sisters from Guillermo's first marriage, María Luisa and Margarita, but they were raised in a convent.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=10–11|2a1=Ankori|2y=2002|2p=18|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3pp=15–16}}

Kahlo later described the atmosphere in her childhood home as often "very, very sad".{{sfn|Ankori|2002|p=18}} Both parents were often sick,{{sfnm|1a1=Ankori|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=10–12}} and their marriage was devoid of love.{{sfn|Beck|2006|p=57}} Matilde's relationships with her daughters were extremely tense.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=8–10|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=16|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3p=18|4a1=Burrus|4y=2005|4p=199}} Kahlo described her mother as "kind, active and intelligent, but also calculating, cruel and fanatically religious".{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=8–10|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=16|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3p=18|4a1=Burrus|4y=2005|4p=199}} Furthermore, Guillermo's photography business suffered greatly during the [[Mexican Revolution]], as the overthrown government had commissioned works from him, and the long civil war limited the number of private clients.{{sfnm|1a1=Ankori|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=10–12}}

When Kahlo was six years old she contracted [[polio]], which made her right leg shorter and thinner than the left.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=10–20|2a1=Ankori|2y=2013|2p=44}}{{efn|Given Kahlo's later problems with [[scoliosis]] and with her hips and limbs, neurologist Budrys Valmantas has argued that she had a congenital condition, [[spina bifida]], which was diagnosed by Dr. [[Leo Eloesser]] when she was a young adult.{{sfn|Budrys|2006|pp=4–10}} Psychologist and art historian Dr. Salomon Grimberg disagrees, stating that Kahlo's problems were instead the result of not wearing an orthopedic shoe on her affected right leg, which led to damage to her hips and spine.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/1995/09/frida-kahlo-diego-rivera-art-diary|title=Diary of a Mad Artist|last=Collins|first=Amy Fine|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''|date=September 3, 2013|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The illness forced her to be isolated from her peers for months, and she was bullied.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=10–20|2a1=Ankori|2y=2013|2pp=44–47}} While the experience made her introverted,{{sfn|Ankori|2002|p=18}} it made her Guillermo's favorite due to their shared experience of living with disability.{{sfnm|1a1=Burrus|1y=2008|1pp=13–15|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=10–21}} Kahlo credited him for making her childhood "marvelous... he was an immense example to me of tenderness, of work (photographer and also painter), and above all in understanding for all my problems".{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|pp=9–10}} He taught her about literature, nature, and philosophy, and encouraged her to play sports to regain her strength, despite the fact that most physical exercise was seen as unsuitable for girls.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=10–20|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=199|3a1=Ankori|3y=2013|3p=45|4a1=Burrus|4y=2008|4p=16}} He also taught her photography, and she began to help him retouch, develop, and color photographs.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=10–20|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=199|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3p=18}}

Due to polio, Kahlo began school later than her peers.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=18}} Along with her younger sister Cristina, she attended the local kindergarten and primary school in Coyoacán and was homeschooled for the fifth and sixth grades.{{sfn|Ankori|2013|p=58}} While Cristina followed their sisters into a convent school, Kahlo was enrolled in a German school due to their father's wishes.{{sfn|Ankori|2002|p=19}} She was soon expelled for disobedience and was sent to a vocational teachers school.{{sfn|Ankori|2013|p=58}} Her stay at the school was brief, as she was sexually abused by a female teacher.{{sfn|Ankori|2013|p=58}}

In 1922, Kahlo was accepted to the elite [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (Mexico)|National Preparatory School]], where she focused on natural sciences with the aim of becoming a doctor.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p=11|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=22–27|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3p=19}} The institution had only recently begun admitting women, with only 35 girls out of 2,000 students.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p=11|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=22–27}} She performed well academically,{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=26–40}} was a voracious reader, and became "deeply immersed and seriously committed to Mexican culture, political activism and issues of social justice".{{sfn|Ankori|2013|pp=60–62}} The school promoted ''[[Indigenismo in Mexico|indigenismo]]'', a new sense of Mexican identity that took pride in the country's indigenous heritage and sought to rid itself of the colonial mindset of Europe as superior to Mexico.{{sfn|Anderson|2009|p=120}} Particularly influential to Kahlo at this time were nine of her schoolmates, with whom she formed an informal group called the "Cachuchas"&amp;nbsp;– many of them would become leading figures of the Mexican intellectual elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=26–40|2a1=Barson|2y=2005|2p=59|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=199|4a1=Ankori|4y=2002|4p=19}} They were rebellious and against everything conservative and pulled pranks, staged plays, and debated philosophy and Russian classics.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=26–40|2a1=Barson|2y=2005|2p=59|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=199|4a1=Ankori|4y=2002|4p=19}} To mask the fact that she was older and to declare herself a "daughter of the revolution", she began saying that she had been born on 7 July 1910, the year the [[Mexican Revolution]] began, which she would continue throughout her life.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1p=5|2a1=Dexter|2y=2005|2p=13|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3pp=19–20}}

Kahlo enjoyed art from an early age, receiving drawing instruction from her father's friend, printmaker Fernando Fernández{{sfnm|1a1=Ankori|1y=2002|1p=20|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=200}} and filling notebooks with sketches.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=20}} In 1925, she began to work outside of school to help her family.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=21}} After briefly working as a [[stenographer]], she became a paid engraving apprentice for Fernández.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=26–40}} He was impressed by her talent,{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|p=12}} although she did not consider art as a career at this time.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=20}}

=== 1925–1930: Bus accident, first paintings, and marriage to Diego Rivera ===
[[File:Frida Kahlo, by Guillermo Kahlo 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kahlo photographed by her father in 1926]]On 17 September 1925, Kahlo and her boyfriend – a fellow Cachucha, Alejandro Gómez Arias – were on their way home from school when the wooden bus they were riding collided with a streetcar. The accident killed several people and fractured Kahlo's ribs, both her legs and her collarbone. Kahlo suffered near-fatal injuries. An iron handrail impaled her through her pelvis, fracturing the pelvic bone.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=47–50|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=23–26|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3pp=200–201|4a1=Ankori|4y=2002|4p=19}}{{efn|Kahlo stated that the handrail entered on the left side of her abdomen and exited through her vagina, but according to Gómez Arias, "the wound was much higher up and hit the pelvic bone; the invention of the point of exit was to hide other things."{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=26}}}} She spent a month in the hospital and two months recovering at home{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|pp=17–18}} before being able to return to work.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=57–60|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=201|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3pp=20–21}} As she continued to experience fatigue and back pain, her doctors ordered x-rays, which revealed that the accident had also displaced three [[vertebrae]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=17–18|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=62–63}} Her treatment included wearing a plaster corset which confined her to bed rest for part of the three months she spent unable to walk.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=17–18|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=62–63}}

The accident ended Kahlo's dreams of becoming a doctor and caused her pain and illness for the rest of her life; her friend [[Andrés Henestrosa]] stated that Kahlo "lived dying".{{sfnm|1a1=Ankori|1y=2002|1p=101|2a1=Ankori|2y=2013|2p=51}} During her recovery, she started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, which would combine her interests in science and art, and began to paint. She had a specially-made easel that enabled her to paint in bed, and a mirror was placed above it so she could see herself.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=17–18|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2p=62–63|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3=201}}  Painting became a way for Kahlo to explore questions of identity and existence,{{sfnm|1a1=Burrus|1y=2005|1p=201|2a1=Ankori|2y=2002|2pp=101–102}} and she later stated that the accident and the isolating recovery period made her desire "to begin again, painting things just as [she] saw them with [her] own eyes and nothing more."{{sfn|Herrera|2002|p=75}}

Most of the paintings Kahlo made during this time were portraits of herself, her sisters, and school friends.{{sfnm|1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p=21|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2p=64}} Her early paintings and correspondence show that she drew inspiration especially from European artists, in particular Renaissance masters such as [[Sandro Botticelli]] and [[Bronzino]]{{sfnm|1a1=Dexter|1y=2005|1p=14|2a1=Barson|2y=2005|2p=58}} and from ''[[avant-garde]]'' movements such as [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] and [[Cubism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ankori|1y=2002|1pp=105–108|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=69}}

Kahlo's bed rest was over by late 1927, and she began socializing with her old school friends, who were now at university and involved in student politics. She joined the [[Mexican Communist Party]] (PCM) and was introduced to a circle of political activists and artists, including the exiled Cuban communist [[Julio Antonio Mella]] and the Italian-American photographer [[Tina Modotti]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=20–22|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=78–81|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=201|4a1=Zamora|4y=1990|4p=31}}

At one of Modotti's parties in June 1928, Kahlo was introduced to [[Diego Rivera]], one of Mexico's most successful artists and a notable figure in PCM.{{sfnm|1a1=Marnham|1y=1998|1p=220|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=33–34|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3p=20, 139}} They had met briefly in 1922 when he was painting a mural at her school.{{sfnm|1a1=Marnham|1y=1998|1p=220|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=33–34|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3p=20}} Shortly after their introduction in 1928, Kahlo asked him to judge whether her paintings showed enough talent for her to pursue a career as an artist.{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1pp=33–35|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=201|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3p=20}} Rivera recalled being impressed by her works, stating that they showed, "an unusual energy of expression, precise delineation of character, and true severity ... They had a fundamental plastic honesty, and an artistic personality of their own ... It was obvious to me that this girl was an authentic artist".{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=86–87}}

[[File: Frida Kahlo Diego Rivera 1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Kahlo with husband [[Diego Rivera]] in 1932]]

Kahlo soon began a relationship with Rivera, despite his being 20 years older than Kahlo, having had two [[Common-law marriage|common-law]] wives, and being a self-confessed womanizer.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=79–80, 87–93|2a1=Ankori|2y=2002|2pp=20–21|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3p=37}} He was considered attractive by women as he at least outwardly refrained from the ''[[machismo|macho]]'' act&amp;nbsp;– according to which women were inferior to and "owned" by men&amp;nbsp;– that was a central part of Mexican masculinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1p=86|2a1=Beck|2y=2006|2p=56}} Kahlo and Rivera were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall of Coyoacán on 21 August 1929.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=35}} Her mother opposed the marriage, and both parents referred to it as a "marriage between an elephant and a dove", referring to the couple's differences in size: Rivera was tall and overweight while Kahlo was petite and fragile.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=93–100|2a1=Ankori|2013|2pp=70–73}} Regardless, her father approved of Rivera, who was wealthy and therefore able to support Kahlo, who could not work and had to receive expensive medical treatment.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=93–100}} The wedding was reported by the Mexican and international press,{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1p=40|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2p=Preface xi}} and the marriage would be subject to constant media attention in Mexico in the coming years, with articles referring to the couple as simply "Diego and Frida".{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=Preface xi}}

Soon after the marriage, in late 1929, Kahlo and Rivera moved to [[Cuernavaca]] in the rural state of [[Morelos]], where he was commissioned by American ambassador [[Dwight W. Morrow]] to paint murals for the [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cortés]].{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1p=42|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=101–105|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=201}} Around the same time, she resigned her membership of the PCM in support of Rivera, who had been expelled shortly before the marriage for his support of the leftist opposition movement within the [[Third International]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burrus|1y=2005|1p=201|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=101–105|3a1=Tibol|3y=2005|3p=191 for time for Rivera's expulsion}}

During the civil war, Morelos had seen some of the heaviest fighting, and living in the Spanish-style Cuernavaca sharpened Kahlo's sense of a Mexican identity and history.{{sfn|Udall|2003|p=11}} She changed her artistic style and increasingly drew inspiration from Mexican folk art.{{sfnm|1a1=Dexter|1y=2005|1pp=15–17|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2pp=20–25}} Art historian Andrea Kettenmann states that she may have been influenced by [[Adolfo Best Maugard]]'s treatise on the subject, as she incorporated many of the characteristics that he outlined – for example, the lack of perspective and the combining of elements from pre-Columbian and colonial periods of Mexican art.{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|pp=24–25}} Similar to many other Mexican women artists and intellectuals at the time,{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=26–27|2a1=Albers|2y=1999|2p=223|3a1=Block and Jeep|3y=1998–1999|3pp=8–10|4a1=Ankori|4y=2002|4p=144}} Kahlo began wearing traditional indigenous Mexican peasant clothing to emphasize her ''[[mestiza]]'' ancestry: long and colorful skirts, ''[[huipil]]s'' and ''[[rebozo]]s'', elaborate headdresses and masses of jewelry.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=109–113|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=78–80}} She especially favored the dress of women from the allegedly [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] society of the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], who had come to represent "an authentic and indigenous Mexican cultural heritage" in post-revolutionary Mexico.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=101–113|2a1=Marnham|2y=1998|2p=228|3a1=Block and Jeep|3y=1998–1999|3pp=8–10|4a1=Dexter|4y=2005|4pp=12–13|5a1=Baddeley|5y=1991|5pp=12–13}} The Tehuana outfit allowed Kahlo to express her feminist and anti-colonialist ideals,{{sfn|Baddeley|1991|p=13-14}} covered the signs of polio and surgery on her body, and appealed to Rivera, who believed that "Mexican women who do not wear [Mexican clothing] ... are mentally and emotionally dependent on a foreign class to which they wish to belong".{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=26–27|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=109–113|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3pp=144–145}}{{efn|Kahlo had always used her appearance to make political statements, having previously "dressed like a boy with shaved hair, pants, boots, and a leather jacket" and even posed for a family photo in a man's suit,{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|pp=11, 26}} and during her time in the Communist Party favoring "workman's shirts and a-line skirts ... deemed proper for a Communist".{{sfn|Albers|1999|p=191}}}} Her identification with ''[[La Raza]]'', the people of Mexico, and her profound interest in its culture remained important facets of her art throughout the rest of her life.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=109–113|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=78–80|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3pp=144–145}}

[[File:Frida Kahlo, by Guillermo Kahlo 3.jpg|thumb|Frida photographed in 1932 by her father, [[Guillermo Kahlo|Guillermo]]]]
After Rivera had completed the commission in Cuernavaca in late 1930, he and Kahlo moved to [[San Francisco]], where he painted murals for the Luncheon Club of the [[San Francisco Stock Exchange]] and the [[California School of Fine Arts]].{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=114–116|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2p=31|3a1=Marnham|3y=|3pp=231–232}} The couple was "feted, lionized, [and] spoiled" by influential collectors and clients during their stay in the city.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=117–125|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=42–43|3a1=Block and Jeep|3y=1998–1999|3p=8}} Kahlo was introduced to American artists such as [[Edward Weston]], [[Ralph Stackpole]], [[Timothy Pflueger]], and [[Nickolas Muray]].{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=117–125|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=42–43|3a1=Block and Jeep|3y=1998–1999|3p=8}} Her long love affair with Muray most likely began around this time.{{sfnm|1a1=Panzer|1y=2004|1pp=40–41; mentions 1931 letter from Kahlo to Muray, but not entirely sure if this was the beginning of affair|2a1=Marnham|2y=1998|2pp=234–235; interprets letter as evidence of the beginning of affair}}

The six months spent in San Francisco were a productive period for Kahlo,{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=117–125|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=42–43|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3p=32}} who further developed the folk art style she had adopted in Cuernavaca.{{sfn|Burrus|2005|p=203}} In addition to painting portraits of several new acquaintances,{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=118–125|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2p=27}} she made ''[[Frieda and Diego Rivera (painting)|Frieda and Diego Rivera]]'' (1931), a double portrait based on their wedding photograph,{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=124–127|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2p=31|3a1=Ankori|3y=2002|3pp=140–145}} and ''The Portrait of [[Luther Burbank]]'' (1931), which depicted the eponymous horticulturist as a hybrid between a human and a plant.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=123–125}} Although she still publicly presented herself as simply Rivera's spouse rather than as an artist,{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=117–125|2a1=Marnham|2y=1998|2pp=234–235}} she participated for the first time in an exhibition, when ''Frieda and Diego Rivera'' was included in the Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists in the [[Legion of Honor (museum)|Palace of the Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwomenartists.org/SFWAArchives2014.pdf|title=SFWA History Timeline|publisher=San Francisco Women Artists|accessdate=July 20, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804210151/http://www.sfwomenartists.org/SFWAArchives2014.pdf|archivedate=August 4, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/fridakahlo/life/timeline_1930.html|title=Timeline|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|date=March 2005|accessdate= July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlo and Rivera returned to Mexico for the summer of 1931, and in the fall, traveled to [[New York City]] for the opening of Rivera's retrospective at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA). In April 1932, they headed to [[Detroit]], where he had been commissioned by the [[Ford Motor Company]] to paint murals for the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=125–130|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=43}} By this time, Kahlo had become bolder in her interactions with the press, impressing journalists with her fluency in English and stating on her arrival to the city that she was the greater artist of the two of them.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=133–160}}

The year spent in Detroit was a difficult time for Kahlo. Although she had enjoyed visiting San Francisco and New York City, she disliked aspects of American society, which she regarded as colonialist, as well as most Americans, whom she found "boring".{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=117–125|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=42–43|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3pp=202–203|4a1=Kettenmann|4y=2003|4p=36 for quote}} She disliked having to socialize with capitalists such as [[Henry Ford|Henry]] and [[Edsel Ford]], and was angered that many of the hotels in Detroit refused to accept Jewish guests.{{sfnm|1a1=Burrus|1y=2005|1p=202|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=133–160}} In a letter to a friend, she wrote that "although I am very interested in all the industrial and mechanical development of the United States", she felt "a bit of a rage against all the rich guys here, since I have seen thousands of people in the most terrible misery without anything to eat and with no place to sleep, that is what has most impressed me here, it is terrifying to see the rich having parties day and night whiles thousands and thousands of people are dying of hunger."{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|p=36 for quote}} Kahlo's time in Detroit was also complicated by a pregnancy. Her doctor agreed to perform an abortion, but the medication used was ineffective.{{sfn|Ankori|2013|pp=87–94}} Kahlo was deeply ambivalent about having a child and had already undergone an abortion earlier in the marriage.{{sfn|Ankori|2013|pp=87–94}} Following the failed abortion, she reluctantly agreed to continue with the pregnancy, but miscarried in July, which caused a serious hemorrhage that required her being hospitalized for two weeks.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=133–160|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2pp=201|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3p=46|4a1=Kettenmann|4y=2003|4p=32|5a1=Ankori|5y=2013|5p=87–94}} Less than three months later, her mother died from complications of surgery in Mexico.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=133–160|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=46}}

Despite her dislike of Detroit and her medical problems, Kahlo's time in the city was beneficial for her artistic expression. She experimented with different techniques, such as [[etching]] and [[fresco]]s,{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=46}} and her paintings began to show a stronger narrative style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/frida-kahlo-70745811/|title=Frida Kahlo|first=Phyllis|last=Tuchman|date=November 2002|accessdate=July 20, 2016|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also began placing emphasis on the themes of "terror, suffering, wounds, and pain".{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=46}} Despite the popularity of the mural in Mexican art at the time, she adopted a diametrically opposed medium, votive images or ''[[retablo]]s'', religious paintings made on small metal sheets by amateur artists to thank saints for their blessings during a calamity.{{sfnm|1a1=Burrus|1y=2005|1p=202|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2pp=35–36}} Amongst the works she made in the ''retablo'' manner in Detroit are ''Henry Ford Hospital'' (1932), ''My Birth'' (1932), and ''Self-Portrait on the Border of Mexico and the United States'' (1932).{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=46}} While none of Kahlo's works were featured in exhibitions in Detroit, she gave an interview to the ''[[Detroit News]]'' on her art; the article was condescendingly titled "Wife of the Master Mural Painter Gleefully Dabbles in Works of Art".{{sfn|Bilek|2012|p=14}}

Kahlo and Rivera returned to New York in March 1933, as he had been commissioned to paint a mural for the [[Rockefeller Center]].{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=161–178}} During this time, she only worked on one painting, ''My Dress Hangs There'' (1934).{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=161–178}} She also gave further interviews to the American press.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=161–178}} In May, Rivera was fired from the Rockefeller Center project amid an international scandal, as he had included [[Vladimir Lenin]] in the mural and refused to change it.{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1p=46|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=161–178|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3p=38}} He was instead hired to paint a mural for the [[New Workers School]].{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=161–178}} Although Rivera wished to continue their stay in the United States, Kahlo was homesick, and they returned to Mexico soon after the mural's unveiling in December 1933.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p=38|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=161–178}}

Kahlo made no new paintings in 1934 and only two in the following year.{{sfn|Ankori|2002|p=160}} She was again experiencing health problems&amp;nbsp;– undergoing an [[appendectomy]], two abortions, and the amputation of [[gangrene|gangrenous]] toes{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=180–190|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2pp=38–39|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=219}}&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and her marriage to Rivera had become strained.

Kahlo reconciled with Rivera and Cristina later in 1935 and moved back to San Ángel.{{sfnm|1a1=Burrus|1y=2005|1p=203|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=190–191|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3p=50}} She became a loving aunt to Cristina's children, Isolda and Antonio.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=192–196}} Despite the reconciliation, both Rivera and Kahlo continued their infidelities.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=192–201|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=50–53|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3p=40}} She also resumed her political activities in 1936, joining the [[Fourth International]] and becoming a founding member of a solidarity committee to provide aid to the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=40–41|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=203}} She and Rivera successfully petitioned the Mexican government to grant asylum to former Soviet leader [[Leon Trotsky]] and offered La Casa Azul for him and his wife [[Natalia Sedova]] as a residence.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=192–215|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=52–54|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3pp=40–41|4a1=Burrus|4y=2005|4p=203}} The couple lived there from January 1937 until April 1939, with Kahlo and Trotsky not only becoming good friends but also having a brief affair.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=192–215|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=52–54|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3pp=40–41}}

1937 and 1938 were extremely productive years for Kahlo, and she painted more "than she had done in all her eight previous years of marriage", creating such works as ''My Nurse and I'' (1937), ''[[Memory, the Heart]]'' (1937), ''Four Inhabitants of Mexico'' (1938), and ''[[What the Water Gave Me (painting)|What the Water Gave Me]]'' (1938).{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1p=215 for quote|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=56|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3p=45}} Although she was still unsure about her work, the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] exhibited some of her paintings in early 1938.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|p=226}} She made her first significant sale in the summer of 1938 when film star and art collector [[Edward G. Robinson]] purchased four paintings at $200 each.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|p=226}} Even greater recognition followed when French Surrealist [[André Breton]] visited Rivera in April 1938. He was impressed by Kahlo, immediately claiming her as a surrealist and describing her work as "a ribbon around a bomb".{{sfn|Mahon|2011|pp=33–34}} He not only promised to arrange for her paintings to be exhibited in Paris but also wrote to his friend and art dealer, [[Julien Levy]], who invited her to hold her first solo exhibition at his gallery on the East 57th Street in Manhattan.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p=45|2a1=Mahon|2y=2011|2pp=33–34}}

[[File:Toni Frissell - Frida Kahlo, seated next to an agave.jpg|thumb|left|1937 photograph by [[Toni Frissell]], from a fashion shoot for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'']]In October, Kahlo traveled alone to New York, where her colorful Mexican dress "caused a sensation" and made her seen as "the height of exotica".{{sfn|Mahon|2011|pp=33–34}} The exhibition opening in November was attended by famous figures such as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] and [[Clare Boothe Luce]] and received much positive attention in the press, although many critics adopted a condescending tone in their reviews.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=230–232|2a1=Mahon|2y=2011|2pp=34–35}} For example, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' wrote that "Little Frida's pictures ... had the daintiness of miniatures, the vivid reds, and yellows of Mexican tradition and the playfully bloody fancy of an unsentimental child".{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=230–232}} Despite the [[Great Depression]], Kahlo sold half of the twenty-five paintings presented in the exhibition.{{sfn|Burrus|2005|p=204}} She also received commissions from [[A. Conger Goodyear]], then the president of the MoMA, and Clare Boothe Luce, for whom she painted a portrait of Luce's friend, socialite [[Dorothy Hale]], who had committed suicide by jumping from her apartment building.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=230–235}} During the three months she spent in New York, Kahlo painted very little, instead focusing on enjoying the city to the extent that her fragile health allowed.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=230–240}} She also had several affairs, continuing the one with Nickolas Muray and engaging in ones with Levy and [[Edgar Kaufmann, Jr.]]{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=230–240|2a1=Ankori|2y=2002|2p=193}}

In January 1939, Kahlo sailed to Paris to follow up on [[André Breton]]'s invitation to stage an exhibition of her work.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=51–52|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=241–243}} When she arrived, she found that he had not cleared her paintings from the customs and no longer even owned a gallery.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=51–52|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=241–245}} With the aid of [[Marcel Duchamp]], she was able to arrange for an exhibition at the Renou et Colle Gallery.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=51–52|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=241–245}} Further problems arose when the gallery refused to show all but two of Kahlo's paintings, considering them too shocking for audiences,{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=241–245}} and Breton insisted that they be shown alongside photographs by [[Manuel Alvarez Bravo]], pre-Columbian sculptures, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Mexican portraits, and what she considered "junk": sugar skulls, toys, and other items he had bought from Mexican markets.{{sfn|Mahon|2011|p=45}}

The exhibition opened in March, but received much less attention than she had received in the United States, partly due to the looming [[Second World War]], and made a loss financially, which led Kahlo to cancel a planned exhibition in London.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=51–52|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=241–250}} Regardless, the [[Louvre]] purchased ''[[The Frame (painting)|The Frame]]'', making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=51–52|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=241–250|3a1=Mahon|3y=2011|3p=45}} She was also warmly received by other Parisian artists, such as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Joan Miró]],{{sfn|Mahon|2011|p=45}} as well as the fashion world, with designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]] designing a dress inspired by her and ''[[Vogue Paris]]'' featuring her on its pages.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=51–52|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=241–250}} However, her overall opinion of Paris and the Surrealists remained negative; in a letter to Muray, she called them "this bunch of coocoo lunatics and very stupid surrealists"{{sfn|Mahon|2011|p=45}} who "are so crazy 'intellectual' and rotten that I can't even stand them anymore."{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|p=51}}

Kahlo sailed back to New York soon after the opening of the exhibition.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=250–252}} She was eager to be reunited with Muray, but he decided to end their affair, as he had met another woman whom he was planning to marry.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=250–252|2a1=Marnham|2y=|2p=290}} Kahlo traveled back to Mexico City, where Rivera requested a divorce from her. The exact reasons for his decision are unknown, but he stated publicly that it was merely a "matter of legal convenience in the style of modern times ... there are no sentimental, artistic, or economic reasons."{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=62}} According to their friends, the divorce was mainly caused by their mutual infidelities.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=250–252, 273–27|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=62–64|3a1=Marnham|3y=|3p=290}} Kahlo and Rivera were granted a divorce in November 1939 but remained friendly; she continued to manage his finances and correspondence.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=250–252, 273–277|a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=62–64|3a1=Marham|3y=|3p=290}}

Following her separation from Rivera, Kahlo moved back to La Casa Azul and, determined to earn her own living, began another productive period as an artist, inspired by her experiences abroad.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=280–294|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=64|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3p=52}} Encouraged by the recognition she was gaining, she moved from using the small and more intimate tin sheets she had used since 1932 to large canvases, as they were easier to exhibit.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p=62|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2p=315}} She also adopted a more sophisticated technique, limited the graphic details, and began to produce more quarter-length portraits, which were easier to sell.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|p=315}}  She painted several of her most famous pieces during this period, such as ''[[The Two Fridas]]'' (1939), ''Self-portrait with Cropped Hair'' (1940), ''[[The Wounded Table]]'' (1940), and ''[[Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird]]'' (1940). Three exhibitions featured her works in 1940: the fourth International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico City, the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco, and ''Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art'' in MoMA in New York.{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1pp=136–137|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=220}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/608/releases/MOMA_1940_0039_1940-05-11_40511-34.pdf?2010|title=Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art Opens at Museum of Modern Art|date=May 15, 1940|accessdate=July 25, 2016|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Coyoacán, where he had continued to live after leaving La Casa Azul.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=295–315}} Kahlo was briefly suspected of being involved, as she knew the murderer, and was arrested and held for two days with her sister Cristina.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=295–315|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=220}} The following month, Kahlo traveled to San Francisco for medical treatment for back pain and a fungal infection on her hand.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=276–277; 295–315|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2pp= 52, 56|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3pp= 64, 70|4a1=Burrus|4y=2005|4p=205}} Her continuously fragile health had increasingly declined since her divorce and was exacerbated by her heavy consumption of alcohol.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=276–277; 295–315|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2pp= 52, 56|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3pp= 64|4a1=Burrus|4y=2005|4p=205}}

Rivera was also in San Francisco after he fled Mexico City following Trotsky's murder and accepted a commission.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=295–315 for fleeing|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=70|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3p=56}} Although Kahlo had a relationship with art dealer [[Heinz Berggruen]] during her visit to San Francisco,{{sfnm|1a1=Marnham|1y=|1p=296|2a1=Ankori|2y=2002|2p=193}} she and Rivera reconciled.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=56–57|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=205|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3p=70}} They remarried in a simple civil ceremony on 8 December 1940.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=56–57|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=205|3a1=Zamora|3y=1990|3p=70|4a1=Herrera|4y=2002|4pp=295–315}} Kahlo and Rivera returned to Mexico soon after their wedding. The union was less turbulent than before for its first five years.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=86}} Both were more independent,{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=295–315|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=70}} and while La Casa Azul was their primary residence, Rivera retained the San Ángel house for use as his studio and second apartment.{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|p=57}} Nevertheless, both continued having extramarital affairs.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=295–315|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=70}}

Despite the medical treatment she had received in San Francisco, Kahlo's health problems continued throughout the 1940s. Due to her spinal problems, she wore twenty-eight separate supportive corsets, varying from steel and leather to plaster, between 1940 and 1954.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=344–346}} She experienced pain in her legs, the infection on her hand had become chronic, and she was also treated for [[syphilis]].{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=344–346|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=86}} The death of her father in April 1941 plunged her into a depression.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=86}} Her ill health made her increasingly confined to La Casa Azul, which became the center of her world. She enjoyed taking care of the house and its garden, and was kept company by friends, servants, and various pets, including [[spider monkey]]s, [[Mexican hairless dog|Xoloitzcuintlis]], and parrots.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=295–315|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2pp=73–78|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3p=61}}

In the United States, Kahlo's paintings continued to raise interest. In 1941, her works were featured at the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston|Institute of Contemporary Art]] in [[Boston]], and in the following year she participated in two high-profile exhibitions in New York, the ''Twentieth-Century Portraits'' exhibition at the MoMA and the Surrealists' ''First Papers of Surrealism'' exhibition.{{sfn|Burrus|2005|pp=220–221}} In 1943, she was included in the ''Mexican Art Today'' exhibition at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] and ''Women Artists'' at [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[The Art of This Century gallery]] in New York.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=316–318|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=137|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3pp=220–221}}

Kahlo gained more appreciation for her art in Mexico as well. She became a founding member of the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana, a group of twenty-five artists commissioned by the Ministry of Public Education in 1942 to spread public knowledge of Mexican culture.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=61–62|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=321–322}} As a member, she took part in planning exhibitions and attended a conference on art.{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|pp=61–62}} In Mexico City, her paintings were featured in two exhibitions on Mexican art that were staged at the English-language Benjamin Franklin Library in 1943 and 1944. She was invited to participate in "Salon de la Flor", an exhibition presented at the annual flower exposition.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=316–320}} An article by Rivera on Kahlo's art was also published in the journal published by the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana.{{sfnm|1a1=Burrus|1y=2005|1p=221|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=321–322}}

Kahlo accepted a teaching position at the recently reformed, nationalistic [[Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda"]] in 1943.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|pp=95–96}} She encouraged her students to treat her in an informal and non-hierarchical way and taught them to appreciate Mexican popular culture and folk art and to derive their subjects from the street.{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1pp=95–96|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2pp=63–67|3a1=Herrera|3y=2002|3pp=330–332|4a1=Burrus|4y=2005|4p=205}} When her health problems made it difficult for her to commute to the school in Mexico City, she began to hold her lessons at La Casa Azul.{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1pp=95–96|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2pp=63–68}} Four of her students&amp;nbsp;– [[Fanny Rabel]], [[Arturo García Bustos]], Guillermo Monroy, and [[Arturo Estrada]]&amp;nbsp;– became devotees, and were referred to as "Los Fridos" for their enthusiasm.{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1pp=95–97|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2pp=63–68}} Kahlo secured three mural commissions for herself and her students.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=335–343}} In 1944, they painted La Rosita, a ''[[pulqueria]]'' in Coyoacán. In 1945, the government commissioned them to paint murals for a Coyoacán launderette as part of a national scheme to help poor women who made their living as laundresses. The same year, the group created murals for Posada del Sol, a hotel in Mexico City. However, it was destroyed soon after completion as the owner did not like it.
[[File:Frida Kahlo in Sari.png|thumb|left|Kahlo (centre), [[Nayantara Sahgal]] and Rita Dar at Caza Azul in 1947]]Kahlo struggled to make a living from her art until the mid to late 1940s, as she refused to adapt her style to suit her clients' wishes.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=316–334}} She received two commissions from the Mexican government in the early 1940s. She did not complete the first one, possibly due to her dislike of the subject, and the second commission was rejected by the commissioning body.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=316–334}} Nevertheless, she had regular private clients, such as engineer Eduardo Morillo Safa, who ordered more than thirty portraits of family members over the decade.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=316–334}} Her financial situation improved when she received a 5000-peso national prize for her painting ''Moses'' (1945) in 1946 and when ''The Two Fridas'' was purchased by the [[Museo de Arte Moderno]] in 1947.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=320–322}} According to art historian Andrea Kettenmann, by the mid-1940s, her paintings were "featured in the majority of group exhibitions in Mexico." Further, Martha Zamora wrote that she could "sell whatever she was currently painting; sometimes incomplete pictures were purchased right off the easel."{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1p=100|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2p=62}}

While Kahlo was gaining recognition in her home country, her health continued to decline. By the mid-1940s, her back had worsened to the point that she could no longer sit or stand continuously.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p=79|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2p=383|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=205}} In June 1945, she traveled to New York for an operation which fused a bone graft and a steel support to her spine to straighten it.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=344–359|2a1=Burrus|2y=2005|2p=205}} The difficult operation was a failure.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=344–359}} According to Herrera, Kahlo also sabotaged her recovery by not resting as required and by once physically re-opening her wounds in a fit of anger.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=344–359}} Her paintings from this period, such as ''Broken Column'' (1944), ''Without Hope'' (1945), ''Tree of Hope, Stand Fast'' (1946), and ''[[The Wounded Deer]]'' (1946), reflect her declining health.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=344–359}}

=== 1950–1954: Last years and death ===

[[File:Studio di Frida Kahlo.jpg|thumb|upright|Kahlo's wheelchair and adjustable easel in La Casa Azul, with one of her still lifes from her final years]]
In 1950, Kahlo spent most of the year in Hospital ABC in Mexico City, where she underwent a new bone graft surgery on her spine.{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1p=122|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=383–389|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=205}} It caused a difficult infection and necessitated several follow-up surgeries.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p=79|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2p=389–400}} After being discharged, she was mostly confined to La Casa Azul, using a wheelchair and crutches to be ambulatory.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p=79|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2p=389–400}}

During these final years of her life, Kahlo dedicated her time to political causes to the extent that her health allowed. She had rejoined the Mexican Communist Party in 1948{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|p=80}} and campaigned for peace by, for example, collecting signatures for the [[Stockholm Appeal]].{{sfn|Burrus|2005|p=206}} She painted mostly [[still lifes]], portraying fruit and flowers with political symbols such as flags or doves.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=79–80|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=397–398}} She was concerned about being able to portray her political convictions, stating that "until now I have managed simply an honest expression of my own self ... I must struggle with all my strength to ensure that the little positive my health allows me to do also benefits the Revolution, the only real reason to live."{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|p=80}} She also altered her painting style: her brushstrokes, previously delicate and careful, were now hastier, her use of color more brash, and the overall style more intense and feverish.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1p&amp;nbsp;p=79–80|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=398–399}}

Photographer [[Lola Alvarez Bravo]] understood that Kahlo did not have much longer to live and thus staged her first solo exhibition in Mexico at the Galería Arte Contemporaneo in April 1953.{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1p=138|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=405–410|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=206}} Though Kahlo was initially not due to attend the opening, as her doctors had put her on bed rest, she ordered her four-poster bed to be moved from her home to the gallery. To the surprise of the guests, she arrived in an ambulance and was carried on a stretcher to the bed, where she stayed for the duration of the party.{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1p=138|2a1=Herrera|2y=2002|2pp=405–410|3a1=Burrus|3y=2005|3p=206}} The exhibition was not only a notable cultural event in Mexico but also received attention in mainstream press around the world.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=405–410}} The same year, the [[Tate]]'s exhibition on Mexican art in London featured five of her paintings.{{sfn|Burrus|2005|p=223}}

Kahlo's right leg was amputated at the knee due to gangrene in August 1953.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=412–430}} She became severely depressed and anxious, and her dependency on painkillers escalated.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=412–430}} When Rivera began yet another affair, she attempted suicide by overdose.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=412–430}} She wrote in her diary in February 1954 that "they have given me centuries of torture and at moments I almost lost my reason. I keep on wanting to kill myself. Diego is what keeps me from it, through my vain idea that he would miss me. ... But never in my life have I suffered more. I will wait a while..."{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=130}} She was again hospitalized in April and May.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=138}} That spring, she resumed painting after a one-year interval.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=412–430}} Her last paintings include the political ''Marxism Will Give Health to the Sick'' (c. 1954) and ''Frida and Stalin'' (c. 1954) and the still-life ''Viva La Vida'' (1954).{{sfnm|1a1=Zamora|1y=1990|1p=130|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2pp=80–82}}
[[File:2013-12-22 Frida Kahlo Totenmaske anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Kahlo's [[death mask]] on her bed in La Casa Azul]]
In her last days, Kahlo was mostly bedridden with [[bronchopneumonia]], though she made a public appearance on 2 July 1954, participating with Rivera in a demonstration against the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état#Operation PBSUCCESS|CIA invasion of Guatemala]].{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1y=2002|1pp=425–433|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=138}} She seemed to anticipate her death, as she spoke about it to visitors and drew skeletons and angels in her diary.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=425–433}} The last drawing was a black angel, which biographer Hayden Herrera interprets as the Angel of Death.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=425–433}} It was accompanied by the last words she wrote, "I joyfully await the exit&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– and I hope never to return&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;– Frida" ("Espero Alegre la Salida&amp;nbsp;– y Espero no Volver jamás").{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=425–433}}

The demonstration worsened her illness, and on the night of 12 July 1954, Kahlo had a high fever and was in extreme pain.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=425–433}} At approximately 6 a.m. on 13 July 1954, her nurse found her dead in her bed.{{sfnm|1a1=Herrera|1a=2002|1pp=425–433|2a1=Zamora|2y=1990|2p=12}} Kahlo was 47 years old. The official cause of death was [[pulmonary embolism]], although no autopsy was performed.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=425–433}} Herrera has argued that Kahlo, in fact, committed suicide.&lt;ref name="HerreraOxfordArt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herrera|first=Hayden|title=Frida Kahlo|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T045455?q=frida+kahlo&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|website=[[Oxford Art Online]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=2014-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=425–433}} The nurse, who counted Kahlo's painkillers to monitor her drug use, stated that Kahlo had taken an overdose the night she died. She had been prescribed a maximum dose of seven pills but had taken eleven.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=12}} She had also given Rivera a wedding anniversary present that evening, over a month in advance.{{sfn|Zamora|1990|p=12}}

On the evening of 13 July, Kahlo's body was taken to the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], where it lay in a state under a Communist flag.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=433–440}} The following day, it was carried to the Panteón Civil de Dolores, where friends and family attended an informal funeral ceremony.  Hundreds of admirers stood outside.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=433–440}} In accordance with her wishes, Kahlo was cremated.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=433–440}} Rivera, who stated that her death was "the most tragic day of my life", died three years later, in 1957.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=433–440}} Kahlo's ashes are displayed in a pre-Columbian urn at La Casa Azul, which opened as a museum in 1958.{{sfn|Herrera|2002|pp=433–440}}

[[File:Frida Kahlo (self portrait).jpg|thumb|''[[Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird]]'' (1940), [[Harry Ransom Center]]]]
Estimates vary on how many paintings Kahlo made during her life, with figures ranging from fewer than 150{{sfn|Dexter|2005|p=11}} to around 200.{{sfnm|1a1=Deffebach|1y=2006|1p=174|2a1=Cooey|2y=1994|2p=95}}&lt;ref name=HerreraOxfordArt /&gt; Her earliest paintings, which she made in the mid-1920s, show influence from Renaissance masters and European avant-garde artists such as [[Amedeo Modigliani]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dexter|1y=2005|1p=14|2a1=Barson|2y=2005|2p=58|3a1=Kettenmann|3y=2003|3p=22}} Towards the end of the decade, Kahlo derived more inspiration from Mexican folk art,{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=54}} drawn to its elements of "fantasy, naivety, and fascination with violence and death".&lt;ref name=HerreraOxfordArt /&gt; The style she developed mixed reality with surrealistic elements and often depicted pain and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Visión Femenina del Surrealismo|url=http://worldbook.planetasaber.com/encyclopedia/default.asp?idreg=121563&amp;ruta=Buscador|website=Hispánica Saber|publisher=Editorial Planeta|language=es|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kahlo's earliest champions was Surrealist artist André Breton, who claimed her as part of the movement as an artist who had supposedly developed her style "in ''total ignorance'' of the ideas that motivated the activities of my friends and myself".{{sfn|Ankori|2002|p=2}} This was echoed by [[Bertram D. Wolfe]], who wrote that Kahlo's was a "sort of 'naïve' Surrealism, which she invented for herself".{{sfn|Mahon|2011|p=33}} Although Breton regarded her as mostly a feminine force within the Surrealist movement, Kahlo brought postcolonial questions and themes to the forefront of her brand of Surrealism.{{sfnm|1a1=Mahon|1y=2011|1pp=33–49|2a1=Dexter|2y=2005|2pp=20–22}} Breton also described Kahlo's work as "wonderfully situated at the point of intersection between the political (philosophical) line and the artistic line."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Surrealist Movement|last=Durozoi|first=Gerard|publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago and London|year=2002|isbn=978-0226174129 |page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While she subsequently participated in Surrealist exhibitions, she stated that she "detest[ed] Surrealism", which to her was "bourgeois art" and not "true art that the people hope from the artist".{{sfn|Helland|1990–1991|p=12}} Some art historians have disagreed whether her work should be classified as belonging to the movement at all. According to Andrea Kettenmann, Kahlo was a [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] concerned more in portraying her inner experiences.{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|p=70}} Emma Dexter has argued that, as Kahlo derived her mix of fantasy and reality mainly from Aztec mythology and Mexican culture instead of Surrealism, it is more appropriate to consider her paintings as having more in common with [[magical realism]], also known as [[New Objectivity]]. It combined reality and fantasy and employed similar style to Kahlo's, such as flattened perspective, clearly outlined characters and bright colours.{{sfn|Dexter|2005|pp=21–22}}

=== Mexicanidad ===
Similarly to many other contemporary Mexican artists, Kahlo was heavily influenced by ''Mexicanidad'', a romantic nationalism that had developed in the aftermath of the revolution.{{sfnm|1a1=Kettenmann|1y=2003|1pp=24–28|2a1=Helland|2y=1990–1991|2pp=8–13|3a1=Bakewell|3y=1993|3pp=167–169}}&lt;ref name=HerreraOxfordArt /&gt; The ''Mexicanidad'' movement claimed to resist the "mindset of cultural inferiority" created by colonialism, and placed special importance on indigenous cultures.{{sfnm|1a1=Bakewell|1y=1993|1pp=167–168|2a1=Cooey|2y=1994|2p=95|3a1=Dexter|3y=2005|3pp=20–21}} Before the revolution, Mexican folk culture&amp;nbsp;– a mixture of indigenous and European elements&amp;nbsp;– was disparaged by the elite, who claimed to have purely European ancestry and regarded Europe as the definition of civilization which Mexico should imitate.{{sfn|Anderson|p=119}} Kahlo's artistic ambition was to paint for the Mexican people, and she stated that she wished "to be worthy, with my paintings, of the people to whom I belong and to the ideas which strengthen me".{{sfn|Helland|1990–1991|p=12}} To enforce this image, she preferred to conceal the education she had received in art from her father and Ferdinand Fernandez and at the preparatory school. Instead, she cultivated an image of herself as a "self-taught and naive artist".{{sfn|Barson|2005|p=76}}

When Kahlo began her career as an artist in the 1920s, [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] dominated the Mexican art scene. They created large public pieces in the vein of Renaissance masters and Russian [[socialist realism|socialist realists]]: they usually depicted masses of people, and their political messages were easy to decipher.{{sfnm|1a1=Bakewell|1y=2001|1p=316|2a1=Deffebach|2y=2006|2p=171}} Although she was close to muralists such as Rivera, [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siquieros]] and shared their commitment to socialism and Mexican nationalism, the majority of Kahlo's paintings were self-portraits of relatively small size.{{sfnm|1a1=Bakewell|1y=2001|1pp=316–317}}&lt;ref name=HerreraOxfordArt /&gt; Particularly in the 1930s, her style was especially indebted to [[votive paintings of Mexico|votive paintings]] or ''retablos'', which were postcard-sized religious images made by amateur artists.{{sfnm|1a1=Bakewell|1y=1993|1pp=168–169|2a1=Castro-Sethness|2y=2004–2005|2p=21|3a1=Deffebach|3y=|3pp=176–177|4a1=Dexter|4y=2005|4p=16}} Their purpose was to thank saints for their protection during a calamity, and they normally depicted an event, such as an illness or an accident, from which its commissioner had been saved.{{sfnm|1a1=Castro-Sethness|1y=2004–2005|1p=21|2a1=Kettenmann|2y=2003|2p=35}} The focus was on the figures depicted, and they seldom featured a realistic perspective or detailed background, thus distilling the event to its essentials.{{sfn|Kettenmann|2003|p=35}} Kahlo had an extensive collection of approximately 2,000 ''retablos'', which she displayed on the walls of La Casa Azul.{{sfnm|1a1=Castro-Sethness|1y=2004–2005|1p=21|2a1=Barson|2y=2005|2p=65|3a1=Bakewell|3y=1993|3pp=173–174|4a1=Cooey|4y=1994|4pp=96–97}} According to Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, the ''retablo'' format enabled Kahlo to "develop the limits of the purely iconic and allowed her to use narrative and allegory."{{sfn|Bakewell|1993|p=173, quotes Mulvey &amp; Wollen's 1982 catalogue essay}}

Many of Kahlo's self-portraits mimic the classic bust-length portraits that were fashionable during the colonial era, but they subverted the format by depicting their subject as less attractive than in reality.{{sfnm|1a1=Bakewell|1y=1993|1pp=168–169|2a1=Castro-Sethness|2y=2004–2005|2p=21|3a1=Deffebach|3y=2006|3pp=176–177}} She concentrated more frequently on this format towards the end of the 1930s, thus reflecting changes in Mexican society. Increasingly disillusioned by the legacy of the revolution and struggling to cope with the effects of the [[Great Depression]], Mexicans were abandoning the ethos of socialism for individualism.{{sfn|Dexter|2005|p=17}} This was reflected by the "personality cults", which developed around Mexican film stars such as [[Dolores del Rio]].{{sfn|Dexter|2005|p=17}} According to Schaefer, Kahlo's "mask-like self-portraits echo the contemporaneous fascination with the cinematic close-up of feminine beauty, as well as the mystique of female otherness expressed in [[film noir]]."{{sfn|Dexter|2005|p=17}} By always repeating the same facial features, Kahlo drew from the depiction of goddesses and saints in indigenous and Catholic cultures.{{sfn|Deffebach|2006|pp=177–178}}

Out of specific Mexican folk artists, Kahlo was especially influenced by [[Hermenegildo Bustos]], whose works portrayed Mexican culture and peasant life, and [[José Guadalupe Posada]], who depicted accidents and crime in satiric manner.{{sfnm|1a1=Barson|1y=2005|1pp=59, 73|2a1=Cooey|2y=1994|2p=98}} She also derived inspiration from the works of [[Hieronymus Bosch]], whom she called a "man of genius", and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], whose focus on peasant life was similar to her own interest in the Mexican people.{{sfn|Barson|2005|pp=58–59}} Another influence was the poet [[Rosario Castellanos]], whose poems often chronicle a woman's lot in the patriarchal Mexican society, a concern with the female body, and tell stories of immense physical and emotional pain.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=54}}

=== Symbolism and iconography ===
Kahlo's paintings often feature root imagery with roots growing out of her body to tie her to the ground, reflecting in a positive sense the theme of personal growth; in a negative sense of being trapped in a particular place, time and situation; and finally in an ambiguous sense of how memories of the past influence the present for either good and/or ill.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=55}} In ''My Grandparents and I'', Kahlo painted herself as a ten-year holding a ribbon that grows from an ancient tree that bears the portraits of her grandparents and other ancestors while her left foot is a tree trunk growing out of the ground, reflecting Kahlo's view of humanity's unity with the earth and her own sense of unity with Mexico.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=57}} In Kahlo's paintings, trees serve as symbols of hope, of strength and of a continuity that transcends generations.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=58}} Additionally, hair features as a symbol of growth and of the feminine in Kahlo's paintings and in ''Self Portrait with Cropped Hair'', Kahlo painted herself wearing a man's suit and shorn of her long hair, which she had just cut off.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=55–56}} Kahlo holds the scissors with one hand menacingly close to her genitals, which can be interpreted as a threat to Rivera whose frequent unfaithfulness infuriated her and/or a threat to harm her own body like she has attacked her own hair, a sign of the way that women often project their fury against others onto themselves.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=56}} Moreover, the picture reflects Kahlo's frustration not only with Rivera, but also her unease with the patriarchal values of Mexico as the scissors symbolize a malevolent sense of masculinity that threatens to "cut up" women, both metaphorically and literally.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=56}} In Mexico, the traditional Spanish values of ''machismo'' were widely embraced, and as a woman, Kahlo was always uncomfortable with ''machismo''.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=56}}

As she suffered for the rest of her life from the bus accident in her youth, Kahlo spent much of her life in hospitals and undergoing surgery, much of it performed by quacks who Kahlo believed could restore her back to where she had been before the accident.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=57}} Many of Kahlo's paintings are concerned with medical imagery, which is presented in terms of pain and hurt, featuring Kahlo bleeding and displaying her open wounds.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=57}} Many of Kahlo's medical paintings, especially dealing with childbirth and miscarriage, have a strong sense of guilt, of a sense of living one's life at the expense of another who has died so one might live.{{sfn|Friis|2004|pp=58}}

Although Kahlo featured herself and events from her life in her paintings, they were often ambiguous in meaning.{{sfn|Cooey|1994|pp=98–99}} She did not use them only to show her subjective experience but to raise questions about Mexican society and the construction of identity within it, particularly gender, race, and social class.{{sfnm|1a1=Bakewell|1y=1993|1pp=168–170|2a1=Ankori|2y=2005|2p=31}} Historian Liza Bakewell has stated that Kahlo "recognized the conflicts brought on by revolutionary ideology":

{{quote|What was it to be a Mexican?&amp;nbsp;– modern, yet pre-Columbian; young, yet old; anti-Catholic yet Catholic; Western, yet New World; developing, yet underdeveloped; independent, yet colonized; ''mestizo'', yet not Spanish nor Indian.{{sfn|Bakewell|1993|p=169}}}}

To explore these questions through her art, Kahlo developed a complex iconography, extensively employing pre-Columbian and Christian symbols and mythology in her paintings.{{sfn|Helland|1990|pp=8–13}} In most of her self-portraits, she depicts her face as mask-like, but surrounded by visual cues which allow the viewer to decipher deeper meanings for it. Aztec mythology features heavily in Kahlo's paintings in symbols like monkeys, skeletons, skulls, blood, and hearts; often, these symbols referred to the myths of [[Coatlicue]], [[Quetzalcoatl]], and [[Xolotl]].{{sfnm|1a1=Helland|1y=1990–1991|1pp=8–13|2a1=Barson|2y=2005|2pp=56–79}} Other central elements that Kahlo derived from Aztec mythology were hybridity and dualism.{{sfnm|1a1=Helland|1y=1990–1991|1pp=8–13|2a1=Dexter|2y=2005|2pp=12–13|3a1=Barson|3y=2005|3p=64}} Many of her paintings depict opposites: life and death, pre-modernity and modernity, Mexican and European, male and female.{{sfn|Helland|1990–1991|pp=8–13}}
[[File:The Love Embrace of the Universe, the Earth (Mexico), Myself, Diego, and Señor Xolotl.jpg|thumb|''[[The Love Embrace of the Universe, the Earth (Mexico), Myself, Diego, and Señor Xolotl]]'', 1949]]
In addition to Aztec legends, Kahlo frequently depicted two central female figures from Mexican folklore in her paintings: [[La Llorona]] and [[La Malinche]]{{sfnm|1a1=Ankori|1y=2005|1pp=31–43|2a1=Barson|2y=2005|2pp=69–70}} as interlinked to the hard situations, the suffering, misfortune or judgement, as being calamitous, wretched or being "''[[La Chingada|de la chingada]]''."{{sfnm|1a1=Barson|1y=2005|1pp=60}} For example, when she painted herself following her miscarriage in Detroit in ''Henry Ford Hospital'' (1932), she shows herself as weeping, with dishevelled hair and an exposed heart, which are all considered part of the appearance of La Llorona, a woman who murdered her children.{{sfn|Ankori|2002|pp=149–163}} The painting was traditionally interpreted as simply a depiction of Kahlo's grief and pain over her failed pregnancies. But with the interpretation of the symbols in the painting and the information of Kahlo's actual views towards motherhood from her correspondence, the painting has been seen as depicting the unconventional and taboo choice of a woman remaining childless in Mexican society.

Kahlo often featured her own body in her paintings, presenting it in varying states and disguises: as wounded, broken, as a child, or clothed in different outfits, such as the Tehuana costume, a man's suit, or a European dress.{{sfnm|1a1=Cooey|1y=1994|1pp=95–108|2a1=Dexter|2y=2005|2p=12|3a1=Barson|3y=2005|3p=58}} She used her body as a metaphor to explore questions on societal roles.{{sfnm|1a1=Cooey|1y=1994|1pp=95–108|2a1=Dexter|2y=2005|2p=12}} Her paintings often depicted the female body in an unconventional manner, such as during miscarriages, and childbirth or cross-dressing.{{sfnm|1a1=Bakewell|1y=1997|1p=725|2a1=Cooey|2y=1994|2p=102|3a1=Helland|3y=1990–1991|3p=10|4a1=Deffebach|4y=2006|4p=176|5a1=Barson|5y=2005|5p=58}} In depicting the female body in graphic manner, Kahlo positioned the viewer in the role of the voyeur, "making it virtually impossible for a viewer not to assume a consciously held position in response".{{sfn|Cooey|1994|p=108}}

According to Nancy Cooey, Kahlo made herself through her paintings into "the main character of her own mythology, as a woman, as a Mexican, and as a suffering person ... She knew how to convert each into a symbol or sign capable of expressing the enormous spiritual resistance of humanity and its splendid sexuality".{{sfn|Cooey|1994|p=99}} Similarly, Nancy Deffebach has stated that Kahlo "created herself as a subject who was female, Mexican, modern, and powerful", and who diverged from the usual dichotomy of roles of mother/whore allowed to women in Mexican society.{{sfn|Deffebach|2006|pp=172–178}} Due to her gender and divergence from the muralist tradition, Kahlo's paintings were treated as less political and more naïve and subjective than those of her male counterparts up until the late 1980s.{{sfnm|1a1=Ankori|1y=2002|1pp=1–3|2a1=Cooey|2y=1994|2p=102|3a1=Helland|3y=1990–1991|3pp=8–13}} According to art historian Joan Borsa, "the critical reception of her exploration of subjectivity and personal history has all too frequently denied or de-emphasized the politics involved in examining one's own location, inheritances and social conditions [...] Critical responses continue to gloss over Kahlo's reworking of the personal, ignoring or minimizing her interrogation of sexuality, sexual difference, marginality, cultural identity, female subjectivity, politics and power."{{sfn|Dexter|2005|p=11}}

The [[Tate Modern]] considers Kahlo "one of the most significant artists of the twentieth century",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/frida-kahlo|title=Frida Kahlo|publisher=[[Tate Modern]]|date=2005|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while according to art historian Elizabeth Bakewell, she is "one of Mexico's most important twentieth-century figures".{{sfn|Bakewell|2001|p=315}} Kahlo's reputation as an artist developed late in her life and grew even further posthumously, as during her lifetime she was primarily known as the wife of Diego Rivera and as an eccentric personality among the international cultural elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Ankori|1y=2002|1pp=3–5|2a1=Deffebach|2y=2006|2p=189|3a1=Pankl and Blake|3y=2012|3p=2|4a1=Baddeley|4y=1991|4p=10}} She gradually gained more recognition in the late 1970s when feminist scholars began to question the exclusion of female and non-Western artists from the art historical canon and the [[Chicano Movement]] lifted her as one of their icons.{{sfnm|1a1=Ankori|1y=2002|1pp=3–5|2a1=Deffebach|2y=2006|2p=189|3a1=Pankl and Blake|3y=2012|3p=1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/frida-kahlo-feminist-and-chicana-icon/|title=Frida Kahlo: Feminist and Chicana Icon|publisher=[[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two books about Kahlo were published in Mexico by [[Teresa del Conde]] and Raquel Tibol in 1976 and 1977, respectively,{{sfn|Ankori|2002|pp=4–5}} and in 1977, ''The Tree of Hope Stands Firm'' (1944) became the first Kahlo painting to be sold in an auction, netting $19,000 at [[Sotheby's]].{{sfn|Theran|p=6}} These milestones were followed by the first two retrospectives staged on Kahlo's ''oeuvre'' in 1978, one at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and another at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Ankori|2002|pp=4–5}}

Two events were instrumental in raising interest in her life and art for the general public outside Mexico. The first was a joint retrospective of her paintings and Tina Modotti's photographs at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in London, which was curated and organized by [[Peter Wollen]] and [[Laura Mulvey]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wollen|1y=2004|1pp=235–236|2a1=Pankl and Blake|2y=2012|2p=1|3a1=Baddeley|3y=1991|3p=10}} It opened in May 1982, and later traveled to Sweden, Germany, the United States, and Mexico.{{sfn|Wollen|2004|p=236}} The second was the publication of art historian Hayden Herrera's international bestseller ''[[Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo]]'' in 1983.{{sfnm|1a1=Pankl and Blake|1y=2012|1p=1|2a1=Wollen|2y=2004|2p=236|3a1=Baddeley|3y=1991|3p=10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/06/entertainment/ca-kahlo6|title=Fighting over Frida Kahlo|first=Christopher|last=Knight|publisher=LA Times|date=2009-09-06|accessdate=2015-11-17|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1984, Kahlo's reputation as an artist had grown to such extent that Mexico declared her works national cultural heritage, prohibiting their export from the country.{{sfn|Theran|p=6}}&lt;ref name=artnet&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/frida-kahlo-market-scarcity-284667|title=Frida Kahlo Market Booming Despite Tough Mexican Export Restrictions|publisher=Art Net News|date=May 25, 2015|first=Eileen|last=Kinsella}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, her paintings seldom appear in international auctions and comprehensive retrospectives are rare.&lt;ref name=artnet /&gt; Regardless, her paintings have still broken records for Latin American art in the 1990s and 2000s. In 1990, she became the first Latin American artist to break the one-million-dollar threshold when ''Diego and I'' was auctioned by Sotheby's for $1,430,000.{{sfn|Theran|p=6}} In 2006, ''Roots'' (1943) reached US$5.6 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/Frida_Kahlo_Roots_$5.6_Million_Record_at_Sothebys.html|title=''Roots'' Sets $5.6 Million Record at Sotheby's|work=Art Knowledge News| date= 2006 |accessdate= 23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, ''Two Lovers in a Forest'' (1939) sold for $8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.asharpeye.com/journey-two-nudes-forest-frida-kahlo-1939-2/ | title=The Journey of "Two Nudes in a Forest" by Frida Kahlo 1939| date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlo has attracted popular interest to the extent that the term "Fridamania" has been coined to describe the phenomenon.{{sfnm|1a1=Pankl and Blake|1y=2012|1p=1|2a1=Baddeley|2y=1991|2p=10–11|3a1=Lindauer|3y=2004|3p=2}} She is considered "one of the most instantly recognizable artists",{{sfn|Wollen|2004|p=236}} whose face has been "used with the same regularity, and often with a shared symbolism, as images of [[Che Guevara]] or [[Bob Marley]]".{{sfn|Baddeley|2005|p=49}} Her life and art have inspired a variety of merchandise, and her distinctive look has been appropriated by the fashion world.{{sfnm|1a1=Pankl and Blake|1y=2012|1p=1|2a1=Baddeley|2y=1991|2p=10–11|3a1=Lindauer|3y=2004|3p=2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/style/frida-kahlo-is-having-a-moment.html|title=Frida Kahlo Is Having a Moment|work=The New York Times|first=Guy|last=Trebay|date=May 8, 2015|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mencimer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalestory.org/LATINAMERICA/Mexico/KahloAndRivera/Kahlo,FridaTheTroubleWithFridaKahlobyStephanie%20Mencimer.pdf|title=The Trouble with Frida Kahlo|first=Stephanie|last=Mencimer|work=[[Washington Monthly]]|date=June 2002|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Hollywood biopic, [[Julie Taymor]]'s ''[[Frida]]'', was released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/fridakahlo/today/|title=Understanding Frida Today|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Herrera's biography and starring [[Salma Hayek]] (who co-produced the film) as Kahlo, it grossed US$56 million worldwide and earned six [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].&lt;ref name="Frida 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=frida.htm|title=Frida (2002)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]-[[Pixar]] animation ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'' also features Kahlo in a supporting role, voiced by [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/10/nolan-gerard-funk-berlin-i-love-you-natalia-cordova-buckley-coco-1202194115/|title=Nolan Gerard Funk Joins 'Berlin, I Love You'; Natalia Cordova-Buckley Set In 'Coco'|last=N'Duka|first=Amanda|website=Deadline|date=October 24, 2017|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coyoacán día de muertos 08.jpg|thumb|right|Effigy of Kahlo for [[Day of the Dead]] at the Museo Frida Kahlo]]
Kahlo's popular appeal is seen to stem first and foremost from a fascination with her life story, especially its painful and tragic aspects. She has become an icon for several minority groups and political movements, such as feminists, the [[LGBTQ]] community, and Chicanos. Oriana Baddeley has written that Kahlo has become a signifier of non-conformity and "the archetype of a cultural minority," who is regarded simultaneously as "a victim, crippled and abused" and as "a survivor who fights back."{{sfn|Baddeley|2005|pp=47–49}} Edward Sullivan stated that Kahlo is hailed as a hero by so many because she is "someone to validate their own struggle to find their own voice and their own public personalities".{{sfn|Lindauer|2004|pp=1–2}} According to [[John Berger]], Kahlo's popularity is partly due to the fact that "the sharing of pain is one of the essential preconditions for a refinding of dignity and hope" in twenty-first century society.{{sfn|Berger|2001|pp=155–165}} [[Kirk Varnedoe]], the former chief curator of MoMA, has stated that Kahlo's posthumous success is linked to the way in which "she clicks with today's sensibilities&amp;nbsp;– her psycho-obsessive concern with herself, her creation of a personal alternative world carries a voltage. Her constant remaking of her identity, her construction of a theater of the self are exactly what preoccupy such contemporary artists as [[Cindy Sherman]] or [[Kiki Smith]] and, on a more popular level, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]... She fits well with the odd, androgynous hormonal chemistry of our particular epoch."&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;

Kahlo's posthumous popularity and the commercialization of her image have drawn criticism from many scholars and cultural commenters, who think that, not only have many facets of her life been mythologized, but the dramatic aspects of her biography have also overshadowed her art, producing a simplistic reading of her works in which they are reduced to literal descriptions of events in her life.{{sfnm|1a1=Lindauer|1y=2004|1pp=3–12|2a1=Dexter|2y=2005|2p=11|3a1=Ankori|3y=2005|3p=31|4a1=Baddeley|4y=2005|4pp=47–53}} According to journalist Stephanie Mencimer, Kahlo "has been embraced as a poster child for every possible politically correct cause" and {{quote|like a game of telephone, the more Kahlo's story has been told, the more it has been distorted, omitting uncomfortable details that show her to be a far more complex and flawed figure than the movies and cookbooks suggest. This elevation of the artist over the art diminishes the public understanding of Kahlo's place in history and overshadows the deeper and more disturbing truths in her work. Even more troubling, though, is that by airbrushing her biography, Kahlo's promoters have set her up for the inevitable fall so typical of women artists, that time when the contrarians will band together and take sport in shooting down her inflated image, and with it, her art."&lt;ref name=mencimer /&gt;}}
Baddeley has compared the interest in Kahlo's life to the interest in the troubled life of [[Vincent van Gogh]] but has also stated that a crucial difference between the two is that most people associate Van Gogh with his paintings, whereas Kahlo is usually signified by an image of herself – an intriguing commentary on the way male and female artists are regarded.{{sfn|Baddeley|1991|p=11}} Similarly, Peter Wollen has compared Kahlo's cult-like following to that of [[Sylvia Plath]], whose "unusually complex and contradictory art" has been overshadowed by simplified focus on her life.{{sfn|Wollen|2004|p=240}}

=== Commemorations and characterizations ===
[[File:Museo Frida Kahlo.JPG|thumb|upright|La Casa Azul, which has been open to the public since 1958 as a museum dedicated to Frida Kahlo.]]

Kahlo's legacy has been commemorated in several ways. La Casa Azul, her home in Coyoacán, was opened as a museum in 1958, and has become one of the most popular museums in Mexico City, with approximately 25,000 visitors monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museofridakahlo.org.mx/esp/1/el-museo/la-casa/la-casa-azul|title=La Casa Azul|publisher=Museo Frida Kahlo|accessdate=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city dedicated a park, Parque Frida Kahlo, to her in Coyoacán in 1985.&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/mexico/mexicomix/article/Frida-Kahlo-and-Diego-Rivera-s-Mexico-City-6496626.php|title=Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera's Mexico City|publisher=SFGate|first=Christine|last=Delsol|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park features a bronze statue of Kahlo.&lt;ref name=sfgate /&gt; In the United States, she became the first Hispanic woman to be honored with a [[U.S. postage stamp]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/news/2001/philatelic/sr01_048.htm |title=Stamp Release No. 01-048&amp;nbsp;– Postal Service Continues Its Celebration of Fine Arts With Frida Kahlo Stamp |publisher=[[USPS]] |accessdate=29 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717182928/http://www.usps.com/news/2001/philatelic/sr01_048.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was inducted into the [[Legacy Walk]], an outdoor public display in Chicago that celebrates the [[LGBT]] history and people, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacyprojectchicago.org/2012_INDUCTEES.html|title=Legacy Project Chicago|author=Victor Salvo |publisher=legacyprojectchicago.org|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlo received several commemorations on the centenary of her birth in 2007, and some on the centenary of the birthyear she attested to, 2010. These included the [[Bank of Mexico]] releasing a new [[Mexican peso|MXN$]] 500-peso note, featuring Kahlo's painting titled ''Love's Embrace of the Universe, Earth, (Mexico), I, Diego, and Mr. Xólotl'' (1949) on the reverse of the note and Diego Rivera on the front.&lt;ref name=Banxico&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banxico.org.mx/billetes-y-monedas/informacion-general/billetes-y-monedas-de-fabricacion-actual/billete-de-500-pesos/material-educativo/%7B601FEB0F-63F6-A3AF-C803-A064AC6BEE74%7D.pdf |title=Presentación del nuevo billete de quinientos pesos |work=[[Bank of Mexico]] |accessdate=11 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923004604/http://www.banxico.org.mx/billetes-y-monedas/informacion-general/billetes-y-monedas-de-fabricacion-actual/billete-de-500-pesos/material-educativo/%7B601FEB0F-63F6-A3AF-C803-A064AC6BEE74%7D.pdf |archivedate=23 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest retrospective of her works at Mexico City's Palacio des Bellas Artes broke its previous attendance record.&lt;ref name="Largest-ever exhibit of Frida Kahlo work to open in Mexico"&gt;{{cite news|title=Largest-ever exhibit of Frida Kahlo work to open in Mexico|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/2007-05/30/content_883458.htm|accessdate=16 February 2016|work=China Daily|agency=[[Agence France Presse]]|date=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to other tributes, Kahlo's life and art have inspired artists in various fields. In 1984, [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] released a biopic titled ''[[Frida, naturaleza viva]],'' starring [[Ofelia Medina]] as Kahlo. She is the protagonist of three fictional novels, Barbara Mujica's ''Frida'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-58567-074-1|title=Frida|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavenka Drakulic]]'s ''Frida's Bed'' (2008), and [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s ''[[The Lacuna]]'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/08/the-lacuna-barbara-kingsolver|title=The Lacuna by Barbara Kingsolver (book review)|author=Alice O'Keeffe|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=4 June 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, American jazz flautist and composer [[James Newton]] released an album titled ''Suite for Frida Kahlo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valley-entertainment.com/suite-for-frida-kahlo-2.html|title=Suite for Frida Kahlo|work=[[Valley Entertainment]]|accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, author Monica Brown and illustrator John Parra published a children's book on Khalo, ''Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos'', which focuses primarily on the animals and pets in Khalo's life and art.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Monica and Parra, John (Illustrator). 2017.

Kahlo has also been the subject of several stage performances.

'''''Gaspard de la Nuit — Fantaisies à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot''''' ({{lang-en|Gaspard of the Night — Fantasies in the Manner of [[Rembrandt]] and [[Jacques Callot|Callot]]}}) is a compilation of [[prose poetry|prose poems]] by Italian-born French poet [[Aloysius Bertrand]]. Considered one of the first examples of modern prose poetry, it was published in [[1842 in literature|1842]], one year after Bertrand's death from [[tuberculosis]], from a manuscript dated 1836,&lt;ref&gt;See Bertrand Guégan (Ed.), ''Gaspard de la Nuit, Fantaisies à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot par Aloysius Bertrand. Edition publiée d'après le manuscrit de l'auteur.'' With a biographical introduction by [[Sainte-Beuve]]. (Payot, Paris 1925), p. 1. The MS title page includes an imprimatur for Eugéne Renduel, Libraire-Editeur, Rue des Grands-Augustins, 22 and the date 1836.&lt;/ref&gt; by his friend [[David d'Angers]]. The text includes a short address to [[Victor Hugo]] and another to [[Charles Nodier]], and a Memoir of Bertrand written by [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] was included in the original 1842 edition.

The poems themselves are expressed with a strong [[Romantic poetry|romanticist]] verve, and explore fantasies of medieval Europe.

==Theme and structure==
The author tells an introductory story of how he sat in a garden in [[Dijon]], and fell into conversation with a dishevelled old man who sat near him leafing through a book.&lt;ref&gt;B. Guégan, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' (1925), pp. 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The stranger recognizes him to be a poet, and speaks of how he has spent his life searching for the meaning of Art ('L'art est la science du poète'), and for the elements or principles of Art. The first principle, what was ''sentiment'' in Art, was revealed to him by the discovery of some little book inscribed Gott - Liebe ('Dieu et Amour', God and Love): to have loved and to have prayed.

Then he became preoccupied by what constituted ''idea'' in Art, and, having studied nature and the works of man through thirty years, at the cost of his youth, he wondered if the second principle, that of idea, might be [[Satan]]. But after a night of storm and colic in the church of Notre-Dame of Dijon, in which clarity shone through the shadows ('Une clarté piqua les ténèbres'), he concluded that the devil did not exist, that Art existed in the bosom of God, and that we are merely the copyists of the Creator.

Then the old stranger thrusts into the poet's hand the book, his own manuscript, telling all the attempts of his lips to find the instrument which gives the pure and expressive note - every trial upon the canvas before the subtle dawn-glow of the 'clair-obscur' or [[chiaroscuro|clarity in shadow]] appeared there - the novel experiments of harmony and colour, the only products of his nocturnal deliberations. The old man goes off to write his Will, saying he will come back to collect his book tomorrow. The manuscript is, naturally, ''Gaspard de la Nuit. Fantaisies à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot''. The next day the poet returns to restore the book to its owner, who does not come: he asks after M. Gaspard de la Nuit, to which the answer is that he is probably in Hell unless he is out on his travels - for he is, of course, the devil. 'May he roast there!' says the poet. 'I shall publish his book.'

A short preface attributed to Gaspard himself&lt;ref&gt;B. Guégan, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' (1925), pp. 25-6.&lt;/ref&gt; explains that the artists [[Rembrandt|Paul Rembrandt]] and [[Jacques Callot]] represent two eternally reverse or antithetic faces of Art: one the philosopher absorbed in meditation and prayer upon the spirits of beauty, science, wisdom and love, seeking to penetrate the symbols of nature, and the other the showy figure who parades about the street, rows in the taverns, caresses bohemian girls, always swears by his rapier, and whose main preoccupation is waxing his moustache. But in considering Art under this double personification he has included studies upon other artists among his poetic meditations, which he has not presented as a formal literary theory because [[François Dominique Séraphin|M. Séraphin]] has not explained to him the mechanism of his Chinese shadow-plays, and [[Pulcinella|Punchinello]] conceals from curious viewers the thread which makes his arm move.

The ''Fantaisies'' of Gaspard de la Nuit, each of a few short paragraphs or extended strophes (and every one of them prefaced by a short literary quotation), are then arranged in six short books entitled 'Ecole Flamande' (Flemish School) (9 pieces), 'Le Vieux Paris' (Old Paris) (10), 'La Nuit et ses Prestiges' (The Night and its Marvels) (11), 'Les Chroniques' (The Chronicles) (8), 'Espagne et Italie' (Spain and Italy) (8), and 'Silves' (6). There is also a group of 13 separate pieces not in the finished collection but found among the author's manuscripts, which include 'Le Gibet', the received version of 'Scarbo', and a piece addressed to the sculptor M. David.&lt;ref&gt;B. Guégan, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' (1925), pp. 189-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The book had an important influence upon other poets, mostly French, including [[Charles Baudelaire]], through whom the importance of the work came to be recognized. The most famous tribute was the Suite, ''[[Gaspard de la Nuit|Gaspard de la Nuit: Trois poèmes pour piano d'après Aloysius Bertrand]]'', of three piano pieces by [[Maurice Ravel]] based on three items, namely 'Ondine', 'Scarbo' and 'Le Gibet'. This was first performed in 1909.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - 26Oct2001 - Ravel: Gaspard de la Nuit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/oct/26/shopping.artsfeatures3|title=Ravel: Gaspard de la Nuit|last=Clements|first=Andrew|date=26 October 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Le Gibet' was one of the supplementary pieces not included in the original 1836 manuscript, and the version of 'Scarbo' alluded to by Ravel was in the same category. The original 'Scarbo' (a different text), and 'Ondine', are numbers (ii) and (ix) respectively of the third book of Fantaisies, ''La Nuit et ses Prestiges''.&lt;ref&gt;B. Guégan, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'' (1925): '(ii) Scarbo' and '(ix) Ondine' in the manuscript, pp. 89-90 and 106-07; Pièces détachées, 'Le Gibet' pp. 217-18 and 'Scarbo' (as quoted by Ravel), pp. 219-20.&lt;/ref&gt; When Ravel wrote his music, the 1925 edition based on the manuscript had not yet been published.

==Translations==
The book has been largely unknown outside France, particularly in English-speaking countries, owing mostly to the lack of translations. Translated excerpts from the book appeared early on in various publications. Paul Zweig's 1964 compilation entitled ''A Selection from Gaspard of the Night'' is one example. However, there was no complete English translation of ''Gaspard'' until that in 1977 by John T. Wright, a professor of French and English at the [[University of South Carolina]], based on the 1925 Bertrand Guégan edition of the 1836 manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Wright, ''Louis "Aloysius" Bertrand's Gaspard de la Nuit: Fantasies in the Manner of Rembrandt and Callot'', 1st Edn. (Washington, University Press of America 1977); 2nd Edn. (Lanham, MD, University Press of America, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; A translation and adaptation by the poet [[Donald Sidney-Fryer]] published in 2004 includes notes and introductory studies.&lt;ref&gt;Aloysius Bertrand, ''Gaspard de la Nuit'', Translated and adapted by Donald Sidney-Fryer (Black Coat Press, Encino, California 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hasbro Universe''' is referred to several [[Shared universe|shared]] [[fictional universes]] featuring characters from several franchises owned by [[toy]] company [[Hasbro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Transformers, G.I.

== Comics ==
=== Marvel Comics (1979–2004) ===
Since 1979, [[Marvel Comics]] has published its own comic books based on ''[[G.I. Joe]]'', ''[[Micronauts]]'', ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' and ''[[Transformers]]'', set in [[Earth-616]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]]. However, the ''Transformers'' and ''G.I. Joe'' series were later established non-canon (they set on Earth-91274). Some of the crossover series featuring both Hasbro and Marvel characters were ''The X-Men and the Micronauts'' (guest starring the [[X-Men]]) and ''[[New Avengers/Transformers]]'' (guest starring the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]). Despite the licensing rights reverting to Hasbro, indirect references to ''Rom'' and ''Micronauts'' have occurred since.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== Dreamwave Productions (2004) ===
On 2004, [[Dreamwave Productions]] published ''Transformers/G.I. Joe'', another crossover set in the time of [[World War I]], and including a one-shot titled ''Transformers/G.I. Joe: Divided Front''. This series only lasted six issues, due to Dreamwave's bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== IDW Publishing (2005–present) ===
{{Main|Hasbro Comic Book Universe|Hasbro Reconstruction}}

Between 2005 and 2008, [[IDW Publishing]] acquired the license to make comics based on ''Transformers'' and ''G.I. Joe'', but neither have ever shared the same [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] before.

== Television ==
=== Marvel Productions and Sunbow Productions (1983–1987) ===
From 1983 to 1987, [[Marvel Productions]] and [[Sunbow Productions]] developed the series ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]'', ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''[[Jem (TV series)|Jem]]'' and ''[[Inhumanoids]]''. These series had been hinted to share the same universe, mostly due to the appearance of the character named [[Hector Ramirez (Sunbow)|Hector Ramirez]].{{Citation needed|reason=Ni official link to be|date=December 2016}}

=== ''Transformers: Aligned'' continuity (2010–2017) ===
The ''Transformers: Aligned'' continuity (comprising the animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'') features a reference to [[M.A.S.K.]] as a division of the United States military that developed a special vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' - Season 3: ''Beast Hunters'' - Episode 5: Project Predacon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'' - Season 1 - Episode 17: One of Our Mini-Cons is Missing&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph C. Lewis''' (born 5 February 1937) is a British businessman and investor, who currently lives in [[New Providence]] in the [[Bahamas]].

Lewis' total wealth is estimated at $US5 billion, and he is listed as the 388th richest person in ''[[Forbes]]''’ 2018 list of billionaires. Forbes reported that Lewis is the 12th wealthiest person in the UK, {{as of|2018|3|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

==Early life==
Lewis was born to a [[British Jews|Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejpress.org/article/7664 European Jewish Press: "Jewish businessmen prominent in British 'Rich List'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414013555/http://www.ejpress.org/article/7664 |date=14 April 2012 }} 24 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324439804578112891365453074?mod=WSJ_topics_obama Wall Street Journal: "Star of David, For Entertainment Only"] 11 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; family above a [[public house]] in Roman Road, [[Bow, London]].&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"&gt;Luscombe, Richard and Teather, David. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/22/creditcrunch.moneyinvestments "The East Ender who blew a billion dollars in a day"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 March 2008. Retrieved 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis left school at 15 to help run his father's [[West End of London|West End]] catering business, Tavistock Banqueting. When he took the reins, he quickly expanded it by selling luxury goods to American tourists, and also owned West End club the Hanover Grand, where he gave [[Robert Earl]] his first job.&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt; He later sold the business in 1979 to make his initial wealth.

==Currency trading==
After selling the family business in the late 1970s, Lewis moved into [[currency trading]] in the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in his move to the Bahamas where he is now a [[tax exile]].&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt; In September 1992, Lewis teamed up with [[George Soros]] to bet on the pound crashing out of the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. The event, which was dubbed [[Black Wednesday]], made Lewis very wealthy, and some say he made more than Soros.&lt;ref name= "Profile"&gt;Bowers, Simon. [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/14/2 "Profile: Joe Lewis"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/joe-lewis | work=Forbes | title=Billionaires: March 2011 - Profile: Joe Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis is still an active [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange trader]].&lt;ref name="World’s Billionaires 2013"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/joe-lewis/| work=Forbes| title=World’s Billionaires 2013 | date=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tavistock Group==
{{main|Tavistock Group}}
Lewis is the main investor in Tavistock Group, which owns more than 200 companies in 15 countries. Tavistock Group's portfolio includes:
*Lake Nona Medical City
*Life sciences
*Sports teams: [[Tottenham Hotspur]] via [[ENIC Group]]. Formerly owned stakes in [[Glasgow Rangers F.C.]] and [[Slavia Prague]].&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt;

===Property===
Lewis hosts the [[Tavistock Cup]] tournament every March in Florida, raising millions of dollars for charity, and owns three of the four clubs that compete: Albany, [[Lake Nona Golf &amp; Country Club]] and [[Isleworth Golf &amp; Country Club]]. Lewis built a golf community in the Bahamas called Albany, which opened in October 2010. Tiger Woods and Ernie Els are also major shareholders in the luxury resort community located in New Providence. Lewis made a £70 million investment in Bulgarian property development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/construction_and_property/article2510919.ece | title=Joe Lewis takes aim at Bulgaria | author=Jenny Davey | publisher=''[[The Sunday Times]]'' | date=27 September 2007 | accessdate=14 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lake Nona Medical City====
{{main|Lake Nona Medical City}}
Lewis seeded Lake Nona, covering 7,000 acres next to Orlando’s international airport, with $100 million in gifts and land which was cultivated into a large-scale community offering research and educational facilities, hospitals for veterans and children, a town center, and a range of workspaces and residential options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/realestate/08medical.html | work=New York Times | title=Orlando’s Newest Attraction Is Medical | date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Escondido Lake and controversy====
Since Lewis bought a property in [[Río Negro Province]], Argentina, public access to Escondido lake has been under discussion. The Argentine law asserts that every water course is public and of free access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/politica/joe-lewis-magnate-lago-escondido_0_V1cE1_yCl.html ¿Quién es Joe Lewis, el magnate dueño de Lago Escondido?], Clarín, 26 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Lewis was ordered by the Superior Tribunal de Justicia (STJ) to create and keep access to the lake, with "sufficient signage and to keep it transitable", but the ruling has not been enforced. Lewis' frontman Van Ditmer stated: "We are going to defend the private property with the Winchester in the hands; with blood if needed".&lt;ref name="cholilaonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cholilaonline.com/2017/01/joe-lewis-el-verdadero-patron-del-mal.html|title=Joe Lewis, el verdadero patrón del mal de la Patagonia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis' property encircles the lake. While some have called for another public mountain trail to be built to access the lake, El Consejo de Ecología y Medio Ambiente de Río Negro (the Council of Ecology and Environment of Río Negro) does not support building another pass, which would cause harm to the environmentally protected area.

He is currently planning to use a huge protected area, 4 times the size of the city of Buenos Aires, for another private development, against the wishes of the locals. The property was bought for 69 pesos per hectare, currently about $4 USD. This low price was secured by using the name of a local 'poblador' on the deed, after which it was transferred to him. It is suggested that the Hidden Lake property is needed to supply water and (hydraulic) energy to this new property, dubbed the private state in Patagonia. In January 2017, new mass protests have started in El Bolson against this project.&lt;ref name="cholilaonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cholilaonline.com/2017/01/dia-historico-en-el-bolson-mas-de-15.html|title=Día histórico en El Bolsón: Más de 15 mil personas marcharon contra el loteo de Joe Lewis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bear Stearns===
{{main|Bear Stearns}}
On 10 September 2007, Lewis paid [[US$]]860.4 million in an all-cash purchase of a 7% stake in Bear Stearns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aasVn8g.o2Js&amp;refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Bear Stearns Gains on Speculation About Stake Sale (Update5) | date=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2007 Lewis had raised his stake at the brokerage firm to 9.4%, a total of 11 million shares, for which he paid an average price of $107 apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601213&amp;sid=aIOoem3ab3bo&amp;refer=home | work=Bloomberg | title=Lewis, Barrow Hanley Lose Combined $2 Billion on Bear (Update2) | date=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the purchase of [[Bear Stearns]] by [[JP Morgan]] for $10 a share, it was estimated that Lewis lost $1.16 billion on his investment.&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120571021671940207 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=A Stake Through the Heart | first=Cassell | last=Bryan-Low | date=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalalchemy.tv/2008/03/joseph-lewis-lost-1-billion-in-bear.html|title=Joseph Lewis: "I Lost $1 Billion in Bear Stearns"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitchells &amp; Butlers===
{{main|Mitchells &amp; Butlers}}
Lewis is the largest shareholder in the British [[public house]] group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, controlling 26.85% of the issued share capital through his investment vehicle Piedmont, which he built up since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/18/mitchells-butlers-no-one-to-call-time | author=Jenny Davey | accessdate=24 September 2011 | work=The Guardian | title=Mitchells &amp; Butlers: the giant pub company with no one to call 'time' | location=London | date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jc-thn-ws3.thejc.com/business/alex-brummer-business/32817/joe-lewis-still-has-midas-touch The Jewish Chronicle: "Joe Lewis still has that midas touch" by Alex Brummer] 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on 27 August 2011 that Lewis had made a zero premium proposal for the pub group of 224p a share. He later revealed on 12 September 2011 that he was considering raising his earlier offer to 230p a share, a 4.5% premium. However, independent M&amp;B board members rejected the offer as "significantly undervaluing" the business.

==Personal life==
Lewis has been married twice. 
His first marriage to Esther Browne ended in divorce. They had two children: 
Vivienne Lewis Silverton is seen as his "heir"&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt; and serves on Tavistock's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tavistock.com/team/ Tavistock Website: Board of Directors] retrieved 8 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityam.com/the-capitalist/harriet-dennys/joe-lewis-clan-bears-his-fourth-generation City AM: "JOE LEWIS CLAN BEARS HIS FOURTH GENERATION" by HARRIET DENNYS] 23 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She is divorced from Toby Silverton, the former chairman of [[Bristol Cars]], once fully owned by Tavistock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristolcars.co.uk/past/#2 Britol Cars: "The end of the second era - 1997-2011"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310235540/http://www.bristolcars.co.uk/past/ |date=10 March 2013 }} retrieved 31 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/bristol-cars-exclusive-anonymity/ New York Times: "Bristol Cars: Exclusive Anonymity" By NICK KURCZEWSKI] 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Undefined-Headline/story-11237972-detail/story.html This Is Bristol: "Bristol Cars - Memorable Motors" by Gerry Brook] 8 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Charles Lewis lives in Argentina,&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt; Lewis is now married to Jane Lewis.&lt;ref name= "The East Ender"/&gt;

==Art collection==
Lewis' art collection is estimated to be worth $1 billion, includes works by [[Picasso]], [[Matisse]], [[Lucian Freud]] and sculptor [[Henry Moore]].&lt;ref name="World’s Billionaires 2013"/&gt; Lewis bought [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]'s ''Triptych 1974–1977'' in 2008 for £26.3 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/07/art.artnews |author=Mark Brown |title=What recession?

The festival has grown since 1994, in terms of the number of shows presented, venues occupied, and tickets purchased, to become the largest [[unjuried]] fringe festival in the United States, a distinction it held until 2018 when it was overtaken by the [[Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival]] and the [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Capital Fringe Festival]].&lt;ref name="die" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Considine |first1=Basil |title=Fringe File 2018 #26 – Official Numbers; MN Fringe No Longer Largest In United States |url=https://twincitiesarts.com/2018/08/23/fringe-file-2018-26-official-numbers-mn-fringe-no-longer-largest-in-united-states/ |accessdate=October 7, 2018 |work=Twin Cities Arts Reader |date=August 23, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007213245/https://twincitiesarts.com/2018/08/23/fringe-file-2018-26-official-numbers-mn-fringe-no-longer-largest-in-united-states/ |archivedate=October 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, over 50,000 tickets were sold for the first time, and in 2015, more performances took place (909) and tickets were sold (50,338) than in any other year.

The '''Los Angeles County Arts Commission''' provides leadership in cultural services of all disciplines for the largest county in the [[United States]], encompassing 88 [[Municipality|municipalities]]. The Arts Commission provides leadership and staffing to support the County-wide collaboration for [[arts in education|arts education]] called the Arts Ed Collective, administers a grants program that funds more than 400 nonprofit arts organizations annually, oversees the County's Civic Art Program for capital projects, funds the largest arts internship program in the country in conjunction with the [[Getty Foundation]] and supports the Los Angeles County Cultural Calendar on Discover LA and Spacefinder LA, a site connecting artists and arts organizations. The Commission also produces free community programs, including a year-round music program that funds free concerts in public sites.

==History==
The Los Angeles County Arts Commission was established in 1947. In the first two decades of its inception the  LA County Arts Commission primarily funded professional and community music groups such as orchestras and was known as the Music Commission. In 1966, the Commission changed its name to the Los Angeles County Music and Performing Arts Commission and also brought under its funding umbrella dance and theater organizations.  

In 1985, the Los Angeles County Music and Performing Arts Commission received additional funding for the first time from the state arts agency, the California Arts Council (CAC). This enabled it to support a larger number of community-based arts organizations from varying disciplines.

In 1997 the Los Angeles County Music and Performing Arts Commission changed its name to the Los Angeles County Arts Commission to signify the organization's equal support to all art disciplines.

'''Ludlow Street''' runs between [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston]] and [[Division Street (Manhattan)|Division]] Streets on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]. Vehicular traffic runs south on this [[one-way street]].

==Name==
Ludlow Street was named after Lieutenant [[Augustus Ludlow]], the naval officer who was second-in-command to Captain [[James Lawrence]] on the [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|USS ''Chesapeake'']] during the ship’s engagement with [[HMS Shannon (1806)|HMS ''Shannon'']] on June 1, 1813.  It was to Ludlow that Lawrence said "Don't give up the ship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite streetbook}}, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
The land that is now Ludlow Street was once part of the huge De Lancey Estate,&lt;ref name=gotham476&gt;{{cite gotham}}, p.476&lt;/ref&gt; which had been confiscated from James De Lancey after the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], due to his status as a Loyalist, and auctioned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gotham}}, pp.267-68&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 19th century, speculative builders had constructed decent housing for workers on Ludlow Street, as well as other streets nearby, such as Eldridge, [[Forsyth Street|Forsyth]] and [[Chrystie Street|Chrystie]] Streets.&lt;ref name=gotham476 /&gt; At mid-century, Ludlow was in the middle of ''[[Kleindeutschland]]'', where large numbers of German-speaking immigrants had settled, and was one of the informal boundaries of the Jewish section of the neighborhood, along with [[Grand Street (Manhattan)|Grand]], [[Stanton Street|Stanton]], and Pitt Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gotham}}, p.745&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and music scene===
As far back as 1962 ''[[Theatre of Eternal Music]]'' members [[Tony Conrad]] and [[Angus MacLise]] lived and worked at 56 Ludlow&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watson, ''Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties'', Pantheon, New York, 2003, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1965 [[Lou Reed]], [[John Cale]] and [[Sterling Morrison]] of [[The Velvet Underground]] lived and recorded there. The earliest known recorded version of ''[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]'' was recorded there.&lt;ref&gt;Fricke, David, liner notes for the ''Peel Slowly and See'' box set (Polydor, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other filmmakers, performers, poets, artists and musicians that lived in the building at the time included [[Warhol superstars]] [[Mario Montez]] and [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323596204578241620759540276 "Incubator for the Velvet Underground"], ''Wall Street Journal'' (January 20, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Conrad has produced two CDs from the [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] tape archives subtitled  ''56 Ludlow Street'' that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack Smith - Les Evening Gowns Damnees - 56 Ludlow Street 1962-1964, Volume I''  and  ''Jack Smith - Silent Shadows On Cinemaroc Island - 56 Ludlow Street 1962-1964 Volume II''. Label: Table of the Elements. CDs released in 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-1970s Gary Weis made some short films of [[Taylor Mead]] talking to his cat in the kitchen of his Ludlow Street apartment called ''Taylor Mead's Cat''.  From 1980 to the mid-80s actor/videomaker Craig Calman lived in the building adjoining Taylor Mead's.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Dan [http://www.thelmagazine.com/3/11/NYCProfiles/nycprofiles.cfm "Taylor Mead, Superstar:The Life and Times of a Downtown Legend"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120914024636/http://www.thelmagazine.com/3/11/NYCProfiles/nycprofiles.cfm |date=2012-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An excerpt from Tyler Hubby's film ''Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present'' documents Tony Conrad making a [[field recording]] on Ludlow Street.

In the early 1980s, Ludlow Street was well known as a street where [[no wave]] [[Colab]] artists connected with [[ABC No Rio]] lived; such as [[Kiki Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], "The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984", [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fab Five Freddy]], [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]], [[Tom Otterness]], Beatrice (Bebe) Smith, Izhar Patkin, Tron Von Hollywood, [[Wolfgang Staehle]], Raina Jane Sherry, Christof Kohlhofer, [[Carlo McCormick]], Cara Perlman, [[Steven Parrino]], Edwige Belmore, [[Joseph Nechvatal]], Uli Rimkus, [[Peter Fend]], [[Walter Robinson (art critic and artist)|Walter Robinson]], [[Aline Mare]], Emily XYZ, and [[George Condo]]. In 1980, [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]] made a video called ''Ludlow'' about Ludlow Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orensanznyc.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/les-on-the-screen-film-series-up-coming-screening-october-3-coleen-fitzgibbon-stephanie-gray/ "'LES on the Screen' Film Series: Screening October 3, 2011: Coleen Fitzgibbon &amp; Stephanie Gray]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1983 to 1989, the bimonthly cassette publication [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] was based out of 143 Ludlow Street. Leonard Abrams started the [[East Village Eye]] cultural magazine at 167 Ludlow Street. In 1989 the [[Beastie Boys]] used a photo of the southwest corner of Ludlow and [[Rivington Street]] as the cover for their album ''[[Paul's Boutique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gothamist.com/2006/04/19/nyc_album_art_p.php NYC Album Art: Paul's Boutique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415205746/http://www.gothamist.com/2006/04/19/nyc_album_art_p.php |date=2007-04-15 }}, accessed April 26, 2007. "According to the album, Paul's Boutique is in [[Brooklyn]]...but we all know this photo was taken in the [[Lower East Side]]. With a Paul's Boutique sign hanging up on the Lee's Sportswear storefront, the shot was taken at 99 Rivington Street, where Rivington and Ludlow intersect."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the two level loft at 58 Ludlow was the home to artists such as Alex Hahn, Douglas Eisenstark,&lt;ref&gt;[http://Douglaseisenstark.com Douglas Eisenstark]&lt;/ref&gt; David Blair and Leslie Mentel, among others. Wolfgang Staehle presented an extended digital photographic record of Ludlow Street in his exhibition at [[Postmasters Gallery]] in 2016/2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2017/02/film/Wolfgang-Staehle-Ludlow-Street Keith Sanborn art review of Wolfgang Staehle at The Brooklyn Rail]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentrification===
In the mid- to late 1990s, the increasing popularity of the area among [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]], driven out of the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] by an invasion of [[yuppie]]s, led to an upturn in activity along Ludlow Street, with several old establishments, such as corner delis (a.k.a. [[convenience store|bodegas)]] closing shop to make way for [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[music venue]]s such as the Ludlow Street Bar &amp; Grill (a basement restaurant and music venue), and [[Theatre|alternative theatres]] such as [[Collective: Unconscious|Collective:Unconscious Theater]] (before it became an empty lot), [[Piano's|Piano's Theater]] (before it became a music venue and bar), and Todo Con Nada (before it became The Dark Room).

In the 2000s, Ludlow Street was a destination street for musicians and music-lovers, and was heavily populated with fashion shops, art galleries, bars, restaurants, and performance venues such as [[Cake Shop NYC|Cake Shop]], [[The Living Room]], and [[Piano's]] making Ludlow into a small nightlife strip with a distinct subcultural flavor. Local institutions included the bistro/cafe Pink Pony, the adjacent artist bar Max Fish, [[Katz's Deli]] (one of the city's most famous [[delicatessen]]s) Motor City bar, Ludlow Street Guitars, Earthmatters Cafe (hangout of musicians/actors/writers/techies), Ludlow Studio (which was home to some of the top recording artists in the mid-1990s) and the Sombrero Mexican restaurant, better known to a generation of musicians as "The Hat." The art and cultural gallery Ludlow 38 is the downtown satellite for contemporary art of the [[Goethe-Institut]] New York. The space was designed by artists Ethan Breckenridge and [[Liam Gillick]]. In 2005 artist [[Wolfgang Staehle]] created ''One day of life on Ludlow Street (New York)''. The work consists of 6716 images displayed in approximately 8 second intervals over 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutiondelart.net/edla/artists/w_staehle.html ''One day of life on Ludlow Street (New York)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Ludlow Street between Delancey and Houston Streets lost to rising rent many small interesting shops, bars and cafes that once gave the street its distinctive flavor. Closed were: Pink Pony Cafe Littéraire &amp; Ciné Club, the print shop at 139 Ludlow, Press Tea, Earth Matters natural food store and Motor City bar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thevillager.com/2013/02/21/pink-pony-had-a-great-ride-but-couldnt-buck-changes/ The Villager: Pink Pony had a great ride, but couldn’t buck changes]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Banksy]] installed a major [[street art]] installation on Ludlow Street in the fall of 2013 as part of his ''[[Better Out Than In]]'' residency: a strange vision of horses with camera-lens googles rearing up by a car covered with cowering humans. The work is Banksy’s largest New York work to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperallergic.com/87431/banksy-watch-new-work-in-les-red-hook-work-protected/ "Banksy Watch: New Work in LES"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Correggio,_madonna_col_bambino_tra_due_angeli_musicanti.jpg|thumb|350px]]
The '''''Madonna and Child with Two Musician Angels''''' is an oil on panel painting by [[Correggio]], now in the [[Uffizi]] in Florence. Some date it to 1514-15 but it is more commonly dated to 1515-16.

==History==
On the back of the painting is a 16th century monogram from the grand-ducal gallery in Florence, showing the identification number 2523, which does not feature in any of the lists of the gallery's holdings at that time. Though it cannot be clearly traced in any 17th century inventories, it was probably one of the works taken to [[Düsseldorf]] by [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]] in 1691 on her marriage to [[John William, Elector Palatine]] and which (after John William's death in 1717) were brought back to Florence. The first official mention places the work in the inventory of the Gallerie fiorentine in 1798, in the Sala dei Maestri Italiani, where it remained until the mid 19th century. Many copies were commissioned from the 18th century onwards, attesting to its popularity. It was then attributed to [[Titian]], but [[Giovanni Morelli (art historian)|Giovanni Morelli]] reattributed it as an early work by a young Correggio - this became the dominant attribution, supported by "the minute technical execution and the clear and shining colours".

==History==
While driving cross-country in 1991, actors [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]] and [[Ethan Hawke]] and playwright [[Jonathan Marc Sherman]] decided to form a theater company.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Emma (February 8, 2013).

[http://nymag.com/arts/theater/profiles/63419/ "The Ethan Hawke Actors Studio,"] ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''. Retrieved September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard later explained, "We would be sitting around New York a lot, and we bowled a lot, and eventually we thought, 'When we're not doing anything, why don't we see if we can put some new plays on?'"&lt;ref name="baltimore"&gt;Rousuck, J. Wynn (March 16, 1997). [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-03-16/news/1997075159_1_glass-menagerie-robert-sean-leonard-vasen/2 "Model Role Actor,"] ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. Retrieved September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaparte's first production was a new translation of [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s 1918 play ''[[:it:Ma non è una cosa seria (Pirandello)|A Joke]]'' starring Hamilton, Hawke, Sherman, [[Cynthia Nixon]], and [[Austin Pendleton]], which ran from October 9–31, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, John, ed.

Come see a new play by an American playwright!"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Amy (October 19, 2015).

'''Muse''' are&lt;!-- Bands that originate from the UK are treated plural, per British English criteria. Please do ''not'' change "ARE" to "IS". --&gt; an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Teignmouth|Teignmouth, Devon]], formed in 1994. The band consists of [[Matt Bellamy]] (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), [[Chris Wolstenholme]] (bass guitar, backing vocals), and [[Dominic Howard]] (drums).

Muse signed to Maverick Records and released their debut album, ''[[Showbiz (album)|Showbiz]]'', in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's [[falsetto]] and a melancholic [[alternative rock]] style. Their second album, ''[[Origin of Symmetry]]'' (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and [[Romantic music|romantic classical]] influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances.&lt;ref name="iTunes"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/muse/1093360 |title=Muse biography |website=itunes.apple.com |access-date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Absolution (album)|Absolution]]'' (2003) saw further classical influence, with [[orchestra]] on tracks such as "[[Butterflies and Hurricanes]]", and became the first of five consecutive [[Lists of UK Albums Chart number ones|UK number-one albums]].

''[[Black Holes and Revelations]]'' (2006) incorporated [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Pop music|pop]] elements, displayed in singles such as "[[Supermassive Black Hole (song)|Supermassive Black Hole]]".&lt;ref name="iTunes"/&gt; The album brought Muse wider international success. ''[[The Resistance (album)|The Resistance]]'' (2009) and ''[[The 2nd Law]]'' (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, ''[[Drones (Muse album)|Drones]]'' (2015), was a [[concept album]] about [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone warfare]] and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, ''[[Simulation Theory (album)|Simulation Theory]]'' (2018), prominently featured [[synthesiser]]s and was influenced by [[science fiction]] and the [[simulation hypothesis]].

Muse have won [[List of awards and nominations received by Muse|numerous awards]], including two [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Brit Awards]], five [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] and eight [[NME Awards]]. In 2012 they received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for International Achievement from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]]. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/muse-glastonbury-review-at-heart-muse-are-an-old-fashioned-heavy/ |title=Muse, Glastonbury, review: they are, at heart, an old fashioned heavy rock band who can really really play |date=25 June 2016 |website=Telegraph.co.uk |access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1994–98: Formation and early years===
The members of Muse played in separate school bands during their stay at [[Teignmouth Community College]] in the early 1990s. Guitarist [[Matt Bellamy]] successfully auditioned for drummer [[Dominic Howard]]'s band, Carnage Mayhem, becoming its singer and songwriter. They renamed the band Gothic Plague. They asked [[Chris Wolstenholme]]–at that time the drummer for Fixed Penalty–to join as bassist; he agreed and took up bass lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Rock |last=Buckley |first=Peter |date=17 November 2003 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=1843531054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International who's who in popular music, Volume 4'' p.37. Routledge, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The band was renamed Rocket Baby Dolls and adopted a [[Gothic rock|goth]]-[[Glam rock|glam]] image. Around this time the band received a £150 grant from [[The Prince's Trust]] for equipment, leading to supporting the Trust through a gig at the Albert Hall on  3 December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Jools Holland interview, 10 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Rocket Baby Dolls won a local [[battle of the bands]], smashing their equipment in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2016/01/22/rocket-baby-dolls-muse-original-band-name-battle-of-the-bands/ |title=Watch "Rocket Baby Dolls" Later Known As Muse Win Battle of the Bands 1994 |website=feelnumb |date=22 January 2016 |access-date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellamy said, "It was supposed to be a protest, a statement, so, when we actually won, it was a real shock, a massive shock. After that, we started taking ourselves seriously." The band quit their jobs, changed their name to Muse, and moved away from Teignmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tastemedia.com/muse/musebiog.html |title=Muse Biography |website=Artists |publisher=Taste Music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021208040122/http://www.tastemedia.com/muse/musebiog.html |archive-date=8 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Muse" was supposedly inspired by Matthew Bellamy's art teacher Samuel Theoun. The band liked that it was short and thought that it looked good on a poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8176141/Muse-profile-of-the-band.html |title=Muse: Profile of the Band |website=The Telegraph |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185130/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8176141/Muse-profile-of-the-band.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Mark Beaumont, the band wanted the name to reflect "the sense Matt had that he had somehow 'summoned up' this band, the way mediums could summon up inspirational spirits at times of emotional need".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Beaumont (2010). "Out of This World: The Story of Muse". Omnibus Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998–2000: First EPs and ''Showbiz''===
{{Main article|Showbiz (album)}}
After a few years building a fanbase, Muse played their first gigs in London and [[Manchester]] supporting [[Skunk Anansie]] on tour. They had a significant meeting with Dennis Smith, the owner of [[Sawmills Studio]], situated in a converted water mill in [[Cornwall]]. He had seen the three boys grow up as he knew their parents, and had a production company with their future manager [[Safta Jaffery]], with whom he had recently started the record label [[Taste Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Safta_Jaffery_Interview.html |title=Interview with Safta Jaffery, manager for Muse |publisher=HitQuarters |accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting led to their first serious recordings and the release of the [[Muse (EP)|''Muse'' EP]] on 11 May 1998 on Sawmills' in-house [[Dangerous Records|Dangerous]] label, produced by [[Paul Reeve]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Myers (2007). "Muse: Inside the Muscle Museum". p. 58. Random House,&lt;/ref&gt; Their second EP, the ''[[Muscle Museum EP]]'', also produced by Reeve, was released on 11 January 1999. It reached number 3 in the indie singles chart and attracted the attention of British radio broadcaster [[Steve Lamacq]] and the weekly British music publication ''NME''.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Later in 1999, Muse performed on the Emerging Artist's stage at [[Woodstock '99]] and signed with Smith and Jaffery. [[File:Muse logo.svg|thumb|right|200px|The Muse logo, incorporated chiefly since the release of [[Muse (EP)|''Muse'' EP]] in 1998]]Despite the success of their second EP, British record companies were reluctant to sign Muse. After a trip to New York's CMJ Festival, Nanci Walker, then Sr. Director of A&amp;R at Columbia Records, flew Muse to the US to showcase for Columbia Records' then-Senior Vice-President of A&amp;R, [[Tim Devine]], as well as for American Recording's Rick Rubin. During this trip, on 24 December 1998, Muse signed a deal with American record label Maverick Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ticketmaster.ie/artist/944747 |title=Muse biography |website=Ticketmaster |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420013322/http://www.ticketmaster.ie/artist/944747 |archive-date=20 April 2008 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their return from America, Taste Media arranged deals for Muse with various record labels in Europe and Australia, allowing them control over their career in individual countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nggEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 |title=''Billboard'' 28 August ust 1999 |publisher=Books.google.com |access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Leckie]] was brought in alongside Reeve to produce the band's first album, ''[[Showbiz (album)|Showbiz]]'' (1999). The album showcased Muse's aggressive yet melancholic musical style, with lyrics about relationships and their difficulties trying to establish themselves in their hometown.&lt;ref&gt;''Showbiz''. Kerrang Review, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001–02: ''Origin of Symmetry'' and ''Hullabaloo''===
{{Main article|Origin of Symmetry|Hullabaloo Soundtrack}}
[[File:Muse at Roskilde Festival 2000.jpg|thumb|right|Muse performing at [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark, July 2000]]
During the production of their second album, ''Origin of Symmetry'' (2001), Muse experimented with instrumentation such as a [[church organ]], [[Mellotron]], animal bones, and an expanded drum kit. There was more of Bellamy's falsetto, [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] guitar, and piano playing. Bellamy cites guitar influences such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Tom Morello]] (of [[Rage Against the Machine]]), the latter evident in the more [[riff]]-based songs in ''Origin of Symmetry'' and in Bellamy's use of guitar [[Pitch shift|pitch-shifting effects]].&lt;ref name="bellamy"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/muses_matt_bellamy_talks.html |title=Muse's Matt Bellamy Talks |date=25 December 2003 |publisher=Ultimate-Guitar.com (possibly reprinted from ''Total Guitar'' (UK Magazine)) |access-date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Not in refs|date=October 2017}} The album features a cover of [[Anthony Newley]] and [[Leslie Bricusse]]'s "[[Feeling Good]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.microcuts.net/uk/news/archives/06242003-nme_article.php |title=NME article |work=NME |access-date=19 January 2008 |date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; voted in various polls one of the greatest cover versions of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.totalguitar.co.uk/page/totalguitar?entry=tg_s_best_covers_ever |title=TG's Best Covers EVER! |date=23 June 2008 |publisher=''[[Total Guitar]]'' |access-date=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/muse/53090 |title=Muse beat The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash to win best cover song of all time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104211343/http://www.nme.com/news/muse/53090 |archive-date=4 January 2016 |website=NME |date=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29791820 |title=Pet Shop Boys' Always On My Mind tops cover version vote |date=27 October 2014 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released as a [[double A-side]] single, "[[Hyper Music/Feeling Good]]".

''Origin of Symmetry'' received positive reviews by critics; NME gave the album 9/10 and wrote: "It's amazing for such a young band to load up with a heritage that includes the darker visions of [[Kurt Cobain|Cobain]] and [[Kafka]], [[Mahler]] and [[The Tiger Lillies]], [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], and make a sexy, populist album."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/muse/5220 |title=Origin of Symmetry – Review |last=Morton |first=Roger |website=NME |access-date=4 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maverick, Muse's American label, did not consider Bellamy's vocals "radio-friendly" and asked Muse to rerecord the song for the US release. The band refused and left Maverick; the album was not released in the US until September 2005, after Muse signed to Warner Bros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wIe3FI6TI0C&amp;pg=PA53 |title=Pomp and Circumstance |magazine=SPIN |date=September 2009 |access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KisEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |title=Dark Matter |publisher=CMJ |magazine=New Music Monthly |issue=123/124 |access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Origin of Symmetry'' has made appearances on lists of the greatest rock albums of the 2000s, both poll-based and on publication lists. In 2006, it placed at number 74 on ''Q'' magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All-Time,&lt;ref name="Q Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timepieces.nl/Top100's/2006Qreaders.html|title=Q Greatest Albums of All Time|accessdate=12 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020204335/http://www.timepieces.nl/Top100's/2006Qreaders.html|archivedate=20 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in February 2008, the album placed at number 28 on a list of the Best British Albums of All Time determined by the magazine's readers. ''Kerrang!'' placed the album at number 20 in its 100 Best British Rock Albums Ever! List and at number 13 on its 50 Best Albums of the 21st Century list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muse Message Board Lists|publisher=Kerrang!|url=http://board.muse.mu/archive/index.php/t-63823.html|accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acclaimed Music]] ranks ''Origin of Symmetry'' as the 1,247th greatest album of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muse|publisher=[[Acclaimed Music]]|date=2009-12-14|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/Muse.htm|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Muse released the first live DVD, ''[[Hullabaloo Soundtrack#DVD|Hullabaloo]]'', featuring footage recorded during Muse's two gigs at [[Le Zenith]] in Paris in 2001, and a documentary film of the band on tour. A double album, ''Hullabaloo Soundtrack'', was released at the same time, containing a compilation of [[B-side]]s and a disc of recordings of songs from the Le Zenith performances. A double-A side single was also released featuring the new songs "[[In Your World]]" and "[[Dead Star/In Your World|Dead Star]]".

In 2002, Muse threatened [[Celine Dion]] with legal action when she planned to name her [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] show "Muse", despite the band owning the worldwide performing rights to the name. Dion offered Muse $50,000 for the rights, but they turned it down and Dion backed down. Bellamy said "We don't want to turn up there with people thinking we're Celine Dion's backing band."&lt;ref name="celine"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2339585.stm |title=Band muses on Dion name victory |date=18 October 2002 |access-date=19 January 2008 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muse's third album, ''Absolution,'' produced by [[Rich Costey]], [[Paul Reeve]] and [[John Cornfield]] was released on 15 September 2003. It debuted at number one in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57886/lily-allen-muse-soar-to-no-1-on-uk-charts |title=Lily Allen, Muse Soar To No.&amp;nbsp;1 On U.K. Charts |date=10 July 2006 |website=Billboard |access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced Muse's first top-ten hit, "[[Time Is Running Out (Muse song)|Time Is Running Out]]", and three top-twenty hits: "[[Hysteria (Muse song)|Hysteria]]", "[[Sing for Absolution]]" and "[[Butterflies and Hurricanes]]".

On the 2004 US leg of the tour, Bellamy injured himself onstage during the opening show in Atlanta;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3625153.stm |title=Muse singer hurt during US show |date=14 April 2004 |access-date=27 January 2008 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tour resumed after Bellamy received stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/3307124/We-take-a-juicer-on-tour.html |title='We take a juicer on tour' |website=Telegraph |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327173242/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/3307124/We-take-a-juicer-on-tour.html |archive-date=27 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, Muse headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival]], which they later described as "the best gig of our lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.tv/mtv.tv/dynamo/shells/other_music.jhtml?article=80134066 |title=Artist of the week |date=June 2004 |website=MTV |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215062626/http://www.mtv.tv/mtv.tv/dynamo/shells/other_music.jhtml?article=80134066 |archive-date=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/muse/28961 |title=Muse: Road To Wembley Part 4 – Glastonbury, triumph and tragedy |date=14 June 2007 |website=NME |location=UK |access-date=27 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard's father, William Howard, who attended the festival to watch the band, died from a heart attack shortly after the performance. Bellamy said: "It was the biggest feeling of achievement we've ever had after coming offstage. It was almost surreal that an hour later his dad died. It was almost not believable. We spent about a week sort of just with Dom trying to support him. I think he was happy that at least his dad got to see him at probably what was the finest moment so far of the band's life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.microcuts.net/uk/biography/ |title=muse: biography |publisher=microcuts.net |access-date=4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Muse released their fourth album, ''Black Holes and Revelations'', co-produced once again with Rich Costey.

Before the release of the new album, Muse made several promotional TV appearances starting on 13 May 2006 at [[BBC]] [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]].

A lot of bands are quite ambitious with their music, mixing lots of different styles – and when I see that I think it's great. I've noticed that kind of thing becoming a bit more mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8266922.stm | title= It's back...

For their second album, ''[[Origin of Symmetry]]'' (2001), Muse wanted to craft a more aggressive sound. In 2000, Wolstenholme said: "Looking back, there isn't much difference sonically between the mellow stuff and the heavier tracks [on ''Showbiz'']. The heavy stuff really could have been a lot heavier and that's what we want to do with [''Origin of Symmetry'']."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microcuts.net/uk/news/archives/2000/09/ |title=muse : archives &amp;#124; microcuts.net &amp;#124; September 2000 |publisher=microcuts.net |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their third album, ''[[Absolution (Muse album)|Absolution]]'' (2003), features prominent string arrangements and began to draw influences from artists such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tntdownunder.com/article/49972/interview-with-muse.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214114231/http://www.tntdownunder.com/article/49972/interview-with-muse.html |title=Interview with Muse |last=Delaney |first=Colin |work=[[TNT (magazine)|TNT]] |date=9 August 2007 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |archivedate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their fourth album, ''[[Black Holes and Revelations]]'' (2006) was influenced by artists like [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], as well as Asian and European music such as [[Naples|Naples music]]; additionally, the band listened to radio stations from the Middle East during the album's recording sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/music/features/muse_0706.htm |work=musicOMH |title=Muse – Intergalacticists Stride Our World |accessdate=12 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107034101/http://www.musicomh.com/music/features/muse_0706.htm |archivedate=7 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen guitarist [[Brian May]] has praised Muse's work, calling the band "extraordinary musicians", who "let their madness show through, always a good thing in an artist."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Masters |first=Tim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8304176.stm |title=Queen star May hails Muse album |publisher=BBC News  |date=13 October 2009 |accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muse's sixth album, ''[[The 2nd Law]]'' (2012) has a broader range of influences, ranging from [[funk]] and [[film scores]] to [[electronica]] and [[dubstep]]. ''The 2nd Law'' is influenced by rock acts such as Queen and [[Led Zeppelin]] (on "[[Supremacy (song)|Supremacy]]") as well as [[dubstep]] producer [[Skrillex]] and [[Nero (band)|Nero]] (on "The 2nd Law: Unsustainable"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2012/07/25/muse-reveals-skrillex-as-major-influence-on-new-album-the-2nd-law/|title=Muse Reveals Skrillex As Major Influence on New Album 'The 2nd Law'|publisher=MTV|accessdate=17 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010085226/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2012/07/25/muse-reveals-skrillex-as-major-influence-on-new-album-the-2nd-law|archivedate=10 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Follow Me (Muse song)|Follow Me]]", with the latter being co-produced by Nero), [[Michael Jackson]], [[Stevie Wonder]] (on "Panic Station" which features musicians who performed on Stevie Wonder's "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_8c7cNxVvc]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118140841/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_8c7cNxVvc|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Hans Zimmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/muse/65524|title=Muse reveal 'The Dark Knight Rises' composer Hans Zimmer is a key influence on 'The 2nd Law'|work=NME|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features two songs with lyrics written and sung by bassist Wolstenholme, who wrote about his battle with [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/muse/65148|title=Muse's Chris Wolstenholme on alcohol battle: 'I had to stop or die'|work=NME|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musicianship===
Many Muse songs are recognizable by vocalist Matt Bellamy's use of [[vibrato]], [[falsetto]], and [[melisma|melismatic phrasing]], influenced by [[Jeff Buckley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/aug/17/artsfeatures.muse |title=Matt Bellamy Interview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305030612/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/aug/17/artsfeatures.muse |archive-date=5 March 2016 |website=The Guardian |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a pianist, Bellamy often uses [[arpeggio]]s. Bellamy's compositions often suggest or quote late [[classical music|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic era]] composers such as [[Sergei Rachmaninov]] (in "[[Space Dementia (song)|Space Dementia]]" and "[[Butterflies and Hurricanes]]"), [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] (in "I Belong to You (Mon Coeur S'ouvre À Ta Voix)") and [[Frédéric Chopin]] (in "[[United States of Eurasia]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/6599450/Muse-interview.html |title=Muse Interview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222235607/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/6599450/Muse-interview.html |archive-date=22 February 2016 |website=Telegraph |access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a guitarist, Bellamy often uses [[arpeggiator]] and [[Pitch shift|pitch-shift]] effects to create a more "electronic" sound, citing [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Tom Morello]] as influences.&lt;ref name="bellamy" /&gt; His guitar playing is also influenced by [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] and [[music of spain|Spanish guitar]] music; Bellamy said: "I just think that music is really passionate...It has so much feel and flair to it. I’ve spent important times of my life in Spain and Greece, and various deep things happened there – falling in love, stuff like that. So maybe that rubbed off somewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/18/muse-matt-bellamy-rocks-backpages-uncut-interview-stephen-dalton-january-2000 |title=Muse's Matt Bellamy: 'We’re not a bunch of boys who’ve got everything, whinging about nothing' |website=The Guardian |accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolstenholme's [[bassline]]s are a central motif of many Muse songs; the band combines bass guitar with effects and synthesisers to create overdriven [[fuzz bass]] tones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bassplayer.com/artists/1171/too-much-is-never-enough-muses-chris-wolstenholme-reinvents-art-rock-bass-for-the-21st-century/25917 |title=Too Much Is Never Enough: Muse’s Chris Wolstenholme Reinvents Art-Rock Bass For The 21st Century |last=BassPlayer.com |first=Electric &amp; Acoustic Bass Gear, Lessons, News, Video, Tabs and Chords - |access-date=19 February 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bellamy and Wolstenholme use touch-screen controllers, often built into their instruments, to control synthesisers and effects including a [[Korg Kaoss Pad|Korg Kaoss pad]] or [[DigiTech Whammy|Digitech Whammy]] pedal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/article/3948-muse-gear-guide-matt-bellamy-s-fx-pedals.html |title=Muse Gear Guide - Matt Bellamy's FX Pedals |publisher=Dolphin Music |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyrics===
Most earlier Muse songs lyrically dealt with introspective themes, including relationships, social alienation, and difficulties they had encountered while trying to establish themselves in their hometown. However, with the band's progress, their song concepts have become more ambitious, addressing issues such as the fear of the evolution of technology in their ''[[Origin of Symmetry]]'' (2001) album. They deal mainly with the [[apocalypse]] in ''[[Absolution (album)|Absolution]]'' (2003) and with catastrophic war in ''[[Black Holes and Revelations]]'' (2006). ''[[The Resistance (album)|The Resistance]]'' (2009) focused on themes of government oppression, uprising, love, and [[panspermia]]. The album itself was mainly inspired by ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]]. Their sixth studio album, ''[[The 2nd Law]]'' (2012) relates to economics, thermodynamics, and apocalyptic themes. Their latest album, ''[[Drones (Muse album)|Drones]]'' (2015) is a concept album that uses autonomous killing drones as a metaphor for brainwashing and loss of empathy.

Books that have influenced Muse's lyrical themes include ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/10000720/new-muse-album-inspired-by-1984 |title=New Muse album 'inspired' by 1984 |last=Cochrane |first=Greg |date=8 April 2009 |website=BBC News |access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Confessions of an Economic Hitman]]'' by [[John Perkins (author)|John Perkins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_78ucyED8E |title=Interview with Matthew Bellamy |publisher=Youtube.com |access-date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hyperspace (book)|Hyperspace]]'' by [[Michio Kaku]],&lt;ref&gt;The Making of Origin of Symmetry.

'''''Old Woman Frying Eggs''''' is a [[genre painting]] by [[Diego Velázquez]], produced during his [[Seville]] period. The date is not precisely known but is thought to be around the turn of 1618 before his definitive move to [[Madrid]] in 1623. The painting is in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Velázquez frequently used working-class characters in early paintings like this one, in many cases using his family as models; the old woman here also appears in his ''[[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Velázquez)|Christ in the House of Martha and Mary]]'' (1618). There is some dispute about what cooking process is actually depicted with some suggesting not [[frying]] but [[Poaching (cooking)|poaching]], leading to an alternative title of the painting, '''''Old Woman Cooking Eggs''''' or '''''Old Woman Poaching Eggs'''''. 

''Old Woman Frying Eggs'' is considered to be one of the strongest of Velázquez's early works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-mx1VLZYnEC&amp;pg=PA58|title=Velázquez|page=58|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=1989|isbn=0870995545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like others, it shows the influence of [[chiaroscuro]], with a strong light source coming in from the left illuminating the woman, her utensils and the poaching eggs, while throwing the background and the boy standing to her right into deep shadow. Here the chiaroscuro is very intense, so much so that it would be impossible to see the wall at the bottom of the painting but for the basket hanging from it; it simultaneously manages to combine the murky darkness and high contrasts of light and shadow with the use of subtle hues and a palette dominated by ochres and browns. The composition is organised as an oval with the middle figures in the nearest plane, thus drawing in the viewer.

The realism is nearly photographic and shows everyday plates, cutlery, pans, pestles, jugs and mortars, capturing the special shine on a glass surface and the light's play on the melon carried by the boy. The boiling pan is particularly well-captured, with its reflections and the whites of the eggs. Velázquez also worked particularly hard on the detail of the two figures's hands.

An '''orphan film''' is a [[motion picture]] work that has been abandoned by its owner or [[copyright]] holder; also, any film that has suffered neglect.

==History==
The exact origin of the term orphan film is unclear.  By the 1990s, however, film archivists were commonly using this colloquialism to refer to motion pictures abandoned by their owners.  Before the end of the decade, the phrase emerged as the governing metaphor for film preservation, first in the United States, then internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Lukow, "The Politics of Orphanage:  The Rise and Impact of the 'Orphan Film' Metaphor on Contemporary Preservation Practice", paper delivered at the University of South Carolina symposium, "Orphans of the Storm:  Saving Orphan Films in the Digital Age", September 23, 1999.  http://www.sc.edu/filmsymposium/archive/orphans2001/lukow.html .  As early as October 1950 ''Industrial Marketing'' magazine referred to 16mm industrial sales movies as orphan films.  Restoration expert Robert Gitt was quoted using the metaphor as early as 1992, to refer to silent-era films, newsreels, and kinescopes.  Robert Epstein, “Mining Hollywood's Old Movie Gold,”  ''Los Angeles Times'', July 16, 1992, p. F1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Historians and archivists define the term in both a narrow and a broad sense.  A report from the [[Librarian of Congress]], ''Film Preservation 1993,'' offered a first definition.  As a category of so-called [[orphan works]], orphan films are those “that lack either clear copyright holders or commercial potential” to pay for their preservation.&lt;ref&gt;''Film Preservation 1993: A Study of the Current State of American Film Preservation: Report of the Librarian Of Congress'',  by Annette Melville and Scott Simmon, Washington, DC: NFPB/LOC, 1993.  https://www.loc.gov/film/study.html&lt;/ref&gt;   However, a much wider group of works fall under the orphan rubric when the term is expanded to refer to all manner of films that have been neglected.  The neglect might be physical (a deteriorated film print), commercial (an unreleased movie), cultural (censored footage), historical (a forgotten World War I-era production) or technical (footage from television commercials and series or music videos).

This broader conception is typically illustrated by a list of orphaned genres.  In ''Redefining Film Preservation: A National Plan'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;''Redefining Film Preservation: A National Plan; Recommendations of the Librarian Of Congress in Consultation with the National Film Preservation Board'', coordinated by Annette Melville and Scott Simmon, Washington, DC: NFPB/LOC, 1994.  https://www.loc.gov/film/plan.html&lt;/ref&gt;  the Librarian of Congress enumerated newsreels, actuality footage, silent films, experimental works, home movies, independent fiction and documentary films, political commercials, amateur footage, along with advertising, educational and industrial films as culturally significant orphans.  To this the National Film Preservation Foundation adds animation, ethnic films, anthropological footage, and fragments.  (See [http://www.filmpreservation.org "What Are Orphan Films"].)

Within a decade the epithet was adopted by scholars and educators.  In ''The Film Experience:  An Introduction'' (2004), for example, Timothy Corrigan and Patricia White include a section on orphan films, defining them simply as "Any sort of films that have survived but have no commercial interests to pay the costs of their preservation."&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Corrigan and Patricia White, ''The Film Experience:  An Introduction'' (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2004), 391–98. They add to the list of orphaned genres government-produced films, citing ''What You Should Know about Biological Warfare'' (1952)  This film is viewable as a digital file at https://archive.org/details/WhatYouS1952  as part of the Prelinger Collection of “ephemeral films.”  Collector-activist [[Rick Prelinger]] is one of the people most responsible for raising awareness of orphan films.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined in this way, more films are orphans than not.  Many are more accurately described as “footage,” recordings shot on celluloid but not intended to be completed works or theatrical releases.  The millions of feet of [[home movies]] and newsreel [[outtakes]] alone outnumber the quantity of film stock used to make all of the [[feature films]] ever released by Hollywood studios.

==Movement==
The resurgent interest in these films is due to their rich value as cultural and historical artifacts.  Documentarians, filmmakers, historians, curators, collectors and scholars have joined forces with archivists because they deem orphans not only historical documents, but also evidence of alternative, suppressed, minority or forgotten histories.

Since 1999, hundreds of these devotees have gathered for the biennial [http://www.nyu.edu/orphanfilm] Orphan Film Symposium]. 
In their introduction to the anthology ''Mining the Home Movie'' (2008) Karen Ishizuka and Patricia Zimmermann assess the impact of these symposiums.

{{Quote|In 1999, film historian Dan Streible and several other interdisciplinary faculty members at the University of South Carolina initiated a symposium on orphan films that drew together archivists, film historians, artists, curators, and other to discuss and screen works within a rigorous scholarly context. Orphan Film Symposium I was entitled “Orphans of the Storm: Saving Orphan Films in the Digital Age” and was held in September 1999. Orphan Film Symposium II, “Documenting the 20th Century,” was held in March 2001; Orphan Film Symposium III, “Sound/Music/Voice: Listening to Orphan Films,” in September 2002; and Orphan Film Symposium IV, “On Location: Place and Region in Forgotten Films,” in March 2004. These four symposia have functioned to generate new research and curatorial activities and have lent increased visibility to the orphan film cause. They have also provided a significant academic and curatorial context for amateur film research.

The Orphan Film symposia, together with an important presence for orphan, amateur, and small-gauge films within the Association of Moving Image Archivists throughout the 1990s and afterward, suggest the coalescing of various international and regional movements to look more closely at these subaltern cinemas.|&lt;ref&gt;Karen L. Ishizuka and Patricia R. Zimmermann, eds. ''Mining the Home Movie: Excavations in Histories and Memories'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008), 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the fifth Orphan Film Symposium ("Science, Industry &amp; Education") took place at the University of South Carolina (March 2006), [[New York University]] took up the project, incorporating it into the Department of Cinema Studies and its Moving Image Archiving and Preservation master's program at the [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. Orphans 6, 7, and 8 took place in New York City. The 2008 symposium focused on neglected films and videos by, about, against, and under "the state." The 2010 edition, "Moving Pictures Around the World," included speakers from 17 nations. In 2012, [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] in Queens co-hosted the eighth symposium, "Made to Persuade". The ninth and tenth symposiums took place at major institutions outside of New York. [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] hosted Orphans 9 ("The Future of Obsolescence," 2014) in Amsterdam, attracting attendees from 30 nations. Orphans 10 ("Sound," 2016) convened at the Library of Congress [[Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation]] in Culpeper, Virginia.
 
In 2001, members of these academic-archival professions began referring to an “orphan film movement.”  As archivist-scholar Caroline Frick has written, some of the most active participants identify themselves as “orphanistas,” passionate advocates for saving, studying, and screening neglected cinema.  In 2004, visual anthropologist Emily Cohen wrote that the movement's creative and intellectual ferment constituted an “Orphanista Manifesto.”&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Frick, ''Restoration Nation:  Motion Picture Archives and 'American' Film Heritage'', PhD diss. University of Texas at Austin, 2005, [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2005/frickd15921/frickd15921.pdf UT Austin library PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604204547/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2005/frickd15921/frickd15921.pdf |date=2011-06-04 }}, and in Frick's ''Saving Cinema: The Politics of Preservation,'' (Oxford University Press, forthcoming); Emily Cohen, “The Orphanista Manifesto: Orphan Films and the Politics of Reproduction,” ''American Anthropologist'' (December 2004), 719–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rick Prelinger Howard Besser.orphanfilms.theora.ogv|thumb|right|440px|[[Rick Prelinger]] ([[Prelinger Archives]]) and [[Howard Besser]] (NYU professor of cinema studies) answer the questions "What is an orphan film?" and "What is the Orphan Film Symposium?" (Recorded at the [[University of South Carolina]], March 2006) running time 2:55]]

More pragmatically, in the United States the group's rising influence affected discourse and policies about copyright reform, joining the broader media reform movement. Examples of this include the 2003 Supreme Court case ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' and the 2006 Copyright Office [http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/ ''Report on Orphan Works'']. In September 2008, the [[U.S. Senate]] passed a bill (S.2913) "to provide a limitation on judicial remedies in copyright infringement cases involving orphan works," but the House of Representatives adjourned before addressing the measure.

Although U.S. copyright stakeholders confine their discussion to the narrower definition of an orphan (a work with no identifiable rightsholder or whose rights holder cannot be located), the broader conception—an orphan film as a neglected object—continues to be used internationally. Film archivists working quite separately in different nations have used the orphan metaphor for a decade. At the Cinemateca de Cuba, for example, the term "huérfanos" has been used to conceptualize the lost and abandoned works of Cuban film history, its "orfandad."  The Nederlands Filmmuseum preserves and programs its "Bits &amp; Pieces" series of unidentified film fragments, its "foundlings." The China Film Archive in Beijing uses a translatable orphan film metaphor as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Streible, "The Role of Orphan Films in the 21st Century Archive," ''[[Cinema Journal]]'' 46.3 (Spring 2007): 124–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indication of the international interest in orphan films was filmmaker Martin Scorsese's announcement of a World Cinema Foundation (WCF) at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Press reports stated that the WCF would preserve "orphan" films. By 2008, however, the WCF's mission statement referred only to "neglected" films rather than orphans, as the foundation helps fund preservation of lesser known theatrical motion pictures, which remain under the legal ownership of some party. [http://www.worldcinemafoundation.org World Cinema Foundation] In 2013 the foundation proper was renamed the World Cinema Project, which is overseen by The Film Foundation Scorsese created in 1990.

In April 2008, the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF) endorsed a [http://www.fiafnet.org/uk/members/Fair%20Use.cfm "Declaration on Fair Use and Access"] which stated "FIAF supports efforts to clarify the legal status of 'orphan' motion pictures and related promotional and historical materials for the purpose of preservation and public access."  Shortly thereafter, on June 4, 2008, the European Union announced the signing of a new "Memorandum of Understanding" on orphan works. The EU's Digital Libraries Initiative produced the statement.  Signatories included key institutions in moving image archiving and representatives of rightsholders: Association Des Cinematheques Europeennes - [[Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques]], the [[British Library]], European Film Companies Alliance, [[Federation Europeenne Des Realisateurs De L'audiovisuel]], Federation Internationale Des Associations De Producteurs De Films, and the International Federation Of Film Distributors. See [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=4145 EU Press Release on Orphan Works.]. In 2010, the Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques carried out a survey among its members to assess the dimension of orphan films. According to this survey, more than 210,000 films preserved in Europe's Film Archives are considered orphan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ace-film.eu/?page_id=246&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2012, the EU adopted the Orphan Works [[Directive 2012/28/EU]] which legally allows the (online) use of orphan works across Europe, provided that a search for the rights holder has been carried before. 
Currently, the [[European Union]] is addressing copyright, access, and preservation issues via FORWARD, a three-year project (2013-2016) to create a registry of orphan films. Officially termed  "Framework for a EU-wide Audiovisual Orphan Works Registry," the project aims to create simplified process for determining the rights status of moving image works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4536">'''Propeller''' is a [[theatre company]] which presents the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] in the UK and around the world. The director is [[Edward Hall (director)|Edward Hall]], and the casts are exclusively male actors.

==Background==
In the mid 1990s, the artistic director of the [[Watermill Theatre]], Jill Fraser, offered Edward Hall the opportunity to direct ''[[Othello]]'' – his first full Shakespeare play. Although a success, Hall determined to use the experience to found an all-male Shakespeare company, "mixing a rigorous approach to the text with a modern physical aesthetic".&lt;ref name="Comedy2003"&gt;Theatre programme, Comedy Theatre, London, August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall has set out the rules of his company, “Everyone is paid the same (tiny) wage and if an actor has created a part in a production then they will automatically receive an offer on the next one which they can refuse or take.” The company has seen new members since its start, keeping the group fresh.&lt;ref&gt;Propeller website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sommernachtskonzert Schönbrunn 2012 45 Omphale.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Statue of Omphale in the Schönbrunn Garden]]
The '''sculptures in the Schönbrunn Garden''' at [[Schönbrunn Palace]] in [[Vienna]], Austria were created between 1773 and 1780 under the direction of [[Johann Wilhelm Beyer]], a German artist and [[garden designer]]. The Great Parterre of [[Schönbrunn Garden]] is lined on both sides with 32 over life-size sculptures that represent mythological deities and virtues. The ''Neptune Fountain'' at the foot of the Gloriette hill is the crowning monument of the Great Parterre. Other sculptures are distributed throughout the garden and palace forecourt, including fountains and pools. Several sculptors were employed during the execution of these works, among them [[Johann Baptist Hagenauer]].

Heracles also served as an ideal of human behavior, acting for the benefit of mankind.&lt;ref name="howatson-269"/&gt; As an infant, he killed the two snakes sent by [[Hera]] to kill him. He studied the arts from the greatest experts, including archery from Eurytus, wrestling from Autolycus, weaponry from Polydeuces, and music from Linus.&lt;ref name="howatson-269"/&gt;

|''Perseus''
|Johann Wilhelm Beyer
|[[Perseus]] was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Danaë]]. He also killed the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]], sister of [[Stheno]] and [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]], with [[Hermes]]' flying shoes and a [[shield]] made of reflecting metal. He needed the [[shield]] to kill the [[gorgon]], elseway he had to look at her and would have turned to [[stone]].&lt;ref name="howatson-422"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

|''Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus''
|Joseph Baptist Hagenauer
|[[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] (c. 280 BC – 203 BC) was a Roman politician and general who was [[Roman Consul]] five times and [[Roman Dictator]] twice. As a military strategist, he became known as ''Cunctator'' (''delayer'') for the [[Fabian strategy|tactics]] he employed during the [[Second Punic War]]. He is widely considered the father of [[guerrilla warfare]] for targeting enemy supply lines while facing a vastly superior enemy—a novel strategy at the time.

|''Flora''
|Johann Wilhelm Beyer

|''Abduction of Helena''
|Johann Wilhelm Beyer
|[[Helen of Troy]] was the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, the younger brother of Agamemnon.&lt;ref name="howatson-262"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Known for her great beauty, Helen was taken to Attica in her youth by Theseus, but was rescued by her brothers and taken back to Sparta, where she was courted by the greatest men in Greece.&lt;ref name="howatson-262"/&gt; She chose Menelaus as her husband, and soon bore him a daughter, Hermione.&lt;ref name="howatson-262"/&gt; When Paris was sent as an ambassador to [[Sparta]] by his father, he fell in love and eloped with Helen, which caused the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name="howatson-409"/&gt; After the Spartans arrived in Troy, Menelaus, challenged Paris to a duel for Helen's return. Paris was soundly beaten by the king and was saved at the last minute by Aphrodite spirits.&lt;ref name="howatson-409"/&gt; After the war, Menelaus found Helen in Egypt and brought her back to Sparta. In Greek mythology, Helen was the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leda and the Swan|Leda]]. According to the myth, Zeus visited Leda in the form of a swan, producing an egg from which Helen was hatched.&lt;ref name="howatson-262"/&gt;

|''Janus and Bellona''
|Johann Wilhelm Beyer
|[[Janus]] was the god of gates, doorways, and beginnings in the Roman religion. He is often depicted having two faces because he looked to both the past and the future.&lt;ref name="howatson-304"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; The first month of the Roman calendar (''[[Ianuarius]]'' or January) was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="howatson-304"/&gt; Janus is shown standing with [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], the Roman goddess of war, and according to various accounts the wife or sister of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].&lt;ref name="howatson-86"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The first temple dedicated to her was built in the [[Campus Martius]] near the [[Circus Flaminius]] by [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] in 296 BC during the war against the Etruscans.&lt;ref name="howatson-86"/&gt;

|''Amphion''
|Joseph Baptist Hagenauer
|[[Amphion and Zethus|Amphion]] was the son of [[Zeus]] by [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]].&lt;ref name="howatson-40-41"&gt;Howatson 1989, pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; After she was raped by Zeus, Antiope fled to [[Sicyon]] and married King [[Epopeus]]. She was later captured by [[Nycteus]] or [[Lycus (brother of Nycteus)|Lycus]] and taken back to [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]. Along the way she gave birth to the twins and was forced to leave them on [[Mount Cithaeron]]. After being enslaved by Lycus and his wife [[Dirce]], who treated her cruelly for many years, Antiope escaped and eventually found her sons, who avenged her captivity by killing Dirce—tying her to the horns of a bull.&lt;ref name="howatson-41"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Amphion and Zethus went on to conquer Thebes, where they ruled together. Amphion became a great singer and musician after [[Hermes]] taught him to play and gave him a golden lyre. He and his brother built the walls around the [[Cadmea]], the citadel of Thebes. Amphion's musical skill was so great that when played his lyre, the stones simply moved into place.&lt;ref name="howatson-41"/&gt;

|''Gaius Mucius Scaevola'' 
|Johann Martin Fischer
|[[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]] was a legendary Roman youth known for his bravery. During the siege of Rome by King [[Lars Porsena]] of Clusium at the end of the sixth century BC, Scaevola entered the enemy's camp and attempted to kill the king. When he was taken prisoner and threatened with death, Scaevola placed his right hand into a fire to show his indifference to death. Porsena was so impressed he freed the brave youth, who took on the cognomen ''Scaevola'' meaning "left-handed".&lt;ref name="howatson-510"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neptune Fountain==
[[File:Neptune Fountain in the Schönbrunn Garden.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|''Neptune Fountain'' in the Schönbrunn Garden]]
The ''Neptune Fountain'' at the foot of the Gloriette hill was designed to be the crowning monument of the Great Parterre.&lt;ref name="neptune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neptune Fountain |work=Schloß Schönbrunn |url=http://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/things-to-know/gardens/tour-through-the-park/neptune-fountain.html |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by Empress [[Maria Theresa]], work on the fountain began in 1776 and was completed within four years, just prior to the death of the empress.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt; The overall design was done by Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf von Hohenberg; the marble sculptural group was executed by Wilhelm Beyer.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt;

The retaining wall of the ''Neptune Fountain'' merges into the slope of the Gloriette hill and includes a balustrade adorned with ornate vases. From a projecting semi-oval [[plinth]], a rocky formation emerges with the sea-god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and his entourage. The plinth is segmented by panels decorated with masks and separated and embellished with garlands.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt; Neptune stands atop the grotto at the center of the figure group in a shell-shaped chariot holding a trident. A nymph is seated to his left. The sea-goddess [[Thetis]] kneels to his right, asking the sea god to favor her son [[Achilles]] on his voyage to Troy.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt;

Appearing at the base of the grotto are four [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]]—creatures who are half-man and half-fish—who are part of the sea-god's entourage. Each holds a conch shell trumpet with which they can inspire fear. They are restraining the sea-horses who draw Neptune's chariot across the seas.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt; This image of Neptune commanding the watery dominion was a common symbol in sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth-century art, to represent monarchs controlling the fate of their people.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt; In the nineteenth century, a bank of evergreen trees was planted behind the white figural group to provide a dark contrast.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt;

|Johann Wilhelm Beyer
|The original well house at this location was built by the court gardener Steckhoven.&lt;ref name="schöner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schöner Brunnen |work=Schloß Schönbrunn |url=http://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/things-to-know/gardens/tour-through-the-park/schoener-brunnen.html |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1771, it was replaced by a square pavilion designed by Isidor Canevale, the court architect.&lt;ref name="schöner"/&gt; The pavilion contains open semi-circular arches at the front and back of the structure. The back arch frames the figure of [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]] seated above a small shell basin. She is holding a vase under her right arm, and from that vase flows spring water. Egeria was a water-nymph to whom pregnant women offered sacrifices to ensure easy births.&lt;ref name="howatson-205"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the divine consort and counselor of [[Numa Pompilius]], the second [[king of Rome]], to whom she gave laws and rituals pertaining to the [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. Her name is an [[eponym]] for female advisor or counselor.&lt;ref name="howatson-205"/&gt; The work was executed by Johann Wilhelm Beyer.&lt;ref name="schöner"/&gt; The corners of the room are decorated with sculpted sheaves of reeds, and the ceilings are embellished with flowers. A stone plaque bearing the initial "M" commemorates Emperor [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]], who discovered at this site the Schöner Brunnen (''Beautiful Fountain'').&lt;ref name="schöner"/&gt;

The '''Department of the Army Seal''' and the '''Department of the Army Emblem''' are, respectively, the official [[Seal (device)|seal]] and [[emblem]] of the [[United States Department of the Army]] (formerly, of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/Trademarks/DOD%20Guide%20about%20use%20of%20seals%20logos%20insignia%20medals-16%20Oct%2015F.PDF|title=Important Information and Guidelines About the Use of Department of Defense Seals, Logos, Insignia, and Service Medals|date=16 October 2015|page=2|access-date=5 April 2016|publisher=United States Department of Defense|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405154729/http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/Trademarks/DOD%20Guide%20about%20use%20of%20seals%20logos%20insignia%20medals-16%20Oct%2015F.PDF|archivedate=5 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "War Office Seal" was created in 1778 and the Emblem was developed out of the seal and approved in 1947.

==History==
The Army Seal was used originally during the American Revolution to authenticate documents. It displayed the designation "War Office", which was synonymous with Headquarters of the Army, and the Roman date MDCCLXXVIII (1778) the first time it was used. It remained unchanged until 1947, when the War Office banner was replaced with "Department of the Army" and the date was changed to 1775, the year in which the Army was established. The seal embodies the Army's ideals of loyalty, vigilance, perseverance, truth, courage, zeal, fortitude, remembrance, determination, constancy, achievement, dignity, and honor. The changes were legislated by the [[National Security Act of 1947]], and authorized by Section 3011, [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10, United States Code]].

Prior to the establishment of the "Department of the Army Emblem", there was no official display item to identify the Army. The Seal had traditionally been used to authenticate documents only and was not authorized for public display. In recognizing the need to provide a display item, the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] approved the emblem design as the official emblem to represent the Army on January 29, 1947.

==Description==
The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|Army Institute of Heraldry]] describes the War Office Seal as follows:

:In the center is a Roman [[cuirass]] below a vertical unsheathed [[sword]], point up, the [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] resting on the neck opening of the cuirass and a [[Phrygian cap]] supported on the sword point, all between on the left an [[espontoon]] and on the right a [[musket]] with fixed [[bayonet]] crossed in [[saltire]] behind the cuirass and passing under the sword guard. To the left of the cuirass and esponton is a [[Betsy Ross flag|national color of the Revolutionary War period]]  with cords and tassels, on a flagstaff with spearhead, above a [[cannon]] barrel, the muzzle end slanting upward behind the cuirass, in front of the [[drum]], with two drumsticks and the fly end of the flag draped over the drumhead; below, but partly in front of the cannon barrel, is a pile of three cannon balls. To the right of the cuirass and musket is the flag of the Department of the Army, with cords and tassels, on a flagstaff with spearhead, similarly arranged above a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] on a carriage, the mortar facing inward and in front of the lower portion of the color and obscuring the lower part of it; below the mortar are two [[shell (projectile)|bomb shells]] placed side by side. Centered above the Phrygian cap is a [[rattlesnake]] holding in its mouth a scroll inscribed "This We'll Defend". Centered below the cuirass are the Roman numerals "MDCCLXXVIII".

Although the U.S. Department of the Army's emblem is derived from the Seal of the U.S. Department of the Army, it differs from the seal in several respects. The emblem is displayed in color while the seal is not, the emblem includes the inscription "Department of the Army" instead of the seal inscription "War Office", and on the emblem, the U.S. flag is on its own right (observer's left) to reflect the current custom for display of flags. The [[flag of the United States Army]] pattern has been added in place of the opposing flag displayed on the seal. The Roman numerals "MDCCLXXVIII" which indicate the date the Seal was adopted, were replaced with the date "1775" to reflect the date the Continental Army was established.

==Symbolism==
The central element of the seal and emblem, the Roman [[cuirass]], is a symbol of strength and defense. The sword, [[Spontoon|esponton]] (a type of half-pike formerly used by subordinate officers), musket, bayonet, cannon, cannonballs, mortar, and mortar bombs are representative of Army implements. The drum and drumsticks are symbols of public notification of the Army's purpose and intent to serve the Nation and its people. The [[Phrygian cap]] (often called the "Cap of Liberty") supported on the point of an unsheathed sword and the motto "This We'll Defend" on a scroll held by the rattlesnake is a symbol depicted on some American colonial flags and signifies the Army's constant readiness to defend and preserve the United States.
The symbolism for the elements of the emblem is the same as for the seal with the deviations and additions noted under “Description” above: The colors of the design elements are those traditionally associated with the ideals of the United States and of the U.S. Army. The flags are depicted in their approved colors. Blue is symbolic of loyalty, vigilance, perseverance, and truth. Red denotes courage, zeal, and fortitude. White alludes to deeds worthy of remembrance. Black is indicative of determination and constancy. Gold represents achievement, dignity, and honor.

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}

In its original sense, a '''shaggy dog story''' or '''yarn''' is an extremely long-winded [[anecdote]] characterized by extensive narration of typically [[Non sequitur (literary device)|irrelevant incidents]] and terminated by an [[Anti-climax (narrative)|anticlimax]] or a pointless punchline.

Shaggy dog stories play upon the audience's preconceptions of joke-telling. The audience listens to the story with certain expectations, which are either simply not met or met in some entirely unexpected manner.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book|title=Jokes|page=8|author=Ted Cohen|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-11230-6|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthy shaggy dog story derives its humour from the fact that the joke-teller held the attention of the listeners for a long time (such jokes can take five minutes or more to tell) for no reason at all, as the end resolution is essentially meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to be funny : an extremely silly guidebook|year=1978|author=Jovial Bob Stine|publisher= Dutton |isbn=0-525-32410-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of their delivery is reflected in the [[English language|English]] [[idiom]] ''[[wiktionary:spin a yarn|spin a yarn]]'', by way of [[analogy]] with the production of [[yarn]].

==Archetypal story==

The commonly believed [[archetype]] of the shaggy dog story is a story that concerns a [[wikt:shaggy|shaggy]] dog.  The story builds up, repeatedly emphasizing how shaggy the dog is. At the climax of the story, someone in the story reacts with, "That dog's not so shaggy." The expectations of the audience that have been built up by the presentation of the story, that the story will end with a punchline, are thus disappointed. Ted Cohen gives the following example of this story:&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

{{quote|A boy owned a dog that was uncommonly shaggy. Many people remarked upon its considerable shagginess.  When the boy learned that there are contests for shaggy dogs, he entered his dog. The dog won first prize for shagginess in both the local and the regional competitions.  The boy entered the dog in ever-larger contests, until finally he entered it in the world championship for shaggy dogs. When the judges had inspected all of the competing dogs, they remarked about the boy's dog: "He's not that shaggy."}}

However, authorities disagree as to whether this particular story is the archetype after which the category is named.  [[Eric Partridge]], for example, provides a very different story, as do William and Mary Morris in ''The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''.

According to Partridge and the Morrises, the archetypical shaggy dog story involves an advertisement placed in the ''Times'' announcing a search for a shaggy dog. In the Partridge story, an aristocratic family living in [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] is searching for a lost dog, and an American answers the advertisement with a shaggy dog that he has found and personally brought across the Atlantic, only to be received by the butler at the end of the story who takes one look at the dog and shuts the door in his face, saying, "But not so shaggy as ''that'', sir!" In the Morris story, the advertiser is organizing a competition to find the shaggiest dog in the world, and after a lengthy exposition of the search for such a dog, a winner is presented to the aristocratic instigator of the competition, who says, "I don't think he's so shaggy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secret of Humor|author=Leonard Feinberg|year=1978|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-6203-370-9|pages=181&amp;ndash;182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaggy Dog Story|work=World Wide Words|author=Michael Quinion|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-sha1.htm|date=19 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
===Mark Twain and the story of grandfather's old ram===
A typical shaggy dog story occurs in [[Mark Twain]]'s book about his travels west, ''[[Roughing It]]''. Twain's friends encourage him to go find a man called Jim Blaine when he is properly drunk, and ask him to tell "the stirring story about his grandfather's old ram."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/marktwain/learnmore/writings_story.html |title=The Story of Grandfather's Old Ram |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=26 September 2013 |author=Twain, Mark |author-link=Samuel Clemons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twain, encouraged by his friends who have already heard the story, finally finds Blaine, an old silver miner, who sets out to tell Twain and his friends the tale. Blaine starts out with the ram ("There never was a bullier old ram than what he was"), and goes on for four more mostly dull but occasionally hilarious unparagraphed pages.

Along the way, Blaine tells many stories, each of which connects back to the one before by some tenuous thread, and none of which has to do with the old ram. Among these stories are: a tale of boiled missionaries; of a lady who borrows a false eye, a peg leg, and the wig of a coffin-salesman's wife; and a final tale of a man who gets caught in machinery at a carpet factory and whose "widder bought the piece of carpet that had his remains wove in&amp;nbsp;..." As Blaine tells the story of the carpet man's funeral, he begins to fall asleep, and Twain, looking around, sees his friends "suffocating with suppressed laughter." They now inform him that "at a certain stage of intoxication, no human power could keep [Blaine] from setting out, with impressive unction, to tell about a wonderful adventure which he had once had with his grandfather's old ram — and the mention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had heard him get, concerning it."

===Isaac Asimov and the story of the Shah Guido G. ===
In the collection of stories by [[Isaac Asimov]] titled ''[[Buy Jupiter and Other Stories]]'', is a story titled "[[Shah Guido G.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Asimov, Isaac |author-link=Isaac Asimov |title=Buy Jupiter and other stories'', |publisher=Fawcett Crest |location=New York, NY |year=1975 |pages=33–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his background notes, Asimov identifies the tale as a shaggy dog story, and explains that the title is a play on "shaggy dog".

*[["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s "[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]," the final track on his 1999 album ''[[Running with Scissors ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Running with Scissors]]'', is an over-eleven-minute digression from one of the first topics mentioned in the song, the narrator-protagonist's longstanding dislike of [[sauerkraut]].

'''Sichuan Fine Arts Institute''' ('''SFAI''') ({{zh|s=四川美术学院 |t=四川美術學院 |p=Sìchuān měishù xuéyuàn}}) is a [[public university|public]] [[fine art]]s university in [[Chongqing]], China.

Sichuan Fine Arts Institute, with a history of over 64 years, is one of the four most prominent art academies in China and the only one in the southwest China.

==History and reputation==
Sichuan Fine Arts Institute has a very bright history in the creation of art and deep research. High quality artwork has been created by the teachers in SFAI.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the institute was symbolized by handcraft arts. In the 1970s, it was sculpture, especially the most famous group statues, the “Rent Collecting Courtyard”. In the 1980s it was oil painting, such as SFAI's president Luo Zhongli’s masterpiece "My Father”, etc.

The institute enjoys great prestige domestically and internationally. The excellent artwork has become milestones in contemporary Chinese art. Since the 1990s, many teachers and students have gained nationwide and international awards. They got opportunities to make their work exhibited to the world.

At present, it’s been establishing cultural exchange relations with more and more foreign art institutes, delegations and artists, dispatching students to study abroad and receiving foreign students to study at SFAI, which result in promoting international art exchanges and development. These outstanding artists make huge contribution to the development of fine arts in China.

The traditional campus was in the district of [[Jiulongpo District|Jiulongpo]], in Chongqing. The new campus was built in Huxi District, Chongqing in 2005.

The university's philosophy is "close to life, to serve the people; knowledge as equally important, new incentives; open-minded and keeping up with the times". The overall development objective is to provide the highest level of art education in the western region of China.

==Departments==
Programs of study at SFAI include craft art, oil painting, sculpture, design, architecture, print making, art theory, and traditional Chinese painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academics|url=http://www.scfai.edu.cn/english/Channel.aspx?Id=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517014309/http://www.scfai.edu.cn/English/Channel.aspx?Id=3|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 May 2007|publisher=Sichuan Fine Arts Institute|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The institute no longer offers Chinese language classes for international and exchange students as a second language at the Huxi campus.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9876">{{About|the ordinance in Seattle|the album named after the ordinance by ''[[A (band)|A]]''|Teen Dance Ordinance (album)}}
The '''Teen Dance Ordinance''' was a controversial [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] law which severely curtailed the ability of concert and club promoters to hold events for underaged patrons. During its existence from 1985 to 2002, it was routinely criticized for its severity (often labeled "[[wikt:draconian|draconian]]") and its effects on the local music scene and industry. After several unsuccessful attempts to repeal it through lobbying and later court action, it was finally repealed and replaced with the All-ages Dance Ordinance.

==History==
From 1977 to 1985, teen dances were unregulated in Seattle. Activities at underage clubs were attracting the attention of the public and a club called The Monastery was particularly notorious for allegations of [[sexual abuse]], [[child prostitution]], and drug and alcohol use. The Monastery was run by George Freeman and was ostensibly a non-profit church of the [[Universal Life Church]], whose dance events were "religious services". During daytime hours it was a youth center that attracted runaways and homeless youth. The Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO) was conceived and passed the [[Seattle City Council|City Council]] on July 29, 1985 to stop abuses at underage clubs. It was amended in 1988. Key among its provisions were:

* Age limits: Underage dances (allowing those under 18 to attend) may only admit patrons age 15-20 unsupervised. Anyone younger would require a parent or guardian [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]] and anyone older would need to be accompanying a youth under 18.
* Security requirement: Two off-duty police officers were required on premises, with one off-duty officer outside to patrol the area.
* [[Insurance]]: $1,000,000 in liability insurance was required;
* Exemptions: Non-profits and schools were exempt from these restrictions.&lt;ref name=Licata&gt;Licata, Nick. [http://www.ci.Seattle.wa.us/council/licata/up92.htm Urban Politics #92.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101021222/http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/council/licata/up92.htm |date=2006-01-01 }} Seattle City Council, Office of Councilman Nick Licata. September 9, 2000. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

With these requirements, teen dances outside of schools were virtually banned in the city, as no [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] would undertake the costs involved. For a city the size of Seattle, shows that would only allow 15- to 20-year-olds could not draw a large enough crowd for the event to break even. In addition to the $1 million insurance bond, hiring off-duty officers was a huge expense. The non-profit exemption meant the ordinance did not apply to the Monastery; it was closed using pre-existing [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] abatement laws. In the 15 years of the ordinance, almost no one applied for a promoter's license for youth events, and no one has been prosecuted with it.&lt;ref name=Licata /&gt;

While the ordinance only regulated "dances," the distinction between a concert and a dance was not outlined by law, and the police were accused of defining a dance so liberally that the dancing done in the audience of a concert was enough to qualify the entire event as a "dance." All-ages concerts were thus subject to being shut down by police who were vigilant in making sure promoters did not skirt the law. As a result, some nationally touring acts refused to do shows in Seattle because they insisted on all-ages audiences. With Seattle becoming an epicenter for [[alternative rock]] and the [[grunge]] scene in the early 90's, teens had to go to neighboring cities to attend concerts and dances.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Jennifer. [https://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/1999/03/vogel.html Guilty Feet.] ''Mother Jones''. March 1999. Retrieved June 20, 2006,&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the TDO said that the ordinance ensured the safety of underage patrons and discouraged gatherings where youth consumed drugs and alcohol. They also invoked the memory of the Monastery, where they said adults preyed upon vulnerable kids susceptible to offers of drugs or quick cash. Excluding adults from underage youth would, in their eyes, create a "bubble of safety."&lt;ref&gt;Paynter, Susan. [http://www.seattlepi.com/paynter/payn078.shtml Repeal teen dance law? Let's sit this one out]. ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer.'' August 7, 2000. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeal of the ordinance was a key goal of [[JAMPAC]], a musicians' and promoters' [[political action committee]] founded by [[Krist Novoselic]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Since its founding in 1995, the group lobbied the City Council to repeal the TDO.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, Deborah. [http://members.aol.com/mystryxia/mags/billboard1995.html Nirvana Bassist Forms Artist, Fan Action League in Seattle] ''Billboard Magazine''. February 18, 1995. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordinance was a focal point for a vocal young activist community in Seattle, notably those consolidated as The All Ages Music Organization, and later by the Music and Youth Task Force, which allowed for youth and public officials to meet regularly to find resolution to conflicting points of view.&lt;ref&gt;Howland Jr., George. [http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0220/nc-howland.php A time to dance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427134646/http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0220/nc-howland.php |date=2006-04-27 }}. ''The Seattle Weekly.''  May 15, 2002. Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new ordinance proposed to replace the TDO was passed by the City Council in 2000, however it was quickly vetoed by Mayor [[Paul Schell]]. The veto caused JAMPAC to launch a suit against the City of Seattle, claiming that the TDO's virtual outlawing of dance infringed on the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free expression. A judge however ruled for the City on JAMPAC's suit in May 2002, claiming there was no infringement on the First Amendment and that the matter is a political one for the Council to decide, not the courts. Nevertheless, during the course of the suit, Schell was voted out of office (in the aftermath of the disastrous [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO meetings of 1999]]) and the new mayor [[Greg Nickels]], a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Council. The new All-ages Dance Ordinance, written by members of the Music and Youth Task Force, was passed on August 12, 2002, replacing the TDO.

==All-Ages Dance Ordinance==

The new provisions of the All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) eased on restrictions to accommodate new youth events. They include:
* a definition of a ''dance'' as an event where dancing is the primary activity intended
* allowing all-ages events to occur absent any alcohol served
* requiring only the requesting of off-duty officers at an event, to be granted by the Seattle Police Guild
* elimination of the $1 million insurance requirement&lt;ref name=Howland&gt;Howland Jr., George. [http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0233/news-howland3.php Slow Dance.] ''The Seattle Weekly.''  August 14, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rules, while more liberal than before, still disappointed many activists who pushed for the TDO's repeal. They viewed the new ordinance as only moderate changes to the rules and not liberal enough to actually encourage all ages shows.&lt;ref name=Howland /&gt; Proponents of the TDO also criticize the new AADO, saying the new all-ages events are now ignored by the police, and that the new law is confusing and ignored by unlicensed promoters. [[Rave]]s have also been points of criticism; they have now been classified as ''concerts'' and are outside the scope of the ordinance while frequent use of [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] by attendees have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Sharon Pian.

Retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, in the aftermath of the [[Capitol Hill massacre]] where a gunman shot several partygoers after a rave, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' editorialized against the new dance rules and called for the city's all-ages dance rules to be "thoroughly re-examined and re-tooled."&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorialsopinion/2002892098_shooted27.html Soul-searching after Capitol Hill tragedy], ''Seattle Times'' editorial, March 26, 2006. Accessed June 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Local community leaders{{who|date=January 2015}} however have so-far ignored such pleas, noting that the incident was the work of a deranged gunman whose intent to kill could not be stopped with new city laws.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''The ''Tenjukoku Shūchō'' Mandala''' ({{nihongo|天寿国繍帳}}) is a Japanese work of [[textile art]]. It is the oldest known example of [[embroidery]] in Japan, dating back to 622 CE. It was created in honour of [[Prince Shōtoku]], one of the earliest proponents of [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="DeaconCalvin2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Deborah A.

==Creation==

In the ''[[Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu]]'', it is recorded that Tachibana no Ōiratsume, one of the widows of Prince Shōtoku, commissioned the [[mandala]] after her husband's death, to represent the heavenly realm to which he had departed so that she could envision his afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=尼門跡寺院の世界: 皇女たちの信仰と御所文化|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6AYAQAAMAAJ|year=2009|publisher=産経新聞社|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork was created by maidservants of the Imperial Court, with the permission of the Empress Suiko.&lt;ref name="tnm"/&gt; The original was stitched in silk on a series of large square curtains, approximately {{convert|5|m|ft}} across,&lt;ref name="meeks2007"/&gt; but only a small portion of this, measuring approximately {{convert|89|cm|in}} by {{convert|83|cm|in}}, still survives.&lt;ref name="tnm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GranoffShinohara2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Phyllis Granoff|author2=Koichi Shinohara|title=Images in Asian Religions: Text and Contexts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f22MMuUrOaUC&amp;pg=PA261|date=1 October 2010|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5980-6|page=261–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidder1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidder|first1=J.

==Replica and current version==

The mandala is held at the [[Nara National Museum]], but remains the property of the [[Chūgū-ji]] temple in [[Nara Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="GranoffShinohara2010"/&gt; The extant version was created in the [[Edo period]] by combining remnants of the original embroidery with a replica made in the late 13th century.&lt;ref name="tnm"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tenjukoku Shucho Mandara and the Statue of Prince Shotoku|url=http://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=242&amp;lang=en|publisher=Tokyo National Museum|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its association with the temple and its reconstruction are due to the work of the [[Bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]] [[Shinnyo]], who recovered the original mandala from its storage at [[Hōryū-ji]] in 1273. According to the narratives of Shinnyo's life, she had a dream in which she learned that the mandala contained the death date of the {{nihongo|Princess Anahobe no Hashihito|穴穂部間人皇女|Anahobe no Hashihito no Himemiko}}, consort of [[Emperor Jomei]] and mother of Shōtoku (Shinnyo was researching Hashihito, the patroness of Chūgū-ji, as part of her work to restore the temple). The mandala was locked away at Hōryū-ji, but a break-in at the Hōryū-ji treasury allowed Shinnyo to access their stores under the pretext of checking for damages. There, she found the mandala, severely damaged, and was given permission to remove it to Chūgū-ji. She subsequently took it on a fund-raising tour to Kyoto, and received enough donations to fund the creation of a replica.&lt;ref name="meeks2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meeks|first1=Lori R.|title=In Her Likeness: Female Divinity and Leadership at Medieval Chūgūji|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=2007|volume=34|issue=2|pages=351–392|jstor=30233816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the replica and the original were damaged by fires at Chūgū-ji in the early fourteenth century, but the damaged pieces were preserved and in the nineteenth century were combined together to create the current version.&lt;ref name="delrosariopradel"/&gt; The colour fastness of the original material was superior to that of the later replica; in the extant version of the artwork, the brighter sections are all derived from the original.&lt;ref name="tnm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kidder1989"/&gt;

==Content==

The mandala depicts the Buddhist realm of Tenjukoku ({{nihongo|天寿国}}), or the "Land of Infinite Life", and presents a number of different elements representing various Buddhist concepts. The building in the bottom right is assumed by most scholars to represent the heavenly palace of Zenpōdō from the ''[[Maitreya]] [[Sutra]]''. The main pattern of tortoises contains characters spelling the names of Shōtoku, Hashihito and Ōiratsume, arranged as a Buddhist [[Triple deity|triad]],&lt;ref name="mita"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mita|first1=Kakuyuki|title=On the Original Form of the Tenjukoku-shûchô and its Subject|url=http://www.bijutsushi.jp/pdf-files/ronbunshou/english/Jahs09-6MitaSar.pdf|website=Bijutsushi|publisher=Japan Art History Society|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents Shōtoku's genealogy; other tortoises contain further characters recorded in the ''Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu'', including the death dates of Shōtoku and his mother, and the story of the mandala's creation.&lt;ref name="Lee2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Doo Young Lee|title=Prince and the Monk, The: Shotoku Worship in Shinran's Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8Xnk04cEGIC&amp;pg=PA93|date=1 February 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8046-5|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of the work contained 100 such tortoises.&lt;ref name="GranoffShinohara2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tnm"/&gt; An inscription, purportedly a statement by Shōtoku, was originally appended: "The world is folly. Only the Buddha is real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tenjukoku Shucho|url=http://www.trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/clothing-undergarment/individual-textiles-and-textile-types/religious-representations/tenjukoku-shucho|publisher=Lieden Textile Research Centre|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original base fabric on which the images are embroidered is a woven purple [[gauze]], which may have been imported; the later replica sections are stitched onto purple [[twill]] or plain white silk. The embroidery threads of the original are [[Yarn#Structure|z-twisted]] ([[Rope#Styles of rope construction|right laid]]) and are sewn exclusively in [[backstitch]] while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches. The looser twist of the yarn may be one of the reasons that the replica sections are less well-preserved.&lt;ref name="delrosariopradel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pradel|first1=Maria del Rosario|title=The Tenjukoku Shucho and the Asuka Period Funerary Practices|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1874&amp;context=tsaconf|website=Textile Society of America|publisher=University of Nebraska|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers argue that the similarity of the mandala's iconography to Chinese and Korean funeral monuments, together with the gauze fabric on which it was originally stitched, indicate that it is not in fact a Buddhist artefact. This theory suggests that the artwork does not represent Tenjukoku, but rather constitutes a record of the memorial rites performed for Shōtoku, and that the association with Buddhism was a later development.&lt;ref name="Lee2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pradel2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pradel|first1=Chari|title=Fabricating the Tenjukoku Shūchō Mandara and Prince Shōtoku’s Afterlives|date=2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004182608|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/fabricating-tenjukoku-shucho-mandara-and-prince-shotokus-afterlives|accessdate=22 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518100946/http://www.brill.com/products/book/fabricating-tenjukoku-shucho-mandara-and-prince-shotokus-afterlives|archive-date=2017-05-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pradel3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pradel|first1=Maria del Rosario|title=The fragments of the Tenjukoku shūchō mandara : reconstruction of the iconography and the historical contexts|url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/3852027|website=HKUL|publisher=University of Hong Kong|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dreamers''''' is a culturally inspired sculpture crafted by artists [[Larry Zink]] and [[Monica Taylor]], designed to highlight and exalt contributions made by the black community.

Completed in 1995, the sculpture stands on the grounds of the Samuel W. Houston secondary school, named after [[Samuel Walker Houston]] (1864-1945),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhobs Handbook of Texas Online] accessed April 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; prominent African-American educator and civil rights pioneer.

The school building now serves the community of [[Huntsville, Texas]] as the [[Samuel Walker Houston Cultural Center]].  The sculpture, which contains 69 carefully cast concrete images covering multiple generations of African-Americans, is set on a curved wall approximately 20 feet in length and approximately four and a half feet tall.  With the top row consisting of elders aged 55–95, the center row of middle-aged adults, and the bottom row of children, the youngest aged 13, the work represents the struggles of the past through to the hope of the future.

The work was commissioned by the [[Huntsville Independent School District]], the [[Huntsville Arts Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://wynnehomeartscenter.com/art_tour.html Art Tour of Huntsville]  accessed April 29, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929175809/http://wynnehomeartscenter.com/art_tour.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Samuel W. Houston High School Ex-Students Association.

'''''The Musicians''''' or '''''Concert of Youths''''' (c. 1595) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]] (1571–1610). It is held in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]], where it has been since 1952. It underwent extensive restoration in 1983.&lt;ref name=Hibbard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|year=1985|publisher=Westview Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780064301282|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio entered the household of Cardinal [[Francesco Maria Del Monte]] sometime in 1595, and ''The Musicians'' is thought to have been his first painting done expressly for the cardinal. His biographer, the painter [[Baglione]], says he "painted for the Cardinal youths playing music very well drawn from nature and also a youth playing a lute," the latter presumably being ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'', which seems to form a companion-piece to ''The Musicians''.

The picture shows four boys in quasi-Classical costume, three playing various musical instruments or singing, the fourth dressed as [[Cupid]] and reaching towards a bunch of grapes.

Caravaggio seems to have composed the painting from studies of two figures.&lt;ref name=Langdon&gt;{{cite book|last=Langdon|first=Helen|title=Caravaggio: A Life|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813337944|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Caravaggio.html?id=PHwNAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central figure with the [[lute]] has been identified with Caravaggio's companion [[Mario Minniti]], and the individual next to him and facing the viewer is possibly a self-portrait of the artist.&lt;ref name=Hibbard /&gt; The cupid bears a strong resemblance to the boy in ''[[Boy Peeling Fruit (Caravaggio)|Boy Peeling Fruit]]'', done a few years before, and also to the angel in ''[[Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy (Caravaggio)|Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy]]''.

The manuscripts show that the boys are practicing [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s celebrating love, and the eyes of the lutenist, the principal figure, are moist with tears—the songs presumably describe the sorrow of love rather than its pleasures. The violin in the foreground suggests a fifth participant, implicitly including the viewer in the tableau.&lt;ref name=Hibbard /&gt;

Scenes showing musicians were a popular theme at the time—the Church was supporting a revival of music and new styles and forms were being tried, especially by educated and progressive prelates such as Del Monte. This scene, however, is clearly secular rather than religious, and harks back to the long-established tradition of "concert" pictures, a genre originating in Venice and exemplified, in its earlier form, by [[Titian|Titian's]] ''[[Pastoral Concert|Le concert champêtre]]''.&lt;ref name=Graham-Dixon/&gt;

This was Caravaggio's most ambitious and complex composition to date, and the artist has evidently had difficulties with painting the four figures separately—they don't relate to each other or to the picture-space, and the overall effect is somewhat clumsy. The painting is in poor condition, and the music in the manuscript has been badly damaged by past restorations, although a tenor and an alto part can be made out. Nevertheless, despite considerable paint loss, the work's originality remains undimmed.&lt;ref name=Graham-Dixon&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham-Dixon|first=Andrew|title=Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780241954645|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lI76naiYuMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Tour Accountant''' is responsible for the financial operations of a large scale [[concert tour]]. Normally, a Tour Accountant will report to both the [[Tour Manager]] (for all matters regarding tour financial operations), and to the Artist Manager/Business Manager (for overall financial reporting).

From a tour perspective, the Tour Accountant will normally: handle periodic financial transactions (either with Artist Management, or promoter), including per diem draw, wire transfers of both direct (Promoter &gt; Artist Management) and indirect (Promoter &gt; Tour Accountant &gt; Artist Management; usually box office receipts collected at settlement by Tour Accountant) funds, per diem distribution, hotel settlement, currency exchange (international tours), negotiate all local tax issues (concerning Artist earnings in each individual local market), and constantly work to clear up any "grey areas" during the advance, that have the potential to affect show settlement. Although normally, tour members will be paid by either Artist Management/Business Management, or accounting firm, the Tour Accountant will act as the "conduit" between the parties, while the tour is operating.

If a tour is not large enough to warrant utilizing a Tour Accountant, the [[Tour Manager]] will normally assume his/her responsibilities, as listed above. Generally, the only exception to this is if Artist Management travels with tour, and opts to handle the aforementioned.

The path to becoming a Tour Accountant usually involves either advancement through the ranks (a great deal of experience with a specific Artist, or Artist Management company), or via a more traditional route (secondary, post secondary education &amp; degree, followed by employment with either Artist Management company, or specialized Entertainment Accounting company).

{{More citations needed|date=March 2018}}The Washington Color School was a movement starting in Washington DC, built of six core abstract expressionist artists during the 1950s–1970s. They emerged during a time when society, the arts, and people were changing quickly. The inner circle of this new visual art movement consisted of Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis, Gene Davis, Howard Mehring, Tom Downing, and Paul Reed.
The '''Washington Color School''', a visual art movement describes a form of image making concerned primarily with [[color field painting]], a form of non-objective or non-representational art that explored ways to use large solid areas of paint. The Washington Color School originally consisted of a group of painters who showed works in an exhibit called the "Washington Color Painters" at the now-defunct [[Washington Gallery of Modern Art]] in Washington from June 25 to September 5, 1965.  The exhibition's organizer was Gerald "Gerry" Nordland and the painters who exhibited were [[Sam Francis]], [[Sam Gilliam]],( painter) [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Howard Mehring]],  [[Thomas "Tom" Downing]], and [[Paul Reed (artist)|Paul Reed]]. This exhibition, which subsequently traveled to several other venues in the United States, including the [[Walker Art Center]], solidified Washington's place in the national movement and defined what is considered the city's signature art movement, according to art historians and journalists alike. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/when-the-washington-color-school-earned-its-stripes-on-the-national-stage/2015/06/26/83413b9e-0f98-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html|title &lt;/ref&gt;When the Washington Color School earned its stripes on the national stage.

The Washington Color School artists painted largely non-representational works, and were central to the larger [[color field]] movement.{{According to whom|date=January 2016}} Though not generally considered [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionists]] due to the orderliness of their works and differing motivating philosophies, many parallels can be drawn between the Washington Color School and the abstract expressionists. Minimally, the use of stripes, washes, and fields of single colors of paint on canvas were common to most artists in both groups. A common technique used in the Washington Color School was "soak staining" or just "staining", where one would pour a thinned painting medium onto canvas and let it sit over time. The result would be a stain in the canvas with no visible traces of conventional application, such as brush strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ideelart.com/module/csblog/post/203-1-art-techniques.html|title=The Most Typical Abstract Art Techniques|website=IdeelArt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330052444/http://www.ideelart.com/module/csblog/post/203-1-art-techniques.html|archive-date=March 30, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After their initial benchmark exhibition, Davis, Mehring, and Reed were joined by Timothy Corkery, Willem de Looper and Jacob Kainen at The Seventeenth Area Exhibition of Artists of Washington and the Adjacent Area at The Corcoran Gallery of Art from November 12 to December 19,1965. The Eighteenth Area Exhibition at The Corcoran from November 18 to December 31,1967 again featured artists including de Looper, Corkery, Downing, Gilliam and Kainen.

Many of these artists exhibited at the Jefferson Place Gallery originally directed by [[Alice Denney]] and later owned and directed by Nesta Dorrance /Sept 21,1969 Washington Post Dorrance/) Other artists associated with the group include: [[Anne Truitt]], [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]], Leon Berkowitz,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.org/colorfieldremix/aboutwcs.cfm], retrieved June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Kainen]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/23/arts/jacob-kainen-91-painter-and-print-curator.html], ''NY Times'' Obituary, retrieved June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alma Thomas]], James Hilleary,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/james-hilleary-noted-washington-artist-dies-at-90/2014/04/22/22d0ae00-c72a-11e3-9f37-7ce307c56815_story.html], retrieved May 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and others. The group is sometimes thought to have expanded as it achieved a dominant presence in the Washington, D.C. visual art community through the 1960s into the 1970s. Along with the original Washington Color School painters, a second generation also exhibited at Jefferson Place Gallery.(6/69 “Four Minds With It” Wash Star; Benjamin) those artists remained influential even as some of its members dispersed elsewhere.

[[Hilda Thorpe]] (Hilda Shapiro Thorpe) was a color field painter who made oversized paintings and paper sculptures who taught a generation of artists in the Washington, D.C. area. Other Washington Color School female artists include [[Anne Truitt]] (whose work relates to the 'minimalist-purity' side of three-dimensional painterly objects and painters), [[Mary Pinchot Meyer]], and [[Alma Thomas]]. Other works that reflect the Washington Color School include [[Sam Gilliam]]'s suspended paintings (whose style can be described by some as [[Baroque painting|''Baroque'']]), Timothy Corkery’s sharp Arrows and contrasting diffuse architectural doorways. [[Rockne Krebs]]' transparent sculptures, light and laser works, Ed McGowin's vacuum-formed pieces which he was ending and moving towards a more personal art (tableau), Bill Christenberry's neon works, which led him to deal more directly with his roots, and the work of Bob Stackhouse and [[Tom Green (artist)|Tom Green]]. 

During spring and summer 2007, arts institutions in Washington, D.C. staged a citywide celebration of [[color field painting]], including exhibitions at galleries and museums of works by members of the Washington Color School.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601756.html], retrieved on May 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a group of Washington art collectors began the Washington Color School Project, to gather and publish information about the history of the color painters and abstract art in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncolorschool.com|title=Washington Color School Project|publisher=|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some of them were not born in Washington, they exhibited together representing Washington as a new hub for the visual arts.
