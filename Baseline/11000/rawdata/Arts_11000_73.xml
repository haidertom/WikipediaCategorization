'''''The Adoration of the Shepherds''''' (German: ''Anbetung der Hirten''), is a circa 1515&amp;ndash;1520 [[Oil painting|oil on panel]] painting of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] by the German artist [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the collection of the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/237952 painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
The Adoration of the Shepherds shows a nocturnal scene with Mary bending over the Child in prayer. Joseph is standing over them holding a candle, but the main light source is coming from the crib. The Child lies on a bed of hay that matches his Mother's halo, surrounded by winged cherubs. In the upper left of the frame, a vista to a moonlit landscape reveals on closer inspection to be a scene of the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]] with [[Gabriel]] as the moon and three shepherds in a field. The same three shepherds stand behind a fence on the right side of the painting looking at the Holy Family.

The painting was painted around the time when [[Martin Luther]] first spoke out about the light of the Gospels and used the candle as a metaphor for [[revelation]]. In his work translating the bible and spreading his message, he hired Cranach to make illustrations and a candle featured in many of them. This same scene in a simplified form was even featured in one of Cranach's woodcuts for Luther's ''Passional Christi und Antichristi'':

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Provenance==
This painting was once in the collection of [[Richard von Kaufmann]] and was purchased by the museum from his estate in 1917.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; It was claimed by the Russians in 1945 and returned to the museum in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lucascranach.org/DE_SKD_GG1907A Painting record] on LucasCranach.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Allegory of Industry''''' is a [[tondo (art)|tondo]] painted by [[Francisco de Goya]] (c. 1805) which was one of the four paintings from a series of [[allegories]] about scientific and economic progress (including the Allegory of [[Allegory of Agriculture|Agriculture]], [[Allegory of Commerce|Commerce]], and [[Allegory of Science|Science]], the latter of which has been lost), which decorated a waiting room of the residence of [[Manuel Godoy]], Prime Minister of [[Spain]] during the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]]. Since 1932, the picture has been in the [[Museo del Prado]].
The image shows two young women as they thread their respective spinning wheels in a semi-darkened room, illuminated by a large window which opens from the left (from the point of view of the observer). At the back, in the dark, one can discern uncertain faces of old women (who have been linked to the [[Moirai|Fates]]). The uncertainty of these women doesn’t reveal whether or not they are factor workers or representations of the tapestry or canvas.

==Analysis==
The themes of the allegory show Godoy’s desire to appear as an enlightened and reformist leader and the ultimate guarantor of economic and scientific progress of Spain, in relation to the activities of the [[Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País]], which thrived at the time.
However, this painting is an indicator of the stale concept that the Spain of that time could develop its industry, but the image itself is far from representing the [[Industrial Revolution]] which was occurring in the more developed regions of Europe. The image departs from the model of the [[Ancien Régime]] (see [[Las Hilanderas (Velázquez)|Las Hilanderas]] by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]), but it is far from representative of the industrial era, as there is no increase in the number of spinners to reflect the mass production of industry and the work itself is being done on simple machines, instead of the more advanced devices used in the more developed countries. Furthermore, the clothes the women are wearing are not typical of the industrial working class. The low necklines, white blouses and melancholy and distracted attitudes more accurately belong to upper women than those who would work in a factory. The robustness of their bodies also isn’t the best way to imagine the regular conditions of nutrition of the [[industrial working class]]. It is a traditional and very flat representation in its symbolism and in its own way it shows the conceptual gap between what the wealthy thought of the industrial revolution should be and what it was actually like.

In [[heraldry]], the '''Allocamelus''' (a.k.a. '''Ass-Camel''') was the depiction of a [[mythical creature]] with the head of a [[donkey]] and the body of a [[camel]].

The '''art of Mesopotamia''' has survived in the archaeological record from early [[hunter-gatherer]] societies (10th millennium BC) on to the [[Bronze Age]] cultures of the [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Babylonia]]n and [[Assyria]]n empires. These empires were later replaced in the [[Iron Age]] by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian empires]]. Widely considered to be the [[cradle of civilization]], [[Mesopotamia]] brought significant cultural developments, including the oldest examples of writing. 
The art of Mesopotamia rivalled [[Art of Ancient Egypt|that of Ancient Egypt]] as the most grand, sophisticated and elaborate in western [[Eurasia]] from the 4th millennium BC until the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] conquered the region in the 6th century BC. The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that, with some exceptions,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 124-126&lt;/ref&gt;  painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculptures were also painted. [[Cylinder seal]]s have survived in large numbers, many including complex and detailed scenes despite their small size. 

Mesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, Chapters 2–5&lt;/ref&gt; Favourite subjects include deities, alone or with worshippers, and animals in several types of scenes: repeated in rows,  single, fighting each other or a human, [[confronted animals]] by themselves or flanking a human or god in the [[Master of Animals]] motif, or a [[Tree of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;Convenient summaries of the typical motifs of cylinder seals in the main periods are found throughout in Teissier&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone [[stela]]e, [[votive offering]]s, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 66–74&lt;/ref&gt; the fragmentary [[Stele of the Vultures]] is an early example of the inscribed type,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; and the Assyrian  [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]] a large and well preserved late one.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 66–74; 167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uruk period==
{{main|Art of Uruk}}
[[File:Cylinder seal lions Louvre MNB1167.jpg|thumb|Cylinder seal with [[serpopard]]s, c. 3000 BC, [[Uruk]]]]
The Protoliterate or [[Uruk period]], named after the city of [[Uruk]] in southern Mesopotamia, (ca. 4000 to 3100 BC) existed from the [[protohistory|protohistoric]] [[Chalcolithic]] to [[Early Bronze Age]] period, following the [[Ubaid period]] and succeeded by the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] generally dated to 3100–2900 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crawford|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; It saw the emergence of urban life in Mesopotamia, and the beginnings of [[Sumer|Sumerian civilization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crawford|2004|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and also the first "great creative age" of Mesopotamian art.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Slightly earlier, the northern city of [[Tell Brak]], today in [[Syria]], also saw urbanization, and the development of a temple with regional significance. This is called the Eye Temple after the many "eye idols", in fact [[votive]] offerings, found there, a type distinctive to this site. The stone [[Tell Brak Head]], 7 inches high, shows a simplified face; similar heads are in [[gypsum]]. These were evidently fitted to bodies that have not survived, probably of wood.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 241-242&lt;/ref&gt; Like temples further south, the Eye Temple was decorated with [[cone mosaic]]s made up of clay cylinders some four inches long, differently coloured to create simple patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 24, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant works from the southern cities in Sumer proper are the [[Warka Vase]] and [[Uruk Trough]], with complex multi-figured scenes of humans and animals, and the [[Mask of Warka]].  This is a more realistic head than the Tell Brak examples, like them made to top a wooden body; what survives of this is only the basic framework, to which coloured inlays, gold leaf hair, paint and jewellery were added.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 24-28, 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Guennol Lioness]] is an exceptionally powerful small figurine of a lion-headed monster,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps from the start of the next period.

There are a number of stone or [[alabaster]] vessels carved in deep [[relief]], and stone [[frieze]]s of animals, both designed for temples, where the vessels held offerings. Cylinder seals are already complex and very finely executed and, as later, seem to have been an influence on larger works.  Animals shown are often representations of the gods, another continuing feature of Mesopotamian art.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 28-37&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the period, despite being a time of considerable economic expansion, saw a decline in the quality of art, perhaps as demand outstripped the supply of artists.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Dynastic period==
[[File:Flickr - Nic's events - British Museum with Cory and Mary, 6 Sep 2007 - 185.jpg|thumb|[[Cylinder seal]] with impression; banquet scene, [[Ur]], c. 2600 BC]]
The [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]] is generally dated to 2900–2350 BC. While continuing many earlier trends, its art is marked by an emphasis on figures of worshippers and priests making offerings, and social scenes of worship, war and court life.  Copper becomes a significant medium for sculpture, probably despite most works having later being recycled for their metal.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Few if any copper sculptures are as large as the [[Tell al-'Ubaid Copper Lintel|Tell al-'Ubaid Lintel]], which is 2.59 metres wide and 1.07 metres high.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Many masterpieces have also been found at the Royal Cemetery at [[Ur]] (c. 2650 BC), including the two figures of a ''[[Ram in a Thicket]]'', the ''[[Copper Bull]]'' and a bull's head on one of the [[Lyres of Ur]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 61–66&lt;/ref&gt;  The so-called [[Standard of Ur]], actually an inlaid box or set of panels of uncertain function, is finely inlaid with partly figurative designs.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 71-76&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of 12 temple statues known as the [[Tell Asmar Hoard]], now split up, show gods, priests and donor worshippers at different sizes, but all in the same highly simplified style. All have greatly enlarged inlaid eyes, but the tallest figure, the main [[cult image]] depicting the local god, has enormous eyes that give it a "fierce power".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 46-49; the group are now divided between the [[Metropolitan Museum]], New York, [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]], Chicago, and the [[National Museum of Iraq]] (with the god).&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the period this geometric style was replaced by a strongly contrasting one giving "a detailed rendering of the physical peculiarities of the subject"; "Instead of sharply contrasting, clearly articulated masses, we see fluid transitions and infinitely modulated surfaces".&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 55-60, 55 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Akkadian period==
[[File:Victory stele of Naram Sin 9066.jpg|thumb|[[Victory Stele of Naram-Sin]], 2254-2218 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/victory-stele-naram-sin|title=Victory Stele of Naram-Sin {{!}} Louvre Museum {{!}} Paris|website=www.louvre.fr|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Akkadian Empire]] was the first to control not only all Mesopotamia, but other territories in the [[Levant]], from about 2271 to 2154 BC. The Akkadians were not Sumerian, and spoke a [[Semitic language]]. In art there was a great emphasis on the kings of the dynasty, alongside much that continued earlier Sumerian art. In large works and small ones such as seals, the degree of realism was considerably increased,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 83–91&lt;/ref&gt; but the seals show a "grim world of cruel conflict, of danger and uncertainty, a world in which man is subjected without appeal to the incomprehensible acts of distant and fearful divinities who he must serve but cannot love.  This sombre mood ... remained characteristic of Mesopotamian art..."&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Naram-Sin of Akkad|King Naram-Sin]]'s famous [[Victory Stele of Naram-Sin|Victory Stele]] depicts him as a god-king (symbolized by his horned helmet) climbing a mountain above his soldiers, and his enemies, the defeated [[Lullubi]]. The strongest indication that the stele is depicting a campaign to Cilicia is evidenced by the booty—a metal vessel—carried by one of Naram-Sin's soldiers. Completely foreign to Mesopotamia, the vessel closely resembles Anatolian crafts from Troy and Cilicia. These vessels—ceramic or metal—were produced during the Early Bronze III Period, which is around the time of Naram-Sin's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeon|first=John|date=1970|title=An Akkadian Victory Stele|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4171539|journal=Boston Museum Bulletin|volume=68|pages=239|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the stele was broken off at the top when it was stolen and carried off by the [[Elam]]ite forces of [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], it still strikingly reveals the pride, glory, and divinity of Naram-Sin. The application of hierarchical scale is used to emphasize Naram-Sin’s relative size to the mountain before him and obvious enlarged stature compared to the subjects below him, differentiating class status between Naram-Sin, Akkadian soldiers, and Lullabi enemies, which also reiterates the warrior as the a mighty protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art History|last=Stokstad|first=Marilyn|publisher=Pearson|year=2018|isbn=9780134479279|location=Upper Saddle River|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the more traditional horizontal frames are visible on smaller broken pieces. The stele seems to break from traditional Akkadian art style of layered registers by using successive diagonal tiers in step-like processions of Naram-Sin's soldiers up the hillside to communicate the story to viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/victory-stele-naram-sin|title=Victory Stele of Naram-Sin {{!}} Louvre Museum {{!}} Paris|website=www.louvre.fr|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is six feet and seven inches tall, and made from pink [[sandstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kleiner, Fred |title=Gardner's Art Through The Ages |publisher=Thomson-Wadsworth |location= |year=2005 |isbn=0-534-64095-8 |oclc= |doi= |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 86&lt;/ref&gt;  From the same reign, the bare legs and lower torso of the copper [[Bassetki Statue]] show an unprecedented level of realism, as does the imposing [[bronze]] head of a bearded ruler (Louvre).&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other artworks from the Akkadian Period is “Head of a Man,” a life-size, bronze bust found in Nineveh or modern day Ninua, Iraq. Experts speculate that the artwork reflects a generalized person rather than a specific individual and is suspected to represent Sargon himself because the piece is thought to date to the time of his rule. The intricate curling and patterning of the beard and the complex hairstyle suggests royalty, power, and wealth from an ideal male in society. Aside from its aesthetic traits, this piece is spectacular because it is the earliest hollow-cast sculpture item known to use the lost-wax casting process. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art History|last=Stokstad|first=Marilyn|publisher=Pearson|year=2018|isbn=9780134479279|location=Upper Saddle River|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is deliberate damage on the left side of the face and eye, indicating that the bust was intentionally slashed at a later period to demonstrate political iconoclasm. By selectively disfiguring the head, the offender uses symbolism to exhibit defeat and humiliation from a ruler once mightily portrayed. From one perspective, the gouged eyes and butched ears might have served to literally depict the individual’s physical state from an actual mutilation used as political punishment. Although it is unclear of who did this or where it occurred, experts speculate that this happened during one of the chaotic revolts during the Akkadian period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nylander|first=Carl|date=July 1980|title=Earless in Nineveh: Who Mutilated ‘Sargon's’ Head?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/504709|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=84|pages=329-333|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the Akkadians and Assyrians==
[[File:Lilith Periodo de Isin Larsa y Babilonia.JPG|thumb|The [[Burney Relief]], probably of [[Ishtar]], [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]], around 1800 BC]]
The political history of this period of nearly 1300 years is complicated, including the [[Neo-Sumerian art]] of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], the Isin-Larsa Period and [[First Babylonian Dynasty]] or Old Babylonian period, an interlude under the rule of the [[Kassites]], and other periods. It ended with the decisive advent of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] under [[Adad-nirari II]], whose reign began in 911 BC.  Life was often unstable, and non-Sumerian invasions a recurring theme.  During the period [[Babylon]] became a great city, which was often the seat of the dominant power. The period was not one of great artistic development, these invaders failing to bring new artistic impetus,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 127&lt;/ref&gt; and much religious art was rather self-consciously conservative, perhaps in a deliberate assertion of Sumerian values.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 93&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of execution is often lower than in preceding and later periods.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 110-116, 126&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Gudea]], ruler of [[Lagash]] (reign ca. 2144 to 2124 BC), was a great patron of new temples early in the period, and an unprecedented 26 [[statues of Gudea]], mostly rather small, have survived from temples, beautifully executed, mostly in "costly and very hard [[diorite]]" stone.  These exude a confident serenity.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 93 (quoted)-99&lt;/ref&gt;  The northern [[Royal Palace of Mari]] produced a number of important objects from before about 1800 BC, including the [[Statue of Iddi-Ilum]],&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 114–119&lt;/ref&gt; and the most extensive remains of [[Investiture of Zimri-Lim|Mesopotamian palace frescos]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 124-126&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Burney Relief]] is an unusual, elaborate, and relatively large (20 x 15&amp;nbsp;inches) [[terracotta]] plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions.  It comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BC, and may also be moulded.  Similar pieces, small statues or reliefs of deities, were made for altars in homes or small wayside shrines, and small moulded terracotta ones were probably available as souvenirs from temples.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 110–112&lt;/ref&gt;

This was generally not a period of the highest quality for cylinder seal images; at different times the inscription took prominence over the image, and the variety of scenes shown reduced, with the "presentation scene" of a king before a god, or an official before a seated king, becoming the norm at times.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 102-126&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially from the Kassite period several stone [[kudurru]] stelae survive, mostly taken up with inscriptions recording grants of land, boundary lines, and other official records, but often with figures and emblems of the gods or the king as well; a [[Land grant to Marduk-apla-iddina I by Meli-Shipak II|land grant by Meli-Shipak II]] is an example.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assyrian period==
{{main|Assyrian sculpture}}
[[File:A glazed terracotta tile from Nimrud, Iraq, depicting a court scene, currently housed in the British Museum, London.jpg|thumb|Glazed terracotta tile from [[Nimrud]], with a court scene, British Museum]]
An [[Assyria]]n artistic style distinct from that of Babylonian art, which was the dominant contemporary art in Mesopotamia, began to emerge c. 1500 BC, well before their empire included [[Sumer]], and lasted until the fall of [[Nineveh]] in 612 BC.
[[File:Britishmuseumassyrianrelieftwohorsemennimrud.jpg|thumb|left|Assyrian relief from [[Nimrud]], from c 728 BC]]

The conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia and much surrounding territory by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour of the art of the neighbouring Egyptian empire.  From around 879 BC the Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone or [[gypsum]] [[alabaster]], originally painted, for palaces. The precisely delineated reliefs concern royal affairs, chiefly hunting and war making. Predominance is given to animal forms, particularly horses and lions, which are magnificently represented in great detail. 

Human figures are comparatively rigid and static but are also minutely detailed, as in triumphal scenes of sieges, battles, and individual combat. Among the best known Assyrian reliefs are the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' scenes in alabaster, and the [[Lachish reliefs]] showing a war campaign in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], both of which are of the 7th century BC, from Nineveh and now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 141–193&lt;/ref&gt; Reliefs were also carved [[rock relief|into rock faces]], as at [[Shikaft-e Gulgul]], a style which the Persians continued.

The Assyrians produced relatively little sculpture in the round, with the partial exception of colossal human-headed ''[[lamassu]]'' guardian figures, with the bodies of lions or bulls, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and often also five legs, so that both views seem complete).  These marked fortified royal gateways, an architectural form common throughout Asia Minor.  The Assyrian form of the [[winged genie]], winged spirits with bearded human heads seen in reliefs, influenced Ancient Greek art, which in its "[[orientalizing period]]" added various winged mythological beasts including the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], [[griffin]] and winged horses ([[Pegasus]]) and men ([[Talos]]).&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before dominating the region the Assyrians had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 141–193&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Nimrud]] the carved [[Nimrud ivories]] and bronze bowls were found that are decorated in the Assyrian style but were produced in several parts of the Near East including many by [[Phoenicia]]n and Aramaean artisans.

==Neo-Babylonian period==
[[Image:Ishtar Gate at Berlin Museum.jpg|thumb|The [[reconstruction (architecture)|reconstruction]] of the Ishtar Gate in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]]]]

The famous [[Ishtar Gate]], part of which is now reconstructed in the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], was the main entrance into [[Babylon]], built in about 575 BC by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the king of the [[Neo-Babylonian]] who exiled the Jews; the empire lasted from 626 BC to 539 BC.  The walls surrounding the entrance way are decorated with rows of large relief animals in glazed brick, which has therefore retained its colours.  Lions, dragons and bulls are represented.  The gate was part of a much larger scheme for a processional way into the city, from which there are sections in many other museums.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 203–205&lt;/ref&gt;  Large wooden gates throughout the period were strengthened and decorated with large horizontal metal bands, often decorated with reliefs, several of which have survived, such as the various [[Balawat Gates]].

Other traditional types of art continued to be produced, and the Neo-Babylonians were very keen to stress their ancient heritage.  Many sophisticated and finely carved seals survive.  After Mesopotamia fell to the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]], which had much simpler artistic traditions, Mesopotamian art was, with [[Ancient Greek art]], the main influence on the cosmopolitan Achaemenid style that emerged,&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 348-349&lt;/ref&gt; and many ancient elements were retained in the area even in the [[Hellenistic art]] that succeeded the conquest of the region by [[Alexander the Great]].

==Collections==
By some margin, the most important collections are those of (in no particular order) the [[Louvre Museum]], the [[British Museum]] and the [[National Museum of Iraq]].  The last was extensively looted after the breakdown of law and order following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], but the most important objects have largely been recovered.  Several other museums have good collections, especially of the very numerous cylinder seals.  Syrian museums have important collections from sites in modern Syria.  The reconstructed Ishtar Gate in Berlin is arguably the most spectacular single work in a museum.

[[File:Lilly the cat 1.jpg|thumb|A 16-year-old female black cat, sleeping]]
A '''black cat''' is a [[Cat|domestic cat]] with black fur that may be a mixed or specific [[Purebred|breed]]. The [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA) recognizes 22 cat [[breed]]s that can come with solid black coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/black-cat-breeds.aspx|title= Black Cat Breeds and History|first= Stacy N.|last= Hackett|date= 2015-08-17|publisher= CatChannel.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150906094914/http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/black-cat-breeds.aspx|archivedate= 2015-09-06|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bombay cat|Bombay]] breed is exclusively black. All-black fur pigmentation is slightly more prevalent in male cats than female cats. Their high [[melanin]] pigment content causes most black cats to have yellow (golden) eyes ([[iris (anatomy)|irises]]).

==Coat==
{{see also|Cat coat genetics}}
Any cat whose fur is a single color, including black, is known as a "solid" or "self". A "solid black" cat may be coal black, grayish black, or brownish black. Most solid-colored cats result from a recessive gene that suppresses the tabby pattern. Sometimes the tabby pattern is not completely suppressed; faint markings may appear in certain lights, even on a solid black cat. A cat having black fur with white roots is known as a "black smoke."&lt;ref name="colorfaq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cat Colors FAQ: Common Colors |url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/colors.html |publisher=Cat Fanciers Chat (fanciers.com) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ISL6nRl?url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/colors.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black cats can also "rust" in sunlight, the coat turning a lighter brownish shade.&lt;ref name="colorfaq"/&gt; Eumelanin, the pigment that is required to produce the black fur, is somewhat fragile, so the rusting effect can be more pronounced in cats that frequently spend time in the sun. A rarer condition that can also cause rusting is a deficiency of the enzyme tyrosine, which is required to produce eumelanin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paws-and-effect.com/why-is-my-black-cat-rusting/|title=Why Is My Black Cat "Rusting"?|publisher=Paws and Effect|date=2015-09-13|accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A black Cat-photographed by Rajdeep Das.JPG|thumb|A black cat "rusting" (coat turning a lighter brown shade) in sunlight]]

In addition to the [[Bombay (cat)|Bombay]], the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] allows solid black as a color option in 21 other breeds. The color description for those breeds is:

:''Black'': dense coal black, sound from roots to tip of fur. Free from any tinge of rust on the tips. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.

The exceptions are:
*[[Oriental Shorthair|Oriental]] – ''Ebony'': dense coal black. Free from any tinge of rust on tips or smoke undercoat. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
*[[Sphynx cat|Sphynx]] – ''Black'': black. One level tone from nose to tip of tail. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
*[[Ragamuffin cat|Ragamuffin]] – Although black is not specifically mentioned, the standard allows for "any color, with or without white," so technically speaking, an all-black Ragamuffin would be allowed under the breed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cats.about.com/od/blackcats/ss/factsaboutblackcats_5.htm |title=Facts About Black Cats |author=Syufy, Franny |publisher=[[About.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ISnsOfs?url=http://cats.about.com/od/blackcats/ss/factsaboutblackcats_5.htm |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical associations==

===Superstition, prejudice, bringer of good or bad luck===

The [[folklore]] surrounding black cats varies from culture to culture. The [[Scottish people|Scots]] believe that a strange black cat's arrival to the home signifies prosperity. In [[Celtic mythology]], a [[fairy]] known as the [[Cat sìth]] takes the form of a black cat. Black cats are also considered good luck in the rest of Britain and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/superstition/library/black_cats |title=Superstition Bash Black Cats |year=2011 |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ITHwwRN?url=http://www.csicop.org/superstition/library/black_cats |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is believed that a lady who owns a black cat will have many suitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petside.com/article/black-cat-myths |title=Black Cat Myths |author=Singer, Jo |publisher=PetSide.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ITlNtPa?url=http://www.petside.com/article/black-cat-myths |archivedate=2011-10-09 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western history, black cats have typically been looked upon as a symbol of evil omens, specifically being suspected of being the [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s of witches, or actually [[shape-shifting]] witches themselves. Most of Europe considers the black cat a symbol of bad luck, particularly if one walks across the path in front of a person, which is believed to be an omen of misfortune and death. In Germany, some believe that black cats crossing a person's path from right to left, is a bad omen. But from left to right, the cat is granting favorable times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.best-cat-art.com/black-cats.html |title=Black Cats... Do black cats mean good luck or bad luck for you? |first= |last= |year=2011 |publisher=Best-Cat-Art.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IU8Z7tU?url=http://www.best-cat-art.com/black-cats.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom it is commonly considered that a black cat crossing a person's path is a good omen.&lt;ref name="Superstitionsonline"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://superstitionsonline.com/cats/|title= Black Cats and Cats in General|date= 2012-01-19|publisher= Superstitionsonline.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150401190628/http://superstitionsonline.com/cats|archivedate= 2015-04-01|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black cat in folklore has been able to change into human shape to act as a spy or courier for witches or demons. When the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] arrived at [[Plymouth Rock]], they brought with them a devout faith in the Bible. They also brought a deepening suspicion of anything deemed of Satan and were a deeply suspicious group. They viewed the black cat as a companion, or a familiar to witches. Anyone caught with a black cat would be severely punished or even killed. They viewed the black cat as part demon and part sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecatsite.com/Snips/124/The-Mystique-Behind-Black-Cats.html |title=The Mystique Behind Black Cats |first=Mary Ann |last=Miller |year=2011 |publisher=The Cat Site.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6208I6S7P?url=http://www.thecatsite.com/Snips/124/The-Mystique-Behind-Black-Cats.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2011-09-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These superstitions led people to kill black cats. There is no evidence from England of regular large-scale massacres of "satanic" cats, or of burning them in [[midsummer]] bonfires, as sometimes occurred elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t71.e150 |title=''A Dictionary of English Folklore''|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2000 |accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the supernatural powers ascribed to black cats were sometimes viewed positively; for example, sailors considering a "[[ship's cat]]" would want a black one because it would bring good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions |last=Eyers |first=Jonathan |year=2011 |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London|isbn=978-1-4081-3131-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea (see [[Ship's cat]]). The view of black cats being favorable creatures is attributed specifically to the Egyptian goddess Bast (or [[Bastet]]), the cat goddess. Egyptian households believed they could gain favor from Bastet by hosting black cats in their household. This view was held in the early 17th century by the English monarch [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Upon the death of his treasured pet black cat, he is said to have lamented that his luck was gone. True to his claim, he was arrested the very next day and [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|charged with high treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cats.lovetoknow.com/Black_Cats |title=Black Cats |first=Ann |last=Parkinson |date= |publisher=Love To Know Cats |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IX7iggs?url=http://cats.lovetoknow.com/Black_Cats |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piracy|Pirates]] of the 18th century believed that a black cat would bring different kinds of luck. If a black cat walks towards someone, that person will have bad luck. If a black cat walks away from someone, then that person will have good luck.

Conversely in the United Kingdom if a black cat walks towards someone, it brings good fortune, but if it walks away, it takes the good luck with it.&lt;ref name="Superstitionsonline" /&gt; If a black cat walks onto a ship and then walks off it, the ship is doomed to sink on its next trip.

Black cats have been found to have lower odds of adoption in American [[Animal shelter|shelters]] compared to other colors except brown, although black animals in general take more time to find homes. The reasons given include not only superstition, but also the perception of black as "boring" compared to other colors as well as the belief that black cats don't photograph well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psyeta.org/jaaws/full_articles/5.1/leeper.pdf|title= Prediction of adoption versus euthanasia among dogs and cats in a California animal shelter|first1= Merry|last1= Lepper|first2= Philip H.|last2= Kass|first3= Lynette A.|last3= Hart|year= 2002|work= Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, 2002;5(1):29-42 |publisher= School of Veterinary Medicine [[University of California]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060925235905/http://www.psyeta.org/jaaws/full_articles/5.1/leeper.pdf |archivedate= 2006-09-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blkcatappr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://holidappy.com/holidays/Why-You-Should-Celebrate-Black-Cat-Appreciation-Day-on-August-17th|title=Why You Should Celebrate Black Cat Appreciation Day on August 17th|date=2018-07-19|author=Jennifer Wilber|publisher=holidappy.com|accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shelters also suspend or limit adoptions of black cats around [[Halloween]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/living/black-cats-irpt/index.html?hpt=hp_c4|title= To be a black cat on Halloween|first= Rachel|last= Rodriguez|date= 2014-10-31|publisher= [[CNN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031142859/http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/living/black-cats-irpt/index.html?hpt=hp_c4|archivedate= 2014-10-31|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; for fear they will be tortured, or used as "living decorations" for the holiday and then abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/blackcat.asp |title=Cat o'Nine Tales |first1=Barbara |last1=Mikkelson |first2=David |last2=Mikkelson |date=2005-10-27 |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IXk2kbc?url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/blackcat.asp |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truth_halloween"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=74&amp;SubsectionID=114&amp;ArticleID=86024|author=Boks, Ed|title=The truth about black cats and Halloween|location=Prescott, Arizona|work=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61yCKuiNb?url=http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=74&amp;SubsectionID=114&amp;ArticleID=86024|archivedate=2011-09-25|date=2010-10-06|accessdate=2010-10-10|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/article_9bcbeea6-ff85-11e0-8a42-0019bb30f31a.html |title=Humane Society refuses black cat adoption during Halloween season |author=Crump, Morgan |date=2011-10-25 |publisher=dailytoreador.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62yLXU9mn?url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/article_9bcbeea6-ff85-11e0-8a42-0019bb30f31a.html |archivedate=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2011-10-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, no one has ever documented in the history of humane work any relationship between adopting black cats and cats being killed or injured.

In the early days of television in the United States, many stations located on [[VHF]] channel 13 used a black cat as a mascot in order to make sport of being located on an "unlucky" channel number.

===Anarcho-syndicalism===

[[Image:Anarchist black cat.svg|left|thumb|The black cat of the Industrial Workers of the World, also adopted as a symbol by anarcho-syndicalists]]
Since the 1880s, the [[political colour|color]] [[black]] has been associated with [[anarchism]]. The black cat, in an alert, fighting stance was later adopted as an [[anarchist symbol]].

More specifically, the black cat—often called the "sab cat" or "sabo-tabby"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary |title=IWW Union Dictionary and Glossary |first= |last= |date=2005-05-01 |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=[[Industrial Workers of the World]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IYWAFaL?url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary |archivedate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2011-10-09 |quote=A symbol for "sabotage" (i.e. inefficiency at the point of production by disgruntled workers), usually represented by a black cat with bared teeth. Also called "sab kitty", "sabo-tabby", or "the cat". |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—is associated with [[anarcho-syndicalism]], a branch of anarchism that focuses on labor organizing (see [[Wildcat strike]]).

In testimony before the court in a 1918 trial of [[Industrial Workers of the World]] leaders, [[Ralph Chaplin]], who is generally credited with creating the IWW's black cat symbol, stated that the black cat "was commonly used by the boys as representing the idea of [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|sabotage]]. The idea being to frighten the employer by the mention of the name sabotage, or by putting a black cat somewhere around. You know if you saw a black cat go across your path you would think, if you were superstitious, you are going to have a little bad luck. The idea of sabotage is to use a little black cat on the boss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salerno |first1=Salvatore |title=Red November, Black November: Culture and Community in the Industrial Workers of the World |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_M25WbGARJwC&amp;pg=PA178|year=1989|location= Albany, New York|publisher= [[SUNY Press]]|isbn=0-7914-0089-1 |page=178 }} from U.S. v.

==Adoption and Black Cat Day==
October 27 has been designated ‘Black Cat Day’ by [[Cats Protection]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref name="NBCatDay"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cats.org.uk/get-involved/national-black-cat-day/|title= National Black Cat Day 2015|date= 2015|publisher= Cats Protection|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151005163431/http://www.cats.org.uk/get-involved/national-black-cat-day/|archivedate= 2015-10-05|deadurl= yes|accessdate= 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate the virtues of black cats and to encourage people to adopt an unwanted black cat. Cats Protection's own figures suggest that black cats are more difficult for them to find a new home for than other colours.&lt;ref name="NBCatDay" /&gt; In 2014, the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] reported that 70% of the abandoned cats in its care were black,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2709721/Hundreds-black-cats-abandoned-owners-don-t-look-good-SELFIES.html |title=Hundreds of black cats are being abandoned by their owners because they don't look good in selfies |first=Harriet |last=Arkell |date=2014-07-29 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6chEq4l7K?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2709721/Hundreds-black-cats-abandoned-owners-don-t-look-good-SELFIES.html |archivedate=2015-10-31 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a possible reason was that people considered black cats [[Photogenic|"un-photogenic"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/black-cats-being-rejected-because-they-dont-look-good-in-selfies-says-rspca-9637202.html|title= Black cats being rejected because they don't look good in selfies, says RSPCA|first= Christopher|last= Hooten|date= 2014-07-30|location= London|work= [[The Independent]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150405040719/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/black-cats-being-rejected-because-they-dont-look-good-in-selfies-says-rspca-9637202.html|archivedate= 2015-04-05|deadurl= no|accessdate= 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, "Black Cat Appreciation Day" is August 17.&lt;ref name="AnimalFound"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://animalfoundation.com/black-cats-the-good-the-bad-and-the-misunderstood/|title= Black Cats — The Good, The Bad, and The Misunderstood|date= n.d.|location= Las Vegas, Nevada|publisher= The Animal Foundation|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021839/http://animalfoundation.com/black-cats-the-good-the-bad-and-the-misunderstood/|archivedate= 2016-10-28|deadurl= no|accessdate= 2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by the [[ASPCA]] shows that black cats are the least likely to be adopted from shelters of any type of cat.&lt;ref name="AnimalFound" /&gt; This can be partly because of the superstition behind black cats such as their association with witchcraft or bad luck, or because they appear dull next to more colorful cats. In 2014 [[Toronto]], Canada's largest city, held an event on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] during which people could adopt a black cat without paying the usual $75 adoption fee, in order to encourage the adoption of black cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/22/adoption_fees_being_waved_for_black_cats_at_shelters.html|title= Adoption fees being waived for black cats at shelters|first= Katherine|last= Declerq|date= 2014-11-22|location= Toronto, Ontario|work= [[Toronto Star]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160410110242/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/22/adoption_fees_being_waved_for_black_cats_at_shelters.html|archivedate= 2016-04-10|deadurl= no|quote= Animal Services will be hosting a “cat adoption blitz” in honour of Black Friday. The $75 adoption fee will be waived from four different animal shelters across the city, as well as at a number of partner locations. The only cost to adopt a black cat will be a $15 license fee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend had now spread across the United States, with many shelters offering free adoption of black cats on Black Friday.

With the success of the 2018 African-themed [[Superhero film]], ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', there was a fad of adopting black domestic cats as pets and naming them after various characters of the film such as [[T'Challa]] and [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahsan|first1=Sadaf|title=Thanks to Black Panther, there's been a reported rise in black cat adoptions|url=http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/movies/thanks-to-black-panther-theres-been-a-reported-rise-in-black-cat-adoptions|accessdate=2 March 2018|publisher=The National Post|date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that usually people were not going out of their way to follow this fad, but visited animal shelters to simply adopt a pet under normal circumstances and were inspired by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to adopt a black cat when they see one. Regardless, to reduce the chance of such cats being abandoned when the fad fades, reputable animal shelter personnel took the usual precautions of having potential adopters fill out questionnaires to weed out potentially abusive guardians and have them read literature about the needs and responsibilities of such a pet to dissuade the less conscientious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chorney|first1=Saryn|title=A Kitten Named Wakanda?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3939">'''Blockage discount''' is an art-business-related and legal [[term of art]] for referring to the money [[discounts and allowances|discount]] assigned to a group of artworks by a single artist when that group of works is to be released to market as a group rather than individually. A blockage discount adjusts the [[fair market value]] of the works downward because of the risks of [[depreciation]] when a large volume of art is released into the market all at once.&lt;ref name="inreW"&gt;In re Warhol, No. 824/87, 1994 WL 245246 * 1 (Surr. Ct., N.Y. Co. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grosz"&gt;[http://www.lexisone.com/lx1/caselaw/freecaselaw?action=OCLDisplayLanding&amp;format=FULL&amp;sourceID=bcfbd&amp;searchTerm=eIWY.ggXa.aadj.ecHc&amp;searchFlag=y&amp;l1loc=FCLOW Grosz v. Serge Sabarsky, Inc.], 24 A.D.3d 264, 806 N.Y.S.2d 498, 500 (1st Dep’t 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bresler"&gt;Lerner and Bresler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qSInf61-xaUC&amp;pg=PA1157&amp;vq=blockage+discount&amp;dq=blockage+discount+art&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Art Law: The Guide for Collectors, Investors, Dealers, and Artists], Practising Law Institute, 1998, p.1157 et seq.. ({{ISBN|978-1402406508}}, 3d edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax issues==
A blockage discount adjusting fair market value also affects the tax consequences of a sale in the U.S., and is frequently a subject of litigation when an artist dies while holding a large collection of her or his own work. For instance, when [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] died she had over 400 of her own works in her estate, and when [[Andy Warhol]] died he had over 90,000 works, including 4,100 paintings, 9,000 drawings, 19,000 prints and 63,000 photographs.&lt;ref name="inde"&gt;Inde, Vilis, Art in the Courtroom, Praeger, 1998, p. 158. {{ISBN|978-0-275-95971-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Georgia O'Keeffe's case, her estate's appraisers established blockage discounts based on solid evidence of market sales, but the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] used its own valuation and the [[United States Tax Court|Tax Court]] assessed a resulting tax of more than the valuation of the collected works at her death.&lt;ref name="establishing"&gt;[http://www.pgdc.com/pgdc/article/2004/05/establishing-value-important Establishing a Value is Important!], Planned Giving Design Center, LLC. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In Andy Warhol's case Surrogate Court of New York rejected the proposed discounts of Christe's, which averaged 60%. Instead, the court applied an average discount of 25%.  The court failed to articulate the specific rationale for its determination, but did state that Warhol was more famous than Smith &amp; O'Keeffe. The court's application of an average discount of 25% has been criticized by attorneys and appraisers because, inter alia, it ignored the necessary time it would take to sell 90,000 pieces of art.&lt;ref name="inde" /&gt; Therefore, accountants and estate planners for artists plan with such eventualities in mind.&lt;ref name="Englebrecht"&gt;Englebrecht, [http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2002/0902/features/f094002.htm Valuation of Art Objects for Estate Tax Purposes], The CPA Journal, 09/02/2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS has stated that [[carrying cost]]s and [[opportunity costs]] are relevant factors for consideration in blockage discounts, along with [[time to market]].&lt;ref&gt;Lerner and Bresler, pp. 1354, 1364.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Western dress codes}}
'''Business casual''' is an ambiguously defined [[dress code]] adopted by some [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] workplaces in [[Western world|Western countries]], comprising more [[casual wear]] than [[informal wear]] ("dress clothes"), but less casual than [[smart casual]].

Widespread acceptance of business casual attire was preceded by [[Casual Friday]]s which originated [[California]], [[United States]], in the 1990s, in turn inspired by the [[Hawaii]]an 1960s casual custom of [[Aloha Friday]].&lt;ref name="BrownArthur2002"&gt;Brown &amp; Arthur 2002, p. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HopeTozian2002"&gt;Hope &amp; Tozian 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There is no generally agreed definition of "business casual".  One definition of business casual states that it includes [[khaki]] pants, [[slacks]], and [[skirts]], as well as short-sleeved [[polo shirt]]s  and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes jeans, tennis shoes, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts.&lt;ref name="Interviewing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/csc/undergraduate/interviewing.shtml|title = Interviewing {{!}} Career Services Center {{!}} Marquette University| website = Marquette University Career Services Center | accessdate = 26 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906180709/http://www.marquette.edu//csc/undergraduate/interviewing.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams.&lt;ref name="Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"&gt;{{cite web|title=Business casual attire|url=http://www.career.vt.edu/JobSearchGuide/BusinessCasualAttire.html#ATTIREMENWOMEN|publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dress for Success" advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as "a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required," which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; [[blouse]]s, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no [[necktie]]; some [[sweaters]]; and closed-toe shoes.&lt;ref name=UTM/&gt; The Canadian university ends with the warning that "it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes.... Don’t let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional."&lt;ref name=UTM&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/careers/business-formal-professional-or-business-casual | title = Business formal/professional or business casual? | publisher = [[University of Toronto Mississauga]] | accessdate = 28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another author wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' that "Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of [[chinos]], a [[blazer]] and a good shirt, no tie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5eec3cd6-8bf2-11e0-854c-00144feab49a.html#axzz2kbppAQhD|title=Why business casual makes me smart|last=Shrimsley|first=Robert|date=3 June 2011|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[BBC]] article suggested that a "safe global standard" consists of "a button down shirt," "jackets or blazers, khaki or gray slacks, and leather shoes."&lt;ref name=BBC-2011&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20111118-business-casual-attire-around-the-world | date = 22 November 2011 | title = ‘Business casual’ attire around the world | work = BBC Business | first = Chris | last = McGinnis | publisher = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It warned, however, that great variation exists between countries and regions within countries.&lt;ref name=BBC-2011/&gt; A U.S. menswear retailer advises men to wear a collared shirt, chinos, navy blazer, and brown shoes, while making sure to look "clean and well-groomed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.paulfredrick.com/2010/05/25/rules/10-tips-for-todays-business-casual-wardrobe | title = 10 Tips for Today’s Business Casual Wardrobe | publisher = Paul Fredrick | location = Fleetwood | accessdate = 11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributor to ''[[Forbes]]'' asked her Facebook friends to define business casual, and found a slightly more casual apparent consensus not forcibly including a jacket: "For men: trousers/khakis and a shirt with a collar. For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear." A response to that was "I disagree. No khakis." She states that "there’s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual wardrobe. All most people know is they don’t want to see too much of a colleague’s body, including feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/reneesylvestrewilliams/2012/05/09/what-is-business-casual/|title=What is Business Casual?|last=Sylvestre-Williams|first=Renee|date=9 May 2012|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">The '''Contemporary Art Research Centre''' is a Research Centre within the Department of Fine Art, Kingston University, England. The founding Directors are Louis Nixon and Elizabeth Price, and the Director from 2016 is Mandy Ure . The stated ethos of the centre specifically refers to the research of [[André Breton]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[We aim] to build and provide an intellectual and creative milieu for innovation in contemporary fine art. Taking its identity from André Breton's articulation of the imagination it [The Centre] draws on the legacy of surrealism to imagine and enact possibilities of contemporary art in contingency with social politics, technology, models of knowledge and modes of experience. In the essay ''Once Upon a Time'' [Il était une fois] Breton argues for the transformative power of the imagination, that it may be applied instrumentally to change circumstances yet is also excessive to utility, absurd and radically profane. The Centre aims to house this rich range of useful/less imaginative invention. Conceits of newness do not distract us, but resourceful adaptations, hybrids, mutations, and détournement, as well as attention to the realm of the overlooked, the scatological and absurd promise of stuff, recognised through play—these things are cultivated here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fada.kingston.ac.uk//research/car/car.php Louis Nixon and Elizabeth Price, CARC webpage, accessed on 16 February, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">'''Cairo Contemporary Dance Center''' ('''CCDC''') is an independent space for [[contemporary dance]] in [[Egypt]]. It’s the first contemporary dance school in Africa and the Middle East, offering a 3-year full-time professional training program for young dancers, choreographers and dance teachers.&lt;ref name="Drosos"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drosos.org/en/projekte/centre-de-danse-contemporaine-du-caire/|title=Cairo Contemporary Dance Center - drosos(…) Foundation|newspaper=drosos(…)|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides artistic residencies, as well as open classes and workshops in different kinds of dance and activities.

==History==
Cairo Contemporary Dance Center was founded in 2012 by [[Karima Mansour]], under the patronage of the Egyptian Ministry of Culture, at the Creativity Center on the ground of [[Cairo Opera House]].&lt;ref name="Up in the Air"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.madamasr.com/en/2013/11/26/feature/culture/contemporary-dance-center-up-in-the-air/|title=Contemporary Dance Center up in the air|newspaper=مدى مصر|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyNews"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/07/contemporary-dance-programme-in-peril/|title=Contemporary dance programme in peril|date=2013-07-07|website=Daily News Egypt|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Right to Dance"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cairoscene.com/ArtsAndCulture/The-Right-to-Dance|title=The Right to Dance|website=Cairo Scene|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It moved to its current location in January 2014, and currently operates as an independent project under the umbrella of MAAT for Contemporary Art.&lt;ref name="Journey"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cairoscene.com/ArtsAndCulture/The-Arduous-Journey-to-An-Egyptian-Contemporary-Dance-Utopia|title=The Arduous Journey to An Egyptian Contemporary Dance Utopia|website=Cairo Scene|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school==
Cairo Contemporary Dance Center was the first professional contemporary dance full-time school in Africa and the Arab world. The 3-year full-time professional training program is officially recognized by the UNESCO [[International Dance Council]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cid-portal.org/site/index.php/2012-01-08-15-56-32/register-of-members/|title=Register of Members|website=www.cid-portal.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first generation of students graduated in June 2015, and a new generation started the three year program in September 2016.

CCDC welcomes every year a diversity of international and Egyptian teachers, including [[Laurance Rudic]],&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/03/10/the-promising-future-of-contemporary-dance/|title=The promising future of contemporary dance|date=2013-03-10|website=Daily News Egypt|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Mantsoe]],&lt;ref name="Etrigg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://etrigg.com/location/cairo-contemporary-dance-center-1-mousa-galal-square-mohandesin-12655-cairo-egypt/1152244/|title=Cairo Contemporary Dance Center مركز الرقص المعاصر - 1 Mousa Galal Square Mohandesin 12655 Cairo Egypt {{!}} etrigg.com|website=etrigg.com|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Tompkins (dancer)|Mark Tompkins]], [[Olivier Dubois]],&lt;ref name="Etrigg" /&gt; and [[Claude Brumachon]].&lt;ref name="Etrigg" /&gt;

==Other activities==

In addition to its professional training, CCDC also offers to the general public open classes and workshops for adults and children in several disciplines covering [[dance]], [[martial arts]] and other activities.&lt;ref name="Totally Egypt"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.totallyegypt.com/event/detail.php?id=22561|title=CCDC Open Classes, Workshops and Activities!|website=TotallyEgypt|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workshops are also regularly organized with invited local and international artists, in different disciplines including [[contemporary dance]], [[contact improvisation]], [[acting]], [[tango]],&lt;ref name="Tango"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cairoscene.com/ArtsAndCulture/A-Taste-of-Tango-in-the-Heart-of-Cair|title=A Taste of Tango in the Heart of Cairo|website=Cairo Scene|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[yoga]].

'''''Children Playing Before a Statue of [[Hercules]]''''' is a [[2005 in literature|2005]] anthology of [[short stories]] edited by [[David Sedaris]].

Sedaris published this book in order to support [[826NYC]], a nonprofit writing and tutoring center in Brooklyn, New York. All of his proceeds, after permission expenses, from ''Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules'' will benefit this organization designed to help students ages six to eighteen develop their writing skills through free writing workshops, publishing projects, and one-on-one help with homework and English-language learning. In the book's epilogue, [[Sarah Vowell]] describes [[826NYC]]'s work.

The book's title references [[:File:Werff, Adriaen van der - Children Playing before a Hercules Group - 1687.jpg|a painting]] by [[Adriaen van der Werff]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6460">{{short description|the part of a molecule responsible for its color}}
A '''chromophore''' is the part of a [[molecule]] responsible for its [[color]].&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01076.html Chromophore]&lt;/ref&gt;
The color that is seen by our eyes is the one not [[Absorption (light)|absorbed]] within a certain [[wavelength]] spectrum of [[visible spectrum|visible light]]. The chromophore is a region in the molecule where the energy difference between two separate [[molecular orbitals]] falls within the range of the visible spectrum. Visible light that hits the chromophore can thus be absorbed by exciting an [[electron]] from its [[ground state]] into an [[excited state]].

In biological molecules that serve to capture or detect light energy, the chromophore is the [[Functional group|moiety]] that causes a [[conformational change]] of the molecule when hit by light.

[[File:Beta-Carotene conjugation.svg|thumb|400px| The eleven conjugated double bonds that form the chromophore of the molecule are highlighted in red.]]

== Conjugated pi-bond system chromophores ==
[[File:RetinalCisandTrans.svg|380px|right|thumb|'''Conjugated chromophore''' that straightens in response to a [[photon]] γ (light), of the correct wavelength: 11-cis-retinal becomes [[retinal|all-trans-retinal]]]]

In the [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] chromophores, the [[Molecular electron transition|electrons jump between energy levels]] that are extended [[pi bond|pi orbitals]], created by a series of alternating [[chemical bond|single and double bonds]], often in [[aromatic]] systems.  Common examples include [[retinal]] (used in the eye to detect light), various [[food coloring]]s, fabric [[dye]]s ([[azo compound]]s), [[pH indicator]]s, [[lycopene]], [[Carotene|β-carotene]], and [[anthocyanins]].  Various factors in a chromophore's structure go into determining at what wavelength region in a spectrum the chromophore will absorb.  Lengthening or extending a [[conjugated system]] with more unsaturated (multiple) bonds in a molecule will tend to shift absorption to longer wavelengths.  [[Woodward-Fieser rules]] can be used to approximate [[ultraviolet]]-visible maximum absorption wavelength in organic compounds with conjugated pi-bond systems.

Some of these are metal complex chromophores, which contain a metal in a [[coordination complex]] with ligands. Examples are [[chlorophyll]], which is used by plants for photosynthesis and [[hemoglobin]], the oxygen transporter in the blood of vertebrate anirnals.  In these two examples, a metal is complexed at the center of a [[tetrapyrrole]] [[macrocycle]] ring: the metal being iron in the [[heme group]] (iron in a [[porphyrin]] ring) of hemoglobin, or magnesium complexed in a [[chlorin]]-type ring in the case of chlorophyll.  The highly conjugated pi-bonding system of the macrocycle ring absorbs visible light.  The nature of the central metal can also influence the absorption spectrum of the metal-macrocycle complex or properties such as excited state lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Gouterman, M. (1978) Optical spectra and electronic structure of porphyrins and related rings. In Dolphin, D. (ed.) The porphyrins.  Academic Press, New York. Volume III, Part A, pp 1-165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, H. (2006) An overview of chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls: biochemistry, biophysics, functions and applications. Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration, vol 25, pp 1-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shapley, P. (2012) Absorbing light with organic molecules. http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/GenChem2/B2/1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The tetrapyrrole moiety in organic compounds which is not macrocyclic but still has a conjugated pi-bond system still acts as a chromophore.  Examples of such compounds include [[bilirubin]] and [[urobilin]], which exhibit a yellow color.

==Auxochrome==
An [[auxochrome]] is a functional group of atoms attached to the chromophore which modifies the ability of the chromophore to absorb light, altering the wavelength or intensity of the absorption.

==Halochromism==
[[Halochromism]] occurs when a substance changes color as the [[pH]] changes.  This is a property of [[pH indicator]]s, whose [[molecular structure]] changes upon certain changes in the surrounding pH.  This change in structure affects a chromophore in the pH indicator molecule.  For example, [[phenolphthalein]] is a pH indicator whose structure changes as pH changes as shown in the following table:

In a pH range of about 0-8, the molecule has three [[aromatic ring]]s all bonded to a [[tetrahedral]] sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Orbital hybridization|hybridized]] [[carbon atom]] in the middle which does not make the π-bonding in the aromatic rings conjugate. Because of their limited extent, the aromatic rings only absorb light in the ultraviolet region, and so the compound appears colorless in the 0-8 pH range.  However, as the pH increases beyond 8.2, that central carbon becomes part of a double bond becoming sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized and leaving a p orbital to overlap with the π-bonding in the rings. This makes the three rings conjugate together to form an extended chromophore absorbing longer wavelength visible light to show a fuchsia color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/uvvisible/theory.html#top UV-Visible Absorption Spectra]&lt;/ref&gt;  At pH ranges outside 0-12, other molecular structure changes result in other color changes; see [[Phenolphthalein]] for details.

[[Wood carving]] is a common art form in the [[Cook Islands]]. Sculpture in stone is much rarer although there are some excellent [[Petroglyph|carvings]] in [[basalt]] by Mike Taveoni. The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but which had special developments in each island. [[Rarotonga]] is known for its fisherman's gods and staff-gods, Atiu for its wooden seats, [[Mitiaro]], [[Mauke]] and [[Atiu]] for mace and slab gods and [[Mangaia]] for its [[ceremonial]] [[adzes]]. Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionary zealots.

Today, carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the [[Māori people|Maori]] in New Zealand. However, there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers. Atiu, in particular, has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as [[Tapa cloth|tapa]]. Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive, idiosyncratic style with the so-called double-k design. Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive [[limestone]] caves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck/culture.htm#visual Lords of the Dance - Culture of the Cook Islands: Visual arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carving==
[[File:British Museum - Wooden carving staff god from Rarotonga.jpg|thumb|150px|A staff-god made of [[casuarina]] wood.]]
Carving was an important part of ancient Cook Islands culture, although much of this is lost. Ancient Cook Islanders carved the poles of their huts, their canoes and weapons (clubs and spears). The patterns used were the same as that used in [[tattooing]] and dyed on [[tapa cloth]]. It is believed that families had their own symbols, much like some British families have crests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcentral.co.ck/arts&amp;crafts.htm Arts &amp; Craft Cook Islands: Build your love of art]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Staff God===
Cult figures called staff-gods or ''atua rakau'' from [[Rarotonga]], apparently combine images of gods with their human descendants. They range in length between 28&amp;nbsp;inches (71&amp;nbsp;cm) and 18&amp;nbsp;feet (5.5&amp;nbsp;m) and were carried and displayed horizontally. At one end there is a schematized blade-shaped head and arms of the progenitive god with a succession of little figures rising from his body, alternatively full-face and in profile with penis erect. The staff itself terminated in a [[phallus]]. But this elaborately carved sexual imagery had less importance for the Rarotongans than the feathers and pieces of shell representing the soul of the god and enclosed in yards of [[Tapa cloth|bark cloth]] wound around the center of the staff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qGb4pyoseH4C&amp;pg=PT751&amp;lpg=PT751&amp;dq=rarotonga+staff+god&amp;source#v=onepage&amp;q=rarotonga%20staff%20god&amp;f=false A world history of art by Hugh Honour &amp; John Fleming (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisherman's god===
A number of images called the fisherman's god are found in museums. These images are likely to be of the sea god ''Tangaroa''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5akbBi6sso8C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=cook+islands+tangaroa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Unu8TaroJouisQPf9sDXBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cook%20islands%20tangaroa&amp;f=false Rarotonga &amp; the Cook Islands by Errol Hunt &amp; Nancy Keller, Cook Islands Myths and Legends: Gods]&lt;/ref&gt; Their function rests solely on the authority of [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], who figured one of them and referred to it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"An idol, of which the figure on the opposite side is a correct representation, was placed on the fore part of every fishing canoe; and when the natives were going on a fishing expedition, prior to setting off, they invariably presented offerings to the god, and invoked him to grant them success."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucArts-t1-body-d1-d16.html Arts and Crafts of the Cook Islands: Religion - nzetc.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Weaving==
[[File:British Museum - Fan with carved wooden figure handle from Rarotonga.jpg|thumb|150px|Weaved [[hand fan]] with a carved figure handle.]]
The outer islands produce traditional weaving of fans, mats, basketware and hats. Particularly fine examples of ''rito'' hats are worn by women to church on Sundays. They are made from the uncurled fibre of the [[coconut palm]] and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of [[Panama hats]], they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule ''pupu'' shells which are painted and stitched on by hand. Although ''pupu'' are found on other islands, the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of [[Mangaia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck/culture.htm#crafts Lords of the Dance - Culture of the Cook Islands: Crafts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tattoo==
Tattooing was forbidden in the Cook Islands after the arrival of missionaries, but has recently become popular again. Historically the Cook Islands tribes or clans each usually recognized a particular fish, bird, insect or plant that was sacred to that tribe and symbolized its unity. The ritual association requires members of the clan to treat the [[totem]] with respect. Its supernatural help could also be sought in times of distress. The symbol for the [[centipede]] with a poisonous bite is a common totem of [[ariki|chiefs]] and was normally tattooed on the chief's back.

[[Captain James Cook]] recorded ''tatau'' as the Tahitian term when he arrived there in 1769, although tatau is not the only word for this art form. In some French Polynesian islands and some Cook Islands it was known as ''nana'o''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janeresture.com/oceania_tattoos/cooks.htm Oceania tattoos: Cook Islands tattoos - janeresture.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tivaevae==
[[File:Woman sewing a tivaevae, Rarotonga.jpg|thumb|Woman sewing a ''tīvaevae'', [[Rarotonga]].]]
A major art form peculiar to the Cook Islands is ''tīvaevae''. This is needlework, specifically the making of [[patchwork]] [[quilts]] by hand. The designs are stunning. These beautiful and intricate works are made by women. They have great intrinsic value and become family [[heirloom]]s.

They are often given as gifts of love and friendship. They supplanted the traditional giving of [[tapa cloth]] on ceremonial occasions such as weddings, funerals and [[First haircut#Polynesian boys|hair-cutting]]. Tivaevae is a communal activity and several women will work on them together. The original idea was introduced by the wives of [[missionaries]] from England and nuns from Tahiti who taught [[embroidery]], [[needlework]], [[sewing]] and [[crochet]].

Tivaevae has played an important role in the daily life of Cook Island women. Since it is largely a social activity, it is nearly always carried out communally, it has had a major impact on the lives of the many women who practise it. Despite its European origin, patterns and techniques have evolved into styles which now belong quite distinctly to the Cooks. The tivaevae reflect the women's surroundings and usually employ designs of flowers, leaves, birds, fish, insects and animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck/tivaevae.htm Quilts of the Cook Islands: Tivaevae]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary art==
Contemporary Artists Eruera Nia and Tim Buchanan are featured at the new International Terminal, [[Rarotonga Airport]]. 36 of Nia's concrete casts are positioned throughout the terminal while Buchanan's 10 metre mural farewell's passengers as they are processed through customs and security. In late 2010, two of Nia's sculptures were acquired for the permanent collection of the [[National Gallery of Australia]]. Buchanan will exhibit with BCA Gallery, Rarotonga in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallerybca.com/home/70-arrivals-and-departures-cook-islands-contemporary-art-rarotonga-international-airport.html BCA Gallery - Cook Islands Contemporary Art @ Rarotonga International Airport]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Creative Commons and Commerce.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=18|This video explains how Creative Commons licenses can be used in conjunction with commercial licensing arrangements]]
A '''Creative Commons''' ('''CC''') '''license''' is one of several [[public copyright license]]s that enable the free distribution of an otherwise [[copyright]]ed "work".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A "work" is any creative material made by a person. A painting, a graphic, a book, a song/ the lyrics to a song, or a photograph of almost anything are all examples of "works".&lt;/ref&gt;  A CC license is used when an author wants to give other people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that he or she (that author) has created. CC provides an author flexibility (for example, he or she might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of a given work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/en/blogs/teachers-guide-creative-commons-licenses|title=The teacher's guide to Creative Commons licenses|last=Shergill|first=Sanjeet|date=2017-05-06|website=Open Education Europa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wur.nl/en/article/What-are-Creative-Commons-licenses.htm|title=What are Creative Commons licenses?|last=|first=|date=|website=Wageningen University &amp; Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guides.lib.umich.edu/creativecommons/licenses|title=Creative Commons licenses|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Michigan Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_464806_en.pdf|title=Creative Commons licenses|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Glasgow|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/open-access/creative-commons-licenses|title=The Creative Commons licenses|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of Creative Commons licenses. The licenses differ by several combinations that condition the terms of distribution. They were initially released on December 16, 2002 by [[Creative Commons]], a [[United States|U.S.]] [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] corporation founded in 2001. There have also been five versions of the suite of licenses, numbered 1.0 through 4.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions|title=License Versions - Creative Commons|website=wiki.creativecommons.org |accessdate=July 4, 2017 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630063933/https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions|archivedate=June 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|February}}, the 4.0 license suite is the most current.

The last two clauses are not [[free content]] licenses, according to definitions such as [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|DFSG]] or the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s standards, and cannot be used in contexts that require these freedoms, such as [[Wikipedia]]. For [[software]], Creative Commons includes three free licenses created by other institutions: the [[BSD License]], the [[GNU]] [[LGPL]], and the [[GNU]] [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].&lt;ref name="GNU LGPL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/license/cc-lgpl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622222019/http://creativecommons.org/license/cc-lgpl|archivedate=June 22, 2009|title=Creative Commons GNU LGPL|accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing and matching these conditions produces sixteen possible combinations, of which eleven are valid Creative Commons licenses and five are not. Of the five invalid combinations, four include both the "nd" and "sa" clauses, which are mutually exclusive; and one includes none of the clauses. Of the eleven valid combinations, the five that lack the "by" clause have been retired because 98% of licensors requested attribution, though they do remain available for reference on the website.&lt;ref name="retiredlicenses"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/retiredlicenses/ |title=Retired Legal Tools |accessdate=May 31, 2012 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503224254/https://creativecommons.org/retiredlicenses/ |archivedate=May 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="v2announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216 |title=Announcing (and explaining) our new 2.0 licenses |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date=May 25, 2004 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060401/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4216 |archivedate=September 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=licenses&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/ |title=About The Licenses - Creative Commons |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=July 26, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726003931/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/ |archivedate=July 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves six regularly used licenses + the CC0 [[public domain]] [[waiver]]:

{{Main|Creative Commons jurisdiction ports}}

The original non-localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the U.S. legal system in mind, therefore the wording may be incompatible with local legislation in other [[jurisdictions]], rendering the licenses unenforceable there. To address this issue, Creative Commons asked its affiliates to translate the various licenses to reflect local laws in a process called "[[Creative Commons jurisdiction ports|porting]]."&lt;ref name=murray&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Laura|title=Putting intellectual property in its place: rights discourses, creative labor, and the everyday|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|isbn=0-19-933626-1|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2011, Creative Commons licenses have been ported to over 50 jurisdictions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/worldwide |title=Worldwide |publisher=Creative Commons |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015194903/http://creativecommons.org/worldwide |archivedate=October 15, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights ==

=== Attribution ===
Since 2004, all current licenses (beside the CC0 waiver) require attribution of the original author, the BY component.&lt;ref name="v2announcement"/&gt; The attribution must be given to "the best of [one's] ability using the information available".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ#How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work.3F |title=Frequently Frequently Asked Questions |date=February 2, 2010 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226070130/http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ#How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work.3F |archivedate=February 26, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally this implies the following:
* '''Include any copyright notices (if applicable)'''. If the work itself contains any copyright notices placed there by the copyright holder, those notices must be left intact, or reproduced in a way that is reasonable to the medium in which the work is being re-published.
* '''Cite the author's name, screen name, or user ID''', etc. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice to link that name to the person's profile page, if such a page exists.
* '''Cite the work's title or name (if applicable)''', if such a thing exists. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice to link the name or title directly to the original work.
* '''Cite the specific CC license the work is under'''. If the work is being published on the Internet, it is nice if the license citation links to the license on the CC website.
* '''Mention if the work is a derivative work or adaptation'''. In addition to the above, one needs to identify that their work is a derivative work, e.g., "This is a Finnish translation of [original work] by [author]." or "Screenplay based on [original work] by [author]."

=== Non-commercial licenses ===
{{further|Creative Commons#Criticism of the non-commercial license}}
The "non-commercial" option included in some Creative Commons licenses is controversial in definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17127 |title=Defining Noncommercial report published |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060638/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/17127 |archivedate=September 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is sometimes unclear what can be considered a non-commercial setting, and application, since its restrictions differ from the principles of [[open content]] promoted by other [[permissive license]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC |title=The Case for Free Use: Reasons Not to Use a Creative Commons -NC License |publisher=Freedomdefined.org |date=August 26, 2013 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68gq4ELlU?url=http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC |archivedate=June 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 [[Wikimedia Deutschland]] published a guide to using Creative Commons licenses as [[m:Open Content - A Practical Guide to Using Creative Commons Licences|wiki pages]] for translations and as PDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Open_Content_A_Practical_Guide_to_Using_Creative_Commons_Licences_web.pdf|title=Open Content – A Practical Guide to Using Creative Commons Licenses|isbn=978-3-940785-57-2|author=Till Kreutzer|year=2014|publisher=[[List of Wikimedia chapters|Wikimedia Deutschland]] e.a.|accessdate=March 23, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404014103/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Open_Content_A_Practical_Guide_to_Using_Creative_Commons_Licences_web.pdf|archivedate=April 4, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Creative Commons announced its [[Public Domain Mark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22940 |title=Marking and Tagging the Public Domain: An Invitation to Comment |publisher=Creativecommons.org |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=September 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060643/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22940 |archivedate=September 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a tool for labeling works already in the public domain. Together, CC0 and the Public Domain Mark replace the Public Domain Dedication and Certification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/ |title=Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law) or Public Domain Certification |date=August 20, 2009 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223035835/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/ |archivedate=February 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which took a U.S.-centric approach and co-mingled distinct operations.

In 2011, the [[Free Software Foundation]] added CC0 to its [[List of FSF approved software licenses|free software licenses]],&lt;ref name="CConCC0software"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27081 |title=Using CC0 for public domain software |date=April 15, 2011 |publisher=[[Creative Commons]] |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514163106/https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27081 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently recommends CC0 as the preferred method of releasing [[public domain software|software into the public domain]].&lt;ref name="fsfCC0"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html |title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them |publisher=[[GNU Project]] |accessdate=April 4, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724023833/https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html |archivedate=July 24, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 CC0 was submitted to [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) for their approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = mdy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, controversy arose over its clause which excluded from the scope of the license any relevant patents held by the copyright holder. This clause was added with scientific data in mind rather than software, but some members of the OSI believed it could weaken users' defenses against [[software patent]]s. As a result, Creative Commons withdrew their submission, and the license is not currently approved by the OSI.&lt;ref name="zero-withdraw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In October 2014 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] approved the Creative Commons CC0 as conformant with the "Open Definition" and recommend the license to dedicate content to the public domain.&lt;ref name="opendefinition.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blog.creativecommons.org"/&gt;

== Legal aspects ==
The legal implications of large numbers of works having Creative Commons licensing are difficult to predict, and there is speculation that media creators often lack insight to be able to choose the license which best meets their intent in applying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Zachary|title=Pitfalls of Open Licensing: An Analysis of Creative Commons Licensing|journal=[[IDEA: The Intellectual Property Law Review]]|year=2005|volume=46|issue=3|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some works licensed using Creative Commons licenses have been involved in several court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Law |title=Creative Commons Case Law |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901220753/http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Law |archivedate=September 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Creative Commons itself was not a party to any of these cases; they only involved licensors or licensees of Creative Commons licenses. When the cases went as far as decisions by judges (that is, they were not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or were not settled privately out of court), they have all validated the legal robustness of Creative Commons public licenses. Here are some notable cases:

=== Dutch tabloid ===
In early 2006, podcaster [[Adam Curry]] sued a Dutch tabloid who published photos from Curry's Flickr page without Curry's permission. The photos were licensed under the Creative Commons Non-Commercial license. While the verdict was in favor of Curry, the tabloid avoided having to pay restitution to him as long as they did not repeat the offense. Professor Bernt Hugenholtz, main creator of the Dutch CC license and director of the Institute for Information Law of the University of Amsterdam, commented, "The Dutch Court's decision is especially noteworthy because it confirms that the conditions of a Creative Commons license automatically apply to the content licensed under it, and binds users of such content even without expressly agreeing to, or having knowledge of, the conditions of the license."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-6052292.html|title=Creative Commons license upheld by court|publisher=News.cnet.com|date=|accessdate=December 24, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025165735/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-6052292.html|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=The+Dutch+Court%27s+decision+is+especially+noteworthy+because+it+confirms+that+the+conditions+of+a+Creative+Commons+license+automatically&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzKvUMOkJseF4gSp4oEY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Dutch%20Court%27s%20decision%20is%20especially%20noteworthy%20because%20it%20confirms%20that%20the%20conditions%20of%20a%20Creative%20Commons%20license%20automatically&amp;f=false |title=Digital Copyright and the Consumer Revolution: Hands Off My Ipod - Matthew Rimmer - Google Böcker |publisher=Books.google.se |date= |accessdate=December 24, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414003634/https://books.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=The+Dutch+Court%27s+decision+is+especially+noteworthy+because+it+confirms+that+the+conditions+of+a+Creative+Commons+license+automatically&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SzKvUMOkJseF4gSp4oEY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Dutch%20Court%27s%20decision%20is%20especially%20noteworthy%20because%20it%20confirms%20that%20the%20conditions%20of%20a%20Creative%20Commons%20license%20automatically&amp;f=false |archivedate=April 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060316052623594|title=Creative Commons License Upheld by Dutch Court|work=[[Groklaw]]|date=March 16, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5823|title=Creative Commons Licenses Enforced in Dutch Court|accessdate=August 31, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906074741/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5823|archivedate=September 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virgin Mobile ===
In 2007, [[Virgin Mobile Australia]] launched an advertising campaign promoting their cellphone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to [[Flickr]] using a Creative Commons-BY (Attribution) license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL leading to the photographer's Flickr page on each of their ads. However, one picture, depicting 15-year-old Alison Chang at a fund-raising carwash for her church,&lt;ref name="permission"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Noam |last=Cohen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Use My Photo? Not Without Permission. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/technology/01link.html |quote=One moment, Alison Chang, a 15-year-old student from Dallas, is cheerfully goofing around at a local church-sponsored car wash, posing with a friend for a photo. Weeks later, that photo is posted online and catches the eye of an ad agency in Australia, and the altered image of Alison appears on a billboard in Adelaide as part of a [[Virgin Mobile]] advertising campaign. |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615133400/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/technology/01link.html |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; caused some controversy when she sued Virgin Mobile.  The photo was taken by Alison's church youth counselor, Justin Ho-Wee Wong, who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license.&lt;ref name="permission"/&gt; In 2008, the case (concerning [[personality rights]] rather than copyright as such) was thrown out of a Texas court for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.internetcases.com/2009/01/22/no-personal-jurisdiction-over-australian-defendant-in-flickr-right-of-publicity-case/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713050011/http://blog.internetcases.com/2009/01/22/no-personal-jurisdiction-over-australian-defendant-in-flickr-right-of-publicity-case/|archivedate=July 13, 2011 |title=No personal jurisdiction over Australian defendant in Flickr right of publicity case |author=Evan Brown |date=January 22, 2009 |work= |publisher=Internet Cases, a blog about law and technology |accessdate=September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7680|title=Lawsuit Against Virgin Mobile and Creative Commons – FAQ|accessdate=August 31, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907054202/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7680|archivedate=September 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SGAE vs Fernández ===
In the fall of 2006, the [[Copyright collective|collecting society]] Sociedad General de Autores y Editores ([[SGAE]]) in Spain sued Ricardo Andrés Utrera Fernández, owner of a disco bar located in [[Badajoz]] who played CC-licensed music. SGAE argued that Fernández should pay royalties for public performance of the music between November 2002 and August 2005. The Lower Court rejected the collecting society's claims because the owner of the bar proved that the music he was using was not managed by the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5830 |title=Spanish Court Recognizes CC-Music |author=Mia Garlick |date=March 23, 2006 |work= |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate=September 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809082620/http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5830 |archivedate=August 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the Cultural Association Ladinamo (based in Madrid, and represented by [[Javier de la Cueva]]) was granted the use of copyleft music in their public activities. The sentence said: "Admitting the existence of music equipment, a joint evaluation of the evidence practiced, this court is convinced that the defendant prevents communication of works whose management is entrusted to the plaintiff [SGAE], using a repertoire of authors who have not assigned the exploitation of their rights to the SGAE, having at its disposal a database for that purpose and so it is manifested both by the legal representative of the Association and by Manuela Villa Acosta, in charge of the cultural programming of the association, which is compatible with the alternative character of the Association and its integration in the movement called '[[copyleft|copy left]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derecho-internet.org/node/359 |title=Sentencia nº 12/2006 Juzgado de lo Mercantil nº 5 de Madrid &amp;#124; Derecho de Internet |language=es |publisher=Derecho-internet.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126165923/http://www.derecho-internet.org/node/359 |archivedate=November 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GateHouse Media, Inc. vs. That's Great News, LLC ===
On June 30, 2010 [[GateHouse Media]] filed a lawsuit against [[That's Great News]]. GateHouse Media owns a number of local newspapers, including ''[[Rockford Register Star]]'', which is based in Rockford, Illinois. That's Great News makes plaques out of newspaper articles and sells them to the people featured in the articles.&lt;ref name="New Copyright Lawsuit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.internetcases.com/2010/07/02/new-copyright-lawsuit-involves-creative-commons/ |title=New Copyright Lawsuit Involves Creative Commons |author=Evan Brown |date=July 2, 2010 |work= |publisher=Internet Cases: A blog about law and technology |accessdate=April 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621215029/http://blog.internetcases.com/2010/07/02/new-copyright-lawsuit-involves-creative-commons/ |archivedate=June 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; GateHouse sued That's Great News for copyright infringement and breach of contract. GateHouse claimed that TGN violated the non-commercial and no-derivative works restrictions on GateHouse Creative Commons licensed work when TGN published the material on its website. The case was settled on August 17, 2010, though the settlement was not made public.&lt;ref name="New Copyright Lawsuit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/gatehouse-media-v-thats-great-news#description |title=GateHouse Media v.

=== Drauglis v. Kappa Map Group, LLC ===
The plaintiff was photographer Art Drauglis, who uploaded several pictures to the photo-sharing website Flickr using Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License (CC BY-SA), including one entitled "Swain's Lock, Montgomery Co., MD.". The defendant was Kappa Map Group, a map-making company, which downloaded the image and used it in a compilation entitled "Montgomery Co. Maryland Street Atlas". Though there was nothing on the cover that indicated the origin of the picture, the text "''Photo: Swain's Lock, Montgomery Co., MD Photographer: Carly Lesser &amp; Art Drauglis, Creative Commoms'' {{sic}}'', CC-BY-SA-2.0''" appeared at the bottom of the back cover.

The validity of the CC BY-SA 2.0 as a license was not in dispute. The CC BY-SA 2.0 requires that the licensee to use nothing less restrictive than the CC BY-SA 2.0 terms. The atlas was sold commercially and not for free reuse by others. The dispute was whether Drauglis' license terms that would apply to "derivative works" applied to the entire atlas. Drauglis sued the defendants in June 2014 for copyright infringement and license breach, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, fees, and costs. Drauglis asserted, among other things, that Kappa Map Group "exceeded the scope of the License because defendant did not publish the Atlas under a license with the same or similar terms as those under which the Photograph was originally licensed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_14-cv-01043/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_14-cv-01043-0.pdf |title=Memorandum Opinion |publisher=United States District Court for the District of Columbia |date=August 18, 2015 |accessdate=August 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921202242/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_14-cv-01043/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_14-cv-01043-0.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge dismissed the case on that count, ruling that the atlas was not a [[derivative work]] of the photograph in the sense of the license, but rather a [[collective work]]. Since the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph, Kappa Map Group did not need to license the entire atlas under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. The judge also determined that the work had been properly attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guadamuz|first1=Andres|title=US Court interprets copyleft clause in Creative Commons licenses|url=http://www.technollama.co.uk/us-court-interprets-copyleft-clause-in-creative-commons-licenses|website=TechnoLlama|accessdate=10 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222123232/http://www.technollama.co.uk/us-court-interprets-copyleft-clause-in-creative-commons-licenses|archivedate=December 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the judge determined that it was sufficient to credit the author of the photo as prominently as authors of similar authorship (such as the authors of individual maps contained in the book) and that the name "CC-BY-SA-2.0" is sufficiently precise to locate the correct license on the internet and can be considered a valid URI of the license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-10-02|title=Carrollogos: U.S. Court Correctly Interprets Creative Commons Licenses|url=https://carrollogos.blogspot.com/2016/04/us-court-correctly-interprets-creative.html|author=[[Michael W.

=== Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet (VGSE) ===
This incident has not been tested in court, but it highlights a potentially disturbing practice.  In July 2016, German computer magazine [[LinuxUser]] reports that a German blogger Christoph Langner used two {{nowrap|CC-BY}} licensed photographs from Berlin photographer [http://www.skley.de Dennis Skley] on his private blog [https://linuxundich.de Linuxundich.de].  Langner duly mentioned the author and the license and added a link to the original.  Langner was later contacted by the ''Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet'' (VGSE) (Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property in the Internet) with a demand for €2300 for failing to provide the full name of the work, the full name of the author, the license text, and a source link, as is apparently required by the fine print in the license.  Of this sum, €40 goes to the photographer and remainder is retained by VGSE.&lt;ref name="luther-2016"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17872">The following is a '''list of unproduced [[Darren Aronofsky]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, American film director Darren Aronofsky has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects fell in [[development hell]] or were cancelled.

== 1990s ==
=== ''Ronin'' ===
Eleven days after the release of ''[[Pi (film)|Pi]]'', his first film, Aronofsky signed a deal with [[New Line Cinema]] in July 1998 to direct a film adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Ronin (DC Comics)|Ronin]]'' comic book series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Benedict Carver,Dan Cox |url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/aronofsky-draws-on-comic-1117478663/ |title=Aronofsky draws on comic |publisher=Variety |date=1998-07-21 |accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], the author of the comic book, was attached to write the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Linder |first=Brian |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/16/the-bat-men-speak |title=The Bat-Men Speak |publisher=IGN |date=2000-10-16 |accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project never materialized and Aronofsky left it to direct ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]''.

== 2000s ==
=== ''Sector 7'' ===
On May 24, 2000, Aronofsky was announced to direct a film adaptation of [[David Wiesner]]'s ''[[Sector 7#Film adaptation|Sector 7]]'' for [[Nickelodeon Movies]]. Eric Watson was attached to produce the film. However, the project finally fell into [[development hell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corona.bc.ca/films/details/sector7.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010410070243/http://www.corona.bc.ca/films/details/sector7.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-04-10 |title=Coming Attractions |date= |accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Aronofsky moved to other projects.

}}  
'''''Farmhouse in Provence''''' also known as '''''Entrance Gate to a Farm with Haystacks''''' was made in 1888 by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in [[Arles]] in [[Provence]] at the height of his career.  Partially due to having been inspired by painter [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli|Adolphe Monticelli]], Van Gogh sought the Provence region of France to further expand his painting skill and experience. Van Gogh used several pairs of complementary colors in the ''Farmhouse in Provence'', the color contrast bringing an intensity to his work.  The painting is owned by the [[National Gallery of Art]] of [[Washington, D.C.]].

==Arles==
At the time that Van Gogh painted ''Farmhouse in Provence'' he was 35 years old.  Living in Arles, in southern France, he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work,&lt;ref name="Morton"/&gt; such as fields, farmhouses and people of the Arles, Nîmes and Avignon area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Adventure Guide to Provence &amp; the Cote D'azur | author=Arfin, F | publisher=Hunter Publishing | location=Edison, NJ | year=2009 | page= | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAQhVyHelOoC&amp;pg=PA37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was quite different than what he'd known in the Netherlands and Paris.  The climate was hot and dry. People had dark hair and skin and spoke a different language than Parisian French.  The colors were vivid. The terrain varied from plains to mountains.  Here Van Gogh found a "brilliance and light that would wash out details and simplify forms, reducing the world around him to the sort of pattern he admired in [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese woodblocks]]" and where the "effect of the sun would strengthen the outlines of composition and reduce nuances of color to a few vivid contrasts."&lt;ref name="NGA sun"/&gt;

A prolific time, in less than 444 days Vincent made about 100 drawings and produced more than 200 paintings.  Yet, he still wrote more than 200 letters.  He described
a series of seven studies of wheat fields as, "landscapes, yellow—old gold—done
quickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the
blazing sun, intent only on the reaping."&lt;ref name="NGA sun"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= |title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900) |volume= |issue= |pages=121–123, 131 |publisher=National Gallery of Art |location=Washington, D.C. |doi= |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], he wrote, "Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle - more like music and less like sculpture - and above all, it promises color."&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Arts Entwined: Music and Painting in the Nineteenth Century | first1=M | last1=Morton | first2=P | last2=Schmunk |  publisher=Garland Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=177–178 | isbn=0-8153-3156-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NP724mFE1MC&amp;pg=PA177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==
Van Gogh used three pairs of complementary, or contrasting, colors which when sat together intensified the brilliance and intensity of one another's colors.  One pair is orange and blue.  There's the red and green of the plants.  Last, pink clouds against the turquoise sky.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=52178 |title=Farmhouse in Provence |author= |year=2011 |work=The Collection | publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh used complementary, contrasting colors to bring an intensity to his work, which evolved over the periods of his work.  Two complementary colors of the same degree of vividness and brightness placed next to one another produce an intense reaction, called the "law of simultaneous contrast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Women: Vincent's Love Affairs and Journey Into Madness | author=Fell, D | publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers | location=New York | year=2005 | origyear=2004 | page=64 | isbn=0-7867-1655-X | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqSjxGgvVMMC&amp;pg=PA64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh mentioned the liveliness and interplay of "a wedding of two complementary colors, their mingling and opposition, the mysterious vibrations of two kindred souls."&lt;ref name="Silverman326"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art | author=Silverman, D | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location=New York | year=2000 | page=326 | isbn=0-374-28243-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8c9jt9AToD0C&amp;pg=PA326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in [[Nuenen]] Van Gogh became familiar with [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]]'s laws in weaving to maximize the intensity of colors through their contrast to adjacent colors.&lt;ref name="Silverman140"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art | author=Silverman, D | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location=New York | year=2000 | page=140 | isbn=0-374-28243-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8c9jt9AToD0C&amp;pg=PA140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris he was exposed through his brother Theo to [[Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli|Adolphe Monticelli]]'s still life work with flowers, which he admired.  First, he saw Monticelli's use of color as an expansion of Delacroix's theories of color and contrast.  Secondly he admired the effect Monticelli created by heavy application of paint.  It was partially Monticelli, from Marseilles, who inspired Van Gogh's southerly move to Provence.  He felt such kinship for the man, and desire to emulate his style, that he wrote in a letter to his sister Wil that he felt as if he were "Monticelli's son or his brother."&lt;ref name="Silverman438"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art | author=Silverman, D | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location=New York | year=2000 | page=438 | isbn=0-374-28243-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8c9jt9AToD0C&amp;pg=PA438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The National Gallery of Art reports the correct sequence of ownership for the painting is:&lt;ref name="NGA-Prov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=52178&amp;detail=prov |title=Farmhouse in Provence - Provenance |author= |year=2011 |work=The Collection |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]] (1862-1925), the artist's sister-in-law, of [[Amsterdam]] sold the painting in November 1890 through Julien Tanguy Gallery, Paris to Willy Gretor, also known as Wilhelm Rudolph Julius Petersen (1868-1923) of Paris.  Five paintings that were sold by Johanna became part of the [[National Gallery of Art]] collection.
* Willy Gretor gifted the painting to [[Maria Slavona]], a German painter, of Paris and Berlin.  It was one of many gifts of Van Gogh paintings by Willie to Maria, with whom he had a daughter, Lilly. Maria then married Otto Ackermann (1871-1963), an art dealer of Paris and Berlin.
* From 1919 to at least 1933 Gaston Bernheim de Villers (1870-1953) of Paris owned the painting. 
* The painting was sold to Capt. Edward H. Molyneux (1891-1974) of Paris.
* It was then sold August 15, 1955 to Ailsa Mellon Bruce (1901-1969) of New York.
* In 1970 it was bequeathed to the National Gallery of Art, part of the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Collection.

Another sequence of ownership was given by J.-B. de la Faille in "The Works of Vincent van Gogh, His Paintings and Drawings" a portion of which was apparently in error (i.e., [[Bernheim-Jeune]], Reid and Lefevre, Ackermann, Molyneux.)&lt;ref&gt;J.B. de la Faille.

'''FRIKAR dance company''' (established May 2006 by Hallgrim Hansegård) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] dance company for contemporary and traditional dance specializing in the connection between dance and nature.

==History==
'''FRIKAR dance company''' was founded by choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård in 2006, and has toured 29 countries all over the world. The company is described by National Geographic as "wildly inventive" and is composed by 32 artists from 4 continents (India, Iran, Somalia, Brazil, Cape Verde, France, Sweden, Norway.) The artists from very diverse genres meet each other in the research of gravity and human nature.

With a background in Norwegian traditional dance choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård founded FRIKAR dance company to give acrobatic dancers living in Norway a creative environment. Together with the dancers he has been developing a new choreographical style for contemporary dance called "Down2Earth" including [[Hallingdans]]  [[Capoeira]] and [[break dance]]. He works in the formats of aerial dance, site specific ecosophical stage arts, indoor dance and interdiciplinary arts.

Hansegård made his international breakthrough with an animation film at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2003 (Tarantrance). In 2005 he won 3rd prize at Superdok. In 2007 he was awarded "Artist of the Year" at The Norwegian Folk Music Awards. In 2009 he won the "Award for best choreography" at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], among 43 countries in the most seen entertainment TV program in the world.

In 2010 he premiered "Jamsiis" at Bergen International Festival [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHSLBUOm9nc Youtube: Jamsiis]. This was a highly personal contribution to the Nordic contemporary dance scene, based on his roots in traditional dances. Jamsiis opened up a public discussion about the boundaries of contemporary dance in Norway. NRK (the Norwegian Broadcasting) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;JAMSIIS, Hallgrim Hansegårds new production, is the most exciting I have seen here. It’s very exciting to see traditional dance in dialogue with contemporary dance. Hansegård is branching out and opening up new territory here. He has come down a path that I think is very important to go. That Hansegård is a dancer with strong will to do his own thing and blessedly uninhibited as far as exceeding boundaries is concerned is something the Norwegian dance community should be happy about… At the same time that he approaches contemporary dance, he opens doors. If he succeeds in making contemporary dance accessible to a wider audience than today’s, the genre of contemporary dance should learn to endure a ‘halling-roundkick’ or two.&lt;ref&gt;Dance critic Karen Frøsland Nystøyl, NRK kulturnytt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009 Hansegård directed TidarÅ, an outdoor full night dance performance under a waterfall with 22 dancers and musicians from FRIKAR dance company. The production collected contemporary and traditional dancers in a research for a unique contemporary dance technique. "Tidarå" is part of FRIKARs ecosophical productions. Hansegård directed also Yr in 2009 together with violin virtous Ragnhild Hemsing, premiere at the [[Bergen International Festival]].

In 2008 FRIKAR was censored by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Naples]] for his non conventional interpretation of Peer Gynt, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsip8vvC7gY NRK: Bukkerittet]. In the years 2005 to 2007 Hansegård directed "Undergrunnsfargo", "Isolations", "Laus", "Kruk", "The snuff grinders" and "Bastard".

He also participated in ''[[Dansefeber]]'', the Norwegian version of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'', in 2006.&lt;ref name=hvem&gt;{{cite book |title=Hvem er hvem? |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2008 |editor=Knut Olav Åmås |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-03-23561-0 |language=Norwegian |page=211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, his dancing was digitalized for the [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) [[Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kul_und/spill/article2351271.ece|title=Et kast for Conan|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=6 April 2008|first=Per Kristian|last=Bjørkeng|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dans, estetikk og samfunn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dans, estetikk og samfunn? |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2010 |editor=Heidi Haraldsen |publisher=Tell Forlag |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-7522-351-5 |language=Norwegian |pages=10, 25, 26, 51, 52, 57, 58.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Greetingman''''' ({{lang-ko|그리팅맨}}) is a modern sculpture project in South Korea.

Its main artist is [[Yoo Young-ho]] (South Korean sculptor). The concept provides a man, 6 m high, [[bowing]] in a typically Asian greeting gesture. The blue color means lack of prejudice.

In October 2012, a statue was unveiled in the neighbourhood of [[Buceo]], [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/121020/pespec-670696/espectaculos/Escultura-coreana-en-rambla-de-Buceo/ |title=Korean sculpture on the Montevidean seashore|date=2012-10-20|publisher=EL PAIS}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a planned world series in multiple locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greetingman.com/future.html Future of Greetingman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/486476.html One thousand greetings]''The Hankyoreh''. 8 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugo Cecil Levinge Rumbold''' (7 February 1884 – 19 November 1932) was an English designer of theatrical scenery and costumes. Among those who commissioned designs from him were [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree|Sir Herbert Tree]], [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]], [[Arthur Bourchier]] and [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]].

==Life and career==
Rumbold was born in Stockholm, the younger son of the diplomat [[Sir Horace Rumbold, 8th Baronet|Sir Horace Rumbold]] and his second wife, Louisa Anne (d. 1940), daughter of [[Thomas Russell Crampton]]. His elder half-brother was another diplomat, also called [[Sir Horace Rumbold, 9th Baronet|Horace Rumbold]].&lt;ref&gt;Otte, T. G. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35866 "Rumbold, Sir Horace George Montagu, 9th Baronet (1869–1941)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2004), accessed 10 Nov 2007 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumbold went to [[Eton College|Eton]] in 1897. He was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the 7th ([[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]]) Battalion of the [[Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort's Own)]] in 1901&lt;ref&gt;Hart′s Army list, 1902&lt;/ref&gt; and served in South Africa during the [[Second Boer War]]. He was promoted to lieutenant in June 1902, the same month the war ended, and soon returned to England.&lt;ref&gt;"The Army in South Africa – Troops returning Home", ''[[The Times]]'', 15 September 1902, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; He served with the [[Grenadier Guards]] in the [[First World War]], during which he was wounded and received the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)]]. In civilian life, he was sometimes referred to by his military title of Captain H. C. L. Rumbold.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'', 21 November 1932, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage design===
[[File:PC rumbold.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Rumbold's costumes for ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'']]
As a stage designer, Rumbold's early work included "[[Pre-Raphaelite]]" sets and costumes for [[William Faversham]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in 1913;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E7DC1F3BE633A25752C2A9649D946296D6CF "Hugo Rumbold Attacks Realism in Stage Scenery; Thinks Belasco and Tree Are Wrong"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 December 1913, p. SM9&lt;/ref&gt; and Tudor décor and costumes for [[Arthur Bourchier]]'s production of ''Bluff King Hal'', the following year. ''[[The Observer]]'' considered Rumbold's contribution the best thing about the show, and said, "His costumes and his scenes at Greenwich, Westminster and Hampton Court show considerable power of being original within the limits of archaeology and probability; and, though inexperience peeps out here and there, the work as a whole is splendid and beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;"Bluff King Hal", ''The Observer'', 6 September 1914, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years his designs included ''The Right to Kill'', a melodrama set in Turkey staged by [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree|Sir Herbert Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 May 1915, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]'s opera ''The Critic'' (based on [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan's]] [[The Critic (play)|play of the same name]]) at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] in 1916, of which ''[[The Times]]'' said, "Mr Hugo Rumbold apparently carries the 18th century atmosphere about in his pocket."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 13 January 1916, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  He also designed ''L'Apres Midi d'un Faune'' in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/guides/fraser.shtml Profile of Claud Lovat Fraser, Claud Lovat Fraser and Grace Crawford Lovat Fraser Collections, Bryn Mawr College Library Special Collections, accessed 10 July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumbold was commissioned by [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] to dress a 1918 revival of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]],'' in succession to [[W. S. Gilbert]], who designed the original costumes, and [[Percy Anderson]], who dressed the 1907 revival. Some of Rumbold's costumes (for the "everyday young girls") were retained by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] until [[Peter Goffin]]'s new designs were introduced in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix, pp. vii and viii&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]], Rumbold designed revivals of ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'', by [[Alexandre Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]], and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Le Nozze di Figaro]]'' staged at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 30 June 1919, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he designed the first British production of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[L'heure espagnole]]'' for [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;"Hugo Rumbold", ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', 21 November 1932, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Rumbold designed a revival of [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 December 1919, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Tempest]]'' for [[Viola Tree]]'s company at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 February 1921, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theatrical work===
In 1920 Rumbold acted as impresario, producing [[Darius Milhaud]]'s new ballet, ''[[Le bœuf sur le toit]]'' at the [[Coliseum Theatre]], under the title ''The Nothing Doing Bar''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Monday, 12 July 1920, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This departure from his milieu was noted in his obituary notice in ''The Times'', which said: "He was essentially a [[Bohemian]] and a clubman, who was witty and amusing and always tried to pass on his zest for life to others.... Later, he took to film-producing. He was indeed something of a dilettante and dabbler in many pursuits. Had he been more of a 'sticker' he would have made more of a name for himself."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;
With [[Zoë Akins]], he wrote ''The Human Elephant'', a play in three acts adapted from the short story of that title by [[Somerset Maugham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/manuscripts/berg/brgmaugh.xml List of manuscripts], New York Public Library, accessed 10 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life and death===
Rumbold was described as "one of the Last of the Dandies" and a "brilliant flâneur".&lt;ref&gt;Montesole, Max. [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32955808 "Little memories of big people"], ''[[The West Australian]]'', 22 September 1934, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of [[Noël Coward]]'s set, with a penchant for [[cross-dressing]] in pursuit of comic turns at parties, according to Coward's biographer [[Philip Hoare]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Faith Compton Mackenzie]], whose clothes he borrowed in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Compton Mackenzie, pp. 165–167&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the mutual hostility of Coward and [[the Sitwells]], Rumbold maintained a friendship with all of them.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charlie Chaplin]] said that as a mimic he had never known anyone to compare with Rumbold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29608801 "How to Entertain Royalty on £1500 a Year"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]], 6 January 1954&lt;/ref&gt; In the last year of his life, Rumbold married the dramatist [[Zoë Akins]].&lt;ref&gt;"Zoe Akins to be Wed to Hugo Rumbold", ''The New York Times'', 8 March 1932; and Porter, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumbold died in [[Pasadena, California]], in 1932, aged 48, from an illness caused by his injuries in World War I.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He is buried at San Gabriel Cemetery, [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=7906288 "Hugo Cecil Levinge "Hugh" Rumbold (1884–1932)"], Find a Grave, accessed July 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eperjeske.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The most characteristic decorative motif is the [[palmette]] style as on this [[sabretache]] plate.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Csempkopacs.jpg|250px|thumb|left|One of the most beautiful heritage from the old Romanesque architectural art: the village church at Csempeszkopács.]] --&gt;
[[File:Nagytotlak.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Several Romanesque village churches in Hungary were constructed in rotunda form, as here at Nagytótlak.]]
'''Hungarian art''' stems from the period of the conquest of the [[Carpathian basin]] by the people of [[Árpád]] in the 9th century.  Prince Árpád also organized earlier people settled in the area.

==Horsemen in the Carpathian basin==
Before the arrival of Árpád several other peoples from the steppe had founded states in the Carpathian basin. The capital of the Huns (Xiongnu in Chinese) was [[Bleda|Buda]], named after King Attila's brother, though [[Priscus]] rhetor, a 5th-century historian and ambassador of the [[Byzantine Empire]] stated that the capital of the Huns was in the plains between the [[Danube]] and [[Tisza]] rivers. After the death of [[Attila]] in 453 the [[Lombards]] and [[Gepids]], and later the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] founded states here (569). This late Avar kingdom was defeated by the [[Franks]], and the Avars of Transdanubia were baptised. The first Hungarians came to the basin during the late 9th century.

==Art of the Conquest period==
The People of Árpád in the 9th century used beautiful ornamental motifs to decorate both their dress and the trappings of their horses, the main motif being the palmette (see the above illustration). This style remained important in Hungary from the 9th to the 11th centuries, and similar motifs can be found in the contemporary decorative arts of the Caucasus, Iran and Middle-Asia.

==Arts in the Romanesque age==
Descendants of Prince Árpád organized the medieval Hungarian Kingdom. During this period the combination of styles originating in the steppes with those of the European  [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] produced a rich heritage, with noticeable parallels in the art of the Scandinavian Vikings and the Celts of Western Europe. The coronation mantle of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen]] (crowned 1000 A. D.) is a particularly fine example from this period.[[File:PALAST.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The coronation mantle of Hungary from the time of King [[Stephen I of Hungary]], reigned 1000-1038 A. D.]]

This king stated that "10 villages should build a church", and though several of his foundations were later famous in new guises, they all date back to the ''lex Stephani'' (law of King Stephen). [[File:Romanikapukon.JPG|left|250px|thumb| Tympani from Romanesque village churches in Medieval Hungary: Monoszló, Domokosfa, Halmágy and the arch of Csempeszkopács with the lamb of Szeged.]]

===Church architecture and sculpture===
In spite of widespread destruction during the Turkish occupation (c1526-1686, and see below), Romanesque churches and other ecclesiastical buildings can be found throughout the Carpathian basin. Fine examples survive at [[Székesfehérvár]], [[Gyulafehérvár]], [[Esztergom]], [[Pannonhalma]], while recently opened lapidariums at [[Pécs]], [[Veszprém]], and [[Eger]] display remains from this period. Ruins of former royal houses at Tarnaszentmária, Feldebrő, and [[Szekszárd]], also show stylistic resemblances to contemporary architecture from the Caucasus. 

Large-scale reconstructions were undertaken after the Mongolian wars of 1241-42. Many beautiful village churches survive from this periods, both round churches ([[Szalonna (village)|Szalonna]], [[Kallósd]] and [[Nagytótlak]]), and those with western tower and southern doorway at [[Nagybörzsöny]], [[Csempeszkopács]], [[Őriszentpéter]], [[Magyarszecsőd]], [[Litér]], [[Velemér]] and [[Zalaháshágy]].
[[File:Velemer.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Romanesque village churches were often decorated with frescoes especially on the north wall, as here at Velemér.]]

==Gothic art==
The Gothic style reached Hungary in the late 14th century, and continued throughout the reigns of the Anjou, Luxembourg, and Jagello kings. Wealthy mining towns have built them on their main square like as at such as [[Košice|Kassa]] (Košice, [[Slovakia]]), [[Bártfa]] (Bardejov, [[Slovakia]]), [[Braşov|Brassó]] and [[Nagyszeben]] built their main squares in this style,which can also be seen in several rebuilt monasteries, for example ([[Garamszentbenedek]] in [[Slovakia]]). The now destroyed monastery of the [[The Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|Pauline Order]] at Budaszentlőrinci was also built in this style.

The most renowned architect of this time was János Mester, a [[Franciscan]] brother. His largest churches are in Szeged-Alsóváros, in Farkas Street, Kolozsvár (Cluj, [[Romania]]), and in Nyirbátor. Perhaps the most famous Hungarian Gothic church of all is the Cathedral of St Elizabeth in [[Košice|Kassa]] (Košice, [[Slovakia]]).

[[File:TereskeSztLaszlo.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Detail of the mural of Saint Ladislaus in the church of Tereske, Northern Hungary.]]


=== Sculptures and paintings ===
The rich heritage of paintings in Hungary originated with the royal houses of Luxemburg and Anjou, that both esteemed the earlier king [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Ladislaus I]]. (Both [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary and Holy Roman Emperor]], and Louis The Great, King of Hungary and Poland were buried in the cathedral of Nagyvárad at the side of King Ladislaus.) Even today, after so many wars and so much destruction, there are about fifty churches where murals of the [[Saint Ladislaus legend]] can be found.

== Renaissance ==
[[File:111 Matthias Corvinus florint 755820.jpg|200px|right|A gold Florin of King Mátyás (Matthias).]] 
King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] had close ties with Italy, and Italian influence is clearly evident in architectural complexes built during his reign, such as his palaces in [[Buda]] and in [[Visegrád|Visegrad]].  A recent exhibition at the mining Museum in [[Rudabánya]] displayed the quality of Hungarian goldwork at this period in the golden forints made by Hungarian masters for the Russian Tsar Ivan III. 2008 saw the 550th anniversary of Matthias' reign, and many items from his library, the Bibliotheca Corvina (once the largest in Europe) were displayed in the National Széchényi Library in [[Buda Castle]] [http://www.corvina.oszk.hu link]
=== Reformation ===
[[File:Tulipkazetta.jpg|150px|thumb|left|A ceiling "cassette" with tulip motifs in a Hungarian village church]]
[[File:Sárospatak - Castle.jpg|thumb|250px|The fortress of Sárospatak: a keep with surrounding bailey; the baroque castle (upper right) is a much later addition.]]

During the same period as the Wars against the Turks and the beginning of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation, [[the Reformation]] led to a change of religious allegiance in about one third of Hungary. This time was also aperiod of renewal for churches in an architectural sense, with inner spaces displaying  fresh and delicate ornamentation, particularly in the use of plant forms. "Cassette" ceilings are also characteristic of this period.

===Architecture of fortresses===
The wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]] also led to great developments in the construction of Hungarian fortresses. Earlier fortresses had been built before the era of heavy artillery, but were now fortified to resist it. The best-known surviving fortresses from this period are those of [[Eger]], [[Nagyvárad]], [[Nagykanizsa]] and [[Érsekújvár]] (Nové Zámky in Slovakia).

==Baroque reconstruction==
[[File:Basilika eger.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The most prominent cathedral in the neo-classical style is the Basilica of Eger.]]
After the expulsion of the Turks in 1686, the new ruling house of the [[Habsburg]]s brought with it the new Baroque style. Most of the early surviving buildings in Hungary today are in this style: not only churches, but also castles e.g. [[Fertőd]], town halls ([[Szeged]]), monasteries ([[Zirc]]), cathedrals ([[Kalocsa]]), colleges ([[Eger]]) and the royal palace at [[Buda]].

==Neo-classicism==
After the Age of Reform, in the early 19th century ancient Greek traditions were revived, with the consequent construction of such neo-Classical buildings as the [[Hungarian National Museum]].

== Secessionism or Jugendstil ==
One of the greatest architects of his age was [[Ödön Lechner]], who planned the Museum of Trade Art, The Hungarian Geological Institute, the town hall of [[Kecskemét]], and the Saint Ladislaus Church at Kőbánya, Budapest. Sometimes he is called the Hungarian [[Gaudi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1704">[[Image:Husky the Muskie, Kenora, Ontario (0082).jpg|thumb|Huskie the Muskie]]
'''Huskie the Muskie''' is the [[nickname]] of a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} outdoor [[sculpture]] depicting a [[muskellunge]] in [[Kenora]], [[Ontario]]'s McLeod Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadtripamerica.com/roadside/Ontario-Kenora-Husky-the-Muskie.htm Roadtrip Travel Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first Huskie was constructed in 1967 as a potential [[Canadian Centennial]] project by Jules Horvath and Bob Selway from Deluxe Signs and Displays under the direction of the Kenora Chamber of Commerce. Since then the [[effigy]]{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} has received national recognition in part due to its size and position alongside the [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. The original was rebuilt in 1995.

A call to the public was made for a suitable name for the giant fish and from the hundreds of entries received the name ''Huskie the Muskie'' was agreed upon by the committee. The winner was Bill Brabooke, who also included a slogan with the name which said, "Huskie the Muskie says Prevent Water Pollution".

Huskie appears in many movies as a sign of travel across the country, along with Max the Moose in [[Dryden, Ontario]], and [[Wawa, Ontario]]'s goose. Movies include: ''One Week'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104806/goofs]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3575">This is a list of all known publications by [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], an influential Italian printer of the 16th century. Most of these were reprinted several times during Petrucci's life, but in this list only dates of first publication are given. Some of the earlier publications (for instance, the [[Josquin des Prez|Josquin]] masses) were reprinted separately, in [[Fossombrone]], after Petrucci moved there around 1510; these reprints are listed. The vast majority of Petrucci's publications were published in [[Venice]]; those from his Fossombrone years are marked accordingly.

The '''Londesborough Brooch''' is a [[Celts|Celtic]] pseudo-[[penannular brooch]] from Ireland. Dating from the early medieval period, it is a particularly elaborate example of a dress fastener that was produced during Ireland's artistic golden age, when objects such as the [[Tara Brooch]] and [[Ardagh Chalice]] were produced. Since 1888, it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=98321&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Londesborough+brooch&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The brooch and pin were cast in [[silver]], though the metal is heavily debased, and tests show it contains about 65% copper, 34% silver, with traces of lead and gold.&lt;ref name=Youngs&gt;Youngs, 93&lt;/ref&gt;  This might reflect an origin in melted-down late Roman coins. The pieces were thickly [[gilding|gilded]] on the front, and selectively on parts of the back of the head. The pin was cast in two pieces, head and shank, joined with a [[rivet]].  Both head and pin were ornamented with geometric and [[zoomorphic]] patterns and inset with [[amber]] pieces, some now missing.  On the back of the head there are two blue glass studs near where the large terminal joins the hoop.  There are many small differences between the decoration of the right and left sides of the head, although the overall impression is one of symmetry.  Many details of the decoration recall the earlier Tara Brooch and the [[Breadalbane Brooch]] (the latter also in the British Museum).  However, unlike most other very elaborate brooches of the type, the Londesborough Brooch lacks any gold [[filigree]] decoration, and aspects of the decoration recall larger pieces of church metal work such as shrines.&lt;ref name="Youngs" /&gt;  
[[Image:Brit Mus 17sept 016.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail of the brooch]]

==Original ownership==

The intricate decoration on precious metal and the large size of the brooch suggest it was made for a wealthy patron or religious leader in Ireland in the late eighth or early ninth centuries AD.&lt;ref name="Youngs" /&gt;  The pseudo-penannular form is typical of Irish brooches at this period; in a true penannular brooch there is a gap in the centre of the wide terminals ending the hoop through which the pin can pass.  In the pseudo-penannular type the terminal sides are joined, here by two narrow bands, making the brooch less efficient as a fastener.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Little is known about the original circumstances of the brooch's discovery before it became part of [[Albert Denison, 1st Baron Londesborough|Lord Londesborough]]'s collection. The British Museum purchased the brooch in 1888. With the Tara Brooch in [[Dublin]], and the [[Hunterston Brooch]] in [[Edinburgh]], it is considered one of the finest of over 50 highly elaborate Irish Celtic brooches to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mill Creek chert''' is a type of [[chert]] found in [[Southern Illinois]] and heavily exploited by members of the [[Mississippian culture]] (800 to 1600 CE).&lt;ref name=ILLINOISAGRI/&gt; [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] made from this material are found in [[archaeological site]]s throughout the [[American Midwest]] and Southeast. It is named for a village and stream near the quarries, [[Mill Creek, Illinois]] and Mill Creek, a [[tributary]] of the [[Cache River (Illinois)|Cache River]].&lt;ref name=QUARRY/&gt; The chert was used extensively for the production of utilitarian tools such as hoes and spades, and for polished ceremonial objects such as [[bifaces]], spatulate celts and [[Ceremonial mace|maces]].

==History==
[[File:Cahokia diorama of flint knapper HRoe 2010.jpg|thumb|Diorama at [[Cahokia]] of flintknapper at work on hoes and bifaces]]
''[[Chert]]'' is a [[siliceous]] (silica) stone, a variety of [[quartz]] similar to [[flint]] but more brittle. It naturally occurs as large, flat, elliptically shaped [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]] in [[Creek bed|creek beds]], and sometimes as hill-top [[Residuum (geology)|residuum]]. The nodules were formed as part of the Ullin limestone formation during the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian geologic period]] (roughly 359 to 318 million years ago). Mill Creek Chert is a tough, coarse-grained chert, usually brown or gray in color, and occurs as large tabular shaped nodules, a shape used by members of the [[Mississippian culture]] for the manufacture of broad bifaces such as [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]], [[spade]]s, and ceremonial maces and spuds.&lt;ref name=ILLINOISAGRI&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/agriculture/htmls/technology/hand_tools/tech_hand_na.html|title=Illinois Agriculture-Technology-Hand tools-Native American Tools|accessdate =2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SIUHISTORY&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/mississippian.htm|title= Mill Creek chert, Millstone Bluff, Kincaid Mounds:900 to 1550 AD|accessdate =2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, [[archaeologists]] began realizing that in the hilly lands of [[Southern Illinois]]  was the location for the [[quarrying]] and production centers -- one of the greatest in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] North America for this type of stone.&lt;ref name=QUARRY/&gt; The sites were located near Mill Creek, Illinois, a village in [[Union County, Illinois|Union County]], located between [[Jonesboro, Illinois|Jonesboro]] and [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]]  on the [[Alexander County, Illinois|Alexander County]] line.&lt;ref name=SIUHISTORY/&gt; From this collection of sites, known colloquially as the "Indian Diggings", [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] quarried, worked into tools and [[Blank (archaeology)|blanks]], and exported this stone to the wider Mississippian world. The chert found here was one of the major exported raw materials of the Mississippian culture and its distribution and procurement was one of the largest mining and production efforts organized during the Mississippian period.&lt;ref name=QUARRY/&gt; The raw material was dug up in the quarries and then transported to small hamlets for production in hoes, spades and blanks. Archaeologists believe they were then transported to and traded at regional mound centers such as the Hale Site, a [[palisade]]d village with a [[platform mound]] and a [[burial mound]]. From these local sites they were then transported and traded at sites even further afield. These materials were some of the most widely exchanged items during this period,&lt;ref name=QUARRY&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Quarry to Cornfield-The Political Economy of Mississippian Hoe Production|author=Charles R. Cobb|publisher=[[University of Alabama Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-8173-1050-9|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with especially large amounts transported to the [[American Bottom]] region. Examples are numerous at [[Cahokia]], where it was especially prized for hoes and spades,&lt;ref name=ILLINOISAGRI/&gt; but finds have been made in locations as distant as  [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] and [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]].

==Types of use==
[[File:Mill Creek Chert hoe distribution HRoe 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A map showing the geographical distribution and frequency of Mill Creek chert finds]]
The most common tools made from Mill Creek chert were digging implements. The physical properties of the stone and its ability to absorb repeated use without breaking as often as other stone, made it especially suitable for these types of tools.&lt;ref name=ILLINOISAGRI/&gt; The Mississippian cultures heavy dependence on [[maize]] agriculture and their monumental architecture ([[platform mound]]s, [[moat]]s and embankments) made such tools especially valuable. Three main varieties of Mississippian culture hoes have been found, differentiated by their shape, oval, flared and notched. The oval and flared varieties were hafted to L-shaped wooden handles, such as the one wielded by the [[Birger figurine]]. The notched version was probably hafted as a spade. Another advantageous property of the Mill Creek chert was the large size of the nodules, which meant that the corresponding tools could be large. Some hoes were up to {{convert|60|cm|in}} in length.&lt;ref name=QUARRY2&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Quarry to Cornfield-The Political Economy of Mississippian Hoe Production|author=Charles R. Cobb|publisher=[[University of Alabama Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-8173-1050-9|pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main use for the chert was large ceremonial bifaces, spatulate [[Celt (tool)|celts]] and stone maces. These were ritual objects which often display a high degree of craftmanship. Unlike the hoes and other utilitarian tools, the ritual objects were often ground and polished to a high degree of finish.&lt;ref name=QUARRY2/&gt; Many [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] artworks depict figures wielding these ceremonial items, especially the sword shaped ceremonial bifaces and maces. As with the hoes, these artifacts could also be quite large, with some of the swordlike bifaces being up to {{convert|50|cm|in}} in length. These ritual objects have been found throughout the [[American Bottom]], the Lilbourn Site in [[New Madrid County, Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csasi.org/2004_october_journal/2004_selected_pictures_from_the_october_journal.htm|title=Central States Archaeological Societies-Selected Pictures from the 2004 October Journal|accessdate =2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as far away as [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] and [[Gahagan Mounds Site|Gahagan Mounds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/ancestors/early.html|title=Early Caddo, A.D. 800-1200|accessdate =2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caddoan Mississippian culture]] sites in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Louisiana]]. Although the objects are modeled after actual weapons, such as war clubs, archaeologists believe they were too delicate to function as actual weapons and instead functioned as status symbols.&lt;ref name=QUARRY2/&gt;

It was founded by [[Alexis Granowsky|Alexander Granowsky]] as the Jewish Theater Workshop, in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Riss, Heidelore (2000). ''Ansätze zu einer Geschichte des jüdischen Theaters in Berlin 1889-1936''. Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang. p.&amp;nbsp;154.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, when Granowsky's theater was taken over by the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment, it relocated to Moscow, and became the Moscow State Jewish Theater.&lt;ref name="Veidlinger-YIVO"&gt;Veidlinger, Jeffrey (September&amp;nbsp;3, 2010). "[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Moscow_State_Yiddish_Theater Moscow State Yiddish Theater]." ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''. Retrieved 2017-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; It early on attracted [[Solomon Mikhoels]], who eventually became the leading actor and, in 1928, its director. The design of GOSET's foyer, as well as decorations sets and costumes for its first production, were done by [[Marc Chagall]].

The theater's repertoire included adaptations of [[Sholom Aleichem]], such as ''[[Tevye|Tevye the Milkman]]'' (also adopted in the West as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''), and of [[Avrom Goldfaden]], such as ''Bar Kokhba'', as well as works by contemporary Soviet Yiddish writers, such as [[Perets Markish]] and [[Dovid Bergelson]].  The theater also performed [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' to great acclaim. Many of the theater's plays were ostensibly supportive of the Soviet state, but closer readings suggest that they actually contained veiled critiques of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s regime.

In January 1948, Mikhoels was murdered by the [[MVD]], and his death was made to look like a car accident. Months later the theater was shut down, and the members of the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] (also headed by Mikhoels) were arrested. At least thirteen prominent Soviet Yiddish writers were executed on August 12, 1952 in the event known as "The [[Night of the Murdered Poets]]" ("Ночь казненных поэтов").

'''''Madonna Enthroned''''', also known as the '''''Ognissanti Madonna''''', is a painting by the Italian late medieval artist [[Giotto di Bondone]], housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of [[Florence, Italy]].

The painting has a traditional Christian subject, representing the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Christ Child]] seated on her lap, with saints and angels surrounding them on all sides. This particular representation of the Virgin is called a [[Maestà]], a popular representation at the time. It is often celebrated as the first painting of the [[Renaissance]] due to its newfound naturalism and escape from the constraints of [[Gothic art]].

It is generally dated to around 1310. While historians have had trouble finding specific information for indisputably attributing many of Giotto's works to the artist, ''Madonna Enthroned'' is one piece for which there are a few documents supporting its creation by Giotto.  There are many sources that show he spent many years living and creating in [[Florence]]. However, the main source that documents ''Madonna Enthroned'' specifically is artist [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s autobiography, ''I Commentarii'' (1447).  An earlier manuscript document of 1418 also attributes the painting to Giotto, but it is Ghiberti's autobiography that provides the most solid evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 676&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Giotto's later works, ''Madonna Enthroned'' was completed in [[Florence]], upon the artist's return to the city.  It was originally painted for the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] Franciscan church in Florence.  Built for the [[Humiliati]], a small religious order at the time, the church had many acclaimed paintings designed for it.  Specifically, Giotto's ''Madonna Enthroned'' was designed for the high altar.

==Influences==
The ''Madonna Enthroned'' shows the numerous styles of art that influenced Giotto. In both the gold coloring used throughout the artwork and the flattened gold background, Giotto's art continued the traditional Italo-Byzantine style so popular in the proto-Renaissance time period.  The altarpiece represents a formalized representation of an icon, still retaining the stiffness of Byzantine art, and Giotto retained the hierarchy of scale, making the centralized Madonna and the Christ Child much larger in size than the surrounding saints and religious figures.

Giotto's figures however escape the bounds of Byzantine art.  His figures are weighty and are reminiscent of three-dimensional sculptures, such as that in classical Roman sculpture.  The Madonna's intricately decorated throne, which itself is an Italian Gothic design, has a very specific use of colored marble as a surface decoration.  This method of decoration, based on a style called Cosmatesque or Cosmati, was popular in Rome since the Early Christian period and in Tuscany in the Late Middle Ages.

|thumb|right|upright=1.3]]
There were, additionally, a number of specific artists whose styles heavily influenced ''The Ognissanti Madonna''.  The influence of [[Cimabue]], traditionally recognized as Giotto's teacher, is shown first in the very symmetrical composition of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, 603&lt;/ref&gt; Cimabue portrayed the same subject in his 1280 ''Virgin and Child Enthroned'', and both pieces share aspects of the Italo-Byzantine style, with Cimabue's having more Byzantine attributes.  Additionally, the two depictions of the angels' wings in Giotto and Cimabue's pieces clearly resemble each other. Both pieces share a similar, initial feeling of severity, yet there is more to each piece than the drama. Giotto adopted from his teacher the importance of, and the concern for, volume and forms in space.  

The tranquility of Giotto's figures resembled also the style of [[Pietro Cavallini]].  From this artist, who painted neo-Byzantine pieces, taking cues from both mosaics and frescos from Roman and Early Christian times, Giotto took important lessons in the technique of painting, and in rendering figures as statuesque and calm.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 686&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lastly, Giotto took cues from many contemporary sculptors, including [[Nicola Pisano|Nicola]] and [[Giovanni Pisano]], whose work shares influences of Northern Gothic art.  In the work of these artists, Giotto saw great, dramatic compositions that would certainly influence his ''Ognissanti Madonna''.

==Technique==
[[Giotto]] was the first artist to depict three-dimensional figures in western European art. Additionally, he used a much smaller space than other contemporary artists, further emphasizing the importance of the bodies in the artwork. Giotto did away with many aspects of Byzantine art that would flatten the painting.  Within [[Cimabue]]'s ''Virgin and Child Enthroned'', there is the use of gold tracing to delineate the folds of the fabric.  In contrast to this, Giotto's fabric folds are more realistic, and instead of lines he used light, shadow, and color to create the appearance of fabric.  Contours of the body underneath these fabric folds are also visible, specifically in the Virgin's knees and also around her breasts. 

Giotto used a value scale, a distinct range of light and darks, to create a sense of volume in his figures, giving them the slight smokiness that is usually characteristic of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and later Renaissance artists.

'''Peasant Girl, spinning''' is the title given by nineteenth century [[United States|American]] [[expatriate]] artist [[Elihu Vedder]] to an [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] that depicts a young female figure spinning wool into thread. The work was completed in 1867 at the artist's studio in [[Via Margutta]], [[Rome]], and represents a slightly scaled up, slightly elaborated version of a theme Vedder had first developed in an oil sketch during the summer of the same year.&lt;ref name="Soria1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Soria, Regina |title=Elihu Vedder: American Visionary Artist in Rome|year=1970 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting depicts a young peasant girl, standing in profile on a hillside, transferring wool fibers from a [[distaff]] to a [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] that dangles from her right hand. She is barefoot and wears traditional costume consisting of a white shirt with sleeves rolled up, a blue frock, and a tattered red apron that sways in the wind. Strewn rocks and sparse tufts of vegetation punctuate a dry and otherwise barren landscape on what a combination of bright areas of paint and corresponding shadows suggest to have been a hot summer day.

In this early work from relatively shortly after Vedder's first arrival in Italy, dramatic movement is conveyed across both horizontal and vertical axes of the picture plane as the girl appears to step forward down the hillside and the spindle whirls, spinning thread from the distaff, midair. The serpentine outline of the girl's arm against the backdrop of the blue sky suggests an elegant [[line of beauty]], which is mirrored in the contours of the apron in the breeze.

==Theme==
Images of peasant girls spinning wool were a popular subject and appeared frequently in the works of nineteenth century artists, to whom the theme offered opportunities to romanticize rural life, document regional costume, as well as conjure up the iconography of [[Clotho]] and the Fates or [[Moirai]] of classical mythology, who are primeval goddesses that spin, apportion and eventually cut the thread of life to determine human fate. Similar treatments of the subject are to be found in [[Jules Breton]]'s ''La Fileuse'' (1872; [[Philbrook Museum of Art]]), the English [[neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] painter [[John William Waterhouse|John Waterhouse]]'s ''Pompeiian Girl Spinning'' (1874; Private Collection) and [[Frederic Leighton]]'s work ''Winding the Skein'' (1878; [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]).

Vedder's treatment of the theme, without precedent in American art and an exceptionally early example of what would eventually become a popular nineteenth century subject, reflects through its study of sunlight and shadow effects the influence of [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] and the [[Macchiaoli|macchiaolo style]] of Italian landscape painter [[Giovanni Costa|Giovanni 'Nino' Costa]], whom Vedder had befriended and painted alongside since the late 1850s.&lt;ref name="Jaffe1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jaffe, Irma|title=The Italian Presence in American Art|year=1989 |publisher=Fordham University Press|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inscription appearing on the back of an oil study for this picture that is dated August 19, 1867 reveals Vedder first developed the subject in ''Peasant Girl, spinning'' at "Le Casacce, between [[Perugia]] and [[Gubbio]], while the artist was in Tuscany that Summer.&lt;ref name="Butterscotch2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Butterscotch Auction Galleries|title=November Estate Auction, Bedford, New York, November 22, 2015, lot 7|year=2016 |publisher=Butterscotch Auction Galleries|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistically, ''Peasant Girl, spinning'' relates to a number of solitary vertical compositions among Vedder's early works, such as ''Girl with a Lute'' (1866; Private Collection), ''The Gloomy Path'' (1868; Private Collection), ''La Regina'' (1871; [[Reynolda House]]), and establishes a mode of depicting figures that would characterize later compositions like ''The Cup of Death'' (1885; [[Smithsonian Institution]]s) and ''Aladdin's Lamp'' (1888; [[Fogg Museum|Harvard Art Museums]]) as well.

Vedder would reprise and elaborate the theme of spinners in numerous later works such as ''Girl Spinning'' (1871; Questroyal Fine Art Galleries, New York), ''Spinning under the Olives'' (1879; [[McMullen Museum of Art|McMullen Museum of Art, Boston College]]), as well as for an illustration of his celebrated edition of the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]] in ''The Fates Gathering the Stars'' (1887; [[Art Institute of Chicago]]).&lt;ref name="Vedder1910"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vedder, Elihu|title=The Digressions of V.|year=1910 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|page=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given its date of 1867, however, ''Peasant Girl, spinning'' appears to be the earliest and the original example of these.

==Reception and exhibition history==
In his autobiography of 1910,'' The Digressions of V.'', Vedder listed this work as having been sold, along with ''Etruscan Girl with a Turtle'' (1867; [[Smith College Museum of Art]]), to New York publisher Jeremiah Curtis.{{sfn|Vedder|1910|p=465}}&lt;ref name="Hoolihan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hoolihan, Christopher|title=An Annotated Catalogue of the Edward C.

[[File:Books.by.women.photographers.jpeg|thumb|right|An example of some photo books]]

A '''photo book''' or '''photobook''' is a book in which [[photograph]]s make a significant contribution to the overall content. A photo book is related to and also often used as a [[coffee table book]].

[[File:The cult of the street Henry Bond.jpg|thumb |upright | Front cover of [[Henry Bond |Henry Bond's]] 1998 photo-book ''The cult of the street'']]

==Early photo books==
Early photo-books are characterised by their use of photographic printing as part of their reprographic technology. Photographic prints were tipped-in rather than printed directly onto the same paper stock used for [[letterpress]] printed text. Many early titles were printed in very small editions and were released as partworks to a network of well-informed and privileged readers. Few original examples of these books survive today, due to their vulnerability to light and damage caused by frequent handling.

What is arguably the first photo book, ''[[Anna Atkins#Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions|Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions]]'' (1843&amp;ndash;1853) was created by [[Anna Atkins]]. The book was released as a partwork to assist the scientific community in the identification of marine specimens. The non-silver [[cyanotype]] printing process worked by pressing actual specimens in contact with light-sensitive paper; hence the word "impression" in the book's title.&lt;ref name="parrbadger1"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Martin Parr | author2 = Gerry Badger | authorlink1 = Martin Parr | authorlink2 = Gerry Badger | title = The Photobook: A History, Volume I | place = London | publisher = [[Phaidon Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-7148-4285-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14, 20&amp;ndash;21}}

''[[The Pencil of Nature]]'' (1844&amp;ndash;46) was produced by [[William Henry Fox Talbot]], who had invented  the [[Calotype]] photographic process in 1839. Although significant as the first negative/positive photography process, the Calotype was also envisioned as a commercial prospect for the reproduction of images in books through mass publication. Anticipating commercial success, Fox Talbot established purpose-made printing premises in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] to carry out the reproduction of his book. ''The Pencil of Nature'' was released in six parts between 1844 and 1846, to an initially promising list of private subscribers whose numbers dwindled, causing the premature termination of his project.&lt;ref name="parrbadger1"/&gt;{{rp|13&amp;ndash;15,22}}

[[Julia Margaret Cameron]] created the first photo book to illustrate a literary work. The 1874 edition of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' contained twelve Cameron images that had been specially created, but reproduced as wood engravings. Cameron sought her own publisher, creating a new version of ''Idylls of the King,'' containing her original photographs as albumen prints, which came out in December of the same year.&lt;ref name="parrbadger1"/&gt;{{rp|69}}

==Japanese photo books==

[[File:Some books by Shimizu Bukou.jpeg|thumb|right|150 px|Some photo books by [[Bukō Shimizu]]]]

Photographers such as [[Shinzō Fukuhara]] were producing photography books in the 1920s. The postwar years brought low-priced photography books, such as the many volumes of [[Iwanami Shoten|Iwanami]] Shashin Bunko magazine. From the 1950s onward, most Japanese photographers of note have had photo books published.

The simplest Japanese translation of photo book is ''shashinshū'' ({{nihongo2|写真集}}), and the ''shashinshū'' section of a typical Japanese bookstore displays books of photographs with various levels of documentary or [[art]]istic merit. They primarily portray currently popular [[Japanese idol|celebrities]] in a variety of settings and outfits. Many are of [[gravure idol|cheesecake]] models (''guradoru''), or porn starlets (''nūdoru''); others are of singers, television personalities, professional sportswomen (often wrestlers) and so forth.

One of the best selling Japanese photobooks of all time, ''[[Santa Fe (Kishin Shinoyama book)|Santa Fe]]'' (1991), a fine art nude photo book modelled by [[Rie Miyazawa]] and photographed by [[Kishin Shinoyama]], sold 1.5 million copies in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://photoguide.jp/txt/Shinoyama_Kishin&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Conceptual photo books== --&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Independent and self-published photo books== --&gt;

== Personalized photo books ==

Storing digital images in traditional photo albums means printed copies are inserted in the pages of an album. Companies allow users to create personalized photo books. The resulting book is printed on digital color printers and case bound.

Professional printing and binding services offer easy creation of photo books with professional layouts and individual layout capabilities. Because of the integrated design and order workflow, hardcover bound books with customized pictures and text can be produced very cost-effectively.

Currently there are many photo book software companies who sell licensed solutions to photo labs and print houses so that their customers can create photo books (and other photo related paraphernalia) with ease. These software solutions are available for free download or online access or through apps.

==Online photo books==

The development of digital cameras and the Internet allowed an enormous production and exchange of pictures, taken from different corners of the
globe. There are many possibilities nowadays for users to upload and share pictures (examples are [[Google]] and [[Facebook]]). However, many people and institutions also publish 'photo books' on the web, by providing the community with a huge web database freely available for everybody.

'''''The remnants of an army, Jellalabad '''(sic)''', January 13, 1842''''', better known as '''''Remnants of an Army''''', is an 1879 oil-on-canvas painting by [[Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler]].  It depicts [[William Brydon]], assistant surgeon in the [[Bengal Army]], arriving at the gates of [[Jalalabad]] in January 1842. The walls of Jalalabad loom over a desolate plain and riders from the garrison gallop from the gate to reach the solitary figure bringing the first word of the fate of the "Army of Afghanistan".

Supposedly Brydon was the last survivor of the approximately 16,000 soldiers and camp followers from the 1842 [[retreat from Kabul]] in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], and is shown toiling the last few miles to safety on an exhausted and dying horse.  In fact a few other stragglers from the Army eventually arrived, and larger numbers were eventually released or rescued after spending time as captives of Afghan forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Dalrymple|page=387|title=Teturn of a King. The Battle for Afghanistan|ISBN=978-1-4088-1830-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;	
 
The painting was made in the middle of the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].  Lady Butler was developing a reputation for her military pictures after the favourable reception of her earlier painting ''[[The Roll Call]]'' of 1874, on a subject from the [[Crimean War]]. It measures {{convert|132.1|cm}} by {{convert|233.7|cm}}

''Remnants of an Army'' was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1879, and acquired by Sir [[Henry Tate]], who presented to the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1897.  Still owned by the Tate Gallery, it is on long-term loan as part of a permanent exhibition at the [[Somerset Military Museum]]: the [[Somerset Light Infantry|13th (1st Somersetshire) Regiment (Light Infantry)]] was involved in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], and moved to Jalalabad in late 1841.

'''Sir Roger Vernon Scruton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA|FRSL}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|r|uː|t|ən}}; born 27 February 1944) is an English [[philosopher]] and writer who specialises in [[aesthetics]] and [[political philosophy]], particularly in the furtherance of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist conservative]] views.&lt;ref name=Cowlingpxxix&gt;Cowling, Maurice. ''Mill and Liberalism'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990, xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, Mark; Hickson, Kevin. ''Conservative thinkers: The key contributors to the political thought of the modern Conservative Party'', Oxford University Press, 2013, 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor from 1982 to 2001 of ''[[The Salisbury Review]]'', a conservative political journal, Scruton has written over 50 books on philosophy, art, music, politics, literature, culture, sexuality, and religion; he has also written novels and two operas. His most notable publications include ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980), ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997), and ''[[How to Be a Conservative]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Roger Scruton bibliography]].&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a regular contributor to the popular media, including ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'', and the ''[[New Statesman]]''.

Scruton embraced conservatism after witnessing the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 student protests]] in France. From 1971 to 1992 he was a lecturer and professor of aesthetics at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], London, after which he held several part-time academic positions at the [[University of St Andrews|University of Oxford,]] the [[University of St Andrews]], as well as the position of Senior Fellow at the [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; He became known in the 1980s for helping to establish [[Jan Hus Educational Foundation|underground academic networks]] in Soviet-controlled [[Eastern Europe]], for which he was awarded the [[Czech Republic]]'s [[Medal of Merit (Czech Republic)|Medal of Merit]] (First Class) by President [[Václav Havel]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Barbara. ''The Velvet Philosophers'', London: The Claridge Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jJNYvDr8YBgC&amp;pg=PA281 281–282].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2016 Birthday Honours]] for "services to philosophy, teaching and public education".&lt;ref name=LondonGazette/&gt;

==Early life==
===Family background===
Scruton was born in [[Buslingthorpe, Lincolnshire|Buslingthorpe]], [[Lincolnshire]]&lt;ref name=born&gt;Cumming, Naomi. [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.50522 "Scruton, Roger"], ''Grove Music Online'', January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; to John "Jack" Scruton, a teacher from Manchester, and his wife, Beryl Claris Scruton (née Haynes), and was raised with his two sisters in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] and [[High Wycombe]].&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt; The Scruton surname had been acquired relatively recently. Jack's father's birth certificate showed him as Matthew Lowe, after Matthew's mother, Margaret Lowe (Scruton's great grandmother); the document made no mention of a father. However, Margaret had decided, for reasons unknown, to raise her son as Matthew Scruton instead. Scruton wondered whether she had been employed at the former Scruton Hall in [[Scruton]], Yorkshire, and whether that was where her child had been conceived.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''England: An Elegy'', A&amp;C Black, 2001, 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack was raised in a [[Back-to-back house|back-to-back]] on Upper Cyrus Street, [[Ancoats]], an inner-city area of Manchester, and won a scholarship to Manchester High School,&lt;!--no indication as to which school this is--&gt; a [[grammar school]].&lt;ref&gt;''England: An Elegy'', 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton told ''The Guardian'' that Jack hated the upper classes and loved the countryside, while Beryl was fond of romantic fiction and entertaining "blue-rinsed friends".&lt;ref name=Wroe&gt;Wroe, Nicholas. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/28/politics "Thinking for England"], ''The Guardian'', 28 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He described his mother as "cherishing an ideal of gentlemanly conduct and social distinction that&amp;nbsp;... [his] father set out with considerable relish to destroy".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''Gentle Regrets: Thoughts From a Life''. Continuum, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wgtnHZE_6lwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA11 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton lived with his parents, two sisters, and Sam the dog, in a [[pebbledashed]] semi-detached house in Hammersley Lane, [[High Wycombe]].&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gentlep89&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his parents had been brought up as Christians, they regarded themselves as humanists, so home was a "religion-free zone".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110225210343/http://spectator.org/archives/2009/03/10/the-new-humanism "The New Humanism"], ''American Spectator'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton's, indeed the whole family's, relationship with his father was difficult. He wrote in ''Gentle Regrets'': "Friends come and go, hobbies and holidays dabble the soulscape like fleeting sunlight in a summer wind, and the hunger for affection is cut off at every point by the fear of judgement."&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing his [[Eleven-plus|11-plus]], he attended the [[Royal Grammar School High Wycombe]] from 1954 to 1962.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''England: An Elegy'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He left school with three [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-levels]], in pure and applied mathematics, physics and chemistry, which he passed with distinction. The results won him an open scholarship in natural sciences to [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], as well as a state scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgs.saund.co.uk/pdfs/1962-09-wycombiensian.pdf "Examination successes, 1961–62"], ''Wycombiensian'', 13(6), September 1962, 328–330.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton writes that he was expelled from the school shortly afterwards, when the headmaster found the school stage on fire, and a half-naked girl putting out the flames, during one of Scruton's plays.&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gentlep34&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt; When he told his family he had won a place at Cambridge, his father stopped speaking to him.&lt;ref name=Edemariam/&gt;

Having intended to study [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|natural sciences at Cambridge]]—where he felt "although socially estranged (like virtually every grammar-school boy), spiritually at home"—Scruton switched on the first day to moral sciences (philosophy).&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the quote, ''Gentle Regrets'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1965,&lt;ref name=about/&gt; then spent time overseas, some of it teaching at the [[University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour]] in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, where he met his first wife, Danielle Laffitte.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger; Dooley, Mark. ''Conversations with Roger Scruton''. London &amp; New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, 18, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 he began studying for his PhD at Jesus, then became a research fellow at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] (1969–1971), where he lived with Laffitte when she was not in France.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 18, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; It was while visiting her during the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 student protests]] in France that Scruton first embraced [[conservatism]]. He was in the [[Latin Quarter in Paris]], watching students overturn cars, smash windows and tear up cobblestones, and for the first time in his life "felt a surge of political anger":&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; I suddenly realised I was on the other side. What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous [[Marxist]] [[gobbledegook]]. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilization against these things. That's when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1970s–1980s==
===Birkbeck, first marriage===
[[File:Birkbeck College phototram.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Scruton taught at Birkbeck for 21 years.]]
Scruton was awarded his PhD in January 1973 for a thesis entitled "Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind", supervised by Michael Tanner and [[Elizabeth Anscombe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/244964 "Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind"], Apollo, University of Cambridge repository.&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis was the basis of his first book, ''Art and Imagination'' (1974), which was followed by ''The Aesthetics of Architecture'' (1979). From 1971 he taught philosophy at [[Birkbeck College]], London, a college that specializes in adult education and holds its classes in the evening.&lt;ref name=Gentlep39/&gt; Laffitte taught French at [[Putney High School]], and they lived together in a [[Harley Street]] apartment previously occupied by [[Delia Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1972 but divorced in 1979.&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;

Working at Birkbeck left Scruton's days free, so he used the time to study law at the [[Inns of Court School of Law]] (1974–1976) and was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in 1978; he never practised because he was unable to take a year off work to complete a [[pupillage]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100831023120/http://www.roger-scruton.com/rs-cv.html "About"], roger-scruton.com, archived 31 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 57; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birkbeck was known for its embrace of [[left-wing politics]]. Scruton has said he was the only conservative there, except for the woman who served meals in the [[Senior Common Room]].&lt;ref name=Gentlep39&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, along with [[Hugh Fraser (British politician)|Hugh Fraser]], [[Jonathan Aitken]] and [[John Casey (academic)|John Casey]], he became a founding member of the [[Conservative Philosophy Group]] dining club, which aimed to develop an intellectual basis for conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 45; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Hugh Thomas]] and the philosopher [[Anthony Quinton]] attended meetings, as did [[Margaret Thatcher]] before she became prime minister. She reportedly said during one meeting in 1975: "The other side have got an ideology they can test their policies against. We must have one as well."&lt;ref&gt;Young, Hugo. ''One of Us'', London: Pan Macmillan, 2013, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton's academic career at Birkbeck was blighted by his conservatism, particularly by his third book, ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''The Meaning of Conservatism'', London: The Macmillan Press, and Totowa, NJ: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goss2006&gt;Goss, Maxwell. [http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles6/ScrutonConservative.php "The Joy of Conservatism: An Interview with Roger Scruton"], ''New Pantagruel'' (courtesy of orthodoxytoday.org), January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by his editorship of the conservative ''Salisbury Review''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 51; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''The Guardian'' that his colleagues at Birkbeck vilified him over the book.&lt;ref name=Edemariam/&gt; The Marxist philosopher [[Gerald Cohen]] of [[University College London]] reportedly refused to teach a seminar with Scruton, although they later became friends.&lt;ref name=SDp46&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued teaching at Birkbeck until 1992, first as a lecturer, by 1980 as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]], and then as professor of aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Salisbury Review''===
[[File:Roger Scruton (2015), Prague.jpg|thumb|Scruton in Prague, 2015]]
In 1982 Scruton became founding editor of ''[[The Salisbury Review]]'', a journal championing traditional conservatism in opposition to [[Thatcherism]], which he edited until 2001.&lt;ref name=ScrutonSept212002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''Conservative Thoughts: Essays from the Salisbury Review'', London: The Claridge Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Review'' was set up by a group of Tories known as the Salisbury Group—founded in 1978 by Diana Spearman and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury|Robert Gascoyne-Cecil]]&lt;ref&gt;Cowling 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_RjyJSr_z0C&amp;pg=PR29 xxix].&lt;/ref&gt;—with the involvement of the [[Peterhouse school of history|Peterhouse Right]]. The latter were conservatives associated with the Cambridge college, including [[Maurice Cowling]], [[David Watkin (historian)|David Watkin]] and the mathematician Adrian Mathias.&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Peterhouse Right (he calls it the Peterhouse Group) and ''The Salisbury Review'', see Haseler, Stephen. ''The battle for Britain: Thatcher and the New Liberals'', London: I.B. Tauris, 1989, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_vPwkkJUA6IC&amp;pg=PA138 138]; ''Gentle Regrets'', 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton wrote that editing ''The Salisbury Review'' effectively ended his academic career in the United Kingdom. The magazine sought to provide an intellectual basis for conservatism, and was highly critical of key issues of the period, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, egalitarianism, feminism, foreign aid, multiculturalism and modernism. To begin with, Scruton had to write most of the articles himself, using pseudonyms: "I had to make it look as though there was something there in order that  ''there should be something there!''"&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that the ''Review'' "helped a new generation of conservative intellectuals to emerge. At last it was possible to be a conservative and also to the ''left'' of something, to say 'Of course, the ''Salisbury Review'' is beyond the pale; but&amp;nbsp;...'"&lt;ref name=Gentlep59&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 the ''Review'' published a controversial article by [[Ray Honeyford]], a headmaster in Bradford, questioning the benefits of multicultural education.&lt;ref&gt;Honeyford, Ray. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3654888/Education-and-Race-an-Alternative-View.html "Education and Race—an Alternative View"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 27 August 2006 (reprint of Honeyford's 1984 article).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger.

Halstead, Mark. ''Education, Justice, and Cultural Diversity: An Examination of the Honeyford Affair, 1984–85''. Barcombe: Falmer Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] accused the ''Review'' of [[scientific racism]], and the [[University of Glasgow]] philosophy department boycotted a talk Scruton had been invited to deliver to its philosophy society. Scruton believed that the incidents made his position as a university professor untenable, although he also maintained that "it was worth sacrificing your chances of becoming a fellow of the [[British Academy]], a vice-chancellor or an emeritus professor for the sheer relief of uttering the truth".&lt;ref name=ScrutonSept212002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 77.&lt;/ref&gt; (Scruton was in fact elected a [[fellow of the British Academy]] in 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/2008/index.cfm |title=Elections to the Fellowship 2008 – British Academy |publisher=britac.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=17 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930183439/http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/elections/2008/index.cfm |archivedate=30 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he described the effect of the editorship on his life:

&lt;blockquote&gt; It cost me many thousand hours of unpaid labour, a hideous character assassination in ''[[Private Eye]]'', three lawsuits, two interrogations, one expulsion, the loss of a university career in Britain, unendingly contemptuous reviews, Tory suspicion, and the hatred of decent liberals everywhere. And it was worth it.&lt;ref name=ScrutonSept212002&gt;Scruton, Roger.

===Writing===
The 1980s established Scruton as a prolific writer. Thirteen of his non-fiction works appeared between 1980 and 1989, as did first novel, ''Fortnight's Anger'' (1981). The most contentious publication was ''[[Thinkers of the New Left]]'' (1985), a collection of his essays from ''The Salisbury Review'', which criticized 14 prominent intellectuals, including [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].{{efn|The subjects of ''[[Thinkers of the New Left]]'' are [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[R. D. Laing]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Rudolf Bahro]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Perry Anderson]], [[György Lukács]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].}} According to ''The Guardian'', the book was [[Remaindered book|remaindered]] after being greeted with "derision and outrage". Scruton said he became very depressed by the criticism.&lt;ref name=Adams2015&gt;Adams, Tim. [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/04/roger-scruton-my-father-looked-like-jeremy-corbyn-fools-frauds-firebrands-interview "Roger Scruton: 'Funnily enough, my father looked very like Jeremy Corbyn'"], ''The Guardian'', 4 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he founded his own publisher, The Claridge Press, which he sold to the [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"The Claridge Press and Continuum", ''The Salisbury Review'', 21–22, 2002, 56: "The Continuum International Publishing Group is delighted to announce the acquisition of the small, independent publishing house Claridge Press from its proprietor, the philosopher, Professor Roger Scruton."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090709070236/http://www.aei.org/scholar/100052 "Roger Scruton"], American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 9 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983 to 1986 he wrote a weekly column for ''The Times''. Topics included music, wine and motorbike repair, but others were contentious. The features editor, [[Peter Stothard]], said that no one he had ever commissioned had "provoked more rage". Scruton made fun of anti-racism and the peace movement, and his support for [[Margaret Thatcher]] while she was prime minister was regarded, he wrote, as an "act of betrayal for a university teacher". His first column, "The Virtue of Irrelevance", argued that universities were destroying education "by making it relevant": "Replace pure by applied mathematics, logic by computer programming, architecture by engineering, history by sociology: the result will be a new generation of well-informed philistines, whose charmlessness will undo every advantage which their learning might otherwise have conferred."&lt;ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p50&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stothard, Peter.

===Activism in Central Europe===
[[File:Roger Scruton, Budapest, September 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Scruton on "Europe and the Conservative Cause", Budapest, September 2016]]
From 1979 to 1989, Scruton was an active supporter of [[dissident]]s in [[Czechoslovakia]] under [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] rule, forging links between the country's dissident academics and their counterparts in Western universities. As part of the [[Jan Hus Educational Foundation]], he and other academics visited [[Prague]] and [[Brno]], now in the [[Czech Republic]], in support of an underground education network started by the Czech dissident [[Julius Tomin]], smuggling in books, organizing lectures, and eventually arranging for students to study for a Cambridge external degree in theology (the only faculty that responded to the request for help). There were structured courses, ''[[samizdat]]'' translations, books were printed, and people sat exams in a cellar with papers smuggled out through the diplomatic bag.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, David. [http://www.radio.cz/en/section/books/roger-scruton-and-a-special-relationship "Roger Scruton and a special relationship"], Radio Prague, 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, Seán.

Scruton was detained in 1985 in Brno before being expelled from the country. The Czech dissident [[:cs:Bronislava Müllerová|Bronislava Müllerová]] watched him walk across the border with Austria: "There was this broad empty space between the two border posts, absolutely empty, not a single human being in sight except for one soldier, and across that broad empty space trudged an English philosopher, Roger Scruton, with his little bag into Austria."&lt;ref&gt;Day 1999, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June that year, he was placed on the Index of Undesirable Persons. He writes that he was also followed during visits to Poland and Hungary.&lt;ref name=Day1999p281/&gt;

For his work in supporting dissidents, Scruton was awarded the First of June Prize in 1993 by the Czech city of [[Plzeň]], and in 1998 he was awarded the Czech Republic's [[Medal of Merit (Czech Republic)|Medal of Merit]] (First Class) by President [[Václav Havel]].&lt;ref name=Day1999p281&gt;Day 1999, 281–282; ''Gentle Regrets'', 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton has been strongly critical of figures in the West—in particular [[Eric Hobsbawm]]—who "chose to exonerate" former communist regimes' crimes and atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-05/local/me-2147_1_communist-party |title=The Day of Reckoning for the Apologists: Western collaborators with Soviet communism must be held accountable |work=Los Angeles Times|date=18 February 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; His experience of dissident intellectual life in 1980s Communist Prague is recorded in fictional form in his novel ''[[Notes from Underground (Scruton novel)|Notes from Underground]]'' (2014).{{fact|date=November 2017}}

==1990s–2000s==
===Farm purchase, second marriage===
[[File:Albany Courtyard.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Scruton rented an apartment in the [[Albany (London)|Albany]]; the rooms had previously been [[Alan Clark]]'s [[servants' quarters]].]]
Scruton took a year's [[sabbatical]] from Birkbeck in 1990 and spent it working in Brno in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=SDp109&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 109–112.&lt;/ref&gt; That year he registered Central European Consulting, established to offer business advice in post-communist [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name=companyinterests&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100902062543/http://www.roger-scruton.com/rs-business.html "Company interests"], roger-scruton.com, accessed 2 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been living in an apartment in [[Notting Hill Gate]], which he sold, and when he returned to England rented a cottage in [[Stanton Fitzwarren]], Swindon, from [[the Moonies]] and an apartment in the [[Albany (London)|Albany]] building on [[Piccadilly]], London, from [[Alan Clark]] (it had been Clark's [[servants' quarters]]).&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref name=SDp109/&gt;

From 1992 to 1995 he lived in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], teaching an elementary philosophy course and a graduate course on the [[philosophy of music]] for one semester a year, as professor of philosophy at [[Boston University]]. Two of his books grew out of these courses: ''Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey'' (1994) and ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997). In 1993 he bought Sunday Hill Farm in [[Brinkworth, Wiltshire|Brinkworth]], [[Wiltshire]]—35 acres, later increased to 100, and a 250-year-old farmhouse—where he lived after returning from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016.&lt;!--add page number--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ross1998&gt;Ross, Deborah.

While in Boston, Scruton had flown back to England every weekend to indulge his passion for [[fox hunting]],&lt;ref&gt;''On Hunting'', 1998; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was during a meet of the [[Duke of Beaufort's Hunt|Beaufort Hunt]] that he met Sophie Jeffreys, an architectural historian. They married in 1996 and set up home on Sunday Hill Farm.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt; Their two children were born in 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; Scruton set up Horsells Farm Enterprises Ltd in 1999, a PR firm that included [[Japan Tobacco International]] and [[Somerfield Stores]] as clients.&lt;ref name=companyinterests/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutHorsells&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161107105520/http://horsellsfarment.com/about-us.html "About us"], Horsells Farm Enterprises.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his publisher were successfully sued for libel that year by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] for suggesting that their songs were in large part the work of sound engineers; the group settled for undisclosed damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/573718.stm "Libel damages for Pet Shop Boys"], BBC News, 21 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tobacco company funding===
Scruton was criticized in 2002 for having written articles about [[smoking]] without disclosing that he was receiving a regular fee from [[Japan Tobacco International]] (JTI) (formerly [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]]).&lt;ref name=Gilmore2004/&gt; In 1999 he and his wife—as part of their consultancy work for Horshells Farm Enterprises&lt;ref name=companyinterests/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scruton28Jan2002/&gt;—began producing a quarterly briefing paper, ''The Risk of Freedom Briefing'' (1999–2007), about the state's control of risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120114207/http://www.riskoffreedom.com/archive.php ''The Risk of Freedom Briefing''], 2000–2006, accessed 11 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed to journalists, the paper included discussions about drugs, alcohol and tobacco, and was sponsored by JTI.&lt;ref name=Scruton28Jan2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p141&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 140–143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Scruton |first=Roger |date= 16 February 2002|title=Smoke Without Fire |url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/16th-february-2002/24/smoke-without-fire |magazine=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton wrote several articles in defence of smoking around this time, including one for ''The Times'',&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger.

The latter criticized the [[World Health Organization]]'s campaign against smoking, arguing that transnational bodies should not seek to influence domestic legislation because they are not answerable to the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger.

''The Guardian'' reported in 2002 that Scruton had been writing about these issues while failing to disclose that he was receiving £54,000 a year from JTI.&lt;ref name=Gilmore2004/&gt; The payments came to light when a September 2001 email from the Scrutons to JTI was leaked to ''The Guardian''. Signed by Scruton's wife, it asked the company to increase their £4,500 monthly fee to £5,500, in exchange for which Scruton would "aim to place an article every two months" in ''The Wall Street Journal'', ''Times'', ''Telegraph'', ''Spectator'', ''Financial Times'', ''Economist'', ''Independent'' or ''New Statesman''.&lt;ref name=Maguire24Jan2002&gt;Maguire, Kevin and Borger, Julian.

===Move to the United States===
[[File:Montpelier near Sperryville, closeup of house (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The Scrutons owned [[Montpelier (Sperryville, Virginia)|Montpelier]], near [[Sperryville, Virginia|Sperryville]], Virginia, from 2004 to 2009.&lt;ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p192/&gt;]]
The tobacco controversy damaged Scruton's consultancy business in England. In part because of that, and because the [[Hunting Act 2004]] had banned fox hunting in England and Wales, the Scrutons considered moving to the United States permanently, and in 2004 they purchased [[Montpelier (Sperryville, Virginia)|Montpelier]], an 18th-century [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation house]] near [[Sperryville, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 181, 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton set up a company, Montpelier Strategy LLC, to promote the house as a venue for weddings and similar.&lt;ref name=companyinterests/&gt; The couple lived there while retaining Sunday Hill Farm, but decided in 2009 against a permanent move to the United States and sold the house.&lt;ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p192&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 192–193; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110207060237/http://web.mac.com/rogerandsophie/iWeb/Site/Welcome.html "Welcome to Montpelier in Rappahannock County, Virginia"], web.mac.com/rogerandsophie.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton held several part-time academic positions during this period. From 2005 to 2009 he was research professor at the [[Institute for the Psychological Sciences]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], a graduate school of [[Divine Mercy University]], and in 2009 he worked at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in Washington, D.C., where he wrote his book ''Green Philosophy'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wine, opera===
From 2001 to 2009 Scruton wrote a wine column for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', and made contributions to ''[[The World of Fine Wine]]'' and ''Questions of Taste: The Philosophy of Wine'' (2007), with his essay "The Philosophy of Wine". His book ''I Drink Therefore I am: A Philosopher's Guide to Wine'' (2009) in part comprises material from his ''New Statesman'' column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Anthony Quinn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/20/drink-therefore-am-roger-scruton |title=I Drink Therefore I Am by Roger Scruton |work=The Guardian |date=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/roger_scruton |title=Roger Scruton |work=New Statesman |date= |accessdate=9 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920083059/http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/roger_scruton |archivedate=20 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton has also written three [[Libretto|libretti]], two set to music. The first is a one-act chamber, ''The Minister'',&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://hdl.handle.net/2144/14498 "The Minister. A one-act opera in six scenes"], OpenBU, Boston University Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second a two-act opera, ''[[Violet (opera)|Violet]]''. The latter, based on the life of the British harpsichordist [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]], was performed twice at the [[Guildhall School of Music]] in London in 2005.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==2010s: Academic posts, knighthood==
The Scrutons returned from the United States to make their home again at Sunday Hill Farm in Wiltshire. Scruton took an unpaid research professorship at [[Buckingham University]],&lt;ref name=about/&gt; and in 2010 was awarded an unpaid visiting professorship at the [[University of Oxford]] to teach graduate classes on aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/news__events/older_news/-_title_of_visiting_professor_conferred_on_roger_scruton "Title of Visiting Professor conferred on Roger Scruton"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210020635/http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/news__events/older_news/-_title_of_visiting_professor_conferred_on_roger_scruton |date=10 February 2011 }}, Philosophy Faculty, University of Oxford, accessed 27 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a senior research fellow at [[Blackfriars, Oxford|Blackfriars Hall]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/hall/academic-staff/ "Academic staff"], Blackfriars.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he delivered the Scottish [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of St Andrews]] on "The Face of God",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/gifford/2010/the-face-of-god/ "The Face of God"], University of St Andrews Gifford Lectures, 25 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year he took up a quarter-time professorial fellowship at St Andrews in moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/news/?newsid=130 "Roger Scruton appointed as quarter-time professorial fellow"], School of Philosophical, Anthropological and Film Studies, University of St Andrews, accessed 27 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two novels appeared during this period: ''[[Notes from Underground (Scruton novel)|Notes from Underground]]'' (2014) is based on his experiences in Czechoslovakia and ''[[The Disappeared (novel)|The Disappeared]]'' (2015) deals with child trafficking in a Yorkshire town.&lt;ref&gt;For the latter, Murray, Douglas.

In November 2018, Scruton was appointed to head the British Government's new Building Better, Building Beautiful commission. The commission was established to "promote better design and style of homes, villages, towns and high streets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/traditionalist-roger-scruton-to-chair-governments-new-beauty-watchdog/10036850.article|title=Traditionalist Roger Scruton to chair government’s new ‘beauty’ watchdog|work=Architects Journal|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being appointed to the role, Scruton faced calls to quit because of a number of controversial comments that he had made in the past.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46128371|title=Academic Scruton's housing role defended|date=2018-11-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical and political views ==
===Aesthetics===
Scruton has specialised in [[aesthetics]] throughout his career. From 1971 to 1992 he taught aesthetics at Birkbeck College. His PhD thesis formed the basis of his first book, ''Art and Imagination'' (1974), in which he argued that "what demarcates aesthetic interest from other sorts is that it involves the appreciation of something for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pjaesthetics.org/index.php/pjaesthetics/article/view/12/11 |title=Imagination, Attitude and Experience in Aesthetic Judgement|first=Cain|last=Samuel Todd|work=Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then Scruton has published ''The Aesthetics of Architecture'' (1979), ''The Aesthetic Understanding'' (1983 and 1997), ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997), and ''Beauty'' (2010). In 2008 a two-day conference was held at [[Durham University]] to assess his impact in the field, and in 2012 a collection of essays, ''Scruton's Aesthetics'', was published by Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/events/conferences/scrutonaesthetics/ "Scruton's Aesthetics"], Department of Philosophy, Durham University, 6 November 2012; Hamilton, Andy; Zangwill, Nick. ''Scruton's Aesthetics'', London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[Intelligence Squared]] debate in March 2009, Scruton (seconding historian [[David Starkey]]) proposed the motion: "Britain has become indifferent to beauty" by holding an image of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' next to one of the supermodel [[Kate Moss]].&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, Stephen. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/mar/22/national-trust-intelligence-squad "Has Britain become indifferent to beauty?], ''The Guardian'', 22 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year Scruton wrote and presented a [[BBC Two]] documentary, ''[[Why Beauty Matters]]'', in which he argued that beauty should be restored to its traditional position in art, architecture and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p6tsd |title=Why Beauty Matters |publisher=BBC |date=28 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that he had received "more than 500 e-mails from viewers, all but one saying, 'Thank Heavens someone is saying what needs to be said'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scruton |first=Roger |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2010/05/17/on-defending-beauty |title=On Defending Beauty |work=The American Spectator |date=May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519110549/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/05/17/on-defending-beauty |archivedate=19 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton has argued that a belief in God makes for more beautiful architecture.  He wrote "Who can doubt, on visiting Venice, that this abundant flower of aesthetic endeavour was rooted in faith and watered by penitential tears? Surely, if we want to build settlements today we should heed the lesson of Venice. We should begin with an act of consecration, since we thereby put down the real roots of a community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2018/11/17/only-religion-could-have-inspired-the-beauties-of-venice/|title=Only religion could have inspired the beauties of Venice {{!}} Catholic Herald|date=2018-11-17|work=Catholic Herald|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for conservatism===
{{Conservatism sidebar}}
Scruton is best known for his writing in support of conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Samuel. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/04/21/enemies-of-roger-scruton/ "The Enemies of Roger Scruton"], ''New York Review of Books'', 21 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; His second book, ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980)—which he called "a somewhat [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] defence of Tory values in the face of their betrayal by the free marketeers"&lt;ref name=Scruton2005p51&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 51.&lt;/ref&gt;—was responsible, he said, for blighting his academic career.&lt;ref name=Edemariam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Jesse. [http://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/09/how-to-be-a-conservative-by-roger-scruton-book-review/ "Passion, authority and the odd mini-rant: Scruton’s conservative vision"], ''The Spectator'', 27 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in ''Gentle Regrets'' (2005) that he found several of [[Edmund Burke]]'s arguments in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) persuasive. Although Burke was writing about revolution, not socialism, Scruton was persuaded that, as he put it, the utopian promises of socialism are accompanied by an abstract vision of the mind that bears little relation to the way most people think. Burke also convinced him that there is no direction to history, no moral or spiritual progress; that people think collectively toward a common goal only during crises such as war, and that trying to organize society this way requires a real or imagined enemy; hence, Scruton wrote, the strident tone of socialist literature.&lt;ref name=Regretsp40/&gt;

Scruton further argued, following Burke, that society is held together by authority and the [[rule of law]], in the sense of the right to obedience, not by the imagined rights of citizens. Obedience, he wrote, is "the prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them, and without which societies crumble into 'the dust and powder of individuality'". Real freedom, Scruton wrote, does not stand in conflict with obedience, but is its other side.&lt;ref name=Regretsp40&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also persuaded by Burke's arguments about the [[social contract]], including that most parties to the contract are either dead or not yet born. To forget this, he wrote—to throw away customs and institutions—is to "place the present members of society in a dictatorial dominance over those who went before, and those who came after them".&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton argued that beliefs that appear to be examples of prejudice may be useful and important: "our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable, from our own perspective, and the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss." A prejudice in favour of [[modesty]] in women and [[chivalry]] in men, for example, may aid the stability of sexual relationships and the raising of children, although these are not offered as reasons in support of the prejudice. It may therefore be easy to show the prejudice as irrational, but there will be a loss nonetheless if it is discarded.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton has been critical of the contemporary [[Feminism|feminist]] movement, while reserving praise for suffragists such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].&lt;ref name=Edemariam/&gt;

[[File:Nexus Masterclass Roger Scruton, November 2015.webm|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Scruton discussing the [[European Union]] and the [[nation state]], November 2015]]
In ''Arguments for Conservatism'' (2006), he marked out the areas in which philosophical thinking is required if conservatism is to be intellectually persuasive. He argued that human beings are creatures of limited and local affections. Territorial loyalty is at the root of all forms of government where law and liberty reign supreme; every expansion of jurisdiction beyond the frontiers of the nation state leads to a decline in accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''A Political Philosophy: Arguments for Conservatism'', London: Bloomsbury, 2006, 3, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He opposed elevating the "nation" above its people, which would threaten rather than facilitate citizenship and peace. "Conservatism and conservation" are two aspects of a single policy, that of husbanding resources, including the [[social capital]] embodied in laws, customs and institutions, and the material capital contained in the environment. He argued further that the law should not be used as a weapon to advance special interests. People impatient for reform—for example in the areas of [[euthanasia]] or [[abortion]]—are reluctant to accept what may be "glaringly obvious to others—that the law exists precisely to impede their ambitions".&lt;ref&gt;''Arguments for Conservatism'', 15, 34, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

He defined [[post-modernism]] as the claim that there are no grounds for truth, objectivity, and meaning, and therefore conflicts between views are nothing more than contests of power, and argued that, while the West is required to judge other cultures in their own terms, Western culture is adversely judged as ethnocentric and racist. He wrote: "The very reasoning which sets out to destroy the ideas of objective truth and absolute value imposes political correctness as absolutely binding, and cultural relativism as objectively true."&lt;ref&gt;''Arguments for Conservatism'', 106, 115, 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and totalitarianism===
Scruton contends, following [[Immanuel Kant]], that human beings have a transcendental dimension, a sacred core exhibited in their capacity for [[self-reflection]].&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, Mark. ''Roger Scruton: The Philosopher on Dover Beach''. Continuum, 2009, 12, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that we are in an era of secularization without precedent in the history of the world; writers and artists such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]] "devoted much energy to recuperating the experience of the sacred—but as a private rather than a public form of consciousness." Because these thinkers directed their art at the few, he writes, it has never appealed to the many.&lt;ref name=Arguments142&gt;''Arguments for Conservatism'', 142–143, 146–147, 150–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

He defines totalitarianism as the absence of any constraint on central authority, with every aspect of life the concern of government. Advocates of totalitarianism feed on resentment, Scruton argues, and having seized power they proceed to abolish institutions—such as the law, property, and religion—that create authorities. Scruton writes, "To the resentful it is these institutions that are the cause of inequality, and therefore the cause of their humiliations and failures." He argues that revolutions are not conducted from below by the people, but from above, in the name of the people, by an aspiring elite.&lt;ref name=Arguments142/&gt;

Scruton suggests that the importance of [[Newspeak]] in totalitarian societies is that the power of language to describe reality is replaced by language whose purpose is to avoid encounters with realities. He agrees with [[Alain Besançon]] that the totalitarian society envisaged by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) can be only understood in theological terms, as a society founded on a transcendental negation. In accordance with T. S. Eliot, Scruton believes that true originality is only possible within a tradition, and that it is precisely in modern conditions—conditions of fragmentation, heresy, and unbelief—that the conservative project acquires its sense.&lt;ref&gt;''Arguments for Conservatism'', 162–163, 182, 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton considers that religion plays a basic function in "endarkening" human minds. "Endarkenment" is Scruton's way of describing the process of socialization through which certain behaviours and choices are closed off and forbidden to the subject, which he considers necessary to curb socially damaging impulses and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, P. "Endarkening the mind: Roger Scruton and the power of law", ''Social &amp; Legal Studies'', 6(1), 1997, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stafford1991/&gt; Scruton himself is an [[Anglican]], who authored ''Our Church: A Personal History of the Church of England'', defending the relevance of the [[Church of England]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

On the matter of evidence of God's existence, Scruton has said, "Rational argument can get us just so far...It can help us to understand the real difference between a faith that commands us to forgive our enemies, and one that commands us to slaughter them. But the leap of faith itself — this placing of your life at God's service — is a leap over reason's edge. This does not make it irrational, any more than falling in love is irrational."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/science/sc0078.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite claiming that belief alone is sufficiently rational, he has advocated a form of the [[argument from beauty]]: he has said that when we take the beauty in the natural world around us as a gift, we are able to openly understand God. The beauty speaks to us, he claims, and from it we can understand God's presence around us.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/17/roger-scruton-kindly-atheists&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
Scruton's ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986) has been described as "the most interesting and insightful philosophical account of sexual desire" produced within [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton|first1=Christopher |last2=Soble|first2=Alan, Editor |last3=Power|first3=Nicholas P., Editor |title=The Philosophy of Sex: Contemporary Readings, Fifth Edition |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location=Lanham, Maryland |year=2008 |page=101 |isbn=0742547981 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a challenge to the conventional boundaries of that discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Janaway|first1=Christopher |last2=Honderich|first2=Ted, Editor |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=816 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has influenced subsequent discussions of sexual ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnhill|first1=Anne |last2=Crasnow|first2=Sharon L., Editor |last3=Superson|first3=Anita M., Editor |title=Out from the Shadows: Analytical Feminist Contributions to Traditional Philosophy |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |year=2012 |pages=115–116 |isbn=978-0199855476 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Plaxton|first1=Michael |title=Implied Consent and Sexual Assault: Intimate Relationships, Autonomy, and Voice |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]] |location=Montreal |year=2015 |pages=221, 223 |isbn=978-0773546202 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] credited Scruton with providing "the most interesting philosophical attempt as yet to work through the moral issues involved in our treatment of persons as sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha |last2=Soble|first2=Alan, Editor |title=The Philosophy of Sex, Contemporary Readings, Third Edition |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location=Oxford |year=1997 |page=293 |isbn=0-8476-8481-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social theorist [[Jonathan Dollimore]] writes that Scruton bases a conservative sexual ethic on the Hegelian proposition that "the final end of every rational being is the building of the self", which involves recognizing the other as an end in itself.&lt;ref name=Dollimore260&gt;[[Dollimore, Jonathan]]. ''Sexual Dissidence: Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault''. Oxford University Press, 1991, 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay, "Sexual morality and the liberal consensus" (1989), Scruton argues that [[homosexuality]] is a perversion because the body of the homosexual's lover belongs to the same category as his own.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''The Philosopher on Dover Beach''. Carcanet Press Limited, 1990, 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton argued further that gays have no children and consequently no interest in creating a socially stable future. He therefore considered it justified to "instil in our children feelings of revulsion" towards homosexuality,&lt;ref name=Stafford1991&gt;Stafford, J. Martin. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00372432 "The two minds of Roger Scruton"], ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', 11(2), 1991, 187–193. {{doi|10.1007/BF00372432}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 he challenged the idea that gays should have the right to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3636798/This-right-for-gays-is-an-injustice-to-children.html "This 'right' for gays is an injustice to children"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 28 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton told ''The Guardian'' in 2010 that he would no longer defend the view that revulsion against homosexuality can be justified.&lt;ref name=Edemariam&gt;Edemariam, Aida. [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jun/05/roger-scruton-interview "Roger Scruton: A pessimist's guide to life"], ''The Guardian'', 5 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal rights===
[[File:Roger Scruton, September 2002.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Roger Scruton]]: rights imply obligations.]]

Scruton argues that rights imply obligations. Every legal privilege, he writes, imposes a burden on the one who does not possess that privilege: that is, "your right may be my duty." Scruton therefore regards the emergence of the animal rights movement as "the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview", because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species.&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt;

He accuses animal rights advocates of "pre-scientific" [[anthropomorphism]], attributing traits to animals that are, he says, [[Beatrix Potter]]-like, where "only man is vile." It is within this fiction that the appeal of animal rights lies, he argues. The world of animals is non-judgmental, filled with dogs who return our affection almost no matter what we do to them, and cats who pretend to be affectionate when, in fact, they care only about themselves. It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape.&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html "Animal Rights"], ''City Journal'', summer 2000.
*Scruton (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton singled out [[Peter Singer]], a prominent Australian philosopher and animal-rights activist, for criticism. He wrote that Singer's works, including ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), "contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals."&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html "Animal Rights"], ''City Journal'', summer 2000.
*Scruton (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===English independence===
Scruton supports [[English independence]] because he believes that it would uphold friendship between [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]]; [[Northern Ireland]] and because the English would have a say in all matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26173128|title= A Point of View: Should the English have a say on Scottish independence?|date= 23 February 2014|publisher= BBC News|quote= I would vote for English independence, as a step towards strengthening the friendship between our countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Architectural Institute of Canada''' ('''RAIC'''), also known since 2012 as '''Architecture Canada''', is a [[Canada|Canadian]] association that represents over 4,800 Canadian [[architect]]s, faculty, and graduates of Canadian schools of architecture. It acts as the voice for architecture and its practice in Canada and provides the national framework for the development and recognition of architectural excellence. The RAIC National Office is located in [[Ottawa]], Ontario.

==History==
RAIC was founded in 1907. It provided a country-level co-ordination among previously-existing provincial architectural groups.&lt;ref name="Crossman1987"&gt;Kelly Crossman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S-5WuEb2aQEC&amp;pg=PR15 Architecture in Transition: From Art to Practice, 1885-1906]''. McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP; 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-0604-6}}. p. 15–.&lt;/ref&gt; Through its journal, the organization provided information to its members about building practices and design considerations in Canada.&lt;ref name="WetherellKmet1991"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qu-WJBzJ4sIC&amp;pg=PA343 Homes in Alberta: Building, Trends, and Design, 1870-1967]''. University of Alberta; 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-88864-223-3}}. p. 343–.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, in anticipation of the confederation of Newfoundland with Canada. Architects there formed the Newfoundland Architects Association, which became a chapter of the RAIC.&lt;ref name="Mellin2011"&gt;Robert Mellin. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xhk6838sbmsC&amp;pg=PA260 Newfoundland Modern: Architecture in the Smallwood Years, 1949-1972]''. McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP; 17 October 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-3902-0}}. p. 260–.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After World War II, The RAIC made considerable efforts to develop connections and forums for collaboration between architects and members of related professions, including interior design, arts and crafts.&lt;ref name="Alfoldy2012"&gt;Sandra Alfoldy. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjYH3-zeFeQC&amp;pg=PA3 Allied Arts: Architecture and Craft in Postwar Canada]''. MQUP; 28 March 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-8682-6}}. p. 3–.&lt;/ref&gt; They also worked on developing standards of measurement in the building trades.&lt;ref name="Conferences1962"&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). Building Research Institute. Conferences. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Methods of Building Cost Analysis: Report of a Program Held as Part of the BRI 1961 Fall Conferences]''. National Academies; 1962. NAP:15348. p. 61–.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2000, a study of the organization's Journal showed that the publication had perpetuated gender-based stereotypes about the field of architecture.&lt;ref name="AdamsTancred2000"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=i8oVMPqR3BIC&amp;pg=PA36 Designing Women: Gender and the Architectural Profession]''. University of Toronto Press; 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8219-0}}. p. 36–.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the RAIC signed on for [[the 2030 °Challenge]], which urges the global architecture community to adopt targets to ensure building practices are carbon-neutral by 2030.

The RAIC presents an annual festival of architecture for architects and members to network and earn continuing education credits; the 2017 festival was be held in [[Ottawa]]. The RAIC also administers a job board for members and the public.

==Membership==

There are three classes of membership in the RAIC: Members ([[post-nominal letters]] MRAIC), fellows (FRAIC), and honorary members/fellows (Hon. MRAIC/FRAIC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32342">'''SF Masterworks''' is a series of [[science fiction]] books started by Millennium and currently published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] (both being imprints of the UK based [[Orion Publishing Group]]).

It began in 1999 and comprises selected pieces of science-fiction literature from 1950 onwards (with a few exceptions). The list was compiled by the managing director of [[Orion Books]], [[Malcolm Edwards]], with the help of "leading SF writers and editors" and the goal of bringing important books back into print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Issues/03Edwards.html Locus Online: Malcolm Edwards interview excerpts]&lt;/ref&gt; The list was described by science fiction author [[Iain M. Banks]] as "amazing" and "genuinely the best novels from sixty years of SF".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/promotions/gollancz-sf-masterworks |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621053514/http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/promotions/gollancz-sf-masterworks |archivedate=2013-06-21 |df= }} Orion Books Masterworks Website &lt;/ref&gt;

It has a companion series in the [[Fantasy Masterworks]] line. A separate ''Future Classics''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uksfbooknews.net/2007/09/06/gollancz-editor-simon-spanton-on-the-future-classics-promotion/ Gollancz editor Simon Spanton on the Future Classics promotion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914123601/http://www.uksfbooknews.net/2007/09/06/gollancz-editor-simon-spanton-on-the-future-classics-promotion/ |date=September 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; line has also started featuring eight science fiction novels from the last few decades.

Gollancz officially relaunched the series in March 2010 beginning with reissues of the first ten titles. These titles have new cover designs (no longer featuring numbers) and introductions, and other existing titles are planned to be reprinted. Gollancz also added new titles to the series beginning in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Gollancz Science Fiction and Fantasy New Books Catalogue: Jan-July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; Also published in the current (since 2010) ''SF Masterworks'' new design series.

==New design==

[[File:SF_Masterworks_table_display_at_London_bookshop,_May_2017.jpg|thumb|left|A selection of titles from the series on display at a London bookshop.]]

The new designs sport yellow/white spines, with the SF Masterworks logo written vertically down the left hand side of the cover.  For titles that were previously issued in the original series, generally the cover artwork is tinted in a different colour from the original version; for example, [[The Dispossessed]] cover artwork is primarily red in the original release, but was partly tinted green when republished in the new series.

With Shweshwe, the cotton cloth is first entirely dyed, thoroughly penetrating the fiber. Then, the cloth is passed through copper design rollers, which emit a mild acid solution, removing color with pinpoint accuracy. One of the characteristics of Shweshwe is the intense use of picotage, tiny pin dots that create not only the designs, but also texture and depth. It is because of the difficulty and expense in creating these designs that they fell out of favor with American and European manufacturers, who chose instead to move to printing processes. Da Gama Textiles of South Africa is the only known manufacturer of fabrics still using the discharge process ... The reverse side of the fabric will be a solid color because it was dyed.

The fabric is manufactured in various colours including the original indigo, chocolate brown and red, in a large variety of designs including florals, stripes, and diamond, square and circular geometric patterns.&lt;ref name=MamaAfrika/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joyce/&gt; The intricate designs are made using picotage, a [[pin]]ning fabric printing technique rarely used by contemporary fabric manufacturers due to its complexity and expense, although the design effects have been replicated using modern fabric printing techniques.&lt;ref name=deVillemarette/&gt;

Previously imported to South Africa from Europe, the [[trademark]]ed fabric has been manufactured by Da Gama Textiles in the [[Zwelitsha]] [[Township (South Africa)|township]] outside [[King William's Town]] in the [[Eastern Cape]] since 1982.&lt;ref name=Kuper/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Futhwa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Joyce/&gt; In 1992 Da Gama Textiles bought the sole rights to Three Cats, the most popular brand of the fabric made by Spruce Manufacturing Co.

'''''Squawkers McCaw''''' is a animatronic [[children]]'s [[toy]] [[bird]] from ''[[Fur Real]]'' that acts like a real [[parrot]].

==Summary==
It was introduced in 2006 by [[Hasbro]] in the [[United States of America|United States]]. The technology behind the bird allows the young child to enjoy a simulation of having a pet bird. The [[Squawk (sound)|squawking sounds]] the toy produces are recordings of a parrot. Feeding the Squawkers McCaw toy with a pretend [[cracker (food)|cracker]] brings [[positive reinforcement]] for the child with some [[American English|English phrases]]. While the "toy cracker" is not consumed by the toy, Squawkers McCaw enjoys the "cracker" as if were real food. 

The voice behind the popular toy was done by 23-year-old E. Shapiro. The phrases the toy speaks consist of basic American English words that are repeated from the child and a pre-set vocabulary of words. Vocabulary is limited on Squawkers McCaw toy birds because the toy is intended for a juvenile audience. As of 2008, all television advertising was pulled from the Squawkers McCaw toy. The toy line was disestablished in 2008.

The official music of Squawkers McCaw is mid-80s through early 90s slow jams with the House Tom sound effect. The official song of Squawkers McCaw is "I Start You Up, You Turn Me On" by Levert. The House Tom sound effect says "CahCahCahCah". An example of a song with this sound effect is "You Got Me Hanging On Seat Belts" by Loose Ends.

==The Official Squawkers Macaw Song Lyrics==
Let's Rock To The Squawk Walk!

Let's move our feet, sway to the beat Singing squawk, squawk, squawk!

Lean to the left, sway to the right, singing squawk, squawk, squawk!

Turn your head, look all around, Flap your wings to the funky sound!

If you want to dance and rock, raise your beak and give a squawk! *bird squawk* 

So we can rock, rock, rock, rock, yeah! 

So rock that squawk walk, yeah!

Sing squawk, squawk, squawk! 

Sing squawk, squawk, squawk! 

All right, rock that squawk walk. *bird squawk*

'''''The Birth of Venus''''' ({{lang-fr|La Naissance de Vénus}}) is one of the most famous paintings by 19th-century [[Painting|painter]] [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. It depicts not the actual birth of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] from the sea, but her transportation in a shell as a fully mature woman from the sea to [[Paphos]] in [[Cyprus]]. She is considered the epitome of the Classical Greek and Roman ideal of the female form and beauty, on par with ''[[Venus de Milo]]''. 

For Bouguereau, it is considered a ''tour de force''. The canvas stands at just over {{convert|9|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}} high, and {{convert|7|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}} wide. The subject matter, as well as the composition, resembles a previous rendition of this subject, [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'', as well as [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|The Triumph of Galatea]]''.

==History==
''The Birth of Venus'' was created for the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1879. It was awarded the Grand Prix de Rome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=His Most Famous Painting (The Birth of Venus) - William-Adolphe Bouguereau|url=http://birth.ezinemark.com/his-most-famous-painting-the-birth-of-venus-william-adolphe-bouguereau-4f3f5cfe22c.html|accessdate=15 October 2012|author=Annette Labedzki}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was purchased by the state for the [[Musée du Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name="Head study"&gt;{{cite web|title=Study of the Head of a Woman for "Offering to Eros"|url=http://www.bernheimer.com/en/study-of-the-head-of-a-woman-for-offering-to-eros|accessdate=29 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111093456/http://www.bernheimer.com/en/study-of-the-head-of-a-woman-for-offering-to-eros|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is now in the permanent collection of the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]].

==Description==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau - The Nymphaeum - 1878 (detail).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Detail from ''[[:commons:Category:Nymphée by Bouguereau|The Nymphaeum]]'', executed by Bouguereau in 1878. Venus' figure was enlarged from this nymph.]]

At the center of the painting, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] stands nude on a [[scallop]] shell&lt;ref name=Naissance&gt;{{cite web|title=William Bouguereau. The birth of Venus. La naissance de Venus c1879|url=http://www.arts-crafts-hobbiesanddiy.com/venus-%20birth-goddess.htm|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; being pulled by a [[dolphin]], one of her symbols. Fifteen [[Putto|putti]], including [[Cupid]] and [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], and several [[nymph]]s and [[centaur]]s have gathered to witness Venus' arrival. Most of the figures are gazing at her, and two of the centaurs are blowing into [[conch]] and Triton shells, signaling her arrival.

Venus is considered to be the embodiment of feminine [[Physical attractiveness|beauty]] and [[Female body shape|form]], and these traits are shown in the painting.&lt;ref name=Naissance/&gt; Her head is tilted to one side, and her facial expression reflects that she is calm and comfortable with her nudity. She raises her arms,&lt;ref&gt;Similar to [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres']] ''Venus Anadyomène''.&lt;/ref&gt; arranging her thigh-length, brown hair, swaying elegantly in an "S" curve [[contrapposto]], emphasizing the curves of her body.&lt;ref name=Anadyomene&gt;{{cite web|title=Venus Anadyomene: The Mythological Symbolism from Antiquity to the 19th Century|url=http://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/55858|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for Venus was Marie Georgine, princess of Ligne.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!-- If there happens to be no info about it, please remove claim and rephrase the paragraph --&gt; In 1861, she was on a short holiday in Paris with her lover. Together, they modeled for Bouguereau's "Abduction of Psyche" and "Flora and Zephyr". He worked out ''Venus'' and other sketches and paintings later from photographs he took of the couple. Some of Bouguereau's other works, like ''[[:w:File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - La Nuit (1883).jpg|La Nuit]]'', are also based on her. Marie was also painted by [[Léon Bonnat]] and photographed by [[Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon]].

Venus' figure was enlarged from a nymph from Bouguereau's [[:w:File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - The Nymphaeum (1878).jpg|''The Nymphaeum'']], completed in 1878, a year earlier.&lt;ref name=Anadyomene/&gt; The nymph is slightly thinner, and her breasts are fuller and more rounded. Venus' contrapposto is more intense, and her hair is also longer and lighter than the nymph's, but she arranges it almost identically.

To the upper-left of the painting, there is a shadow in the clouds. It appears to be the silhouette of the artist, with a head, shoulder, arm, and a raised fist that would seem to hold a paintbrush.&lt;ref name=Naissance/&gt;

'''''The Englishman's Library''''' was an English book series of the 1840s, a venture of the publisher [[James Burns (publisher)|James Burns]]. It ran eventually to 31 volumes.

The title had been used already in 1824, for ''The Englishman's library'', edited by E. H. L., published by [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Englishman|title=The Englishman's Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdgGAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1824}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was announced in ambitious fashion in the ''[[British Critic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Critic, Quarterly Theological Review, and Ecclesiastical Record|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUUDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1839|publisher=C. &amp; J. Rivington, and J. Mawman|pages=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started by [[William Gresley (divine)|William Gresley]] and [[Edward Churton]], with propagandistic aims; the works are still a source for the "[[condition of England]]" debate of the time. Gresley wrote six novels for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Sutherland|title=The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzJ3yNVVqtUC&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=6 January 2013|date=1 November 1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1842-4|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
According to its prospectus, the Library aimed to "unite a popular style with sound Christian principles". The announced authors did not in fact all contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Henry Newman|title=Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman: Littlemore and the parting of friends May 1842-October 1843|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_SWAJPBo5wC&amp;pg=PA300|accessdate=6 January 2013|year=1961|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925458-3|page=300 note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those behind the series were younger [[High Church]] men who wished to imitate some of the success of the ''[[Tracts for the Times]]''. They were less hostile to the Tractarians than older, more orthodox members of the [[Hackney Phalanx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter B.

'''''The Green Christ''''' (in French: '''''Le Christ vert''''') is a painting executed by [[Paul Gauguin]] in autumn 1889 in [[Pont-Aven]], [[Brittany]], France. Together with ''[[The Yellow Christ]]'', it is considered to be one of the key-works of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] in painting. It depicts a Breton woman at the foot of a [[calvary (sculpture)|calvary]], or sculpture of Christ's crucifixion. Calvaries are common in town squares in Brittany. The woman appears to be hiding from a pair of figures in the distant background; the green christ providing her cover from the figures. 

Topographically, the site depicted is the Atlantic coast at [[Clohars-Carnoët|Le Pouldu]]. But the calvary depicted is an amalgam of calvaires from different site; the cross is based upon that in the centre of [[Névez]], a community close to [[Pont-Aven]] and several miles from the coast, and the figure of Christ is based upon the calvaire at [[Briec]] - also some distance from the sea.

A [[SWAT]] team is sent to investigate his home only to find that Jack is alone and perfectly safe. The leader of the SWAT team informs Jack the fire in Cuba was started when a plane piloted by one of Jack's clients, Jean Saint Preux, crashed.

==="Kill Zone" by [[Robert Liparulo]]===
Police sniper Byron Stone watches through a rifle's scope, a man in an apartment terrorizes a mother and her two children. He fears missing his target, granting the hostage-taker a final opportunity to complete his dirty work.

==="Epitaph" by [[J. A. Konrath]]===
A paid killer, Phin, is hired by a Chinese man named Ti to avenge his daughter, Sunny Lung, who was killed by a gang known as the 'Kings'. Phin, after having received a beating from the Kings, breaches the gang's headquarters and kills the men responsible for Sunny's death, using Sunny's cremated remains as bullets.

==="The Face In the Window" by [[Heather Graham Pozzessere|Heather Graham]]===
A dangerous storm rips through Florida, where an evacuation notice has been spread throughout part of the state. Beth Henson, a woman whose husband, Keith has been sent to rescue an elderly woman, stays in her house during the evacuation progress. A man stumbles in seeking shelter, but Beth suspects that he is a serial killer. Keith enters the elderly woman's home, only to find that she is unconscious inside the trunk of her car. A youth found around the woman's house claims to be her nephew; Keith also suspects that he is a serial killer. Back in the house, Beth attacks her guest with a frying pan. She flees to the shed where the youth catches her, holding a knife to her neck. Keith arrives at the house and whilst searching for the youth, bumps into the man who was hit by a frying pan. Keith locks him in a room and exits to the shed. The three enter the house where the man ambushes them and takes Beth hostage. Beth retaliated and attacked the man again with a frying pan, leaving him unconscious.

==="Empathy" by [[James Siegel]]===
The author, whose name is unmentioned, has an affair with a hotel masseuse, Kelly. Kelly tells him she is an empath, someone who can sense one's emotions by touch. She also tells him of a man in whom she sensed a very strong evil, and that the man is a pedophile. The author is very moved, because he feels responsible for his younger brother's suicide, because the narrator had not said anything about the pedophile priest who, it is implied, abused both of them. He seeks out the man Kelly mentioned, and after killing him, meets with a friend of Kelly's, who informs the narrator that Kelly was divorced, was a drug addict, and had poisoned her son against his father. The narrator, realizing he had killed Kelly's innocent ex-husband, set out to kill Kelly and avenge the man he had wrongfully killed. In the end it is implied that the author commits suicide.

==="Kowalski's In Love" by [[James Rollins]]===
Seaman Joe Kowalski swims onto a small island after his boat is accidentally blown up by a gas leak. He is met by Dr. Shay Rosauro, who informs him that the island is infected with a [[transgenic rhabdovirus]] and is scheduled to be bombed by the Brazilian Navy at 0900 hours—in less than half an hour. Shay had entered the island to retrieve the only antidotes to the virus; an evac helicopter  will pick her up at 0855 hours. However, the island is scattered with booby traps, and it isn't long until Shay falls into one, breaking her leg. Kowalski offers to retrieve the antidotes himself, whilst Shay makes for the evac dropsite. Shay reluctantly agrees but becomes treed by apes on her way. Kowalski encounters Gabriella Salazar, who has already collected the antidotes. Kowalski shoots and killed Gabriella in self-defense and retrieves the antidotes. Kowalski could escape on the evac chopper, but opts not to, as it will lift off the island on schedule, with or without Shay. Kowalski rescues Shay, and they escape on the water vehicle that was meant for Gabriella.

==="The Hunt For Dmitri" by [[Gayle Lynds]]===
Dmitri Garnitsky is on the hitlist of a professional assassin, the Carnivore, who has a reputation for never failing. After being tipped off, Dmitri leaves his home, but he is met by the Carnivore, and later Oleg Olenkov, the man who hired the Carnivore. The Carnivore is angered by Olenkov's demands and shoots him in the chest, leaving Dmitri unharmed. Many years later, Olenkov catches up with the Carnivore's daughter, Liz Sansborough, a psychologist. Masquerading as "Arkady Albam", Olenkov befriends Sansborough, lures her to his apartment, and tells her a false story of how he got shot. He ultimately reveals himself to be Olenkov, and moments later Dmitri enters the apartment, shocked that his attempted killer is there. The three of them engage in a violent struggle, resulting in one of their being rendered unconscious and harmless.

==="Disfigured" by [[Michael Palmer (novelist)|Michael Palmer]] &amp; [[Daniel Palmer (writer)|Daniel Palmer]]===
Dr. George Hill and his ex-wife Maura Hill receive a letter that their son has been kidnapped; if they want to see him alive again, George must inject [[isopropyl alcohol]] in the face of his celebrity client, Audra Meadows, during surgery, disfiguring her permanently. Maura sneaks into the Meadows' household, hoping to rescue her son. After witnessing Audra being verbally abused and then raped by her husband, Alec, Maura searches the house without success. Maura visits another property, this one owned by A.R. Meadows, only to find the property is owned by ''Ambrose'' Meadows. Maura then goes in search of Dr. Simon Rubenstein, the psychiatrist who had prescribed Audra's pills. Maura then discovers that Audra had threatened Maura's son's life herself, unbeknownst to Alec, believing that if she were disfigured, Alec would reject her, and then she'd be free from his mental and sexual abuse. Just before the surgery, Maura and Dr. Rubenstein confront Audra.

Weaver and his friend, Thomas Lane, are attacked by Fisher and his crime partner, Ruddy Dick. After Lane was knocked out, Weaver beheaded Dick, Fisher grabbed the money and both fled the scene. A year later, Fisher befriends a man known as Farting Dan. Whilst robbing an equipage, Weaver kills Dan, but is shot by Fisher. Fisher returns home with the equipage's horseman, Phillip, trying to get him to pick a valuable lock. Phillip revealed himself to be Weaver, and that in their encounter a year ago Fisher had mistaken Lane for Weaver and vice versa. Lane, however, is not dead; the gun Fisher used was faulty and all the entire robbery deaths were staged. Farting Dan entered and the two of them retrieved the boxes.

==="Dirty Weather" by [[Gregg Hurwitz]]===
A bar in a small, ransacked town is under armed robbery. Rick Jacobs manages to scare off the robber who was after a load of cash in a safe. After pocketing the cash, Jacobs and a maid who worked at the bar escaped the road-blocked town. Jacobs reveals he faked the robbery scene with his crime partner, knocking the maid out and stealing the money.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60296">The following is a '''list of unproduced Tim Burton projects''', in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 30 years, [[Tim Burton]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the [[pre-production]] stage under his direction.

==1980s==

===''After Hours''===
Burton was originally attached to direct the 1985 film ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'', but [[Martin Scorsese]] read the script at a time when he was unable to get financial backing to complete ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'', which was finally completed in 1988; Burton gladly stepped aside when Scorsese expressed interest in directing ''After Hours''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes|title=Filming for Your Life: The Making of After Hours"|type=Bonus feature|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]|location=Burbank, California|id=B000286RNE|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Big Top Pee-wee''===
After the [[Pee-wee's Big Adventure|1985 film]], Burton was offered the opportunity to direct ''[[Big Top Pee-wee]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Salisbury|Burton|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had no interest and was already working on his own pet project, ''Beetlejuice''.

===''Hot to Trot''===
After the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), and before his hiring of ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), [[Warner Bros.]] sent Burton various scripts. He was disheartened by their lack of imagination and originality, one of them being ''[[Hot to Trot]]'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Burton, pp. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==

===''Conversations with Vincent''===
Burton held a fascination with [[Vincent Price]] films since his childhood. He first worked with the actor on the 1982 television film ''[[Hansel and Gretel (1983 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]'', and a second collaboration on the 1982 short film ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]''. During the production of ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), in which Price portrayed the inventor, Burton conceived the idea of making an independent [[documentary film]] on the actor,&lt;ref name=Vince&gt;Hanke, pp. 116, 187&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[working title]] ''Conversations with Vincent''.&lt;ref name=died&gt;Salisbury, Burton, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt; With self-financing from his own production company, Burton shot the film in black-and-white over a three-day period at the Vincent Price Gallery in [[East Los Angeles College]] in April 1991. In addition to Price, [[Roger Corman]] and [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]] were interviewed. ''Conversations with Vincent'' was stalled when Burton went to work on ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name=Vince/&gt; and after Price's death in October 1993.&lt;ref name=died/&gt; In December 1994 it was announced that Burton was returning to the hour-long documentary, now titled ''A Visit with Vincent''. Lucy Chase Williams, author of ''The Complete Films of Vincent Price'', was working as a consultant. The film likely would have been released in the [[direct-to-video]] market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304825,00.html | title = Upcoming Projects for Tim Burton and Keanu Reeves | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1994-12-09 | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project was ultimately abandoned and remains unfinished.&lt;ref name=Vince/&gt;

===''Drop Dead Fred''===
Burton was offered the chance to direct ''[[Drop Dead Fred]].'' He turned it down in favor of different projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/drop-dead-fred/257794/drop-dead-fred-looking-back-on-a-cult-classic|title=Drop Dead Fred: Looking Back On A Cult Classic|date=September 1, 2017|publisher=Den of Geeks|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian''===
In 1990, Burton hired writer [[Jonathan Gems]] for write a sequel to ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', entitled ''Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19751_6-insane-sequels-that-almost-ruined-classic-movies.html|title=6 Insane Sequels That Almost Ruined Classic Movies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nothing came of this project. In early 1991, Burton was still interested in directing the sequel, and hired [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]] to rewrite the script, but the two decided to focus on ''Batman Returns''. By  August 1993, producer [[David Geffen]] hired [[Pamela Norris]] (''[[Troop Beverly Hills]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'') to rewrite the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodie|first=John|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR109942.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title=Twentieth, Norris-Clay ink pact|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1993-08-26|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Warner Bros. decided to hire [[Kevin Smith]] to write another script, but he turned down the offer to write the script of the unmade ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[An Evening With Kevin Smith]]|type= DVD|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later joked that his response was "Didn't we say all we needed to say in the first ''Beetlejuice''? Must we go tropical?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=[[An Evening With Kevin Smith]]|type= DVD|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying "The ''Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian'' script is still owned by The Geffen Film Company and it will likely never get made. You really couldn't do it now anyway. Winona is too old for the role, and the only way they could make it would be to totally recast it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrante|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony C. Ferrante|date=March 1997|title=Hidden Gems|work=[[Fangoria]]|pages=53–56|accessdate=2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Warner Bros. hired [[Seth Grahame-Smith]], who collaborated with Burton on ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'', to write and produce a sequel to ''Beetlejuice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike|title=KatzSmith Duo Makes First-Look Warner Bros Deal; Will Bring 'Beetlejuice' Back From Dead|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/09/katzsmith-duo-makes-first-look-warner-bros-deal-will-bring-beetlejuice-back-from-dead/|date=2011-09-06|accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grahame-Smith signed on with the intention of doing "a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat." He was also adamant that [[Michael Keaton]] would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ary|first=John|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/55824/|title=John Ary With A Brief Snippet Of Info Re: Beetlejuice 2 Via Writer Seth Grahame-Smith!!|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=2012-05-17|accessdate=2012-08-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522005333/http://www.aintitcool.com/node/55824|archivedate=May 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, "We talked for a couple of hours and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [Michael's] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll talk to anybody about it who will listen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turek|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/165575-michael-keaton-meets-about-beetlejuice-2-seth-grahame-smith-offers-update|title=Michael Keaton Meets About Beetlejuice 2, Seth Grahame-Smith Offers Update|website=[[Shock Till You Drop]]|date=2012-02-11|accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; "This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel. What's great is that for Beetlejuice {{sic}}, time means nothing in the afterlife, but the world outside is a different story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chitwood|first=Adam | url = http://collider.com/seth-grahame-smith-beetlejuice-sequel/153065/|title=Seth Grahame-Smith Gives Update on Beetlejuice Sequel; Says Film Will Be a True Sequel Set 26 or 27 Years After the Original|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=2012-03-17|accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, [[Winona Ryder]] hinted at a possible return for the sequel as well by saying, "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano |first=Andrew |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/18/exclusive-winona-ryder-on-beetlejuice-2-looks-like-it-s-happening-with-burton-keaton-and-ryder.html |title=Winona Ryder on‘Beetlejuice 2': 'Might Be Happening’With Burton, Keaton, and Ryder|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=2013-11-18|accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, Burton stated, "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/392099-exclusive-tim-burton-thinks-theyre-closer-than-ever-to-beetlejuice-sequel|title=Exclusive: Tim Burton Thinks Beetlejuice 2 is Closer Than Ever|date=2014-12-14|website=[[ComingSoon.net]]|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming ''Beetlejuice 2'' by the end of the year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/01/16/beetlejuice-2-something-wicked-gremlins-seth-grahame-smith/3|title='Beetlejuice' 2, 'Something Wicked,' 'Gremlins,' vampires galore: Seth Grahame-Smith's 2015 to-do list|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2015-01-16|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'', Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Beetlejuice 2' Is Really Happening, Says Winona Ryder|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/beetlejuice-2-sequel-winona-ryder-tim-burton-michael-keaton-1201567607/|accessdate=September 13, 2015|first=Mannie|last=Holmes|publisher=Variety|date=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Burton stated, "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out [for a sequel], it's not the ''Beetlejuice'' trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|url=http://collider.com/beetlejuice-2-update-tim-burton/|title=Beetlejuice 2: Tim Burton Gives Update on Sequel|publisher=Collider|date=2016-05-10 |accessdate=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mai, the Psychic Girl''===
Beginning in the late 1980s, [[New wave music|new wave]] rock band [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] attempted to make the Japanese manga ''[[Mai, the Psychic Girl]]'' into a musical, with interest from Burton&lt;ref name=Gall/&gt; and [[Carolco Pictures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Jay Carr | title = Batman to battle DeVito's Penguin | work = [[The Boston Globe]]| date = 1991-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; who purchased the [[film rights]] in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' for [[Touchstone Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Jeff Yang| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2009/08/06/apop080609.DTL| title = The Pokemon generation grows up | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| date = 2009-08-06|accessdate = 2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out.&lt;ref name=Gall&gt;{{cite news | author = Joseph Galliano | url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/classical/article6895801.ece| title = Striking Sparks with Bergman| work = [[The Sunday Times]]| date = 2009-10-30 | accessdate = 2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Ford Coppola]] later developed the property in the late 1990s. In June 2000, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] started on a different project with [[Kirk Wong]] attached to direct.&lt;ref name=SPE&gt;{{cite news | author = Dana Harris | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117782459 | title =Wong to helm SPE's 'Psychic' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2000-06-11 | accessdate = 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2001, a script had been written by Lisa Addario and Joey Syracuse for Sony's [[Columbia Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Claude Brodesser; Cathy Dunkley | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117794526 | title =U opens its heart to Addario, Syracuse spec| work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2001-02-18 | accessdate = 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of ''[[The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman]]'', a radio musical by Sparks, in August 2009, was informed by the six years the band spent trying to get their ''Mai, the Psychic Girl'' produced. The album generated new interest, and gained a "second wind", vocalist [[Russell Mael]] explained. "The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day."&lt;ref name=Gall/&gt; On May 18, 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/tim-burton-mai-psychic-girl-ross-60405/|title=Tim Burton Directing 'Mai, the Psychic Girl'?|last=Miller|first=Ross|publisher=Screenrant.com|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Stay Tuned''===
[[Morgan Creek Productions]] originally wanted Burton to direct ''[[Stay Tuned (film)|Stay Tuned]]'' because of his work on ''Beetlejuice'' and his art style, but Burton left the project to direct ''Batman Returns'', the sequel to his [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]], and was replaced by [[Peter Hyams]] while having some of the art styles paying tribute to Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/stay-tuned/55430/looking-back-at-stay-tuned|title=Looking back at Stay Tuned|last=Childs|first=Paul|website=denofgeek|accessdate=February 22, 2018|date=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Singles'' television series===
After the 1992 film ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'' was released, which had Burton in a rare credited acting role, [[Warner Bros. Television]] tried to turn the film into a [[television series]], but the project never materialized. The film's director [[Cameron Crowe]] claims that ''Singles'' inspired the television series ''[[Friends]]''.&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, Jim. [http://www.jimdero.com/Bangs/on_the_set.htm "As Crowe flies"]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. September 3, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jurassic Park''===
Before [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' was published, Hollywood studios were highly interested in purchasing the [[film rights]]. This included Warner Bros. and Burton, Sony Pictures Entertainment and [[Richard Donner]], and [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Joe Dante]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]] (1997). ''Steven Spielberg: A Biography''. Faber and Faber, 416–9. {{ISBN|0-571-19177-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] acquired the rights in May 1990 for [[Steven Spielberg]], resulting in the [[Jurassic Park (film)|1993 film adaptation]].&lt;ref name="Production notes"&gt;''Jurassic Park'' DVD production notes&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mary Reilly''===
Producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]] acquired the film rights to ''[[Mary Reilly (novel)|Mary Reilly]]'' in 1989, and optioned them for Warner Bros. with [[Roman Polanski]] as director.&lt;ref name=mulls/&gt; When Guber became CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment later that year, he moved ''Mary Reilly'' to Sony's sister company, [[TriStar Pictures]], where Burton was approached to direct with [[Denise Di Novi]] to produce in 1991.&lt;ref name=off/&gt; [[Christopher Hampton]] was hired to write the screenplay, and Burton signed on as director in January 1993, after he approved over Hampton's rewrite.&lt;ref name=mulls&gt;{{cite news | author = Claudia Eller | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR102864 | title = Fox mulls playing 'Pat' hand; TriStar woos Woo | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-01-11 | accessdate = 2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to start filming in January 1994, after he completed ''Ed Wood'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR103729 | title = TriStar Pictures slate for 1993 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-02-04 | accessdate = 2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Burton dropped out in May 1993 over his anger against Guber for putting ''Ed Wood'' in turnaround. [[Stephen Frears]] was TriStar's first choice to replace Burton, and Di Novi was fired and replaced with [[Ned Tanen]].&lt;ref name=off&gt;{{cite news | author = Claudia Eller | url =http://www.variety.com/article/VR106493 | title = Burton's off 'Reilly' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-05-03 | accessdate = 2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ended up becoming the critically and commercially unsuccessful ''[[Mary Reilly (film)|Mary Reilly]]'' in 1996, starring [[Julia Roberts]] and [[John Malkovich]].

===''Catwoman''===
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="After the traumas of ''Batman Returns'' she has amnesia, and she doesn't really remember why she has all these bullet holes in her body, so she goes to relax in Oasisburg. What [[Gotham City]] is to [[New York City]], Oasisburg is to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]-[[Los Angeles]]-[[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]]. [It's a] resort area in the middle of the desert. It's run by superheroes, and the movie has great fun at making fun at the whole male superhero mythos. Then they end up being not very good at all deep down, and she's got to go back to that whole Catwoman thing."|source=—Daniel Waters on his script for ''Catwoman''&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt;}}

''Batman Returns'' would be the last film in the Warner Bros. [[Batman (1989 film series)|''Batman'' film series]] that featured Burton and [[Michael Keaton]] as director and leading actor. With ''[[Batman Forever]]'', Warner Bros. decided to go in a "lighter" direction to be more [[mainstream]] in the process of a [[family film]]. Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel, but was credited as producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Burton]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Joel Schumacher]], ''The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight: Reinventing a Hero'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; With Warner Bros. moving on development for ''Batman Forever'' in June 1993, a ''Catwoman'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] was announced. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in ''Forever'' because of her own spin-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR107881 | title = Dish | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-06-17 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton became attached as director, while producer Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR109036 | title = Another life at WB for ''Catwoman'' and Burton? | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-07-22 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct ''Catwoman'' or an adaptation of "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR117395 | title = Seagal on the pulpit may be too much for WB | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-01-13 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his ''Catwoman'' script to Warner Bros., the same day ''Batman Forever'' was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, "Turning it in the day ''Batman Forever'' opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. ''Catwoman'' is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script."&lt;ref name=beetle&gt;Judy Sloane (August 1995). "Daniel Waters on Writing", ''Film Review'', pp. 67-69&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Tim Egan | title = Michelle Pfeiffer, Sensuous to Sensible | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1995-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film labored in [[development hell]] for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by [[Ashley Judd]].

During the early development of the cancelled ''Catwoman'' spin-off, Burton expressed his interest in directing the third installment of the ''Batman'' film series that began with ''Batman'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TizGvUlAybY|title=Tim Burton's Biography &amp; The Directors Batman Segments|first=|last=Kamdan|date=21 June 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Monkees]] lead drummer [[Micky Dolenz]] was attached to star as the [[Riddler]], the film's main antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niagara-gazette.com/news/local_news/micky-dolenz-embraces-his-monkees-past/article_bd16fc13-2b88-5bb7-8f05-99f9c1796981.html|title=Micky Dolenz embraces his Monkees past|first=Thom Jennings|last=ngedit@niagara-gazette.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Harvey Dent's transformation into [[Two-Face]] was supposed to occur in the film, with [[Billy Dee Williams]] reprising his role as Dent from the first film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/11/02/billy-dee-williams-talks-two-face-did-not-get-paid-for-batman-forever/|title=Billy Dee Williams Talks Two-Face, Did Not Get Paid For Batman Forever|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after turning down the offer to appear in ''Batman Returns''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about-faces.livejournal.com/85767.html|title=Stories That Never Were: the Harvey Dent we DIDN'T see in Tim Burton's "Batman" movies|first=2012-11-14 04:24:00 About_faces About_faces 2012-11-14 04:24:00|last=About_faceswrote|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these, Michelle Pfeiffer was attached to return as [[Catwoman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/catwoman/248479/whatever-happened-to-the-tim-burton-catwoman-movie|title=Whatever Happened to the Tim Burton Catwoman Movie?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marlon Wayans]] was attached to star as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/marlon-wayans%2C13500/ |title=Marlon Wayans - - A.V.

In 1993, Burton was set to direct ''[[Cabin Boy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/04/26/director-of-cabin-boy-explains-where-things-went-south/|title=Director of Cabin Boy Explains Where Things Went South|last=Getlen|first=Larry|publisher=NYPost|date=April 26, 2014|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left to direct ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''. [[Adam Resnick]] eventually directed the 1994 film, with Burton in a producer role.

Burton considered directing ''Go Baby Go'', a beach film in the style of filmmaker [[Russ Meyer]], with a screenplay by Jonathan Gems; he chose to direct ''Mars Attacks!'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geektyrant.com/news/2009/6/10/tim-burton-projects-that-never-made-it-to-the-screen.html|title=TIM BURTON projects that NEVER MADE it to the screen|last=Reyes|first=Eli|website=geektyrant|accessdate=July 18, 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Geek Love''===
Burton bought the rights to ''[[Geek Love]]'' by [[Katherine Dunn]] in the 1990s. The story, about a traveling circus that uses chemicals to create genuine freaks, seemed perfect for Burton, but there has been no word about it since. In an interview with Dunn, she stated, "He's got the rights. That's half the battle right there. Though it no longer seems like something he'd do. It's a little too horror for him now in my opinion. Though I would love to see this film get made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geektyrant.com/news/2009/6/10/tim-burton-projects-that-never-made-it-to-the-screen.html|title=TIM BURTON projects that NEVER MADE it to the screen|last=Reyes|first=Eli|website=geektyrant|accessdate=July 18, 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dinosaurs Attack!''===
Around 1995, writer Jonathan Gems wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of ''[[Dinosaurs Attack!]]'', with Burton as director. However, both Burton and Gems came to the conclusion that the project was too similar to ''Jurassic Park''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5963344/these-terrifying-dinosaurs-attack-trading-cards-from-the-1980s-traumatized-an-entire-generation|title=These terrifying Dinosaurs Attack! trading cards from the 1980s traumatized an entire generation|first=George|last=Dvorsky|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Toots and the Upside Down House''===
In 1996, when Burton was the CEO and founder of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' stop-motion studio division [[Skellington Productions]], he was going to produce the studio's planned third film, ''Toots and the Upside Down House'', that was based on the book by [[Carol Hughes (author)|Carol Hughes]] where a young girl still grieving over the death of her mother goes to a fantasy world inside her home when her dad still won't pay attention to her, where goblins, fairies and sprites live while helping the fairies battle an evil [[Jack Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='The Advanced Art of Stop-Motion Animation': History of Stop-Motion Feature Films: Part 2 | url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/advanced-art-stop-motion-animation-history-stop-motion-feature-films-part-2 | last=Priebe | first=Ken | publisher=''[[Animation World Network]]'' | quote="The relationship between Disney’s company Miramax and Henry Selick also became strained, as plans for another feature called ''Toots and the Upside Down House'' were abandoned. | accessdate=January 4, 2015 | date=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton was attached to produce it, while [[Henry Selick]] was set to direct it (marking the third collaboration between Selick and Burton), with the screenplay written by [[Steven Soderbergh]] and co-produced by Disney's film partner at the time [[Miramax]], which would have made it the first original animated film made by the company.

Burton gave art director Sylvain Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was "a cone with a round ball on top, and something that looked like an emaciated skull inside.

''Tim Burton's Lost in Oz'' would be a television series based on [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[List of Oz books|The Wizard of Oz]]'' book series. Burton would be its executive producer.

===''Ripley's Believe It or Not!''===
{{More|Ripley's Believe It or Not!#Planned film}}
During the mid-2000s, Burton was scheduled to direct a film based on the famous ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' franchise, with [[Jim Carrey]] portraying [[Robert Ripley]] and a script by ''Ed Wood'' scribes [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]]; the film ran over budget however, and was shelved by [[Paramount Pictures]]. Burton moved on to direct ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]''. On January 12, 2011, it was reported that Paramount had revived development of the film with screenwriter [[Eric Roth]], with Carrey still attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2011/01/paramount-reviving-ripleys-believe-it-or-not-with-eric-roth-96116/|title=Paramount Reviving 'Ripley's Believe It Or Not' With Eric Roth|first=Mike Fleming|last=Jr|date=13 January 2011|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I was always very protective of ''Nightmare'' not to do sequels or things of that kind," Burton explained. "You know, 'Jack visits [[Thanksgiving]] world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/movies/|title=News - Entertainment, Music, Movies, Celebrity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first is the opening theme for "Gotham City" and the entry of Batman with his tortured solo "The Graveyard Shift"; followed by "The Joker's Song (Where Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?)", "The Catwoman's Song (I Need All The Love I Can Get)", "We're Still The Children We Once Were" (the climactic sequence) and "In The Land Of The Pig The Butcher Is King", sung by the corrupt blood-suckers ruling Gotham, covered on the [[Meat Loaf]] album ''[[Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose]]''. After production was cancelled, these songs were released on the ''Batman: The Musical'' memorial site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071124212821/http://www.freewebs.com/batman_themusical/ Dark Knight of the Soul]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2005, Burton stated that he and [[Johnny Depp]] didn't have intentions of making a sequel to ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', based on the ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]'' novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4660873.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Entertainment - Willy Wonka's everlasting film plot|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some elements of ''Great Glass Elevator'' were seen at the end of Burton's film.

And I think we could continue the journey from where we left off and see how these creatures are existing in a world in which the natural environment is coming back and perhaps even threatening them in some way. Do they make the decision to not affect it, or do they try to affect it in some way? And do they still try to hold on to that humanity within them or do they recognize themselves at being machines too and go off on a different trajectory?

No plans for a sequel have been made, but possibilities were mentioned via the film's 2009 DVD commentary.

It wasn't a conscious decision. First of all, it's a bit presumptuous to think that. If something works out, that's one thing, but you can't ever predict that. The ending had more to do with the soap opera structure of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/johnny-depp-tim-burton-dark-shadows-interview/|title=Johnny Depp and Tim Burton Talk DARK SHADOWS, Pulling from the TV Series, Deleted Scenes, a Sequel and More|date=8 May 2012|publisher=collider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Deep''===
On June 11, 2012, Shane Acker confirmed that Burton would work with [[Valve Corporation]] to create his next animated feature film, ''Deep''. Like ''9'', the film will take place in a post-apocalyptic world (although set in a different universe). ''Deep'' would of been another darker animated film, as Shane Acker has expressed his interest in creating more PG-13 animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/shane-acker-valve-deep-movie-sandy-178699/|title=’9′ Director Teaming With Valve for Post-Apocalyptic Animated Film, 'Deep'|publisher=Screenrant.com|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been no further announcements. However, despite the silence from Acker, in January 2017, the Facebook profile of the character "the Scientist" was updated with a rather cryptic message. The profile had been inactive since 2009, leading some to speculate the teasing of a sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The light has faintly flickered on again beneath the ashes and I have begun the long awaited search for hope...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8357">'''The Triangle Network '''(formally known as the''' '''Triangle Arts Trust) is an international arts organization that brings together artists from different countries to explore new ideas and expand the boundaries of their practice. Triangle was initiated through a series of artists' workshops providing an uninterrupted period of two weeks where 20–25 artists from diverse [[culture|cultural]] backgrounds engage with each other, to explore new ideas and expand the boundaries of their practice. Now the Triangle Network coalesces grassroots arts organisations around the world (many of which were initiated as workshops while others grew independently), in order that artists' mobility, international cultural exchange and capacity building objectives can be shared.

The Triangle Network is registered as a charitable organization in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts/Ends11%5C0000326411_AC_20040331_E_C.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Triangle Network was established in 1982 by [[Robert Loder]] and [[Anthony Caro]], and is organised as a network of [[artist]]s, [[visual art]] organisations, and artists-led workshops. It currently is active in over 30 countries. Each centre within the Network is independent and set up to respond to local needs. The object of the workshops is "to counterbalance the tendency of the Western art world to put the emphasis on the object and its marketing rather than on the creative process itself".

David Elliott was appointed to Chair the Board, succeeding Robert Loder who retired in 2009. Loder remained a Trustee of the organization until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=32071|title=Triangle Arts Trust Announced the Appointment of David Elliott as the Chair of the Board of Triangle Arts Trust|author=Ignacio Villarreal|work=artdaily.org|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Worker and Kolkhoz Woman''''' ({{lang-ru|Рабо́чий и колхо́зница}} ''Rabochiy i Kolkhoznitsa'') is a sculpture of two figures with a [[Hammer and sickle|sickle and a hammer]] raised over their heads. It is 24.5&amp;nbsp;meters (78&amp;nbsp;feet) high, made from [[stainless steel]] by [[Vera Mukhina]] for the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|1937 World's Fair]] in [[Paris]],&lt;ref name="overy260"&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p260 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently moved to [[Moscow]]. The sculpture is an example of the [[socialist realism|socialist realistic]] style, as well as [[Art Deco]] style. The worker holds aloft a hammer and the [[kolkhoz]] woman a sickle to form the [[hammer and sickle]] symbol.&lt;ref name="overy260"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Paris-expo-1937-pavillon de l'URSS-13.jpg|thumb|upright|1937 Expo pavilion in Paris]]
The sculpture was originally created to crown the Soviet pavilion of the World's Fair.&lt;ref name="overy260"/&gt;  The organizers had placed the Soviet and German pavilions facing each other across the main pedestrian boulevard at the [[Trocadéro]] on the north bank of the Seine.&lt;ref name="overy260"/&gt;

Mukhina was inspired by her study of the classical ''[[Harmodius and Aristogeiton (sculpture)|Harmodius and Aristogeiton]]'', the ''[[Victory of Samothrace]]'' and ''[[La Marseillaise]]'', [[François Rude]]'s sculptural group for the [[Arc de Triomphe]],&lt;ref name="Power 1995"&gt;''Art and Power: Europe under the dictators'', 1995, {{ISBN|1-85332-148-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; to bring a monumental composition of socialist realist confidence to the heart of Paris. The symbolism of the two figures striding from West to East, as determined by the layout of the pavilion, was also not lost on the spectators.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Totalitarian Art'', Golomstock, 1990 {{ISBN|0-00-272169-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukhina said that her sculpture was intended "to continue the idea inherent in the building, and this sculpture was to be an inseparable part of the whole structure",&lt;ref&gt;''Arkhitekturnaya gazeta'', 28 February 1938&lt;/ref&gt; but after the fair, the ''Rabochiy i Kolkhoznitsa'' was relocated to [[Moscow]] where it was placed just outside the [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre]].

In 1941, the sculpture earned Mukhina one of the initial batch of [[Stalin Prize]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The sculpture was removed for restoration in autumn of 2003 in preparation for [[Expo 2010]]. The original plan was for it to return in 2005, but because the [[World's Fair]] was not awarded to [[Moscow]] but to [[Shanghai]], the restoration process was hampered by financial problems and re-installation was delayed. See photographs of the disassembled statue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080427093215/http://community.livejournal.com/ru_sovarch/175556.html webarchive community.livejournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

It finally returned to its place at [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre|VDNKh]] on November 28, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091128/157018323.html |title=Moscow reinstalls landmark Soviet statue &amp;#124; Russia &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=2009-11-28 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revealing of the restored monument was held on the evening of December 4, 2009, accompanied by fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/Art_and_Fun/2009-12-04/second-life-socialist-monument.html |title=Second life of great Socialist monument — RT |publisher=Rt.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213020355/http://rt.com/Art_and_Fun/2009-12-04/second-life-socialist-monument.html |archivedate=2009-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The restored statue uses a new pavilion as its pedestal, increasing its total height from 34.5 meters (the old pedestal was 10 meters tall) to 60 meters (the new pavilion is 34.5 meters tall plus 24.5 meters of the statue's own height).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Use in media==
In Soviet cinema, the sculpture was chosen in 1947 to serve as the logo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ytfiles.com/2009/12/10/worker-and-kolkhoz-woman-a-soviet-era-monument-finds-its-way-back-into-moscows-landscape/&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[film studio]] [[Mosfilm]]. It can be seen in the opening credits of the film ''[[Red Heat (1988 film)|Red Heat]]'', as well as many of the Russian films released by the [[Mosfilm]] studio itself.

A giant moving reproduction of the statue was featured in the [[2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Olympics Opening Ceremony Offers Fanfare for a Reinvented Russia| work = The New York Times| date = 7 February 2014| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/sports/olympics/russia-opens-sochi-games-with-pageantry-and-pride.html?_r=0| accessdate = 2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Sochi 2014 in five pictures| work = beranger.org| date = 7 February 2014| url = http://beranger.org/2014/02/07/sochi-2014-in-five-pictures/| accessdate = 2009-02-09| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140209212605/http://beranger.org/2014/02/07/sochi-2014-in-five-pictures/| archivedate = 9 February 2014| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; symbolizing post-World War II Soviet society, particularly in Moscow.
