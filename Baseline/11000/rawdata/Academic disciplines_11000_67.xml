'''Aberrant decoding''' or '''aberrant reading''' is a concept used in fields such as [[communication studies|communication]] and [[media studies]], [[semiotics]], and [[journalism]] about how messages can be interpreted differently from what was intended by their sender. The concept was proposed by [[Umberto Eco]] in an article published first in 1965 in [[Italian language|Italian]] and in 1972 in English.&lt;ref name=Eco1972&gt;{{cite paper|last=Eco|first=Umberto|others=trans. Paola Splendore|journal=Working Papers in Cultural Studies|title=Towards a Semiotic Inquiry Into the Television Message|year=1972|volume=3|pages=103–21|publisher=University of Birmingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Every [[communication]] act requires that the messages must be [[Encode (semiotics)|encoded]] into a set of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] by the sender. These signs must then be transmitted and [[Decode (semiotics)|decoded]] by the receiver to understand the contained messages. The [[Code|code system]] must be shared by both the sender and the receiver in order for the communication to succeed. For example, thoughts must be encoded into words, transmitted through air, and then be decoded back to thoughts. Often the sender has a certain meaning to convey with his message, hoping the receiver will interpret it correctly. This right interpretation can be called the ''preferred decoding'' or ''preferred reading''. When the interpretation of the message is different from what was intended, this can be called ''aberrant decoding''.&lt;ref name=Fiske1990&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=John|title=Introduction to Communication Studies|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415046725|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberrant decodings can occur in a more widespread range of situations, as wrong interpretation of a media product or text whose incoming message is not the one intended by the creator of the product or text.&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eco, aberrant decodings were rare in [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]], when most communication occurred between people who shared the same [[culture]]. He lists four classes of exceptions where aberrant decodings could have happened:&lt;ref name=Hartley2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartley|first=John|title=Communication, Cultural and Media Studies: The key concepts|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415268899|edition=3rd|author2=Rennie, Elinor|author3= Brennan, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*People who did not share the same language.
*People trying to interpret the meanings of past cultures. For example, [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] people looking at [[Roman art]].
*People who did not share the same [[belief system]]. For example, [[Christian]]s looking at [[Paganism|pagan]] art.
*People who came from different cultures. For example, white [[Europeans]] looking at [[Aboriginal art]].

Eco continues that in contemporary media, instead of being exceptions, aberrant decodings have become the norm. For example, TV broadcasters know beforehand that their messages will be interpreted in various ways. He speculated that because of this freedom of interpretation, the power of media over individuals might be much less influential than is thought.&lt;ref name="Hartley2002" /&gt;

This idea of examining the messages contained in the media and how the audience interprets them has since become one of the core concepts of academic media research. Eco's article influenced, among others, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]'s [[Hall's Theory|encoding/decoding theory]].&lt;ref name="Hartley2002" /&gt;

[[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] has argued that aberrant decoding occurs mainly with [[Iconography|iconic codes]], referring to visual messages.&lt;ref name="Fiske1990" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Iconic codes'' or ''iconic signs'' in semiotics and communication theory could also refer to a [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs|class of signs]] defined by [[iconicity]] (as in [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]'s triadic sign theory). But in this case Fiske contrasts iconic signs with "verbal language" (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, he explains how prehistoric cave paintings of animals are often seen as graceful and moving. However, in 1960 [[M. L. J. Abercrombie|Margaret Abercrombie]]&lt;ref name=Abercrombie1960&gt;{{cite book|last=Abercrombie|first=Margaret|title=The Anatomy of Judgement: An Investigation into the Processes of Perception and Reasoning|year=1960|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|isbn=978-1299246812}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the paintings are, in fact, depictions of dead animals. Thus if we accept Abercrombie's claim, we can argue that our modern culture, where we value living animals and only rarely encounter dead ones, has led us to aberrant decoding of the paintings.

'''Active sound design''' (ASD) is an automotive audio application in which the car engine's sound is generated based on various engine parameters like speed and throttle input. This technology is implemented in [[BMW M5]] and [[Renault Clio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoblog.com/2011/09/23/active-sound-design-enhances-v8-burble-inside-bmw-m5/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6487">This ''Law'' or ''Rule'' was formulated by [[Henry Alford]] (1810-1871) as a rule of biblical interpretation. It appeared in his monumental multi-volume work completed in 1861, ''The Greek Testament'', which is still consulted today. He presented this rule as follows with specific reference to the first resurrection in Rev. 20:4–6:

:“If, in a passage where two resurrections are mentioned, where certain "souls lived" at the first, and the rest of the "dead lived" only at the end of a specified period after that first, - if in such a passage the first [[resurrection]] may be understood to mean spiritual rising with [[Christ]], while the second means literal rising from the grave; then there is an end of all significance in language, and Scripture is wiped out as a definite testimony to anything. If the first resurrection is spiritual, then so is the second, which I suppose none will be hardy enough to maintain. But if the second is literal, then so is the first, which in common with the whole [[Early Christianity|primitive Church]] and many of the best modern expositors, I do maintain, and receive as an article of faith and hope.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Alford, ''The Greek Testament'', 4 volume ed., Vol. IV, s.v. Rev. 20:5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Eldon Ladd]] refers to this Law and cites the quote above in support of his position on [[Historic Premillennialism]] and the interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]] chapter 20. Ladd writes:

:"Natural inductive [[exegesis]] suggests that both words are to be taken in the same way, referring to [[Resurrection of the dead|literal resurrection]]. We can do no better than to repeat the oft-quoted words of Henry Alford ..."&lt;ref&gt;George Eldon Ladd, "Historic Premillennialism", in The Meaning of the Millennium: Four Views, ed. Robert G. Clouse (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1977), pp. 37–38. Note: Ladd documents his citation as from a printing of Alford's work by Lee and Shephard, Boston, 1872, IV:732 (cp. Ladd, p. 214, note 10).&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief form of the quote from Alford above may also be found in works by Alva J. McClain,&lt;ref&gt;''The Greatness of the Kingdom: An Inductive Study of the Kingdom of God'' (Winona Lake, IN: BMH Books, 1959), p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Seiss]],&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Seiss, ''The Apocalypse: Lectures on the Book of Revelation'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan Publishing House, n.d., 4th reprint ed. 1962), pp. 461, 464.&lt;/ref&gt; and J. Barton Payne.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Biblical Prophecy'' (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1980), p. 618, s.v. Prediction 32.&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthier citation including the statement above is found in the works of [[William Eugene Blackstone]],&lt;ref&gt;W. E. B., ''Jesus Is Coming'' (Old Tappan, NJ: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1898, 1908, 1932), pp. 58–59. Blackstone documents this quote as from Alford's 2nd ed. (London: Rivington's, 1854), IV:726.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George N. H. Peters]]:&lt;ref&gt;''The Theocratic Kingdom'', 3 vols. (Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1952), II:291. Peters also referenced Alford's statement at II:281, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It will have been long ago anticipated by the readers of this commentary, that I cannot consent to distort its words from their plain sense and chronological place in the prophecy, on account of any considerations of difficulty, or any risk of abuses which the doctrine of the Millennium may bring with it. Those who lived next to the Apostles, and the whole Church for three hundred years, understood them in the plain literal sense; and it is a strange sight in these days to see expositors who are among the first in reverence of antiquity, complacently casting aside the most cogent instance of unanimity which primitive antiquity presents. As regards the text itself, no legitimate treatment of it will extort what is known as the spiritual interpretation now in fashion. If, in a passage where ''two resurrections'' are mentioned, where certain ''souls came to life'' at the first, and the rest of the ''dead came to life'' only at the end of a specified period after the first [v. 5a]—if in such a passage the first resurrection may be understood to mean ''spiritual'' rising with Christ, while the second means ''literal'' rising from the grave—then there is an end of all significance in language, and Scripture is wiped out as a definite testimony to anything. If the first resurrection is spiritual, then so is the second, which I suppose no one will be hardy enough to maintain. But if the second is literal, then so is the first, which in common with the primitive church and many of the best modern expositors, I do maintain and receive as an article of faith and hope."

[[Wayne Grudem]] cites the rule only to discredit it:

:"There is no fixed rule in any [[language]] that when a word is used twice in close succession it ''must'' be used in the same sense both times. It is best simply to choose from the possible senses the one that best fits the context in each case."&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Grudem, ''1 Peter'', Vol. 17 in the ''Tyndale New Testament Commentaries'' (Grand Rapids: [[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]], 1988), p. 171, s.v. 1 Pet. 4:6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] has been cited concerning Alford as follows:

:“When I’m stumped with a ... [[grammar|grammatical]] or [[syntax|syntactical]] or logical [question] in [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], I go to Henry Alford. Henry Alford ... comes closer more consistently than any other commentator to asking my kinds of questions.”&lt;ref&gt;John Piper, "The Chief Design of My Life: Mortification and Universal Holiness, Reflections on the Life and Thought of John Owen", presented January 25, 1994 at the annual Bethlehem Conference for Pastors, s.v. the "Question and Answer" session from 1:30:11–1:30:31.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5129">The '''American Association for the Promotion of Social Science''' (est.1865) was founded in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], by several high-profile academics. Officers in the first years of the society included [[William Barton Rogers|William B. Rogers]], [[Thomas Hill (clergyman)|Thomas Hill]], [[George S. Boutwell]], [[Francis Lieber]], [[Erastus Otis Haven|Erastus O. Haven]], Mary Eliot Parkman, David A. Wells, [[Emory Washburn]], [[Caroline Healey Dall]], [[Samuel Eliot]], [[Franklin Benjamin Sanborn|F. B. Sanborn]], Joseph White, George Walker, Theodore W. Dwight, and James J. Higginson.&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite book |title=Constitution, address, and list of members of the American Association for the Promotion of Social Science, with the questions proposed for discussion: to which are added minutes of the transactions of the association |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1866 |publisher=Wright &amp; Potter |location=Boston |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By3zZYNsZlIC |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 the group intended "to aid the development of social science, and to guide the public mind to the best practical means of promoting the amendment of laws, the advancement of education, the prevention and repression of crime, the reformation of criminals, and the progress of public morality, the adoption of sanitary regulations, and the diffusion of sound principles on questions of economy, trade, and finance. It will give attention to pauperism, and the topics related thereto ; including the responsibility of the well-endowed and successful, the wise and educated, the honest and respectable, for the failures of others. It will aim to bring together the various societies and individuals now interested in these objects, for the purpose of obtaining by discussion the real elements of truth; by which doubts are removed, conflicting opinions harmonized, and a common ground afforded for treating wisely the great social problems of the day."&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt;

The society divided itself into departments of inquiry (education; health; jurisprudence; economy, trade and finance) and laid out research questions to guide collection of the most pertinent "data required." The questions proposed for research reflected key issues of the time in American society: national debt and a national currency; taxation and revenue; labor and capital; hasty and excessive legislation; crime and punishment; the province of law in regard to education, public  health, and social morals; education of neglected and vicious children; relative value of classical and scientific instruction in schools and colleges; fine arts in education and industry; half-time system of instruction; quarantine considered in its relation to cholera; the tenement house; inspection of food and drugs; pork as an article of food; sewerage of great cities; and management of hospitals and insane asylums."&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt;

Meetings took place in Boston at the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] (Oct. 1865) and the [[Lowell Institute]] (Dec. 1865);&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt; and in New York at the YMCA on 5th Ave. (Nov. 1867).&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Nov. 20, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 the group joined with the "Boston Social Science Association" to form a joint committee called the "[[American Social Science Association]]" (ASSA);&lt;ref name="constitution" /&gt; the committee met in Boston's [[Old City Hall (Boston)|city hall]] to discuss school reform and other matters.  "The first annual meeting of the ASSA ... was ... held [in] 1868."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Lepawsky. The Politics of Epistemology. Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 17, No. 3, Supplement (Sep., 1964); L. L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60811">'''Artificial general intelligence''' ('''AGI''') is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a [[human]] being can. It is a primary goal of some [[artificial intelligence]] research and a common topic in [[science fiction]] and [[Futures studies|future studies]]. Artificial general intelligence is also referred to as "'''strong AI'''",&lt;ref name="K"&gt;{{Harv|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} or see [http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html Advanced Human Intelligence] where he defines strong AI as "machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence."&lt;/ref&gt; "'''full AI'''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-Age-of-Artificial-Intellige The Age of Artificial Intelligence: George John at TEDxLondonBusinessSchool 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; or as the ability of a machine to perform "general intelligent action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976}}. This is the term they use for "human-level" intelligence in the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic sources reserve "strong AI" to refer to machines capable of experiencing [[Chinese room#Strong AI|consciousness]].

Some references emphasize a distinction between strong AI and "applied AI"&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-219086/artificial-intelligence Strong AI, applied AI, and cognitive simulation] or Jack Copeland [http://www.cs.usfca.edu/www.AlanTuring.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/what_is_AI/What%20is%20AI02.html What is artificial intelligence?] on AlanTuring.net&lt;/ref&gt; (also called "narrow AI"&lt;ref name=K/&gt; or "[[weak AI]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open2.net/nextbigthing/ai/ai_in_depth/in_depth.htm The Open University on Strong and Weak AI]&lt;/ref&gt;): the use of software to study or accomplish specific [[problem solving]] or [[reason]]ing tasks. Weak AI, in contrast to strong AI, does not attempt to perform the full range of human [[cognitive]] abilities.

As of 2017, over forty organizations worldwide are doing active research on AGI.&lt;ref name=baum/&gt;

Various criteria for [[intelligence]] have been proposed (most famously the [[Turing test]]) but to date, there is no definition that satisfies everyone.&lt;ref&gt;AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] writes: "we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent." {{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/node1.html |title=Basic Questions| last=McCarthy |first=John| authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist)| publisher=[[Stanford University]]| year=2007}} (For a discussion of some definitions of intelligence used by [[artificial intelligence]] researchers, see [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]].)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there ''is'' wide agreement among artificial intelligence researchers that intelligence is required to do the following:&lt;ref&gt;
This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by major AI textbooks, including:
{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},
{{Harvnb|Luger|Stubblefield|2004}},
{{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998}} and
{{Harvnb|Nilsson|1998}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[automated reasoning|reason]], use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgments under [[uncertainty]];
* [[knowledge representation|represent knowledge]], including [[Commonsense knowledge base|commonsense knowledge]];
* [[automated planning and scheduling|plan]];
* [[machine learning|learn]];
* communicate in [[natural language processing|natural language]];
* and integrate all these skills towards common goals.

Other important capabilities include the ability to [[machine perception|sense]] (e.g. [[computer vision|see]]) and the ability to act (e.g. [[robotics|move and manipulate objects]]) in the world where intelligent behaviour is to be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeifer, R. and Bongard J. C., How the body shapes the way we think: a new view of intelligence (The MIT Press, 2007). {{ISBN|0-262-16239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would include an ability to detect and respond to [[hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = R.

Computer based systems that exhibit many of these capabilities do exist (e.g. see [[computational creativity]], [[automated reasoning]], [[decision support system]], [[robot]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[intelligent agent]]), but not yet at human levels.

;[[Turing test|The Turing Test]] ([[Alan Turing|''Turing'']])
: A machine and a human both converse sight unseen with a second human, who must evaluate which of the two is the machine, which passes the test if it can fool the evaluator a significant fraction of the time. Note: Turing does not prescribe what should qualify as intelligence, only that knowing that it is a machine should not disqualify it.

== Problems requiring AGI to solve ==
{{Main|AI-complete}}

The most difficult problems for computers are informally known as "AI-complete" or "AI-hard", implying that solving them is equivalent to the general aptitude of human intelligence, or strong AI, beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm.&lt;ref name="Shapiro92"&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks".)&lt;/ref&gt;

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include general [[computer vision]], [[natural language understanding]], and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.&lt;ref&gt;Roman V. Yampolskiy. Turing Test as a Defining Feature of AI-Completeness. In Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation and Metaheuristics (AIECM) --In the footsteps of Alan Turing. Xin-She Yang (Ed.). pp. 3–17. (Chapter 1). Springer, London. 2013. http://cecs.louisville.edu/ry/TuringTestasaDefiningFeature04270003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

AI-complete problems cannot be solved with current computer technology alone, and also require [[human computation]].  This property can be useful to test for the presence of humans, as with [[CAPTCHA]]s, and for [[computer security]] to repel [[brute-force attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper, and John Langford. [http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security]. In Proceedings of Eurocrypt, Vol. 2656 (2003), pp. 294–311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Richard | last = Bergmair | title = Natural Language Steganography and an "AI-complete" Security Primitive | citeseerx = 10.1.1.105.129 | date = January 7, 2006 }} (unpublished?)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical AI ==
{{Main|History of artificial intelligence}}
Modern AI research began in the mid 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of AI researchers was convinced that artificial general intelligence was possible and that it would exist in just a few decades. As AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simon|1965|p=96}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their predictions were the inspiration for [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s character [[HAL 9000]], who accurately embodied what AI researchers believed they could create by the year 2001. Of note is the fact that AI pioneer [[Marvin Minsky]] was a consultant&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/Hal/chap2/two1.html Scientist on the Set: An Interview with Marvin Minsky]&lt;/ref&gt; on the project of making HAL 9000 as realistic as possible according to the consensus predictions of the time; Crevier quotes him as having said on the subject in 1967, "Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved,"&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Minsky to {{Harvtxt|Darrach|1970}}, quoted in {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although Minsky states that he was misquoted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. Funding agencies became skeptical of AGI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful "applied AI".&lt;ref&gt;The [[Lighthill report]] specifically criticized AI's "grandiose objectives" and led the dismantling of AI research in England. ({{Harvnb|Lighthill|1973}}; {{Harvnb|Howe|1994}}) In the U.S., [[DARPA]] became determined to fund only "mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research". See {{Harv|NRC|1999}} under "Shift to Applied Research Increases Investment". See also {{Harv|Crevier|1993|pp=115–117}} and {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1980s began, Japan's [[Fifth Generation Computer]] Project revived interest in AGI, setting out a ten-year timeline that included AGI goals like "carry on a casual conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=211}}, {{harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=24}} and see also {{Harvnb|Feigenbaum|McCorduck|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this and the success of [[expert systems]], both industry and government pumped money back into the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier| 1993|pp=161–162,197–203,240}}; {{harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=25}}; {{harvnb|NRC|1999|loc=under "Shift to Applied Research Increases Investment"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, confidence in AI spectacularly collapsed in the late 1980s, and the goals of the Fifth Generation Computer Project were never fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=209–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second time in 20 years, AI researchers who had predicted the imminent achievement of AGI had been shown to be fundamentally mistaken. By the 1990s, AI researchers had gained a reputation for making vain promises. They became reluctant to make predictions at all&lt;ref&gt;As AI founder [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] writes "it would be a great relief to the rest of the workers in AI if the inventors of new general formalisms would express their hopes in a more guarded form than has sometimes been the case." {{cite web| url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/reviews/lighthill/lighthill.html | title=Reply to Lighthill | last=McCarthy | first=John | authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist) | publisher=Stanford University |year=2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and to avoid any mention of "human level" artificial intelligence for fear of being labeled "wild-eyed dreamer[s]."&lt;ref&gt;"At its low point, some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers."{{cite news |first=John |last=Markoff |title=Behind Artificial Intelligence, a Squadron of Bright Real People |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/14/technology/14artificial.html?ei=5070&amp;en=11ab55edb7cead5e&amp;ex=1185940800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1185805173-o7WsfW7qaP0x5/NUs1cQCQ |work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-10-14 |accessdate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current narrow AI research==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence}}

In the 1990s and early 21st century, mainstream AI has achieved far greater commercial success and academic respectability by focusing on specific sub-problems where they can produce verifiable results and commercial applications, such as [[artificial neural networks]], [[computer vision]] or [[data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "applied AI" systems are now used extensively throughout the technology industry, and research in this vein is very heavily funded in both academia and industry.

Most mainstream AI researchers hope that strong AI can be developed by combining the programs that solve various sub-problems using an integrated [[agent architecture]], [[cognitive architecture]] or [[subsumption architecture]]. [[Hans Moravec]] wrote in 1988: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I am confident that this bottom-up route to artificial intelligence will one day meet the traditional top-down route more than half way, ready to provide the real world competence and the [[Commonsense knowledge base|commonsense knowledge]] that has been so frustratingly elusive in reasoning programs. Fully intelligent machines will result when the metaphorical [[golden spike]] is driven uniting the two efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even this fundamental philosophy has been disputed; for example, Stevan Harnad of Princeton concluded his 1990 paper on the [[Symbol grounding problem|Symbol Grounding Hypothesis]] by stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The expectation has often been voiced that "top-down" (symbolic) approaches to modeling cognition will somehow meet "bottom-up" (sensory) approaches somewhere in between. If the grounding considerations in this paper are valid, then this expectation is hopelessly modular and there is really only one viable route from sense to symbols: from the ground up. A free-floating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route (or vice versa) – nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level, since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings (thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harnad | first1 = S | year = 1990 | title = The Symbol Grounding Problem | url = | journal = Physica D | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 335–346 | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6| bibcode = 1990PhyD...42..335H | arxiv = cs/9906002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Artificial general intelligence research==
Artificial general intelligence{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} (AGI) describes research that aims to create machines capable of general intelligent action. The term was introduced by Mark Gubrud in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gubrud|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a discussion of the implications of fully automated military production and operations.  The research objective is much older, for example [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]] project (that began in 1984), and [[Allen Newell]]'s [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] project are regarded as within the scope of AGI. AGI research activity in 2006 was described by Pei Wang and [[Ben Goertzel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goertzel|Wang|2006}}. See also {{harvtxt|Wang|2006}} with an up-to-date summary and lots of links.&lt;/ref&gt; as "producing publications and preliminary results". As yet, most AI researchers have devoted little attention to AGI, with some claiming that intelligence is too complex to be completely replicated in the near term. However, a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research, and many of this group are contributing to a series of [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence|AGI conferences]]. The research is extremely diverse and often pioneering in nature. In the introduction to his book,{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century, but the consensus in the AGI research community seems to be that the timeline discussed by [[Ray Kurzweil]] in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''&lt;ref name=K/&gt; (i.e. between 2015 and 2045) is plausible.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Most mainstream AI researchers doubt that progress will be this rapid.{{citation_needed|date=January 2017}} Organizations explicitly pursuing AGI include the Swiss AI lab [[IDSIA]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nnaisense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=When A.I.

A 2017 survey of AGI categorized forty-five known "active R&amp;D projects" that explicitly or implicitly (through published research) research AGI, with the largest three being [[DeepMind]], the Human Brain Project, and OpenAI.&lt;ref name=baum&gt;Baum, Seth. "A Survey of Artificial General Intelligence Projects for Ethics, Risk, and Policy." (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing power needed to simulate a brain ==

===Whole brain emulation===
{{main|Mind uploading}}
A popular approach discussed to achieving general intelligent action is [[whole brain emulation]]. A low-level brain model is built by [[brain scanning|scanning]] and [[Brain mapping|mapping]] a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer runs a [[computer simulation|simulation]] model so faithful to the original that it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishably.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;
{{Harvnb|Sandberg|Boström|2008}}. "The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain."&lt;/ref&gt; Whole brain emulation is discussed in [[computational neuroscience]] and [[neuroinformatics]], in the context of [[brain simulation]] for medical research purposes. It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''&lt;ref name=K/&gt; predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.

===Early estimates ===
[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.1 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Boström|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to 5×10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997 Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; computations per second (cps).&lt;ref&gt;In "Mind Children" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cps is used. More recently, in 1997, &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}&gt; Moravec argued for 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not "cps", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, if a "computation" was equivalent to one "[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]" –  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s – then 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; "computations" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.

===Modelling the neurons in more detail===
The [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently only understood in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Discover2011JanFeb"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia—the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan–Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current research===
There are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures. The [[Artificial Intelligence System]] project implemented non-real time simulations of a "brain" (with 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) in 2005. It took 50 days on a cluster of 27 processors to simulate 1 second of a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Izhikevich |first=Eugene M. |last2=Edelman |first2=Gerald M. |date=March 4, 2008 |title=Large-scale model of mammalian thalamocortical systems |url=http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/publications/large-scale_model_of_human_brain.pdf |journal=PNAS |publisher= |volume=105 |issue=9 |pages=3593–3598 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0712231105|access-date=23 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612095651/http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/publications/large-scale_model_of_human_brain.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2009 |pmid=18292226 |pmc=2265160|bibcode=2008PNAS..105.3593I }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blue Brain]] project used one of the fastest supercomputer architectures in the world, [[IBM]]'s [[Blue Gene]] platform, to create a real time simulation of a single rat [[Neocortex|neocortical column]] consisting of approximately 10,000 neurons and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; synapses in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/Jahia/site/bluebrain/op/edit/pid/19085|title=Project Milestones|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer term goal is to build a detailed, functional simulation of the physiological processes in the human brain: "It is not impossible to build a human brain and we can do it in 10 years," [[Henry Markram]], director of the Blue Brain Project said in 2009 at the [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8164060.stm Artificial brain '10 years away' 2009 BBC news]&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been controversial claims to have simulated a [[cat intelligence#Computer simulation of the cat brain|cat brain]]. Neuro-silicon interfaces have been proposed as an alternative implementation strategy that may scale better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/10343 University of Calgary news], [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12037941/ MSNBC news]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Moravec]] addressed the above arguments ("brains are more complicated", "neurons have to be modeled in more detail") in his 1997 paper "When will computer hardware match the human brain?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He measured the ability of existing software to simulate the functionality of neural tissue, specifically the retina.  His results do not depend on the number of glial cells, nor on what kinds of processing neurons perform where.

===Complications and criticisms of AI approaches based on simulation===
A fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree&lt;/ref&gt; If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body). Goertzel{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} proposes virtual embodiment (like [[Second Life]]), but it is not yet known whether this would be sufficient.

Desktop computers using microprocessors capable of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cps (Kurzweil's non-standard unit "computations per second", see above) have been available since 2005. According to the brain power estimates used by Kurzweil (and Moravec), this computer should be capable of supporting a simulation of a bee brain, but despite some interest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setiai.com/archives/cat_honey_bee_brain.html some links to bee brain studies]&lt;/ref&gt; no such simulation exists {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. There are at least three reasons for this:
* Firstly, the neuron model seems to be oversimplified (see next section).
* Secondly, there is insufficient understanding of higher cognitive processes{{refn|In Goertzels' AGI book ([[#CITEREFYudkowsky2006|Yudkowsky 2006]]), Yudkowsky proposes 5 levels of organisation that must be understood – code/data, sensory modality, concept &amp; category, thought, and deliberation (consciousness) – in order to use the available hardware}} to establish accurately what the brain's neural activity, observed using techniques such as [[Neuroimaging#Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance imaging]], correlates with.
* Thirdly, even if our understanding of cognition advances sufficiently, early simulation programs are likely to be very inefficient and will, therefore, need considerably more hardware.
* Fourthly, the brain of an organism, while critical, may not be an appropriate boundary for a cognitive model.  To simulate a bee brain, it may be necessary to simulate the body, and the environment. [[The Extended Mind]] thesis formalizes the philosophical concept, and research into [[Cephalopoda|cephalopods]] has demonstrated clear examples of a decentralized system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15829594 | doi=10.1152/jn.00684.2004 | volume=94 | issue=2 | title=Dynamic model of the octopus arm.

In addition, the scale of the human brain is not currently well-constrained.

==Artificial consciousness research==
{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}

Although the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].

==Relationship to "strong AI"==
{{See also|philosophy of artificial intelligence|Chinese room}}

In 1980, philosopher [[John Searle]] coined the term "strong AI" as part of his [[Chinese room]] argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to distinguish between two different hypotheses about artificial intelligence:&lt;ref&gt;As defined in a standard AI textbook: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis." {{Harv|Russell|Norvig|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An artificial intelligence system can ''think'' and have a ''mind''.  (The word "mind" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in "the [[mind body problem]]" or "the [[philosophy of mind]]".)
* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.
The first one is called "the ''strong'' AI hypothesis" and the second is "the ''weak'' AI hypothesis" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the "strong AI hypothesis" as "strong AI". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;For example:
* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},
* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] (quoted in "High Beam Encyclopedia"),
* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] (quoted in "AITopics")
* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math]
* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] Anthony Tongen
&lt;/ref&gt;

The weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], "Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis."{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}

In contrast to Searle, Kurzweil uses the term "strong AI" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,&lt;ref name=K/&gt; regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.

==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==
{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}

Since the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}

While most AI researchers believe that strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] that deny the possibility of achieving AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}

Conceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: "the framework starts from Weizenbaum’s observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}

Furthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do {{Examples|date=September 2017}}.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem that is described by David Gelernter is that some people assume that thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}

The problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}

Other possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain into a computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously can people then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}

Clocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}

The practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}

A possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.

There have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, "No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion."{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.

==Consciousness==
There are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:
* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it "feels like" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask "what does it feel like to be a bat?" However, we are unlikely to ask "what does it feel like to be a toaster?" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.
* [[sentience]]: The ability to "feel" perceptions or emotions subjectively.
* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.
These traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. Also, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | magazine=Wired |date=April 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.

In science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to philosopher [[John Searle]], it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. "Strong AI" (as defined above by [[Ray Kurzweil]]) should not be confused with Searle's "'[[strong AI hypothesis]]". The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.

==Controversies and dangers==

===Feasibility===
{{expand section|date=February 2016}}
Opinions vary both on ''whether'' and ''when'' artificial general intelligence will arrive. At one extreme, AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". However, this prediction failed to come true. Microsoft co-founder [[Paul Allen]] believed that such intelligence is unlikely in the 21st century because it would require "unforeseeable and fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs" and a "scientifically deep understanding of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Paul|title=The Singularity Isn't Near|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in [[The Guardian]], roboticist Alan Winfield claimed the gulf between modern computing and human-level artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical faster-than-light spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winfield|first1=Alan|title=Artificial intelligence will not turn into a Frankenstein's monster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-will-not-become-a-frankensteins-monster-ian-winfield|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI experts' views on the feasibility of AGI wax and wane, and may have seen a resurgence in the 2010s. Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median guess among experts for when they'd be 50% confident AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll, with the mean being 2081. It is also interesting to note 16.5% of the experts answered with "never" when asked the same question but with a 90% confidence instead.&lt;ref name="new yorker doomsday"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Raffi Khatchadourian|title=The Doomsday Invention: Will artificial intelligence bring us utopia or destruction?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, V.

===Potential threat to human existence{{anchor|Risk_of_human_extinction}}===
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}
{{See also|Technological singularity}}

The creation of artificial general intelligence may have repercussions so great and so complex that it may not be possible to forecast what will come afterwards.  Thus the event in the hypothetical future of achieving strong AI is called the [[technological singularity]], because theoretically one cannot see past it.  But this has not stopped philosophers and researchers from guessing what the smart computers or robots of the future may do, including forming a utopia by [[friendly artificial intelligence|being our friends]] or overwhelming us in an [[AI takeover]]. The latter potentiality is particularly disturbing as it poses an [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|existential risk for mankind]].

==== Self-replicating machines ====
Smart computers or robots would be able to design and produce improved versions of themselves. &lt;ref&gt;Hein, Andreas Makoto, and Hélène Condat. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02091 "Can Machines Design? An Artificial General Intelligence Approach."] arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.02091 (2018).&lt;/ref&gt; A growing population of intelligent robots could conceivably out-compete inferior humans in job markets, in business, in science, in politics (pursuing [[robot rights]]), and technologically, sociologically ([[Group mind (science fiction)|by acting as one]]), and militarily.

==== Emergent superintelligence ====
If research into strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software, it would be able to reprogram and improve itself – a feature called "recursive self-improvement". It would then be even better at improving itself, and would probably continue doing so in a rapidly increasing cycle, leading to an [[intelligence explosion]] and the emergence of [[superintelligence]].  Such an intelligence would not have the limitations of human intellect, and might be able to invent or discover almost anything.

Hyper-intelligent software might not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind, and might be extremely difficult to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Yudkowsky, Eliezer|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of [[risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth]].

One proposal to deal with this is to make sure that the first generally intelligent AI is a [[friendly AI]] that would then endeavor to ensure that subsequently developed AIs were also nice to us. But friendly AI is harder to create than plain AGI, and therefore it is likely, in a race between the two, that non-friendly AI would be developed first. Also, there is no guarantee that friendly AI would remain friendly, or that its progeny would also all be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Berglas|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 161 feet long and weighing at 1,450 tons, the Aurora Simulator was the first gamma radiation simulator of its size in the world at the time. It was also one of only four large machines in the United States that were built specifically to test complete nuclear weapons packages, with the other three being the Hermes I to III simulators at [[Sandia Base]], New Mexico. Situated at the [[Harry Diamond Laboratories]] (which later became a part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]]) in Adelphi, Maryland, it was used to test complete weapons electronics packages from the warheads of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)]] to satellites. After more than 20 years of use during the Cold War, the Aurora Simulator was officially decommissioned and disassembled in 1996.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1986, the Aurora facility set the world record for the largest amount of high-power microwave power generated from a virtual cathode oscillator. As a result, HDL was recognized by the [[American Defense Preparedness Association|American Defense Preparedness Association (ADPA)]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8wIcWpgq4wC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=history+of+army+research+lab+aurora&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimr4371OfbAhWRtlkKHSmZA8AQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
Following the use of the [[Atomic Bomb|atomic bomb]] in World War II, studies on flash radiography found that field emission flash x-rays, which were previously used to analyze explosions, could simulate radiation from a nuclear bomb. Given this realization, the U.S. military began to prioritize the development of flash x-ray machines to test parts of missile packages during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

After the Soviet Union demonstrated the use of the world’s first [[Anti-ballistic missile|anti-ballistic missiles (ABM)]] in 1964, DASA launched a series of projects in response that aimed to hasten the advancement of nuclear effects laboratories in the United States. The U.S. military was concerned that the introduction and subsequent nuclear explosion of Soviet AMBs into the airspace would increase the likelihood of the resulting radiation interfering with the electronics systems of inbound U.S. ICBMs. In order to [[Radiation hardening|thoroughly harden]] U.S. missiles, DASA initiated the construction of the Aurora Simulator as well as a full-threat level facility that engaged in gamma radiation testing and missile refinement in 1969.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When selecting the site for the Aurora facility, DASA wanted the gamma radiation simulator to be situated at an existing military laboratory. After much deliberation between the [[Air Force Weapons Laboratory|Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL)]] in New Mexico and the Army and Navy laboratories in the Washington, D.C. area, DASA chose the latter and granted the Harry Diamond Laboratory (HDL) the responsibility of operating the facility. In order to house the Aurora Simulator, HDL moved from its downtown Washington, D.C. site to an area of land in White Oak, Maryland, which would eventually become the now-present Adelphi.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The cooperation between DASA and HDL on the Aurora project led to many HDL researchers becoming involved in the simulator’s development, including assistant to DASA Deputy Director for Science and Technology Peter Haas and former participant in the Manhattan Project Paul Caldwell, who later was placed in charge of the Aurora Simulator. In turn, Caldwell hired physicist Alexander Stewart from Ion Physics (IP) and HDL’s Robert Lamb and Dennis Whittaker, the four of whom (including Caldwell) made up the bulk of the research and development team for the Aurora project. The construction of the Aurora Simulator was completed on January 1971, costing about $16 million, and the first test was conducted on the Spartan ABM flight control set in April 1972. Throughout its entire run at HDL, which ended in 1995, the Aurora Simulator conducted 287 numbered tests, resulting in more than 9,100 test shots.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Operation ==
The Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator consisted of four 14 MV [[Marx generator|Marx generators]], each of which contained four parallel 1.25 MJ units connected together to drive four parallel oil-dielectric [[Blumlein generator|Blumlein pulse-forming lines (PFLs)]]. Each PFL was coupled with an [[Electron-beam processing|E-beam]] diode.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Aurora Simulator emitted four short pulses of high energy bremsstrahlung radiation that overlapped to deliver a single 120 ns wide pulse of 20 to 50 krads (Si) into a 1m cube. It could also deliver 25 krads (Si) throughout a 1m diameter and 1m long cylindrical volume or 50 krads (Si) throughout a 25cm sphere. What made the Aurora Simulator unique was its ability to provide an extremely high volumetric dose output. Due to this large irradiation volume, dose measurements ranged up to 200 locations within a single electronics system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in order to obtain the desired radiation levels, all four 8-MeV, 230-kA bremsstrahlung pulses had to overlay within 10 ns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkel|first=George|last2=Scharf|first2=William|last3=Spohn|first3=Daniel|date=October 1982|title=Use of the AURORA Flash X-Ray Machine as a Source-Region EMP Simulator and Antenna Coupling Analysis Facility|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA122024|journal=Harry Diamond Labs|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; This synchronization was made possible by the symmetrization of the four Blumleins. During active testing, the Aurora Simulator was capable of accommodating as many as 13 test shots in a single day. In comparison, nuclear weapons testing at the [[Nevada Test Site]] was limited to one test shot per three months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There were two main limitations to the operation of the Aurora Simulator. First, the long discharge time of the Blumeins often hindered the extraction of the bremsstrahlung pulses. Second, the high internal impedance of the Blumeins made them rather inefficient for energy transfer to low impedance loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander|last2=Huttlin|first2=George|date=February 1979|title=Design Study for an AURORA Modification Leading to a 100-Terawatt Nuclear Weapon Radiation Simulator|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA071339|journal=Harry Diamond Labs|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics''' (ACPFG) is a research organisation focusing on improving the resistance of [[wheat]] and [[barley]] to hostile [[Natural environment|environmental]] conditions, using functional [[genomics]] technologies.

Scientists at the ACPFG are focusing on stresses that impact [[agriculture in Australia]], including [[drought]], [[Salinity in Australia|salinity]], high or low [[temperatures]] and [[Nitrogen deficiency|mineral deficiencies]] or [[Toxicity|toxicities]]. These stresses, known as [[abiotic stress]]es, are a major cause of [[cereal]] [[crop yield]] and quality loss throughout the [[world]].

The ACPFG was established in December 2002 after being granted $27 million from the [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC), the [[Grains Research and Development Corporation]] (GRDC) and the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian Government]].

It also had support of $30 million from the [[University of Adelaide]], [[The University of Melbourne]], the Victorian Department of Primary Industries and the [[University of Queensland]].

ACPFG as a research organisation has an unusual structure because it is a [[company]], but its [[shareholders]] are the research organisations and governments that fund it.

In the second funding cycle the [[University of South Australia]] became a shareholder, increasing ACPFG’s focus on [[bioinformatics]], which is the focus of ACPFG researchers in [[University of Queensland|Queensland]].

Most ACPFG researchers are based on the [[University of Adelaide#Waite|University of Adelaide’s Waite Campus]] in the Plant Genomics Centre.

As well as the core research programs focused on [[abiotic stress|environmental stresses]], ACPFG researchers work with other organisations including [[CSIRO]] and the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]], on nutritional focuses such as [[beta-glucan]] and [[iron]] [[biofortification]].

Though research outcomes are focused on [[wheat]] and [[barley]] for Australian farmers, [[model species]] such as [[Arabidopsis thaliana|arabidopsis]] and [[rice]] are often used in ACPFG research. Researchers also explore the [[genetic diversity]] of less [[Plant breeding|commercially viable]] plant [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], such as those originating from the [[fertile crescent]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8640">[[Image:Collimator2.svg|thumb|In the lower picture, the light has been collimated.]]
A '''collimated beam''' of [[light]] has parallel [[ray (optics)|rays]], and therefore will spread minimally as it propagates. A perfectly collimated [[light beam]], with no [[beam divergence|divergence]], would not disperse with distance. Such a beam cannot be created, due to [[diffraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://file.lasersaur.com/docs-thirdparty/Lasers.pdf |title=Melles Griot Catalog |chapter=Introduction to Laser Technology |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--&gt; |page=36.6 |date=n.d. |publisher=Melles Griot |access-date=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light can be approximately collimated by a number of processes, for instance by means of a [[collimator]]. Perfectly collimated light is sometimes said to be ''focused at infinity''. Thus, as the distance from a point source increases, the spherical [[wavefront]]s become flatter and closer to [[plane wave]]s, which are perfectly collimated.

==Etymology==
The word "collimate" comes from the [[Latin]] verb ''collimare'', which originated in a misreading of ''collineare'', "to direct in a straight line".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|first=Charlton T. |last=Lewis|first2=Charles|last2=Short|location=Oxford; Medford|publisher=Clarendon Press; Perseus Digital Library|year=2010|origyear=1879|title=collimo|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=collimo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
===Lasers===
[[Laser]] light from gas or crystal lasers is highly collimated because it is formed in an [[optical cavity]] between two parallel [[mirror]]s which constrain the light to a path perpendicular to the surfaces of the mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldoflasers.com/laserproperties.htm |title=Properties of Lasers |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=World of Lasers |publisher=World of Lasers |access-date=5 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, gas lasers can use concave mirrors, flat mirrors, or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joshi |date=2010 |title=Engineering Physics |publisher=[[Tata McGraw-Hill Education]] |page=517 |isbn=9780070704770 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Engineering Physics 1: For WBUT |location=India |publisher=Pearson Education India |pages=3–9 |date=n.d. |isbn=9788131755938 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=Paul |date=1992 |title=Elementary Modern Physics |publisher=MacMillan |page=149 |isbn=9780879015695 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The divergence of high-quality laser beams is commonly less than 1 [[milliradian]], and can be much less for large-diameter beams. [[Laser diode]]s emit less-collimated light due to their short cavity, and therefore higher collimation requires a collimating lens.

===Synchrotron light===
[[Synchrotron light]] is very well collimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winick |first=Herman |last2=Doniach |first2=S |date=2012 |title=Synchrotron Radiation Research |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |page=567 |isbn=9781461579984 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by bending relativistic electrons (i.e. those moving at [[Special relativity|relativistic]] speeds) around a circular track. When the electrons are at relativistic speeds, the resulting radiation is highly collimated, a result which does not occur at lower speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mobilio |first=Settimio |last2=Boscherini |first2=Federico |last3=Meneghini |first3=Carlo |date=2014 |title=Synchrotron Radiation: Basics, Methods, and Applications |publisher=Springer |page=31 |isbn=9783642553158 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 August 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distant sources===
The light from [[star]]s (other than the [[Sun]]) arrives at Earth precisely collimated, because stars are so far away they present no detectable angular size. However, due to refraction and turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, starlight arrives slightly uncollimated at the ground with an [[astronomical seeing|apparent angular diameter of about 0.4 arcseconds]]. Direct rays of light from the Sun arrive at the Earth uncollimated by one-half degree, this being the [[angular diameter]] of the Sun as seen from Earth.  During a [[solar eclipse]], the Sun's light becomes increasingly collimated as the visible surface shrinks to a thin crescent and ultimately a [[Baily's beads|small point]], producing the phenomena of distinct shadows and [[shadow bands]].

===Lenses and mirrors===
[[Image:CollimatingLensSVG.svg|thumb|150px|right|An example of an optical collimating lens.]]A perfect [[parabolic mirror]] will bring parallel rays to a focus at a single point. Conversely, a point source at the focus of a parabolic mirror will produce a beam of collimated light creating a [[Collimator]]. Since the source needs to be small, such an optical system cannot produce much optical power. [[Spherical mirror]]s are easier to make than parabolic mirrors and they are often used to produce approximately collimated light. Many types of [[lens (optics)|lens]]es can also produce collimated light from point-like sources.

===Display system in flight simulators that uses collimated light===
[[File:Collimated display from side.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of a collimated-light display system, as seen from the side of a flight simulator]]
This principle is used in [[full flight simulator]]s (FFS), that have specially designed systems for displaying imagery of the Out-The-Window (OTW) scene to the pilots in the replica aircraft cabin.

In aircraft where two pilots are seated side by side, if the OTW imagery were projected in front of the pilots on a screen, one pilot would see the correct view but the other would see a view where some objects in the scene would be at incorrect angles.
[[File:Collimation - diagram and real sim.jpg|300px|right|Diagram of display system that uses collimated light and a real flight simulator]]
To avoid this, collimated optics are used in the simulator visual display system so that the OTW scene is seen by both pilots at a distant focus rather than at the focal distance of a projection screen.  This is achieved through an optical system that allows the imagery to be seen by the pilots in a mirror that has a vertical curvature, the curvature enabling the image to be seen at a distant focus by both pilots, who then see essentially the same OTW scene without any distortions. Since the light arriving at the eye point of both pilots is from different angles to the field of view of the pilots due to different projection systems arranged in a semi-circle above the pilots, the entire display system cannot be considered a collimated display, but a display system that uses collimated light.

==Collimation and decollimation==
"Collimation" refers to all the optical elements in an instrument being on their designed [[optical axis]]. It also refers to the process
of adjusting an optical instrument so that all its elements are on that designed axis (in line and parallel). With regards to a telescope, the term refers to the fact that the optical axis of each optical component should be centered and parallel, so that collimated light emerges from the eyepiece. Most amateur reflector telescopes need to be re-collimated every few years to maintain optimum performance. This can be done by simple visual methods such as looking down the optical assembly with no eyepiece to make sure the components are lined up, by using a [[Cheshire eyepiece]], or with the assistance of a simple laser collimator or [[autocollimator]]. Collimation can also be tested using a [[Shearing Interferometer|shearing interferometer]], which is often used to test laser collimation.

"Decollimation" is any mechanism or process which causes a beam with the minimum possible [[ray (optics)|ray]] divergence to diverge or converge from parallelism. Decollimation may be deliberate for systems reasons, or may be caused by many factors, such as [[refractive index]] inhomogeneities, occlusions, [[scattering]], [[Deflection (physics)|deflection]], [[diffraction]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], and [[refraction]]. Decollimation must be accounted for to fully treat many systems such as [[radio]], [[radar]], [[sonar]], and optical [[Telecommunication|communications]].

'''Comparatio''' in [[Classical rhetoric]] is strategy that uses ''comparison'' to persuade people. Comparatio relies upon people's [[knowledge]] or [[belief]]s about a phenomenon, and then discursively "links" that phenomenon to a different phenomenon about which the speaker/writer wishes to make a claim.

For example, if someone wanted to persuade an audience of the merit of putting in a new freeway system, they could use comparatio as a rhetorical strategy. They might compare the new freeway system to a "river of life flowing through our community" or they could call it a "path to commercial vibrance."

Comparisons can also be made to phenomena about which an audience could be expected to have negative feelings. For example, if you were opposed to the new freeway because of the environmental damage it would do to waterfowl nesting areas, you might compare the new freeway to "a corridor of death for our bird species."

The rhetorical success of comparatio hinges upon comparing your claim to a phenomenon that is:
*familiar to the audience

It would not, for example, work well to call the freeway a "ham sandwich lodged in the throat of the community." The freeway seems more logically related to the throat (a passageway or throughway) than an obstacle in that passageway.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5668">'''Corticocortical Coherence''' is referred to the synchrony in the neural activity of different cortical brain areas. The neural activities are picked up by electrophysiological recordings from the brain (e.g. [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]], [[Electrocorticography|ECoG]], etc.). It is a method to study the brain's neural communication and function at rest or during functional tasks.

== History and Basics ==
Initial applications of spectral analysis for finding the relationship between the EEG recordings from different regions of scalp dates back to 1960's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=D. O.|date=1963-08-01|title=Spectral analysis for electroencephalograms: mathematical determination of neurophysiological relationships from records of limited duration|journal=Experimental Neurology|volume=8|pages=155–181|issn=0014-4886|pmid=20191690}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corticocortical coherence has since been extensively studied using [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] and [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] recording for potential diagnostic applications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sklar|first=B.|last2=Hanley|first2=J.|last3=Simmons|first3=W.

The exact origins of corticocortical is under active investigation. While the consensus suggests that the functional neural communication between distinct brain sources leads to synchronous activity in those regions (possibly connected by neural tracts, in either direct or indirect way),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lei|first=Xu|last2=Wu|first2=Taoyu|last3=Valdes-Sosa|first3=Pedro|date=2015-01-01|title=Incorporating priors for EEG source imaging and connectivity analysis|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2015.00284/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|language=English|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00284|issn=1662-453X|pmc=4539512|pmid=26347599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-88630-5_8|title=Computational Neuroscience|last=Ramírez|first=Rey R.|last2=Wipf|first2=David|last3=Baillet|first3=Sylvain|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9780387886299|editor-last=Chaovalitwongse|editor-first=Wanpracha|series=Springer Optimization and Its Applications|pages=127–155|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-88630-5_8|editor-last2=Pardalos|editor-first2=Panos M.|editor-last3=Xanthopoulos|editor-first3=Petros}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=B.|last2=Liu|first2=Z.|date=2008-01-01|title=Multimodal Functional Neuroimaging: Integrating Functional MRI and EEG/MEG|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4664427/|journal=IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering|volume=1|pages=23–40|doi=10.1109/RBME.2008.2008233|issn=1937-3333|pmc=2903760|pmid=20634915}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative explanation emphasises on single focal oscillations that occur at single brain sources that eventually appear connected or synchronous in different scalp or brain source regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delorme|first=Arnaud|last2=Palmer|first2=Jason|last3=Onton|first3=Julie|last4=Oostenveld|first4=Robert|last5=Makeig|first5=Scott|date=2012-02-15|title=Independent EEG Sources Are Dipolar|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030135|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e30135|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030135|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3280242|pmid=22355308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corticocortical coherence has been of special interest in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands (commonly used for [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] studies).

==  Methods, Mathematics and Statistics ==
Cortico-cortical coherence is commonly studied using bipolar channels of EEG recordings, as well as unipolar channels of EEG or MEG signals; however, unipolar channels are usually used to estimate the brain sources and their connectivity, using electrical source imaging and connectivity analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehrkanoon|first=Saeid|last2=Breakspear|first2=Michael|last3=Britz|first3=Juliane|last4=Boonstra|first4=Tjeerd W.|date=2014-09-17|title=Intrinsic Coupling Modes in Source-Reconstructed Electroencephalography|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/brain.2014.0280|journal=Brain Connectivity|volume=4|issue=10|pages=812–825|doi=10.1089/brain.2014.0280|issn=2158-0014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic and commonly used approach to assess the synchrony between neural signals is to use [[Coherence (signal processing)|Coherence]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, D. M., Rosenberg, J. R., Amjad, A. M., Breeze, P., Conway, B. A., &amp; Farmer, S. F. (1995).

Statistical significance of coherence is found as function of number of data segments with assumption of the signals' normal distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, D. M., &amp; Rosenberg, J. R. (1999).

Retrieved from http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-58552-4_18&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively non-parametric techniques such as bootstrapping can be used.

'''Cosmology''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κόσμος, ''kosmos'' "world" and -λογία, ''-logia'' "study of") is the study of the [[Chronology of the universe|origin, evolution, and eventual fate]] of the [[universe]]. [[Physical cosmology]] is the scientific study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and its [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate,]] as well as the [[Laws of science|scientific laws]] that govern these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9988-instant-expert-cosmology.html "Introduction: Cosmology – space"]. ''New Scientist''. 4 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cosmology'' was first used in English in 1656 in [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s ''Glossographia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Cosmology (Routledge Revivals): Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology |first1=Norriss S. |last1=Hetherington |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-317-67766-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 Extract of page 116]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1731 taken up in Latin by [[German philosophy|German philosopher]] [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in ''Cosmologia Generalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wraparound Universe |first1=Jean-Pierre |last1=Luminet |publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4398-6496-8 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 Extract of page 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[creation myth]]s and [[eschatology]].

Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as [[Astronomy|astronomers]] and [[Physics|physicists]], as well as [[Philosophy|philosophers]], such as [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]], [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]], and [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophers of space and time]].  Because of this shared scope with [[philosophy]], [[theory|theories]] in physical cosmology may include both [[science|scientific]] and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be [[hypothesis|tested]]. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual [[celestial object]]s. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which attempts to bring together [[observational astronomy]] and [[particle physics]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology "Cosmology"] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.

[[Astrophysics#Theoretical astrophysics|Theoretical astrophysicist]] [[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=[[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] |title= Cosmology Today |journal=Daedalus |date=Fall 2014|volume=143|issue=4 |pages=125–133| doi = 10.1162/DAED_a_00312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physics]] and [[astrophysics]] have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. [[Physical cosmology]] was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the [[Big Bang]], followed almost instantaneously by [[cosmic inflation]]; an [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] from which the universe is thought to have emerged [[Age of the universe|13.799 ± 0.021]] [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years ago.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results. XIII. Cosmological parameters (See Table 4 on page 31 of PDF)|arxiv=1502.01589|bibcode=2016A&amp;A...594A..13P|author=Planck Collaboration|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201525830|volume=594|issue=13|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|pages=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmogony]] studies the origin of the Universe, and [[cosmography]] maps the features of the Universe.

In [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopédie]], cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=  |title=Detailed Explanation of the System of Human Knowledge

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antonius viii. 52 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15877/15877-h/15877-h.htm#viii._52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical cosmology===
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "[[celestial mechanics]]", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.

[[File:PIA17993-DetectorsForInfantUniverseStudies-20140317.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the [[Big Bang|infant universe]] may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the [[focal plane]] of the [[BICEP2]] [[radio telescope]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317" /&gt;]] 
[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]—that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst Öpik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.

{{Physical cosmology}}
In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way&lt;!-- and has galaxies of their own--&gt;&lt;!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.--&gt;.

Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[Redshift|red shift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].

Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.  This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 2014, astronomers at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] announced the detection of [[gravitational waves]], providing strong evidence for [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] and the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |authors=  |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url= http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 | website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite news |author =Whitney Clavin |title = NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url= http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |work= [[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317"&gt;{{cite news | author1 = [[Dennis Overbye]]  |title= Detection of Waves in Space Buttresses Landmark Theory of Big Bang |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date= 17 March 2014 |work =[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 19 June 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140619"&gt;{{cite news | author =Dennis Overbye |title= Astronomers Hedge on Big Bang Detection Claim |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/science/space/scientists-debate-gravity-wave-detection-claim.html |date= 19 June 2014 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=20 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20140619"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |title= Cosmic inflation: Confidence lowered for Big Bang signal |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27935479 |date=19 June 2014 |work= [[BBC News]] |accessdate=20 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.241101|pmid=24996078 |arxiv=1403.3985 |bibcode = 2014PhRvL.112x1101B | title = Detection of ''B''-Mode Polarization at Degree Angular Scales by BICEP2| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 112| issue = 24|pages=241101 | year = 2011| last1 = Ade | first1 = P.  A.  R. | last2 = Aikin | first2 = R.  W. | last3 = Barkats | first3 = D.| last4 = Benton | first4 = S.  J. | last5 = Bischoff | first5 = C.  A. | last6 = Bock | first6 = J.  J. | last7 = Brevik | first7 = J.  A. | last8 = Buder | first8 = I.| last9 = Bullock | first9 = E.| last10 = Dowell | first10 = C.  D. | last11 = Duband | first11 = L.| last12 = Filippini | first12 = J.  P. | last13 = Fliescher | first13 = S.| last14 = Golwala | first14 = S.  R. | last15 = Halpern | first15 = M.| last16 = Hasselfield | first16 = M.| last17 = Hildebrandt | first17 = S.  R. | last18 = Hilton | first18 = G.  C. | last19 = Hristov | first19 = V.  V. | last20 = Irwin | first20 = K.  D. | last21 = Karkare | first21 = K.  S. | last22 = Kaufman | first22 = J.  P. | last23 = Keating | first23 = B.  G. | last24 = Kernasovskiy | first24 = S.  A. | last25 = Kovac | first25 = J.  M. | last26 = Kuo | first26 = C.  L. | last27 = Leitch | first27 = E.  M. | last28 = Lueker | first28 = M.| last29 = Mason | first29 = P.| last30 = Netterfield | first30 = C.  B. | display-authors = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crouch |first1=C.

It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like [[dialectic]]s. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications#Planck2015|title=Publications - Cosmos|website=www.cosmos.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see [[monism]], [[pantheism]], [[emanationism]] and [[creationism]])
* What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[hylomorphism]], [[atomism]])
* What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [[teleology]])
* Does the existence of consciousness have a purpose? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see [[epistemology]])

| [[Hindu cosmology]]
| [[Rigveda]] (c. 1700–1100 BC)
| Cyclical or oscillating, Infinite in time
| One cycle of existence is around 311 trillion years and the life of one universe around 8 billion years. This Universal cycle is preceded by an infinite number of universes and to be followed by another infinite number of universes. Includes an infinite number of universes at one given time.

|-
|  [[Jain cosmology]]
|  [[Jain Agamas]] (written around 500 AD as per the teachings of [[Mahavira]] 599–527 BC)
|  Cyclical or oscillating, eternal and finite 
|  Jain cosmology considers the ''[[loka]]'', or universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to [[Jainism]], is broad at the top, narrow at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.

| [[Babylonian astronomy#Cosmology|Babylonian cosmology]]
| [[Assyro-Babylonian literature|Babylonian literature]] (c. 3000 BC)
| Flat earth floating in infinite "waters of chaos"
| The Earth and the [[Heaven]]s form a unit within infinite "waters of chaos"; the earth is flat and circular, and a solid dome (the "firmament") keeps out the outer "chaos"-ocean.
|-
| [[Eleatics|Eleatic cosmology]]
| [[Parmenides]] (c. 515 BC)
| Finite and spherical in extent
| The Universe is unchanging, uniform, perfect, necessary, timeless, and neither generated nor perishable. Void is impossible. Plurality and change are products of epistemic ignorance derived from sense experience. Temporal and spatial limits are arbitrary and relative to the Parmenidean whole.

| Earth floating in infinite "waters of chaos"
|The Earth and the [[Heaven]]s form a unit within infinite "waters of chaos";  the "[[firmament]]" keeps out the outer "chaos"-ocean.
|-
| [[Atomism|Atomist universe]]
| [[Anaxagoras]] (500–428&amp;nbsp;BC) &amp; later [[Epicurus]]
| Infinite in extent
| The universe contains only two things: an infinite number of tiny seeds ([[atom]]s) and the void of infinite extent. All atoms are made of the same substance, but differ in size and shape. Objects are formed from atom aggregations and decay back into atoms. Incorporates [[Leucippus]]' principle of [[causality]]: "nothing happens at random; everything happens out of reason and necessity". The universe was not ruled by [[gods]].{{citation needed|reason=Ancient Greeks typically believed that nothing was random *because* there were gods – for instance, when you elected a leader by drawing straws, the person 'randomly' elected leader was the one chosen by the gods!  The random selection was intended to minimize human influence on the outcome of the election, not to eliminate the influence of mount olympus – which would have been considered impossible, by typical Greek thinkers at least.  Perhaps Anaxagoras was atypical in *that* way, as well as atypical in believing in some primitive version of the atomic theory, but methinks not.|date=January 2013}}

| [[Pythagorean astronomical system|Pythagorean universe]]
| [[Philolaus]] (d. 390 BC)
| Existence of a "Central Fire" at the center of the Universe.
| At the center of the Universe is a central fire, around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and [[planet]]s revolve uniformly. The Sun revolves around the central fire once a year, the stars are immobile. The earth in its motion maintains the same hidden face towards the central fire, hence it is never seen. First known non-geocentric model of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Carl B.

| [[De Mundo]]
| [[Pseudo-Aristotle]] (d. 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC)
| The Universe then is a system made up of heaven and earth and the elements which are contained in them.
| There are "five elements, situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater – namely, earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by ether – make up the whole Universe."&lt;ref name=1908DeMundo&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/demundoarisrich#page/4/mode/2up |title=De Mundo |year=1914 |author=Aristotle |editor1=Forster, E.

| [[Stoics]] (300&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;AD)
| [[Island universe]]
| The [[cosmos]] is finite and surrounded by an infinite void. It is in a state of flux, and pulsates in size and undergoes periodic upheavals and conflagrations.
|-
| [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian universe]]
| [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC)
| [[Geocentric]], static, steady state, finite extent, infinite time
| Spherical earth is surrounded by concentric [[celestial spheres]]. Universe exists unchanged throughout eternity. Contains a fifth element, called [[aether (classical element)|aether]], that was added to the four [[classical element]]s.
|-
| Aristarchean universe
| [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] (circa&amp;nbsp;280&amp;nbsp;BC)
| [[Heliocentric]]
| Earth rotates daily on its axis and revolves annually about the sun in a circular orbit. Sphere of fixed stars is centered about the sun.
|-
| [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic model]]
| [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century&amp;nbsp;AD)
| Geocentric (based on Aristotelian universe)
| Universe orbits around a stationary Earth. Planets move in circular [[epicycles]], each having a center that moved in a larger circular orbit (called an eccentric or a deferent) around a center-point near Earth. The use of [[equant]]s added another level of complexity and allowed astronomers to predict the positions of the planets. The most successful universe model of all time, using the criterion of longevity. [[Almagest]] (the Great System).
|-
| Aryabhatan model
| [[Aryabhata]] (499)
| Geocentric or Heliocentric
| The [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] and the planets move in [[elliptical orbit]]s around either the Earth or Sun; uncertain whether the model is geocentric or heliocentric due to planetary orbits given with respect to both the Earth and Sun.
|-
| Medieval universe
| [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval philosophers]] (500–1200)
| Finite in time
| A universe that is finite in time and has a beginning is proposed by the [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] [[John Philoponus]], who argues against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. Logical arguments supporting a finite universe are developed by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]] [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]] [[Saadia Gaon]], and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]] [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]].

| [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (1149–1209)
| [[Multiverse]], multiple worlds and universes
| There exists an infinite outer space beyond the known world, and God has the power to fill the vacuum with an infinite number of universes.
|-
| Maragha models
| [[Maragheh observatory|Maragha school]] (1259–1528)
| Geocentric
| Various modifications to Ptolemaic model and Aristotelian universe, including rejection of [[equant]] and [[Deferent and epicycle|eccentrics]] at [[Maragheh observatory]], and introduction of [[Tusi-couple]] by [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Al-Tusi]]. Alternative models later proposed, including the first accurate [[Moon|lunar]] model by [[Ibn al-Shatir]], a model rejecting stationary Earth in favour of [[Earth's rotation]] by [[Ali Kuşçu]], and planetary model incorporating "circular [[inertia]]" by [[Al-Birjandi]].
|-
| Nilakanthan model
| [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544)

| A universe in which the planets orbit the Sun and the Sun orbits the Earth, similar to the earlier [[Nilakantha Somayaji|Nilakanthan model]].
|-
|[[Giordano Bruno#Bruno.27s cosmology|Bruno's cosmology]]
| [[Giordano Bruno]] (1548–1600)
| Infinite extent, infinite time, homogeneous, isotropic, non-hierarchical
| Rejects the idea of a hierarchical universe. Earth and Sun have no special properties in comparison with the other heavenly bodies. The void between the stars is filled with [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], and matter is composed of the same [[Classical element|four elements]] (water, earth, fire, and air), and is atomistic, animistic and intelligent.
|-
|Keplerian
| [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630)
| Heliocentric with elliptical planetary orbits
| Kepler's discoveries, marrying mathematics and physics, provided the foundation for our present conception of the Solar system, but distant stars were still seen as objects in a thin, fixed celestial sphere.
|-
| Static Newtonian
| [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727)
| [[Static universe|Static]] (evolving), steady state, infinite
| Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle. Matter on the large scale is uniformly distributed. Gravitationally balanced but unstable.
|-
| [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation#Vortex|Cartesian Vortex]] universe
| [[René Descartes]], 17th century
| Static (evolving), steady state, [[infinity|infinite]]
| System of huge swirling whirlpools of aethereal or fine matter produces what we would call gravitational effects. But his vacuum was not empty; all space was filled with matter.
|-
| Hierarchical universe
| [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Lambert]], 18th century
| Static (evolving), steady state, infinite
| Matter is clustered on ever larger scales of hierarchy. Matter is endlessly recycled.
|-
| [[Static universe|Einstein Universe with a cosmological constant]]
| [[Albert Einstein]], 1917
| Static (nominally). Bounded (finite)
| "Matter without motion". Contains uniformly distributed matter. Uniformly curved spherical space; based on [[Riemann sphere|Riemann's hypersphere]]. Curvature is set equal to Λ. In effect Λ is equivalent to a repulsive force which counteracts gravity. Unstable.
|-
| [[De Sitter universe]]
| [[Willem de Sitter]], 1917
| [[Metric expansion of space|Expanding]] [[shape of the universe|flat space]].
Steady state.
Λ &gt; 0
| "Motion without matter." Only apparently static. Based on Einstein's [[general relativity]]. Space expands with constant [[accelerating universe|acceleration]]. [[Scale factor (universe)|Scale factor]] increases exponentially (constant [[cosmic inflation|inflation]]).
|-
| MacMillan universe
| [[William Duncan MacMillan]] 1920s
| Static and steady state
| New matter is created from [[radiation]]; starlight perpetually recycled into new matter particles.

| Spherical expanding space.
''k'' = +1 ; no Λ
| Positive curvature. Curvature constant ''k'' = +1
[[Metric expansion of space|Expands]] then [[Big crunch|recollapses]]. [[shape of the universe|Spatially closed]] (finite).
|-
| [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann universe]], hyperbolic space
| [[Alexander Friedmann]], 1924
| [[Hyperbolic space|Hyperbolic]] expanding space.
''k'' = &amp;minus;1 ; no Λ
| [[Shape of the universe|Negative curvature]]. Said to be infinite (but ambiguous). Unbounded. Expands forever.
|-
| [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]]
| [[Paul Dirac]] 1930s
| Expanding
| Demands a large variation in ''G'', which decreases with time. Gravity weakens as universe evolves.
|-
| Friedmann zero-curvature
| Einstein and De Sitter, 1932
| Expanding flat space
''k'' = 0 ; Λ = 0
Critical density
| Curvature constant ''k'' = 0. Said to be infinite (but ambiguous). "Unbounded cosmos of limited extent". Expands forever. "Simplest" of all known universes. Named after but not considered by Friedmann. Has a [[deceleration parameter|deceleration term]] ''q'' = 1/2, which means that its expansion rate slows down.
|-
| The original [[Big Bang]] (Friedmann-Lemaître)
| [[Georges Lemaître]] 1927–29
| Expansion
Λ &gt; 0 ; Λ &gt; |Gravity|
| Λ is positive and has a magnitude greater than gravity. Universe has initial high-density state ("primeval atom"). Followed by a two-stage expansion. Λ is used to destabilize the universe. (Lemaître is considered the father of the big bang model.)
|-
| [[Oscillating universe]] (Friedmann-Einstein)
| Favored by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]], 1920s
| Expanding and contracting in cycles
| Time is endless and beginningless; thus avoids the beginning-of-time paradox. Perpetual cycles of big bang followed by big crunch. (Einstein's first choice after he rejected his 1917 model.)
|-
| Eddington universe
| [[Arthur Eddington]] 1930
| First static then expands
| Static Einstein 1917 universe with its instability disturbed into expansion mode; with relentless matter dilution becomes a De Sitter universe. Λ dominates gravity.

| [[Edward Arthur Milne|Edward Milne]], 1933, 1935;
[[William H. McCrea]], 1930s
| Kinematic expansion without space expansion
| Rejects general relativity and the expanding space paradigm. Gravity not included as initial assumption. Obeys cosmological principle and [[special relativity]]; consists of a finite spherical cloud of particles (or galaxies) that expands within an infinite and otherwise empty flat space. It has a center and a cosmic edge (surface of the particle cloud) that expands at light speed. Explanation of gravity was elaborate and unconvincing.
|-
| [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] class of models
| [[Howard Percy Robertson|Howard Robertson]], [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker|Arthur Walker]], 1935
| Uniformly expanding
| Class of universes that are homogeneous and isotropic. Spacetime separates into uniformly curved space and cosmic time common to all co-moving observers. The formulation system is now known as the FLRW or Robertson–Walker metrics of cosmic time and curved space.
|-
| [[Steady state theory|Steady-state]]
| [[Hermann Bondi]], [[Thomas Gold]], 1948

| Matter creation rate maintains constant density. Continuous creation out of nothing from nowhere. Exponential expansion. Deceleration term ''q'' = &amp;minus;1.
|-
| Steady-state
| [[Fred Hoyle]] 1948
| Expanding, steady state; but unstable
| Matter creation rate maintains constant density. But since matter creation rate must be exactly balanced with the space expansion rate the system is unstable.
|-
| [[Ambiplasma]]
| [[Hannes Alfvén]] 1965 [[Oskar Klein]]
| Cellular universe, expanding by means of matter–antimatter annihilation
| Based on the concept of [[plasma cosmology]]. The universe is viewed as "meta-galaxies" divided by [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]] and thus a bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic matter-[[antimatter]] [[annihilation]]s keep the bubbles separated and moving apart preventing them from interacting.
|-
| [[Brans–Dicke theory]]
| [[Carl H. Brans]], [[Robert H. Dicke]]
| Expanding
| Based on [[Mach's principle]]. ''G'' varies with time as universe expands. "But nobody is quite sure what Mach's principle actually means."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
|-
| [[Cosmic inflation]]
| [[Alan Guth]] 1980
| [[Big Bang]] modified  to solve [[horizon problem|horizon]] and [[flatness problem]]s
| Based on the concept of hot inflation. The universe is viewed as a multiple quantum flux – hence its bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic expansion kept the bubbles separated and moving apart.
|-
| [[Chaotic inflation theory|Eternal inflation]] (a multiple universe model)
| [[Andrei Linde|Andreï Linde]], 1983
| Big Bang with [[cosmic inflation]]
| [[Multiverse]] based on the concept of cold inflation, in which inflationary events occur at random each with independent initial conditions; some expand into bubble universes supposedly like our entire cosmos. Bubbles nucleate in a [[Quantum foam|spacetime foam]].
|-
| [[Cyclic model]]
| [[Paul Steinhardt]]; [[Neil Turok]] 2002
| Expanding and contracting in cycles; [[M-theory]].
| Two parallel [[orbifold]] planes or [[Membrane (M-theory)|M-branes]] collide periodically in a higher-dimensional space. With [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or [[dark energy]].

'''Cytoscape''' is an [[Open-source software|open source]] [[bioinformatics]] [[software platform]] for [[Visualization (graphic)|visualizing]] [[Metabolic network modelling|molecular interaction networks]] and integrating with [[gene expression]] profiles and other state data. Additional features are available as [[plugins]]. Plugins are available for network and molecular profiling analyses, new layouts, additional file format support and connection with databases and searching in large networks. Plugins may be developed using the Cytoscape open [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software architecture by anyone and plugin  community development is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shannon P, Markiel A, Ozier O |title=Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks |journal=Genome Res. |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=2498–504 |year=2003 |pmid=14597658 |doi=10.1101/gr.1239303 |url=http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/13/11/2498 |pmc=403769|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bell GW, Lewitter F |title=Visualizing networks |journal=Meth. Enzymol. |volume=411 |issue= |pages=408–21 |year=2006 |pmid=16939803 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(06)11022-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cytoscape also has a [[JavaScript]]-centric sister project named [http://js.cytoscape.org Cytoscape.js] that can be used to analyse and visualise graphs in JavaScript environments, like a browser.

== History ==
Cytoscape was originally created at the Institute of Systems Biology in Seattle in 2002.  Now, it is developed by an international consortium of open source developers. Cytoscape was initially made public in July, 2002 (v0.8); the second release (v0.9) was in November, 2002, and v1.0 was released in March 2003.  Version 1.1.1 is the last stable release for the 1.0 series. Version 2.0 was initially released in 2004; Cytoscape 2.83, the final 2.xx version, was released in May 2012. Version 3.0 was released Feb 1, 2013, and the latest version, 3.4.0, was released in May 2016.

== Development ==
The Cytoscape core developer team continues to work on this project and released Cytoscape 3.0 in 2013. This represented a major change in the Cytoscape architecture; it is a more modularized, expandable and maintainable version of the software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cytoscape.wodaklab.org/wiki/Cytoscape_3/ developer's wiki page].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[Image:Cytoscape network visualization1.png|thumb|450px|Yeast Protein–protein/Protein–DNA interaction network visualized by Cytoscape. Node degree is mapped to node size]]

While Cytoscape is most commonly used for biological research applications, it is agnostic in terms of usage.  Cytoscape can be used to visualize and analyze network graphs of any kind involving nodes and edges (e.g., social networks). A key aspect of the software architecture of Cytoscape is the use of plugins for specialized features. Plugins are developed by core developers and the greater user community.

== Features ==
'''Input'''
* Input and construct molecular interaction networks from raw interaction files (SIF format) containing lists of protein–protein and/or protein–DNA interaction pairs.  For yeast and other model organisms, large sources of pairwise interactions are available through the BIND and [[TRANSFAC]] databases. User-defined interaction types are also supported.
* Load and save previously-constructed interaction networks in [[Graph Modelling Language|GML]] format (Graph Modelling Language).
* Load and save networks and node/edge attributes in an XML document format called [[XGMML]] (eXtensible Graph Markup and Modeling Language).
* Input mRNA expression profiles from tab- or space-delimited text files.
* Load and save arbitrary attributes on nodes and edges. For example, input a set of custom annotation terms for your proteins, create a set of confidence values for your protein–protein interactions.
* Import gene functional annotations from the [[Gene Ontology]] (GO) and [[KEGG]] databases.
* Directly import GO terms and annotations from OBO and Gene Association files.
* Load and save state of the cytoscape session in a cytoscape session (.cys) file. Cytoscape session file includes networks, attributes (for node/edge/network), desktop states (selected/hidden nodes and edges, window sizes), properties, and visual styles.

'''Visualization'''
* Customize network data display using powerful visual styles.
* View a superposition of gene expression ratios and p-values on the network.  Expression data can be mapped to node color, label, border thickness, or border color, etc. according to user-configurable colors and visualization schemes.
* Layout networks in two dimensions.  A variety of layout algorithms are available, including cyclic and [[Force-based algorithms (graph drawing)|spring-embedded layouts]].

For instance, users may select nodes involved in a threshold number of interactions, nodes that share a particular GO annotation, or nodes whose gene expression levels change significantly in one or more conditions according to p-values loaded with the gene expression data.
** Find active subnetworks/pathway modules. The network is screened against gene expression data to identify connected sets of interactions, i.e. interaction subnetworks, whose genes show particularly high levels of differential expression.  The interactions contained in each subnetwork provide hypotheses for the regulatory and signaling interactions in control of the observed expression changes.
** Find clusters (highly interconnected regions) in any network loaded into Cytoscape. Depending on the type of network, clusters may mean different things. For instance, clusters in a protein–protein interaction network have been shown to be protein complexes and parts of pathways. Clusters in a protein similarity network represent protein families.

'''Divided consciousness''' is a term coined by [[Ernest Hilgard]] to define a psychological state in which one's [[consciousness]] is split into distinct components, possibly during [[hypnosis]].

== Origin(s) ==
The theory of a division of consciousness was touched upon by [[Carl Jung]] in 1935 when he stated, "The so-called unity of consciousness is an illusion... we like to think that we are one but we are not."&lt;ref&gt;(Review: Dissociationism Revived, Matthew Hugh Erdelyi, Science, New Series, Vol. 200, No. 4342 (May 12, 1978), pp. 654-655; Published by: American Association for the Advancement of Science)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ernest Hilgard believed that hypnosis causes a split in awareness and a vivid form of everyday mind splits.&lt;ref&gt;(Myers, David G. Psychology:  Eighth Edition in Modules. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;   Drawing themes from [[Pierre Janet]], Hilgard viewed hypnosis from this perspective as a willingness to divide the main systems of consciousness into different sectors.  He argued that this split in consciousness can not only help define the state of mind reached during hypnosis, but can also help to define a vast range of psychological issues such as [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]].

In Hilgard's ''Divided Consciousness Reconsidered'', he offers a great many examples of "[[dissociation (psychology)|dissociated]]" human behavior. With regard to theory, he does state that it is useful to assign two modes of consciousness, a receptive mode and an active mode—that is, a bimodal consciousness. In other places he mentions the concept of ''coconsciousness'', wherein two or more states of consciousness may be equally receptive or active, as, for example, in some types of multiple personality.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, B. (1979). Distributing cognition: A defense of collective mentality,'' Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 8 (6)'',591;  Retrieved from http://www.springerlink.com/content/h66jn31642t052j8/fulltext.pdf?page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Many psychological studies assume a unity of consciousness. Doubt is cast on this assumption by psychophysical studies in normal subjects and those with [[blindsight]] showing the simultaneous dissociation of different modes of report of a sensation, and by clinical studies of [[anosognosia|anosognosic]] patients showing dissociations of awareness of their own states.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These and other phenomena are interpreted to imply two kinds of division of consciousness: the separation of phenomenal experience from reflexive consciousness and the non-unity of reflexive consciousness. Reflexive consciousness is taken to be necessary for report and is associated with the self as the subject of experience and agent of report. Reflexive consciousness is operative only when we attend to our own states. When we are involved in the world reflexivity intervenes less and our consciousness is more unified.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, D, Juzyck, P, Klein R.,(1983). The Nature of Thought, '' Medical Research Council, Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge, UK.'' Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=0cprqzSe6BkC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=By+Donald+Olding+Hebb,+Peter+W.+Jusczyk,+Raymond+M.+Klein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N_f-8zNr2K&amp;sig=dBHDyYyDKSCTQ4YohMjalD85fxY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA32,M1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimentation ==
The theory has been tried and tested and some tests have proven that the theory makes some legitimate predictions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Others, such as one performed on 169 undergraduate students, some of whom performed tasks in [[selective attention]] and divided attention conditions being correlated with scores on the [[Hypnotic susceptibility#Harvard Group Scale|Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility]] refute Hilgard’s findings.&lt;ref&gt;Some operationalizations of the neodissociation concept and their relationship to [[hypnotic susceptibility]]. Stava, Lawrence J.; Jaffa, Melvyn. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Vol 54(6), Jun 1988, 989-996.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

New trends in psychology and [[cognitive neuroscience]] suggest that applications of [[nonlinear dynamics]], chaos and [[self-organization]] seem to be particularly important for research of some fundamental problems regarding mind-brain relationship. Relevant problems among others are formations of memories during alterations of mental states and nature of a barrier that divides mental states, and leads to the process called [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]. This process is related to a formation of groups of [[neuron]]s which often synchronize their firing patterns in a unique spatial manner. The central theme of this study is the relationship between level of moving and oscillating [[mental process]]es and their [[neurophysiological]] substrate. This presents a question about principles of organization of the conscious experience and how the experiences happen in the brain. Chaotic self-organization provides a unique theoretical and experimental tool for deeper understanding of dissociative phenomena and enables to study how dissociative phenomena can be linked to [[epilepsy|epileptiform]] discharges which are related to various forms of psychological and somatic manifestations. Organizing principles that constitute human consciousness and other mental phenomena from this point of view may be described by analysis and reconstruction of underlying dynamics of psychophysiological measures.&lt;ref&gt;Chaos, brain and divided consciousness.

'''Dora Sakayan''' ([[classical Armenian orthography]]: {{lang|hy|Դորա Սաքայեան}} {{transl|hy|ISO|Dora Sak'ayean}}; [[Armenian orthography reform|reformed]]: {{lang|hy|Դորա Սաքայան}} {{transl|hy|ISO|Dora Sak'ayan}}; born January 24, 1931), Professor of German Studies (retired), McGill University. Specializing initially as a Germanist, today she is known for her work in various areas of [[Applied Linguistics]]. Sakayan is also noted for pioneering Armenology in Canada, and introducing the two branches of the Armenian language, [[Western Armenian]] and [[Eastern Armenian]], to the English-speaking world.

==Early life, education and career==
Sakayan was born in 1931 in Salonica, Greece, to Armenian parents who had escaped the [[Armenian Genocide]]. She grew up in a multilingual environment, with her first languages being Western Armenian and Modern Greek, and she received early exposure to German, French and Turkish. After immigrating to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]], she received her education in Eastern Armenian and Russian. Later on, she mastered English and learned other languages.

Sakayan received her elementary education at the Armenian Gulabi Gulbenkian School in Salonica. She then attended the local German high school Deutsche Schule Saloniki. She was 11&amp;nbsp;years old when her family moved to Vienna, Austria, where she pursued her high school education at the Gymnasium for girls in the 7th District of Vienna "Oberschule für Mädchen, Wien VII."

In 1946, Sakayan’s family repatriated to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]] where she completed her secondary education. In 1948, she was admitted to the [[Yerevan State Linguistic University|Yerevan State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages]] (YSPL) where she graduated with a diploma in [[Germanic languages|Germanic linguistics]] and in [[Pedagogy]] in 1952. She was then appointed as an instructor of German at YSPL, where she taught from 1952 to 1956. Subsequently, she was invited to teach in the Department of [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Germanic philology|Germanic Philology]] at [[Yerevan State University]] (YSU, 1956–1958).

Sakayan began her graduate studies in Germanic philology in 1958 at the [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov Moscow State University]] (LMSU), completing them in 1961. Over the following four years, she shared her time between Moscow and Yerevan to pursue her teaching duties in Germanic Philology at YSU and complete her PhD thesis while raising her two young children. She obtained her PhD in Germanic Philology from [[Moscow Lomonosov University]] in 1965.

In 1965, Sakayan became Head of the Department of Foreign languages of YSU, a position she held for ten years. At the same time, she delivered lectures in the Department of Romance-Germanic Philology of YSU.

Sakayan immigrated to Canada in January 1975 and began to teach German at two universities: [[McGill University]], (Department of German Studies) and the [[Université de Montréal]] (Department of Études des langues anciennes et modernes). In 1977, she was offered a full-time position at McGill and left Université de Montréal. Due to her high ratings as an instructor of German at McGill, in 1978 she was offered a joint appointment with the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies where she taught for ten years. Over the years, Sakayan rose to the rank of Full Professor at McGill University.

In 1981, Sakayan began her groundbreaking work in [[Armenian studies|Armenian Studies]] at McGill. At the Centre of Continuing Education, she founded and supervised a program of credited Armenian courses anchored in the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies. She edited and prepared for publication a number of Armenological manuscripts of linguistic, literary and historic  interest,&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Sakayan et al. "Sign, System, Communications.

She became a regular participant at international Armenological conferences and congresses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dorasakayan.org./papers.htm |title=Dora Sakayan |work=Dorasakayan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she also organized Armenological conferences in Canada and Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dorasakayan.org/confs.htm |title=Dora Sakayan |work=Dorasakayan.com |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing her mission as presenting Armenian language and culture to non-Armenians, she founded the series "Armenian Studies for the English Speaking World" and published a number of scholarly books and articles under this heading. To promote the publication of her Armenological books, in 1997 she founded a small press under the name AROD Books in Montreal.

After 25&amp;nbsp;years of service at McGill University, Sakayan retired from the Department of German Studies in 2000 and dedicated herself fully to Armenian Studies. She renewed her ties with Yerevan State University, where she regularly spends a few months every year, participating in scholarly projects, organizing international linguistic conferences, publishing her books with YSU Press and organizing book launches at YSU and elsewhere in Armenia. Among many activities in her homeland, she is the supervisor and participant of an ongoing translation project that she carries out with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armin.am/en/news |title=Institute for Armenian Studies of YSU |publisher=Armin.am |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; at YSU.

At the same time, Sakayan continues the promotion of Armenian Studies in Canada. In 2005, she founded an Armenian language program at the Diocese of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] in Montreal, carrying on a tradition that she established more than three decades ago (in 1981) at the Centre of Continuing Education at McGill University.

==Works==

===Contrastive grammar===
As a Germanist and educator in the East European tradition, Sakayan has received training in Germanic linguistics and [[language pedagogy]]. This background has led her to applied linguistics, and from the great variety of its interdisciplinary branches Sakayan has concentrated on the following areas: a) [[contrastive linguistics]], b) [[foreign language acquisition]], c) [[translation studies]].

Sakayan includes into the contrastive discussion, besides German, other [[Indo-European languages]]: Russian, English, French, and Modern Greek. As an innovation, she also includes Armenian, a non-European language whose [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] properties set it apart from other languages in the Indo-European family. In fact, in Sakayan’s work, contrastive analysis is predominantly based on Armenian, and other languages are viewed through the prism of this language. The objectives of such an endeavor are to establish [[Linguistic typology|language typologies]] and to identify areas of difficulty in foreign language acquisition. Her work also incorporates the findings of Armenian and Russian data — not always accessible to Western linguists.

Sakayan introduces to the Western reader the idiosyncrasies of Eastern Armenian [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], with a special focus on the verb system and its rich paradigm of non-finite verb forms, called ''derbays'' (դերբայ = participle). Over the years, she has dealt extensively with East Armenian deverbal [[nominalization]]s, deriving from certain ''derbays'': the Armenian infinitive and three participles: the present, past and the future participle. Within the framework of "Nominalizations of various degrees" Sakayan discusses the regular [[relative clause]] (RC), the ‘relative participles’&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Armenian Relative Participles and their Access to the AH (Accessibilty Hierarchy)." In: Proceedings of the XVth  [[International Congress of Linguists]], Université Laval, 1992, Quebec: Université Laval Press, 1993, vol. 2, pp. 361-364&lt;/ref&gt; (RP based on the present, past and the future participle), as well and other phenomena of relativization in Eastern Armenian.

Sakayan contrasts Armenian clausal nominalizations with their semantic counterparts in a selective number of European languages. A noteworthy monograph in this respect is ''Formen der Textkohärenz: Nominalisierung als sententiale Anapher im Ostarmenischen''.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Formen der Textkohärenz. Nominalisierung als sententiale Anapher im Ostarmenischen [Forms of text coherence. Nominalization as sentential anaphora in East Armenian], Tübinger Beiträge zur Linguistik, 299 – [Tübingen contributions to Linguistics, Nr. 299], Tübingen: Gunter Narr 1986. {{ISBN|3-87808-299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book explores East Armenian clausal nominalizations that are based on the Armenian infinitive. Sakayan describes the transformation process of finite clauses into economical nominal phrases, gives the morphosyntactic characteristics of these nominalizations, identifies the functions of the agglutinative segments in a synthetic nominalized infinitive (SNI).

===Contrastive phraseology===
Sakayan has also taken a keen interest in contrastive [[phraseology]] in the general sense of the term. Recognizing the importance of ready-made expressions in human communication, she has based her research on self-collected linguistic corpora of phraseological units, such as proverbs and sayings, idiomatic expressions, and routine formulae (gambits).

Sakayan has explored the reproduction of routine formulae (gambits) and their role for turn-taking in conversation and for organizing discourse&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora; Tessier, Christine (1983). "Deutsche Gesprächsformeln in Mikrodialogen" [German Speech Formulae in Mini-Dialogues]. Zielsprache Deutsch 1983/3: pp. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; She has created thematically and pragmatically grouped bilingual concordances of routine formulae (gambits) for language learning. See the use of such concordances in Sakayan’s textbooks.&lt;ref name="SakayanDora"&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Revised Edition. Yerevan State University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakayan's interest in proverbs resulted in a major [[Paremiology|paremiological]] study accompanied by a bilingual (Armenian-English), thematically arranged anthology of 2,500 proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Armenian Proverbs: A Paremiological Study with an Anthology of 2,500 Armenian Folk Sayings Selected and Translated into English, Delmar &amp; New York: Caravan Books, First edition: 1994, Second and revised edition: 1995&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive introduction addresses the language and structure,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On the Grammar of Armenian Proverbs." In: John A. C. Greppin (ed.), Proceedings. Fourth International Conference on Armenian Linguistics. [[Cleveland State University]], Cleveland, September 14–19, 1991, Delmar &amp; New York: Caravan Books, 1992, pp. 171-201&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the origin of Armenian proverbs (international, borrowed and specifically Armenian proverbs).

Contrastive paremiology being an ongoing project, Sakayan’s next volume became a language-pair-oriented paremiological study with special focus on German-Armenian connections and discussions on cross-cultural translatability.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "Ein Freund kann dir das Gesicht weiß oder schwarz machen: Zum Problem der Übersetzbarkeit von Sprichwörtern" [Problems of proverb translatability]. In: Ferdinand van Ingen and Christian Juranek (eds.). Ars et Amicitia, Festschrift für Martin Bircher zum 60. Geburtstag am 3. Juni 1998. Chloe. Beihefte zum Daphnis. Bd. 28. Amsterdam and Atlanta, Rodopi, 1998, pp. 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Cross-Cultural Understanding of Language-Specific Notions and Concepts in Folklore." In: Alice Sarkösi (ed.), Festschrift for Edmond Schütz, Budapest: Academy of Sciences Press, 1998, pp. 130-145&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the German counterpart of this paremiological study appeared&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Armenische Sprichwörter. Որտեղ հաց, այնտեղ կաց, որտեղ գինի, այնտեղ քնի: Wiesbaden: [[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]], 2001. {{ISBN|3-447-04379-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new introduction that provides an in-depth analysis of the structure and language of Armenian proverbs. Along with the extreme conciseness of the Armenian proverbs, Sakayan points to their capacity to function in various sizes and shapes, from extremely short and compact units to more elaborate and wordy structures (e.g. dialogues). Some of them encapsulate people’s everyday talk, citations of reported or direct speech. Since dialogue proverbs or dramatized proverbs are not a universal genre and can be found only in a few languages, Sakayan explores them extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Reported and Direct Speech in Proverbs. Dialogue Proverbs in Armenian." In: Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship, Vol. 16, 1999, pp. 303-324&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign language acquisition===
Sakayan’s scholarly interest in foreign language acquisition is apparent not only in the titles of her published articles, but also in the list of authored and co-authored textbooks, instructional manuals and methodological guides, for the instruction of both German and Armenian as foreign languages&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Christine Tessier. Rede und Antwort. Übungen zum dialogischen Ausdruck. (with cassette) Coauthor: Chr. Tessier. Ismaning: Hueber Verlag, 1989. {{ISBN|3-19-001482-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these projects demonstrate the benefits of applying the latest trends in linguistics to instructional development.&lt;ref&gt;On newer trends in Foreign language teaching. Expectancy Grammar." In: Semiotics and Language Teaching. Theoretical Principles and Practical Applications. Ann Arbor: Caravan Books, 2001, pp. 9-14&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1960s and 1970s, while chairing the Department of Foreign Languages at Yerevan State University (YSU) in Soviet Armenia, Sakayan authored and co-authored several textbooks, manuals and methodological guides for the instruction of German in Armenian high schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Zaruhi Svazlian. Deutsch für die 6. Klasse. (German for the 6th grade of Armenian secondary schools). Coauthor: Z. Svazlian. Yerevan: Louys Press, 1970 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.), 1973 (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Zaruhi Svazlian. Deutsch für die 5. Klasse (German for the 5th grade of Armenian secondary schools). Yerevan: Louys Press, 1969 (1st ed.), 1971 (2nd ed.), 1973 (3rd ed).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Deutsches Lesebuch. [An anthology of German literary]. Yerevan State University Press, 1968 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Lies Deutsch, Erzähl Deutsch! (A reader for Armenian secondary schools with German-Armenian commentary and glossary.) Yerevan: Louys Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Deutsches Lesebuch. [An anthology of literary texts for graduate students in philology, with German-Armenian commentary and glossary]. Yerevan: University Press, 1967 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in accordance with Soviet censorship rules that deprived expatriate authors of authorship, the production of all books carrying her name had to be discontinued after Sakayan’s departure to Canada in 1975.

After resettling in Canada, Sakayan continued her research in Foreign Language Methodology. In close collaboration with Professor Christine Tessier of Université Laval in Quebec City, Canada, Sakayan conducted the research project dedicated to German Stereotyped Speech Forms in Mini-Dialogues. Sakayan and Tessier laid the groundwork for a new method of communicative exercises that has received widespread recognition in the area of DaF (Deutsch als Fremdsprache, or German as a Foreign Language). The project resulted in a book called Rede und Antwort,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Christine Tessier. Rede und Antwort. Übungen zum dialogischen Ausdruck. (with cassette) Coauthor: Chr. Tessier. Ismaning: Hueber Verlag, 1989. {{ISBN|3-19-001482-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely used as a supplement to other DaF textbooks at universities; in 1991 it was declared in the AOL-Reference Manual as "a hit textbook for DaF."

The innovative method is based on the introduction of German Stereotyped Speech Forms, or gambits, known for their important role in languages while turn-taking in interaction. Gambits used at the beginning of an utterance are seen as cues that signal not only the illocutionary feature of an utterance, but also its syntactic-semantic unfolding. The method broadly applies [[speech act theory]] and [[text linguistics]], as well as some insights of "grammar of expectancy," to the teaching of DaF. The Rede und Antwort exercises have proven to be an effective means for promoting oral skills in the classroom, which are readily applicable in real life-settings.

Inspired by the success of the Rede und Antwort, in the 1990s Sakayan launched and carried out a completely new project: an introductory university textbook for Western Armenian (Western Armenian for the English-speaking World: A Contrastive Approach). The textbook, which first appeared in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Modern Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach. Montreal: Arod Books, 2000. {{ISBN|0-9699879-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; draws on more recent achievements of linguistics in the instruction of Western Armenian. It demonstrates the great potential that contrastive linguistics has for the advancement of foreign language teaching by outlining Armenian-English contrasts throughout the course. It also applies the insights of text linguistics and grammar of expectancy by enhancing the production of correct grammatical forms anticipated by the reproduction of certain ready-made routine formulae. The textbook is conceptualized pragmatically, enabling students to carry out speech acts fundamental for communication. Although grammar receives proper attention, other linguistic aspects such as word formation, semantic vocabulary groups, pronunciation, orthography, etc. are also treated on a regular basis. The textbook was received positively and was adopted by Armenian Studies Programs at universities and schools worldwide.

In 2007, Sakayan published a new Armenian textbook, this time on Eastern Armenian,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; also accompanied by a CD-Rom featuring Eastern Armenian native speakers. To bring the level of the existing Western Armenian textbook to that of its Eastern Armenian counterpart, in 2012 Sakayan published a second and revised edition (with CD-Rom).&lt;ref name="SakayanDora" /&gt;

Both titles are now published by YSU Press. They are consistent in methodology and structure, with a vast amount of linguistic material proportionally distributed among 12 Units, which each consist of 12 sections. These twin Armenian textbooks are considered to be the highlight of Sakayan’s career, reflecting a lifetime of pedagogical and scholarly experience in foreign language teaching and research in applied linguistics.

===Armenian genocide===
Sakayan is also a major contributor to the study of the Armenian Genocide. In 1993, she came across the journal of her maternal grandfather, Dr. Garabed Hatcherian, and has since dedicated herself to its publication and dissemination. The journal is a chronicle of the Smyrna catastrophe of 1922, which describes how the ancient port city in Asia Minor was destroyed by a massive fire, whereby the entire Christian population was either massacred or forced to flee. The journal is also a detailed account of the hardship Dr. Hatcherian and his family of eight endured in September 1922. Dr. Hatcherian’s diary is considered to be the most widely translated book about the Armenian Genocide. So far, the journal has appeared in nine languages, three of which were translated by Sakayan, who is also the general editor of all editions. All volumes include a detailed biography of the author, a literary analysis of the journal in an expanded introduction, 52 annotations of an historical and cultural nature, an afterword, and a bibliography. The meticulous editorial work has made ''An Armenian Doctor in Turkey'' a book that has received a highly favorable international reception&lt;ref&gt;[See worldwide reception of Dr. Hatcherian's Diary pp. 175-207] Ed.

Sakayan) ՅՈՒՇԱՐՁԱՆ Ապրիլ 11-ի – MEMORIAL to April 11. Istanbul: Belge International Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was first compiled and published in Turkish by Theodik in 1919 in Istanbul to pay tribute to the murdered intellectuals and community leaders of 1915—writers, journalists, editors, clergymen, academics, teachers, and jurists.

This latest edition of Theodik’s Hushartsan, published in commemoration of the 95th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, is a bilingual production (Armenian and Turkish) with a trilingual introductory section (Armenian, Turkish, and English) dedicated to the memory of [[Hrant Dink]], the Armenian journalist who was murdered in Istanbul in 2007. Also included in this volume is an Armenian and Turkish index of the names of the 761 Armenian martyrs of April 11 (April 24 according to the Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/06/08/theodik/ |title=Theodik’s ‘Memorial to April 11′ Republished in Turkey |publisher=Armenian Weekly |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the last decade, Sakayan has been working on a translation project with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies at YSU. This project has yielded six books that Sakayan and Makaryan translated from German into Armenian and published with YSU Press. The translations are predominantly eyewitness testimonies of the Armenian Genocide&lt;ref name=Kunzler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Künzler, Dreissig Jahre Dienst am Orient [Thirty Years of Service in the Orient] Basel 1933, Translated from German into East Armenian by Dora Sakayan and Evelina Makarian (Յակոբ Քյունցլեր, Երեսուն տարի ծառայություն Արևելքում), Yerevan State University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-1026-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zwei Kriegsjahre in Konstantinopel, Skizzen Deutsch-Jungtürkischer Moral und Politik von Dr. Harry Stuermer, Korrespondent der "Kölnischen Zeitung" In Konstantinopel, 1915–1916, Verlag Payot, Lausanne, 1917. Translation from German into Armenian in progress.]&lt;/ref&gt; that Sakayan has collected from libraries in German-speaking countries.

Sakayan's latest (and most important) work is a book entitled «Man treibt sie in die Wüste»; Clara und Fritz Sigrist-Hilty als Augenzeugen des Völkermordes an den Armeniern 1915–1918 ["They drive them into the desert": Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty as eyewitnesses of the Armenian Genocide 1915-1918] on the writings of Clara Sigrist-Hilty (1884–1988). One day after their church wedding in April 1915, the civil engineer Fritz Sigrist and the nurse Clara Hilty take the train from Werdenberg (Switzerland) and travel through the war zone to South-Eastern Turkey, where Fritz has been working at the construction of the Baghdad railway since 1910. They settle in Keller (today’s Fevzipaşa), a little town on the flank of the Amanus mountains. Shortly after their arrival, the Armenian deportations start and thousands of Armenians walk past their window. For three years the couple has to witness «the lapsing of human lights down there in the steep gorge» while they live their everyday life in their little house on the remote hillside. A visit to Aleppo makes them realize that what they were seeing in Keller on a daily basis was nothing but premeditated death marches. Things deteriorate when the skilled Armenian workers at the Baghdad railway construction site must also join those death marches. Clara feels obliged to record the atrocities, first in her journal, and later in a special eyewitness account. Fritz in his turn writes some important essays on the subject.

Sakayan has deciphered and transcribed the documents written in Gothic handwriting; she has meticulously processed the data and embedded them in the historic events of the time. Moreover, based on a memoir by Haig Aramian, Sakayan recounts the adventurous story of how in June 1916 the couple Sigrist-Hilty helped their Armenian storehouse manager Aramian to escape certain death. The structure of the book presented itself from the available archival materials. The book consists of three parts, each centered around one main character: Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty, and Haig Aramian. Through a thoughtful interplay of primary and secondary texts, Sakayan tells a coherent story of endless human suffering, but also of Christian compassion and selflessness.

===Translations===
At an early stage of her career, Sakayan’s knowledge of languages directed her towards translation and interpretation, and some of her translations were published early on.&lt;ref&gt;Manouk Abeghian (1865–1944) Der armenische Volksglaube [Armenian Folk Beliefs]. Translated from German into East Armenian by Dora Sakayan. In: Collected Works of Manouk Abeghian, Vol. 7.

This furthered her interest in the theoretical aspects of translation. During the Summer semesters between 1981 and 1986, her contact and collaboration with the Translation Department of Saarbrücken University in Germany (Chairman: Dr. Wolfram Wilss) intensified her involvement and productivity in that field and resulted in several articles published in scholarly journals and books, as well as in several papers presented at international conferences.

[[File:Nordkirchen-100415-12272-Trinkender.jpg|thumb|300px|The act of drinking portrayed in statuary—the figure employs a traditional [[waterskin]].]]
'''Drinking''' is the act of [[Ingestion|ingesting]] [[water]] or other [[liquid]]s into the body through the mouth. Water is required for many of life’s physiological processes. Both excessive and inadequate water intake are associated with health problems.

==Methods==

===In humans===
When a [[liquid]] is poured into an open human mouth, the [[swallowing]] process is completed by [[peristalsis]] which delivers the liquid to the stomach; much of the activity is abetted by gravity. The liquid may be poured from the hands or [[drinkware]] may be used as vessels. Drinking can also be performed by acts of [[inhalation]], typically when imbibing hot liquids or drinking from a spoon. Infants employ a method of suction wherein the lips are pressed tight around a source, as in [[breastfeeding]]: a combination of breath and tongue movement creates a vacuum which draws in liquid.&lt;ref name=Flint137&gt;Flint, pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===In aquatic animals===
[[Amphibian]]s and [[aquatic animal]]s which live in [[freshwater]] do not need to drink: they absorb water steadily through the skin by [[osmosis]].&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtis569&gt;Curtis, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saltwater fish]], however, drink through the mouth as they swim, and purge the excess salt through the gills.&lt;ref name=Curtis569/&gt;

===In land animals===
[[File:Cat_lapping_water_off_ground_in_slow_motion.gk.webm|thumb|Slow motion video of a cat lapping water]]
By necessity, [[terrestrial animal]]s in captivity become accustomed to drinking water, but most free-roaming animals stay hydrated through the fluids and moisture in fresh food.&lt;ref name=Mayer59&gt;Mayer, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; When conditions impel them to drink from bodies of water, the methods and motions differ greatly among species.&lt;ref name=Broom105&gt;Broom, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[desert animals]] do not drink even if water becomes available, but rely on eating [[succulent plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;

Cats, canines, and ruminants all lower the neck and lap in water with their powerful tongues.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt; Cats and canines lap up water with the tongue in a spoon-like shape.&lt;ref name=Smith238&gt;Smith, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruminants and most other herbivores partially submerge the tip of the mouth in order to draw in water by means of a plunging action with the tongue held straight.&lt;ref name=Smith237&gt;Smith, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Cats drink at a significantly slower pace than ruminants, who face greater natural predation hazards.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt; Uniquely, elephants draw water into their trunks and squirt it into their mouths.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;

Most birds scoop or draw water into the [[Buccal cavity|buccal]] areas of their bills, raising and tilting their heads back to drink. An exception is the common pigeon which can suck in water directly by inhalation.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;

==Hydration and dehydration==
[[File:Drinking Bee2.jpg|thumb|Drinking can be observed in many insect species.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;]]
{{Main|Tissue hydration|Dehydration}}
Like nearly all other life forms, humans require water for [[tissue hydration]]. Lack of hydration causes [[thirst]], a desire to drink which is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]] in response to subtle changes in the body's [[electrolyte]] levels and blood volume. A decline in total [[body water]] is called [[dehydration]] and will eventually lead to death by [[hypernatremia]]. Methods used in the [[management of dehydration]] include assisted drinking or [[oral rehydration therapy]].

An overconsumption of water can lead to [[water intoxication]], which can dangerously dilute the concentration of salts in the body. Overhydration sometimes occurs among athletes and outdoor laborers, but it can also be a sign of disease or damage to the hypothalamus. A persistent desire to drink inordinate quantities of water is a psychological condition termed [[polydipsia]]. It is often accompanied by [[polyuria]] and may itself be a symptom of [[Diabetes mellitus]] or [[Diabetes insipidus]].&lt;ref name=Provan120&gt;Provan, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human water requirements===
A daily intake of water is required for the normal physiological functioning of the [[human body]]. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] recommends a daily intake of ''total water'': not necessarily by drinking but by consumption of water contained in other [[beverage]]s and foods. The recommended intake is 3.7 liters (appx. 1 gallon) per day for an adult male, and 2.7 liters (appx. 0.75 gallon) for an adult female.&lt;ref name=USDA2011&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&amp;tax_level=3&amp;tax_subject=256&amp;topic_id=1342&amp;level3_id=5140 |title=Dietary Guidance |author=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |work=USDA Food and Nutrition Information Center |accessdate=31 August 2013 |quote=Redirects to the NAS report, [http://www.iom.edu/Global/News%20Announcements/~/media/442A08B899F44DF9AAD083D86164C75B.ashx Dietary Reference Intakes: Electrolytes and Water] (PDF) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429140007/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&amp;tax_level=3&amp;tax_subject=256&amp;topic_id=1342&amp;level3_id=5140 |archivedate=29 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, claim that a high intake of fresh [[drinking water]], separate and distinct from other sources of moisture, is necessary for good health – eight servings per day of eight fluid ounces (1.8 liters, or 0.5 gallon) is the amount recommended by many [[nutritionist]]s,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/treatments/healthy_living/nutrition/healthy_water.shtml |title=Healthy living – Water |author=Greenhalgh, Alison |year=2001 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC Health |accessdate=31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no scientific evidence supporting this recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/283/5/R993 |title=Drink at least eight glasses of water a day: Really?

==Alcoholic beverages==
{{Main|Alcoholic drink}}
The term “drinking” is often used [[Metonymy|metonymically]] for the consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Most cultures throughout history have incorporated some number of the [[List of alcoholic beverages|wide variety of "strong drinks"]] into their meals, celebrations, ceremonies, [[Toast (honor)|toasts]] and other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Gately, pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of fermented drinks in human culture goes back as early as the [[Neolithic]] Period,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Clarence Hodges. ''Alcohol, Culture, and Society''. AMS Press, 1952, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first pictorial evidence can be found in Egypt around 4,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=David|title=Ancient Period|url=http://www2.potsdam.edu/alcohol/Controversies/1114796842.html#.VICKF9xH1FI|website=History of Alcohol and Drinking around the World|publisher=State University of New York|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Alcohol consumption]] has developed into a variety of well-established [[drinking culture]]s around the world. Despite its popularity, alcohol consumption poses significant health risks. [[Alcohol abuse]] and the addiction of [[alcoholism]] are common maladies in developed countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msbgsruprofiles.pdf|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high rate of consumption can also lead to [[cirrhosis]], [[gastritis]], [[gout]], [[pancreatitis]], [[hypertension]], various forms of [[cancer]], and numerous other illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fiebach, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''eco-industrial park''' ('''EIP''') is an [[industrial park]] in which [[businesses]] cooperate with each other and with the [[Local government|local community]] in an attempt to reduce waste and pollution, efficiently share resources (such as information, materials, water, [[Electric power|energy]], [[infrastructure]], and [[natural resources]]), and help achieve [[sustainable development]], with the intention of increasing [[Profit (economics)|economic gains]] and improving [[Natural environment|environmental quality]].&lt;ref&gt;AM Hein, M Jankovic, R Farel, B Yannou 2015. A Conceptual Framework For Eco-Industrial Parks. Proceedings of the ASME 2015 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences &amp; Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE 2015&lt;/ref&gt; An EIP may also be planned, designed, and built in such a way that it makes it easier for businesses to co-operate, and that results in a more financially sound, environmentally friendly project for the developer.

The Eco-industrial Park Handbook&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Ernest A. 2001. Eco-industrial Park Handbook for Asian Developing Countries. A Report to Asian Development Bank, Environment Department, Indigo Development, Oakland, CA&lt;/ref&gt; states that "An Eco-Industrial Park is a community of manufacturing and service businesses located together on a common property. Members seek enhanced environmental, economic, and social performance through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues."

Based on the concepts of [[industrial ecology]], collaborative strategies not only include [[by-product synergy]] ("waste-to-feed" exchanges), but can also take the form of wastewater cascading, shared logistics and shipping &amp; receiving facilities, shared parking, green technology purchasing blocks, multi-partner [[green building]] retrofit, [[Distributed generation|district energy]] systems, and local education and resource centres. This is an application of a [[systems approach]], in which designs and processes/activities are integrated to address multiple objectives.

EIPs can be developed as [[greenfield land]] projects, where the eco-industrial intent is present throughout the planning, design and site construction phases, or developed through retrofits and new strategies in existing industrial developments.

==Examples==
[[Image:IndustrialSymbiosisWasteHeatExchange.png|250px|right|thumb|Example of Industrial Symbiosis. Waste steam from a waste incinerator (right) is piped to an ethanol plant (left) where it is used as in input to their production process.]]
"[[Industrial symbiosis]]" is a related but more limited concept in which companies in a region collaborate to utilize each other's by-products and otherwise share resources. In  [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|Kalundborg, Denmark]] a symbiosis network links a 1500MW [[Coal-fired power station|coal-fired power plant]] with the community and other companies.  [[Waste heat|Surplus heat]] from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes in addition to a nearby [[fish farm]], whose [[sludge]] is then sold as a [[fertilizer]].  [[Steam]] from the power plant is sold to [[Novo Nordisk]], a [[pharmaceutical]] and [[enzyme]] manufacturer, in addition to a [[Statoil]] plant.  This reuse of [[Waste heat|heat]] reduces the amount [[thermal pollution]] discharged to a nearby [[fjord]].  Additionally, a by-product from the power plant's [[sulfur dioxide]] [[scrubber]] contains [[gypsum]], which is sold to a [[wallboard]] manufacturer.  Almost all of the manufacturer's [[gypsum]] needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of [[open-pit mining]] needed.  Furthermore, [[fly ash]] and [[clinker (waste)|clinker]] from the power plant is utilized for road building and [[cement]] production.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ehrenfeld and N. Gertler(1997), "Industrial Ecology in Practice. The Evolution of Interdependence at Kalundborg",''Journal of Industrial Ecology'', 1:1, pp 67–79&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial symbiosis at Kalundborg was not created as a top-down initiative, but instead evolved gradually.  As environmental regulations became stricter, firms were motivated reduce the cost of compliance, and turn their by-products into economic products.

In [[Canada]], eco-industrial parks exist across the country and have enjoyed some success. The best known example is [[Burnside, Nova Scotia|Burnside Park]], in Halifax, Nova Scotia. With support from [[Dalhousie University]]’s Eco-Efficiency Centre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eco-efficiency.management.dal.ca/About_Us/|title=Eco‑Efficiency Centre|website=Dalhousie University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the more than 1,500 businesses have been improving their environmental performance and developing profitable partnerships. Subsequently, two greenfield industrial developments have been started in [[Alberta]]: TaigaNova Eco-Industrial Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taiganova.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206153958/http://www.taiganova.com/ |date=2008-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is in the heart of the [[Athabasca oil sands]], while Innovista Eco-Industrial Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eip.hinton.ca {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608024948/http://www.eip.hinton.ca/ |date=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a gateway to the [[Rocky Mountains]] ~300km west of [[Edmonton]].

UNIDO Viet Nam (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) has compiled a list in 2015 of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIP) in the ASEAN Economic Community in a report titled "[https://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media_upgrade/Resources/Publications/UCO_Viet_Nam_Study_FINAL.pdf Economic Zones in the ASEAN]" written by Arnault Morisson.

==Other usage==
EIPs also refer to industrial parks where a "green" approach has been taken towards the infrastructure and development of the site. This can include [[green infrastructure]] related to [[Renewable Energy Systems]]; [[stormwater]], [[groundwater]] and [[wastewater]] management; road surfaces; and [[transportation demand management]]. [[Green building]] practices can also be encouraged or mandated

EIPs are often used as a stimulus for economic diversification in the community or region where they are located. Anchor tenants, such as bio-based product manufacturers or [[waste-to-energy]] facilities, etc., can attract complementary businesses as suppliers, scavengers/recyclers, service providers, downstream users and other businesses that could benefit from eco-industrial strategies.

==Suggested usage==

It is suggested that EIPs be used as a means of growing the renewable energy sector. In the case of a Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Manufacturing plant, an EIP can increase the manufacturing efficiency to make it more economical, while reducing the environmental impact of producing the solar cells. In essence, this assists the growth of the [[renewable energy industry]] and the environmental benefits that come with replacing fossil-fuels.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Pearce, Industrial Symbiosis for Very Large Scale Photovoltaic Manufacturing, Renewable Energy 33, pp. 1101-1108, 2008,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V4S-4PJ6BJ9-1/2/f3df89a481dc23c1853d998d0d282cae]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endoderm''' is one of the three primary [[germ layer]]s in the very early [[embryo]]. The other two layers are the [[ectoderm]] (outside layer) and [[mesoderm]] (middle layer), with the endoderm being the innermost layer.&lt;ref&gt;Langman's Medical Embryology, 11th edition. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cells migrating inward along the [[archenteron]] form the inner layer of the [[gastrulation|gastrula]], which develops into the endoderm.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The endoderm consists at first of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar. It forms the [[epithelial]] lining of multiple systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In [[plant biology]], endoderm corresponds to the innermost part of the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] ([[Bark (botany)|bark]]) in young [[shoots]] and young [[Root|roots]] often consisting of a single [[Cell (biology)|cell]] layer. As the [[plant]] becomes older, more endoderm will [[Lignification|lignify]].

==Production==

The following chart shows the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s produced by the endoderm.
The embryonic endoderm develops into the interior linings of two tubes in the body, the digestive and respiratory tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbert|first=SF|title=Endoderm|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/|publisher=Sinauer Associates|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}

The '''Energy Hierarchy''' is a classification of [[energy]] options, prioritised to assist progress towards a more [[sustainable energy]] system. It is a similar approach to the [[waste hierarchy]] for minimising [[resource depletion]], and adopts a parallel sequence.

The highest priorities cover the prevention of unnecessary energy usage both through eliminating waste and improving [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The sustainable production of energy resources is the next priority. Depletive and waste-producing energy generation options are the lowest priority.

For an energy system to be sustainable: the resources applied to producing the energy must be capable of lasting indefinitely; [[energy conversion]] should produce no harmful by-products, including net emissions, nor wastes which cannot be fully recycled; and it must be capable of meeting reasonable energy demands.

==Energy saving==
{{main article|Energy conservation}}
The top priority under the Energy Hierarchy is energy conservation or the prevention of unnecessary [[use of energy]]. This category includes eliminating waste by turning off unneeded lights and appliances and by avoiding unnecessary [[travelling|journeys]]. [[Heat loss]] from buildings is a major source of energy wastage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartlett|first=Dave|title=The Top Ten Ways We Waste Energy And Water In Buildings|url=http://energy.aol.com/2011/07/26/the-top-ten-ways-we-waste-energy-and-water-in-buildings/|publisher=AOL Energy|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so improvements to building insulation and air-tightness can make a significant contribution to energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems|url=http://www.ecbcs.org/home.htm|work=About the ECBCS|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have agencies to encourage [[energy saving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Kingdom|title=Energy Saving Trust|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/|publisher=The Energy Saving Trust|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
The second priority under the energy hierarchy is to ensure that energy that is used is produced and consumed efficiently. [[Energy efficiency (physics)|Energy efficiency]] has two main aspects.

===Conversion efficiency of energy consumption===
{{main article|Efficient energy use}}
Energy efficiency is the ratio of the productive output of a device to the energy it consumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy efficiency definition and meaning|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/energy-efficiency.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency was a lower priority when energy was cheap and awareness of its environmental impact was low. In 1975 the average fuel economy of a car in the US was under 15 miles per gallon&lt;ref name=EPA_vehicles&gt;{{cite web|title=Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends: 1975 Through 2011|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/cert/mpg/fetrends/2012/420r12001a.pdf|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incandescent light bulbs, which were the most common type until the late 20th century, waste 90% of their energy as heat, with only 10% converted to useful light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn about LEDs|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=lighting.pr_what_are|publisher=Energy Star|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, energy efficiency has become a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Energy savings to be first policy priority for 2030|url=http://www.energy-cities.eu/IMG/pdf/20121120_press_release_Coalition_call_for_2030_energy_savings.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013|newspaper=Energy Cities (Europe)|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last reported average fuel efficiency of US cars had almost doubled from the 1975 level;&lt;ref name=EPA_vehicles /&gt; LED lighting is now being promoted which are between five and ten times more efficient than incandescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LED basics|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/sslbasics_ledbasics.html#how_efficient|work=Solid State Lighting|publisher=USDOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many household appliances are now required to display [[Energy input labeling|labels]] to show their energy efficiency.

===Conversion efficiency of energy production===
{{main article|Energy conversion efficiency}}
Losses are incurred when energy is harvested from the natural resource from which it is derived, such as fossil fuels, radioactive materials, solar radiation or other sources. Most electricity production is in thermal power stations, where much of the source energy is lost as heat. The average efficiency of world electricity production in 2009 was c.37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Energy Balance for the World|url=http://www.iea.org/stats/balancetable.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=29|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A priority in the Energy Hierarchy is to improve the efficiency of energy conversion, whether in traditional power stations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency in electricity generation|url=http://www.eurelectric.org/Download/Download.aspx?DocumentID=13549|publisher=Eurelectric|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by improving the [[Photovoltaic power station#System performance|performance ratio]] of [[Photovoltaic power stations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012|url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/downloads/pdf-files/aktuelles/photovoltaics-report.pdf|work=Photovoltaics Report|publisher=Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other energy sources.

Overall efficiency and sustainability can also be improved by capacity- or [[Climate change mitigation#Fuel switching|fuel-switching]] from less efficient, less sustainable resources to better ones; but this is mainly covered under the [[#Low impact energy production|fourth level]] of the hierarchy.

==Sustainable energy production==
{{main article|Renewable energy}}
Renewable energy describes naturally occurring, theoretically inexhaustible sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Renewable Energy|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/renewable-energy.html|publisher=Business Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources are treated as being inexhaustible, or naturally replenished, and fall into two classes.

===Elemental renewables===
The first class of renewables derive from climatic or elemental sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy |url=http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/students/options/sectors/energy/renewable/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419123506/http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/students/options/sectors/energy/renewable/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-19 |publisher=Manchester University |accessdate=23 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as sunlight, wind, waves, tides or rainfall ([[hydropower]]). [[Geothermal energy]] from the heat of the earth's core also falls in this category.

These are treated as being inexhaustible because most derive ultimately from energy emanating from the [[sun]], which has an estimated life of 6.5 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Sun's lifetime going to be?|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a10395.html|work=Ask the space scientist|publisher=NASA|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bio-energy===
The other main class of renewables, [[bioenergy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Renewable Energy|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/tech/home|publisher=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; derives from biomass, where the relatively short growing cycle means that usage is replenished by new growth. Bioenergy is usually converted by combustion, and therefore gives rise to carbon emissions. It is treated as carbon neutral overall, because an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide will have been extracted from the atmosphere during the growing cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pingoud|first=Kim|title=Harvested Wood Products|volume=4|series=IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_12_Ch12_HWP.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioenergy sources can be solid, such as wood and [[energy crop]]s; liquid, such as biofuels; or gaseous, such as biomethane from anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is bioenergy?|url=http://www.bioenergywiki.net/What_is_bioenergy|publisher=Bioenergy Wiki|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low impact energy production==
{{main article|Low carbon power}}
The next priority in the hierarchy covers energy sources that are not entirely sustainable, but have a low environmental impact. These include the use of fossil fuels with [[carbon capture and storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon dioxide capture and storage|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf|work=Technical Report|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear energy is sometimes treated as a low impact source, because it has low carbon emissions.

==High impact energy production==

The lowest priority under the energy hierarchy is energy production using unsustainables sources, such as unabated fossil fuels. Some also place nuclear energy in this category, rather than the one above, because of the required management/storage of highly hazardous [[radioactive waste]] over extremely long (hundreds of thousands of years or more) timeframes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sovacool|first=Benjamin|title=Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-4322-75-1|pages=308|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/7895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depletion of uranium resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Choi|first=Charles|title=Uranium Supply Decline Clouds Nuclear Power's Future|url=http://www.livescience.com/2463-uranium-supply-decline-clouds-nuclear-power-future.html|publisher=World Science|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a consensus that the share of such energy sources must decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An energy vision for a planet under pressure|url=http://www.igbp.net/publications/policybriefsforrio20summit/policybriefsforrio20summit/anenergyvisionforaplanetunderpressure.5.7edb9cae136f47276108000494.html|publisher=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this tier, there are possibilities for limiting adverse impacts by [[Climate change mitigation#Fuel switching|switching]] from the most damaging fuel sources, such as coal, to less emissive sources, such as gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Salovaara|first=Jackson|title=Coal to Natural Gas Fuel Switching and CO2 Emissions Reduction|work=Harvard |year=2011|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/hepg/Papers/2011/Salovaara_SeniorThesis_FINAL.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many suggest that when such high impact energy usage has been minimised, the effects of any unavoidable residual usage should be counterbalanced by emissions [[offsetting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liyanage|first=Chandratilak De Silva|title=Sustainable Energy Management and CSR|series=Encyclopedia of Corporate Social Responsibility|url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/343555.html|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the energy hierarchy==
The Energy Hierarchy was first proposed in 2005 by [[Philip Wolfe (engineer)|Philip Wolfe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=A proposed Energy Hierarchy|url=http://www.wolfeware.com/library/publications/EnergyHierarchy.pdf|publisher=WolfeWare|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was Director General of the [[Renewable Energy Association]]. This first version had three levels; energy efficiency, renewables and traditional energy production. It was endorsed and adopted in 2006 by a consortium of institutions, associations and other bodies in the Sustainable Energy Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Groups release energy 'manifesto'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4921896.stm|accessdate=23 February 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the concept has been adopted and refined by others in the energy industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Institution of Mechanical Engineers |title=The Energy Hierarchy |year=2009 |series=Energy Policy Statement |issue=09/03 |url=http://www.imeche.org/Libraries/Position_Statements-Energy/EnergyHierarchyIMechEPolicy.sflb.ashx |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625001718/http://www.imeche.org/Libraries/Position_Statements-Energy/EnergyHierarchyIMechEPolicy.sflb.ashx |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thinking differently - the energy hierarchy|url=http://www.cabe.org.uk/sustainable-places/advice/the-energy-hierarchy|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110118095356/http:/www.cabe.org.uk/sustainable-places/advice/the-energy-hierarchy|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-01-18|publisher=UK Government National Archives|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Energy Hierarchy |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/climate/sustainable_energy.jsp |work=The London Plan |publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305005446/http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/climate/sustainable_energy.jsp |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25606">The "'''eternal return'''" is an idea for interpreting religious behavior proposed by the historian [[Mircea Eliade]]; it is a belief expressed through behavior (sometimes implicitly, but often explicitly) that one is able to become contemporary with or return to the "[[Mythology|mythical]] age"—the time when the events described in one's myths occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.&amp;nbsp;xiii&lt;/ref&gt; It should be distinguished from the philosophical concept of ''[[eternal return]]''.

==Sacred and profane==
According to Eliade,
{{Quote | all the definitions given up till now of the religious phenomenon have one thing in common: Each has its own way of showing that the [[sacred]] and the [[Religion|religious life]] are the opposite of the [[Sacrilege|profane]] and [[Secularity|secular life]].&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This concept had already been extensively formulated by the [[France|French]] [[sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;[[Durkheim]], ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', (1912, English translation by Joseph Swain: 1915) The Free Press, 1965. {{ISBN|0-02-908010-X}}, new translation by Karen E. Fields 1995, {{ISBN|0-02-907937-3}} (p.&amp;nbsp;47)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis-inline|date=January 2012}}  Scholars such as [[Jack Goody]] gave evidence that it may not be universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = [[Australia|AU]] | url= http://epress.anu.edu.au/nts/mobile_devices/ch06s03.html |title= The sacred-profane distinction is not universal |accessdate = 2007-07-10 | publisher = ANU | quote = neither do the [[Lo Dagaa]] [group in Gonja ''editor note''] appear to have any concepts at all equivalent to the vaguer and not unrelated dichotomy between the sacred and the profane}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane – Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work= J rank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sharp distinction between [[the sacred and the profane]] is Eliade's trademark theory. According to Eliade, traditional man distinguishes two levels of existence: (1) the Sacred, and (2) the profane world. (Here "the Sacred" can be God, gods, mythical ancestors, or any other beings who established the world's structure.) To traditional man, things "acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality".&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmos and History'', p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Something in our world is only "real" to the extent that it conforms to the Sacred or the patterns established by the Sacred.

Hence, there is profane space, and there is sacred space. Sacred space is space where the Sacred manifests itself; unlike profane space, sacred space has a sense of direction:
{{Quote | In the homogeneous and infinite expanse, in which no point of reference is possible and hence no orientation is established, the [[hierophany]] [appearance of the Sacred] reveals an absolute fixed point, a center.&lt;ref name="Profane pg. 21"&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Where the Sacred intersects our world, it appears in the form of ideal models (e.g., the actions and commandments of gods or mythical heroes). All things become truly "real" by imitating these models. Eliade claims: "For archaic man, reality is a function of the imitation of a celestial [[archetype]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Comos and History'', p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence for this view, in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', he cites a belief of the [[Iran]]ian [[Zurvanism|Zurvanites]]. The Zurvanites believed that each thing on Earth corresponds to a sacred, celestial counterpart: for the physical sky, there is a sacred sky; for the physical Earth, there is a sacred Earth; actions are virtuous by conforming to a sacred pattern.&lt;ref name="Myth of the Eternal Return p. 6"&gt;''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; These are some other examples Eliade gives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to [[Religions of the Ancient Near East|Mesopotamian beliefs]], the [[Tigris]] has its model in the star [[Ishtar|Anunit]] and the [[Euphrates]] in the star of [[Pisces (constellation)|the Swallow]]. A [[Sumer]]ian text tells of the "place of the creation of the gods," where "the [divinity of] the flocks and grains" is to be found. For the [[Ural–Altaic]] peoples the mountains, in the same way, have an ideal archetype in the sky. In [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], places and [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] were named after the celestial "fields": first the celestial fields were known, then they were identified in terrestrial geography.&lt;ref name="Myth of the Eternal Return p. 6"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further, there is profane time, and there is sacred time. According to Eliade, myths describe a time that is fundamentally different from historical time (what modern man would consider "normal" time). "In short," says Eliade, "myths describe ... breakthroughs of the sacred (or the 'supernatural') into the World".&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical age is the time when the Sacred entered our world, giving it form and meaning: "The manifestation of the sacred ontologically founds the world".&lt;ref name="Profane pg. 21"/&gt; Thus, the mythical age is sacred time, the only time that has value for traditional man.

==Origin as power==
According to Eliade, in the archaic worldview, the power of a thing resides in its origin, so that "knowing the origin of an object, an animal, a plant, and so on is equivalent to acquiring a magical power over them".&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt; The way a thing was created establishes that thing's nature, the pattern to which it should conform. By gaining control over the origin of a thing, one also gains control over the thing itself.

Eliade concluded that, if origin and power are to be the same, "it is the first manifestation of a thing that is significant and valid".&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;34&lt;/ref&gt; The Sacred first manifested itself in the events of the mythical age; hence, traditional man sees the mythical age as the foundation of value.

==Sacred time==
Eliade's theory implies that as the power of a thing lies in its origin, the entire world's power lies in the [[cosmogony]]. If the Sacred established all valid patterns in the beginning, during the time recorded in myth, then the mythical age is sacred time—the only time that contains any value. Man's life only has value to the extent that it conforms to the patterns of the mythical age.

The [[Dreamtime|religion]] of the [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginals]] is supposed to contain many examples of the veneration paid to the mythical age. Just before the dawn of the first day, the [[Bagadjimbiri]] brothers emerged from the Earth in the form of [[dingo]]s, and then turned into human giants whose heads touched the sky. Before the Bagadjimbiri came, nothing had existed. But when the sun rose, and the brothers began naming things, the "plants and animals began really to exist".&lt;ref name="Myths pg. 191"&gt;''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.&amp;nbsp;191&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers met a group of people and organized them into a civilized society. The people of this tribe—the Karadjeri of [[Australia]]—still imitate the two brothers in many ways:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the Bagadjimbiri stopped to urinate [...] That is the reason why the Australian Karadjeri stop and take up a special position in order to urinate. [...] The brothers stopped and ate a certain grain raw; but they immediately burst into laughter, because they knew that one ought not eat it so [...] and since then men imitate them whenever they have this grain cooked. The Bagadjimbiri threw a primal (a kind of large baton) at an animal and killed it—and this is how men have done it ever since. A great many myths describe the manner in which the brothers Bagadjimbiri founded all the customs of the Karadjeri, and even their behavior.&lt;ref name="Myths pg. 191"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The mythical age was the time when the Sacred appeared and established reality. For traditional man, Eliade argues, (1) only the first appearance of something has value; (2) only the Sacred has value; and, therefore, (3) only the first appearance of the Sacred has value. Because the Sacred first appeared in the mythical age, only the mythical age has value. According to Eliade's hypothesis, "primitive man was interested only in the beginnings ... to him it mattered little what had happened to himself, or to others like him, in more or less distant times".&lt;ref name="Myths pg. 44"&gt;''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.&amp;nbsp;44&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, traditional societies express a "nostalgia for the origins",&lt;ref name="Myths pg. 44"/&gt; a yearning to return to the mythical age. To traditional man, life only has value in sacred time.

==Myths, rituals, and their purpose==
Eliade also explained how traditional man could find value for his own life (in a vision of where all events occurring after the mythical age cannot have value or reality); he indicated that, if the Sacred's essence lies only in its first appearance, then any later appearance must actually be the first appearance. Thus, an imitation of a mythical event is actually the mythical event itself, happening again—[[myth and ritual|myths and rituals]] carry one back to the mythical age:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In imitating the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythic [[hero]], or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time."&lt;ref&gt;''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Myth and ritual are vehicles of "eternal return" to the mythical age. Traditional man's myth- and ritual-filled life constantly unites him with sacred time, giving his existence value. As an example of this phenomenon, Eliade cites church services, by which churchgoers "return" to the sacred time of Scripture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Just as a church constitutes a break in plane in the profane space of a modern city, [so] the service celebrated inside [the church] marks a break in profane temporal duration. It is no longer today's historical time that is present—the time that is experienced, for example, in the adjacent streets—but the time in which the historical existence of Jesus Christ occurred, the time sanctified by his preaching, by his passion, death, and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cyclic time==
Eliade attributes the well-known "cyclic" view of time in ancient thought to the eternal return. In many religions, a ritual cycle correlates certain parts of the year with mythical events, making each year a repetition of the mythical age. For instance, Australian Aboriginal peoples annually reenact the events of the "Dreamtime":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The animals and plants created ''[[List of Latin phrases (F–O)#I|in illo tempore]]'' by the Supernatural Beings are ritually re-created. In [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]] the rock paintings, which are believed to have been painted by the Ancestors, are repainted in order to reactivate their creative force, as it was first manifested in the mythical times, at the beginning of the World."&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Every New Year, the people of [[Mesopotamia]] reenacted the ''[[Enuma Elish]]'', a creation myth, in which the god [[Marduk]] slays [[Tiamat]], the primordial monster, and creates the world from her body. They correlated the birth of the year with the mythical birth of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;48&lt;/ref&gt;

By periodically bringing man back to the mythical age, these liturgical cycles turn time itself into a circle. Those who perform an annual ritual return to the same point in time every 365 days: "With each periodical [ritual] festival, the participants find the same sacred time—the same that had been manifested in the festival of the previous year or in the festival of a century earlier."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, some traditional societies express their cyclic experience of time by equating the world with the year:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In a number of North American Indian languages the term world (= Cosmos) is also used in the sense of year. The Yokuts says 'the world has passed,' meaning 'a year has gone by.' For the Yuki, the year is expressed by the words for earth or world. [...] The cosmos is conceived [of] as a living unity that is born, develops, and dies on the last day of the year, to be reborn on New Year's Day. [...] At every New Year, time begins ''ab initio''."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The New Year ritual reenacts the mythical beginning of the cosmos. Therefore, by the logic of the eternal return, each New Year ''is'' the beginning of the cosmos. Thus, time flows in a closed circle, always returning to the sacred time celebrated during the New Year: the cosmos's entire duration is limited to one year, which repeats itself indefinitely.

These ritual cycles do more than give humans a sense of value. Because traditional man identifies reality with the Sacred, he believes that the world can endure only if it remains in sacred time. He periodically revives sacred time through myths and rituals in order to keep the universe in existence. In many cultures, this belief appears to be consciously held and clearly stated. From the perspective of these societies, the world
&lt;blockquote&gt;"must be periodically renewed or it may perish. The idea that the [[Cosmos]] is threatened with ruin if not annually re-created provides the inspiration for the chief festival of the [[California]] [[Karuk|Karok]], [[Hupa]], and [[Yurok tribe|Yurok]] tribes. In the respective languages the ceremony is called 'repair' or 'fixing' of the world, and, in English, 'New Year'. Its purpose is to re-establish or strengthen the Earth for the following year or two years."&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human creativity==
To some, the theory of the eternal return may suggest a view of traditional societies as stagnant and unimaginative, afraid to try anything new. However, Eliade argues that the eternal return does not lead to "a total cultural immobility".&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 140"&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;140&lt;/ref&gt; If it did, traditional societies would never have changed or evolved, and "ethnology knows of no single people that has not changed in the course of time".&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 140"/&gt; The mere fact that traditional societies have colonized new lands and invented new technologies proves that the eternal return hasn't suppressed their sense of initiative.&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 141"&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;141&lt;/ref&gt;

Far from suppressing creativity, Eliade argues, the eternal return promotes it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There is no reason to hesitate before setting out on a sea voyage, because the mythical Hero has already made [such a voyage] in the fabulous Time. All that is needed is to follow his example. Similarly, there is no reason to fear settling an unknown, wild territory, because one knows what to do. One has merely to repeat the cosmogonic ritual, whereupon the unknown territory (= 'Chaos') is transformed into 'Cosmos'."&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 141"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Eliade, traditional man has endless creative possibilities because "the possibilities for applying the mythical model are endless".&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 141"/&gt;

=="Terror of History"==
According to Eliade, this yearning to remain in the mythical age causes a "terror of history". Traditional man desires to escape the linear march of events, empty of any inherent value or sacrality. In Chapter 4 of ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'' (entitled "The Terror of History") and in the appendix to ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', Eliade suggests that the abandonment of mythical thought and the full acceptance of linear, historical time, with its "terror", is one of the reasons for [[Modernity|modern man]]'s [[Anxiety|anxieties]]. Traditional societies escape this anxiety to an extent, as they refuse to completely acknowledge historical time. Eliade describes the difference between ancient and modern man's reactions to history, as well as modern man's impotence before the terror of history, as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In our day, when historical pressure no longer allows any escape, how can man tolerate the catastrophes and horrors of history—from collective deportations and massacres to atomic bombings—if beyond them he can glimpse no sign, no transhistorical meaning; if they are only the blind play of economic, social, or political forces, or, even worse, only the result of the 'liberties' that a minority takes and exercises directly on the stage of universal history?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We know how, in the past, humanity has been able to endure the sufferings we have enumerated: they were regarded as a punishment inflicted by God, the syndrome of the decline of the 'age,' and so on. And it was possible to accept them precisely because they had a metahistorical meaning [...] Every war rehearsed the struggle between good and evil, every fresh social injustice was identified with the sufferings of the Saviour (or, for example, in the pre-Christian world, with the passion of a divine messenger or vegetation god), each new massacre repeated the glorious end of the martyrs. [...] By virtue of this view, tens of millions of men were able, for century after century, to endure great historical pressures without despairing, without committing suicide or falling into that spiritual aridity that always brings with it a relativistic or nihilistic view of history"&lt;ref&gt;''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', pp.&amp;nbsp;151–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Terror of the eternal return==
In general, according to Eliade, traditional man sees the eternal return as something positive, even necessary. However, in some religions, such as [[Buddhism]] and certain forms of [[Hinduism]], the traditional cyclic view of time becomes a source of terror:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "In certain highly evolved societies, the intellectual [[élite]]s progressively detach themselves from the patterns of traditional religion. The periodical resanctification of cosmic time then proves useless and without meaning. [...] But ''repetition emptied of its religious content necessarily leads to a pessimistic vision of existence''. When it is no longer a vehicle for reintegrating a primordial situation [...] that is, ''when it is desacralized'', cyclic time becomes terrifying; it is seen as a circle forever turning on itself, repeating itself to infinity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the world becomes desacralized, the traditional cyclic view of time is too firmly entrenched to simply vanish. It survives, but in a profane form (such as the myth of [[reincarnation]]). Time is no longer static, as for the Karadjeri, for whom almost every action imitates a mythical model, keeping the world constantly in the mythical age. Nor is time cyclical but sacred, as for the ancient Mesopotamians, whose ritual calendar periodically returned the world to the mythical age. Rather, for some [[Dharmic religions]], "time was homologized to the cosmic illusion (''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'')".&lt;ref name="Profane pg. 109"&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of traditional humanity, linear history is profane, and sacredness lies in cyclic time. But, in Buddhism, [[Jainism]], and some forms of Hinduism, even cyclic time has become profane. The Sacred cannot be found in the mythical age; it exists outside all ages. Thus, human fulfilment does not lie in returning to a sacred time, but in escaping from time altogether, in "a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] of the cosmos."&lt;ref name="Profane pg. 109"/&gt; In these religions, the "eternal return" is less like the eternal return in most traditional societies (for whom time has an objective beginning, to which one should return) and more like the philosophical concept of eternal return—an endless cosmic cycle, with no beginning and, thus, no inherently sacred time.

==Scholarly criticism==
Although immensely influential in religious studies, the ideas behind Eliade's hypothesis of the eternal return are less well accepted in anthropology and sociology. According to the classicist G. S. Kirk, this is because Eliade overextends the application of his ideas: for example, Eliade claims that the modern myth of the "noble savage" results from the religious tendency to idealize the primordial, mythical age.&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth, footnote, p. 255"&gt;Kirk, ''Myth'', footnote, p.&amp;nbsp;255&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk claims that Eliade's relative unpopularity among anthropologists and sociologists also results from Eliade's assumption—essential for belief in the eternal return as Eliade formulates it—that primitive and archaic cultures had concepts such as "being" and "real", although they lacked words for them.&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth, footnote, p. 255"/&gt;

Kirk thinks Eliade's theory of eternal return applies to some cultures. Specifically, he agrees that Australian Aborigines used myths and rituals "to bring the Dreamtime" (the Australian mythical age) "into the present with potent and fruitful results".&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 64"&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.&amp;nbsp;64&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kirk argues, Eliade takes this Australian phenomenon and applies it to other cultures uncritically. In short, Kirk sees Eliade's theory of eternal return as a universalization of the Australian Dreamtime concept.&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 64"/&gt;

As two counterexamples to the eternal return, Kirk cites Native American mythology and Greek mythology. The eternal return is nostalgic: by retelling and reenacting mythical events, Australian Aborigines aim to evoke and relive the Dreamtime. However, Kirk believes that Native American myths "are not evocative or nostalgic in tone, but tend to be detailed and severely practical".&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 64"/&gt; In many Native American mythologies, animals once acted like humans, during the mythical age; but they don't any longer: the division between animals and men is now a firm one, and according to Kirk, "that in itself reduces the effectiveness of myth-telling as a reconstitution" of the mythical age.&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 65"&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt; As for Greek myths, many of them fall outside any sacred age of origins: this challenges Eliade's claim that almost all myths are about origins, and that people retell and reenact myths to return to the time of origins.&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 65"/&gt; (Note that the classicist Kirk uses a much broader definition of "myth" than many professional folklorists. According to the classical definition used by folklorists, many Greek stories conventionally called "myths" are not myths, precisely ''because'' they fall outside a sacred age of origins.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;/ref&gt;)

Even Wendy Doniger, a religious-studies scholar and Eliade's successor at the University of Chicago, claims (in the Introduction to Eliade's own ''Shamanism'') that the eternal return does not apply to all myths and rituals, although it may apply to many of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism'', p.&amp;nbsp;xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in popular culture==
In [[T. A. Barron]]'s ''[[The Lost Years of Merlin]]'' (the "Sacred Time" chapter), Merlin's mother says that "stories"—specifically, myths—are "real enough to help [her] live. And work. And find the meaning hidden in every dream, every leaf, every drop of dew."&lt;ref name="Barron, pg. 36"&gt;Barron, p.&amp;nbsp;36&lt;/ref&gt; She states that "they dwell in sacred time, which flows in a circle. Not historical time, which runs in a line."&lt;ref name="Barron, pg. 36"/&gt;

[[Jean Cocteau]]'s screenplay for ''[[L'Éternel retour]]'' portrays the timeless nature of the myth of [[Tristan and Isolde]].

The Heavy Metal band Therion released "Eternal Return" on their 2000 album "Deggail." The song is thematically in line with Eliade's concept of the eternal return and would seem to be inspired by it.

A '''flexible organic light emitting diode''' ('''FOLED''') is a type of [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) incorporating a flexible plastic [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]] on which the [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] [[organic semiconductor]] is deposited. This enables the device to be bent or rolled while still operating. Currently the focus of research in industrial and academic groups, flexible OLEDs form one method of fabricating a [[rollable display]].

==Technical details and applications==

An OLED emits light due to the [[electroluminescence]] of thin films of [[organic semiconductor]]s approximately 100&amp;nbsp;nm thick. Regular OLEDs are usually fabricated on a glass [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]], but by replacing glass with a flexible plastic such as [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/357477a0|title=Flexible light-emitting diodes made from soluble conducting polymers|year=1992|last1=Gustafsson|first1=G.|last2=Cao|first2=Y.|last3=Treacy|first3=G.

Such materials may not be suitable for comparable devices based on  [[inorganic]] [[semiconductor]]s due to the need for [[lattice matching]] and the high temperature fabrication procedure involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/16.605453|title=Achieving full-color organic light-emitting devices for lightweight, flat-panel displays|year=1997|last1=Burrows|first1=P.

==Disadvantages==
{{see also|Organic light-emitting diode#Disadvantages|l1=List of OLED disadvantages}}
Both flexible substrate itself as well as the process of bending the device introduce [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] into the materials. There may be residual stress from the deposition of layers onto a flexible substrate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiang|first1=C.-J.|last2=Winscom|first2=C.|last3=Monkman|first3=A.|year=2010|title=Electroluminescence characterization of FOLED devices under two type of external stresses caused by bending|journal=Organic Electronics|volume=11|pages=1870–1875|doi=10.1016/j.orgel.2010.08.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; thermal stresses due to the different coefficient of [[thermal expansion]] of materials in the device,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsueh|first1=C.

Stress introduced into the organic layers may lower the efficiency or brightness of the device as it is deformed, or cause complete breakdown of the device altogether. [[Indium tin oxide]] (ITO), the material most commonly used as the transparent [[anode]], is brittle. Fracture of the anode can occur which can increase the [[sheet resistance]] of the ITO or disrupt the layered structure of the OLED.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leterrier|first1=Y.|last2=Médico|first2=L.|last3=Månson|first3=J.-A.

[[Micro-encapsulation|Encapsulation]] is another challenge for flexible OLED devices.  The materials in an OLED are sensitive to air and moisture which lead to [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] of the materials themselves as well as [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] of excited states within the molecule.  The common method of encapsulation for regular OLEDs is to seal the organic layer between glass.  Flexible encapsulation methods are generally not as effective a barrier to air and moisture as glass, and current research aims to improve the encapsulation of flexible organic light emitting diodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Han|first1=J.-M.|last2=Han|first2=J.-W.|last3=Chun|first3=J.-Y.|last4=Ok|first4=C.-H.|last5=Seo|first5=D.-S.|year=2008|title=Novel Encapsulation Method for Flexible Organic Light-Emitting Diodes using Poly(dimethylsiloxane)|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|volume=47|pages=8986–8988|doi=10.1143/JJAP.47.8986|bibcode = 2008JaJAP..47.8986H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=S.|last2=Zhang|first2=D.|last3=Li|first3=Y.|last4=Duan|first4=L.|last5=Dong|first5=G.|last6=Wang|first6=L.|last7=Qiu|first7=Y.|year=2008|title=New hybrid encapsulation for flexible organic light-emitting devices on plastic substrates|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|volume=53|pages=958–960|doi=10.1007/s11434-008-0088-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gene redundancy''' is the existence of multiple genes in the genome of an organism that perform the same function. This is the case for many sets of [[paralogous]] genes. When an individual gene in such a set is disrupted by mutation or targeted [[gene knockout|knockout]], there can be little effect on [[phenotype]] as a result of gene redundancy, whereas the effect is large for the knockout of a gene with only one copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pérez-Pérez JM, Candela H, Micol JL |title=Understanding synergy in genetic interactions |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=368–76 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19665253 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gene Duplication.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Figure 1. Common mechanisms of gene duplication.]]

== Origin and Evolution of Redundant Genes ==
Gene redundancy most often results from [[Gene duplication]]. When a gene is duplicated within a genome, the two copies are initially functionally redundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Genetic Redundancy Caused By Gene Duplications And Its Evolution In Networks Of Transcriptional Regulators|last = Wagner|first = Andreas|date = 1996|journal = Biological Cybernetics|doi = 10.1007/s004220050267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the more common mechanisms of gene duplication are [[Retroposon|retroposition,]] unequal [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]], and non-homologous segmental duplication. Retroposition is when the mRNA transcript of a gene is reverse transcribed back into DNA and inserted into the genome at a different location. During unequal crossing over, [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] chromosomes exchange uneven portions of their DNA. This can lead to the transfer of one chromosome's gene to the other chromosome, leaving two of the same gene on one chromosome, and no copies of the gene on the other chromosome. Non-homologous duplications result from replication errors that shift the gene of interest into a new position. A tandem duplication then occurs, creating a chromosome with two copies of the same gene. Figure 1 to the left provides a good visual explanation of these three mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurles|first=Matthew|title=Gene Duplication: The Genomic Trade in Spare Parts|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020206|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=2|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020206|pmc=449868|pmid=15252449|page=e206}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Evolution of redundant genes.png|thumb|398x398px|Figure 2. After a duplication event, redundant genes undergo either subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or gene loss]]As the genome is replicated over many generations, the redundant gene's function will most likely evolve due to [[Genetic drift]]. This means that the gene will acquire mutations that change the overall function. The three mechanisms of functional differentiation in genes are nonfunctionalization (or gene loss), neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Evolutionary Fate and Consequences of Duplicate Genes|last = Lynch|first = M.|date = 2000|journal = Science|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During nonfunctionalization, or degeneration/gene loss, one copy of the duplicated gene acquires mutations that render it inactive or [[Gene silencing|silent]]. At this time, the gene has no function and is called a [[pseudogene]]. Pseudogenes can be lost over time due to genetic mutations. Neofunctionalization occurs when one copy of the gene accumulates mutations that give the gene a new, beneficial function that is different than the original function. Subfunctionalization occurs when both copies of the redundant gene acquire mutations. Each copy becomes only partially active; two of these partial copies then act as one normal copy of the original gene. Figure 2 to the right provides a visual explanation.

== Gene Maintenance Hypotheses ==
The evolution and origin of redundant genes remain unknown, largely because evolution happens over such a long period of time. Theoretically, a gene can not be maintained without mutation unless it has a selective pressure acting on it. Gene redundancy, therefore, would allow both copies of the gene to accumulate mutations as long as the other was still able to perform its function. This means that all redundant genes should theoretically become a [[pseudogene]] and eventually be lost. Scientists have devised two hypothesis as to why redundant genes can remain in the genome: the backup hypothesis and the piggyback hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Genetic Redundancies and Their Evolutionary Maintenance|last = Zhang|first = Jianzhi|date = 2012|journal = Evolutionary Systems Biology Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The backup hypothesis proposes that redundant genes remain in the genome as a sort of "back-up plan". If the original gene loses its function, the redundant gene is there to take over and keep the cell alive. The piggyback hypothesis states that two [http://homepage.usask.ca/~ctl271/857/def_homolog.shtml paralogs] in the genome have some kind of non-overlapping function as well as the redundant function. In this case, the redundant part of the gene remains in the genome due to the proximity to the area that codes for the unique function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Qian|first = Wenfeng|last2 = Liao|first2 = Ben-Yang|last3 = Chang|first3 = Andrew Y.-F.|last4 = Zhang|first4 = Jianzhi|date = 2010-10-01|title = Maintenance of duplicate genes and their functional redundancy by reduced expression|journal = Trends in Genetics|volume = 26|issue = 10|pages = 425–430|doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.002|issn = 0168-9525|pmc = 2942974|pmid = 20708291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason redundant genes remain in the genome is an ongoing question and gene redundancy is being studied by researchers everywhere. There are many hypotheses in addition to the backup and piggyback models. For example, at the University of Michigan, a study provides the theory that redundant genes are maintained in the genome by reduced expression.

== Research ==

=== Gene Families and Phylogeny ===
Researchers often use the history of redundant genes in the form of [[Gene family|gene families]] to learn about the phylogeny of a species. It takes time for redundant genes to undergo functional diversification;  the degree of diversification between [http://homepage.usask.ca/~ctl271/857/def_homolog.shtml orthologs] tells us how closely related the two genomes are. Gene duplication events can also be detected by looking at increases in gene duplicates.

A good example of using gene redundancy in evolutionary studies is the [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00438-015-1142-3 Evolution of the KCS gene family in plants]. This paper studies how one KCS gene evolved into an entire gene family via duplication events. The number of redundant genes in the species allows researchers to determine when duplication events took place and how closely related species are.

=== Locating and Characterizing Redundant Genes ===
Currently, there are three ways to detect paralogs in a known genomic sequence: simple homology (FASTA), gene family evolution ([http://treefam.genomics.org.cn/ TreeFam]) and [http://eggnogdb.embl.de/ orthology (eggNOG v3]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bina|first=Minou|date=2006-01-01|title=Identification and mapping of paralogous genes on a known genomic DNA sequence|journal=[[Methods in Molecular Biology]]|volume=338|pages=21–29|doi=10.1385/1-59745-097-9:21|issn=1064-3745|pmid=16888348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Human Genome Project]]'s completion, researchers are able to annotate the human genome much more easily. Using online databases like the [https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway Genome Browser] at UCSC, researchers can look for homology in the sequence of their gene of interest.

== Human Redundant Genes ==

=== Olfactory Receptors ===
The Human Olfactory Receptor (OR) gene family contains 339 intact genes and 297 pseudogenes. These genes are found in different locations throughout the genome, but only about 13% are on different chromosomes or on distantly spaced loci. 172 subfamilies of OR genes have been found in humans, each at its own loci. Because the genes in each of these subfamilies are structurally and functionally similar, and in close proximity to each other, it is hypothesized that each evolved from single genes undergoing duplication events. The high number of subfamilies in humans explains why we are able to recognize so many odors.

Human OR genes have homologues in other mammals, such as mice, that demonstrate the evolution of Olfactory Receptor genes. One particular family that is involved in the initial event of odor perception has been found to be highly conserved throughout all of vertebrate evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malnic|first=Bettina|last2=Godfrey|first2=Paul A.|last3=Buck|first3=Linda B.|date=2004-02-24|title=The human olfactory receptor gene family|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/8/2584|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|language=en|volume=101|issue=8|pages=2584–2589|doi=10.1073/pnas.0307882100|issn=0027-8424|pmc=356993|pmid=14983052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease ===
Duplication events and redundant genes have often been thought to have a role in some human diseases. Large scale whole genome duplication events that occurred early in vertebrate evolution may be the reason that human monogenic disease genes often contain a high number of redundant genes. Chen et al. hypothesizes that the functionally redundant paralogs in human monogenic disease genes mask the effects of dominant deletorious mutations, thereby maintaining the disease gene in the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Wei-Hua|last2=Zhao|first2=Xing-Ming|last3=van Noort|first3=Vera|last4=Bork|first4=Peer|date=2013-05-01|title=Human Monogenic Disease Genes Have Frequently Functionally Redundant Paralogs|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=9|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003073|issn=1553-734X|pmc=3656685|pmid=23696728|page=e1003073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whole genome duplications may be a leading cause of retention of some tumor causing genes in the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malaguti|first=Giulia|last2=Singh|first2=Param Priya|last3=Isambert|first3=Hervé|date=2014-05-01|title=On the retention of gene duplicates prone to dominant deleterious mutations|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=93|pages=38–51|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2014.01.004|issn=1096-0325|pmid=24530892}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Strout et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strout|first=Matthew P.|last2=Marcucci|first2=Guido|last3=Bloomfield|first3=Clara D.|last4=Caligiuri|first4=Michael A.|date=1998-03-03|title=The partial tandem duplication of ALL1 (MLL) is consistently generated by Alu-mediated homologous recombination in  acute myeloid leukemia|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=95|issue=5|pages=2390–2395|issn=0027-8424|pmc=19353|pmid=9482895|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.5.2390}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that tandem duplication events, likely via homologous recombination, are linked to [[acute myeloid leukemia]]. The partial duplication of the ''ALL1'' (''MLL'') gene is a genetic defect has been found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

The '''Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics''' ('''KITP''') is a research institute of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. KITP is one of the most renowned institutes for [[theoretical physics]] in the world, and brings theorists in physics and related fields together to work on topics at the forefront of theoretical science. The [[National Science Foundation]] has been the principal supporter of the Institute since it was founded as the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1979. In a 2007 article in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', KITP was given the highest impact index in a comparison of nonbiomedical research organizations across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/104/46/17943.full National scientific facilities and their impact on nonbiomedical research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directors of the KITP since its beginning have been:
* [[Walter Kohn]], 1979–1984 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1998)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[Robert Schrieffer]], 1984–1989 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize for Physics, 1972)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[James S. Langer]], 1989–1995
* [[James Hartle]], 1995–1997 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;([[Einstein Prize (APS)]], 2009)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[David Gross]], 1997–2012 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize in Physics, 2004)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[Lars Bildsten]], 2012–present

The Director and the permanent members of the KITP (Leon Balents, David Gross, Alexei Kitaev, Joseph Polchinski, and Boris Shraiman) are also on the faculty of the [[UC Santa Barbara Physics Department]].  Former permanent members include Physics Nobel Laureate [[Frank Wilczek]].

In the early 2000s, the institute, formerly known as the Institute for Theoretical Physics, or ITP, was named for the [[Norwegians|Norwegian]]-[[United States|American]] [[physicist]] and [[businessman]] [[Fred Kavli]], in recognition of his donation of $7.5 million to the Institute.

Kohn Hall, which houses KITP, is located just beyond the Henley Gate at the East Entrance of the UCSB campus.  The building was designed by the architect [[Michael Graves]], and a new wing designed by Graves was added in 2003-2004.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Chemistry''' ('''Otto Hahn Institute''') ({{lang-de|Max Planck Institut für Chemie - Otto Hahn Institut}}) is a non-university research institute under the auspices of the Max Planck Society (German: [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]]). It is based in [[Mainz]].

In 2016 research at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz aims at an integral understanding of chemical processes in the Earth system, particularly in the atmosphere and biosphere. Investigations address a wide range of interactions between air, water, soil, life and climate in the course of Earth history up to today´s human-driven epoch, the '''[[Anthropocene]]'''. The Institute consists of five scientific departments (Atmospheric Chemistry, Climate Geochemistry, Biogeochemistry, Multiphase Chemistry, and Particle Chemistry) and additional research groups. The departments are independently led by their Directors.

== Research ==

The Institute consists of five scientific departments and additional research groups.
* '''Atmospheric Chemistry Department:''' The Atmospheric Chemistry Department which is led by Prof. Dr. Jos Lelieveld focuses on the study of ozone and other atmospheric photo-oxidants, their chemical reactions and global cycles. The researchers use kinetic and photochemical laboratory investigations, in situ and remote sensing measurements. The Atmospheric Chemistry department also develops numerical models to describe meteorological and chemical processes in the atmosphere, to simulate the complex atmospheric interactions and to test the theory through measurement campaigns (ground-based or by ship, aircraft, satellite). 
* '''Biogeochemistry Department:''' The Department Biogeochemistry of Prof. Dr. Meinrat O. Andreae concentrates on  the exchange and interactions of trace gases and aerosols between biosphere and atmosphere with a special focus on Amazon region. They use  laboratory investigations, field measurements and numerical models to study this processes. Research topics are: exchange of chemically and climatically important trace gases between the soil/vegetation system and the atmosphere, formation of aerosol particles and their effects on climate, impact of vegetation fires on ecology and atmospheric pollution, and the changing global cycles of trace elements.  
* '''Department of Climate Geochemistry:''' Prof. (ETHZ) Dr. Gerald H. Haug and his team explore the climate -ocean-atmosphere system on annual up to geological timescales. Of particular interest is the Cenozoic (the past 65 million years). They investigate the changes in internal feedback processes, e.g. interactions between ocean and atmosphere, oceanic heat transport or its nutrient status. Moreover, the scientists study the biogeochemical processes in the polar oceans and their role in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentration between ice ages and warmer periods. Therefore, they examine geological archives such as sediments from the open ocean and speleothems. 
* '''Multiphase Chemistry Department:''' The department of Prof. Dr. Ulrich Pöschl deals with multiphase processes at the molecular level and its impact on the macroscopic and global scale. Concerning the Earth System and climate research, they focus on biological and organic aerosols, aerosol-cloud interactions and atmospheric surface exchange processes whereas in the field of life and health sciences, the researchers study the change of protein macromolecules air pollution and how this affects allergic reactions and diseases. 
* '''Particle Chemistry Department:''' The department is led by Prof. Dr. Stephan Borrmann. Here they study the physical properties and chemical composition of atmospheric aerosol and cloud particles using laboratory experiments (e.g. in a vertical wind tunnel), measurements on ground and hill stations and on mobile measurement facilities (airplanes). Furthermore,  extraterrestrial particles are being analyzed using isotopic measurements, such as presolar grains from meteorites and comets. 
* '''Further research groups:''' In December 2016 there were four additional research groups at the Institute: The Minerva group led by Dr. Yafang Cheng. They deal with the interaction of aerosols and regional air quality. Dr. [[Mikhail Eremets]] studies mater at high pressures. Prof. Dr. Thomas Wagner and his Satellite Research Group of analyzes satellite data in order to draw conclusions about tropospheric and stratospheric trace gases. The group "Terrestrial Paleoclimates" which is led by  Dr. Kathryn Fitzsimmons, uses loess in Eurasia as climate archives for information of past climates.
* In 2010 the [[Geochemistry]] department (which was led by Prof. Albrecht W. Hofmann) was closed and the scientific working groups were integrated into the Biogeochemistry department. This department conducted research on large-scale geological processes, such as the formation of continental and oceanic crusts, the chemical differentiation of the Earth's mantle and the circulation of present-day and former oceans. The scientists used mass spectrometric measurements of isotopic abundances to determine the absolute age of rocks. They also used isotopic abundances and trace element contents to determine the origin of volcanic lava from the Earth's mantle or crust and studies the long-term processes used by the Earth's mantle to recycle old crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpic.de/en/history/chronicle-of-the-directors/1980-1996.html|title=1980 - 1996|last=Chemie|first=Max-Planck-Institut für|date=2015-12-16|website=www.mpic.de|language=en|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Institute was founded as [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] for Chemistry in Berlin Dahlem in 1911. The founding director was [[Ernst Otto Beckmann|Ernst Beckmann]] (1853-1923), who also directed the Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry. The Department of Organic Chemistry was led by [[Richard Willstätter|Richard Willstatter]] (1872-1942), who won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize for Chemistry]]  in 1915 for his work on plant pigments. The teamwork of [[Otto Hahn]] (1879-1968), [[Lise Meitner]] (1878-1968) and [[Fritz Strassmann|Fritz Straßmann]] (1902-1980) led to the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] in December 1938. Otto Hahn was Director of the Institute from 1928 to 1946. He received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1944.

During the war, in 1944, the Institute building was severely damaged as a result of air raids. Everything that hadn't been destroyed was then stored in a closed textile factory in Tailfingen, Württemberg (present-day [[Albstadt]]), where the Institute continued the work it had started in Berlin for a time.

After [[World War II]] the institute moved to the campus of [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]] in 1949. In 1948 the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] was restructured and renamed becoming the [[Max Planck Society]], the institute was also renamed as the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpic.de/en/history.html|title=History|last=Chemie|first=Max-Planck-Institut für|date=2016-05-20|website=www.mpic.de|language=en|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to adapt to changing scientific requirements, the institute's research activities changed several times over the years. When classic chemistry was practiced in the early years, it later focussed on [[Radiochemistry]], [[Cosmochemistry]], [[Nuclear physics|Nuclear Physics]], and [[mass spectrometry]]. These days the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry focusses on  an integral scientific understanding of chemical processes in the Earth System from molecular to global scales.

== Nobel laureates of the institute ==
* [[Richard Willstätter]], director from 1912 till 1916.  In 1915, he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his research into plant dyes, primarily [[chlorophyll]]. He discovered, among other things, that the structure of green dye exhibits significant similarity to the structure of the red blood pigment [[hemoglobin]].
* [[Otto Hahn]], director of the department for radioactive research from 1912 till 1948, from 1928 till 1946 managing director of the institute. The joint research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner and Fritz Straßmann into transuranic elements led to the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] in 1938. In 1945, Otto Hahn received the Noble Prize for this.
* [[Paul J. Crutzen]], Director of the Atmospheric Chemistry Department from 1980 till 2000, Nobel Prize for Chemistry 1995 for investigations on the formation and destruction of [[ozone]] in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].

== Staff ==
At the beginning of 2014 about 300 people were employed at the institute, including 77 scientists, 122 junior scientists and 11 trainees (mechanical workshop and electronics).

== Max Planck Graduate School (MPGS) ==
The [http://www.mpic.de/en/career/mpgs-max-planck-graduate-school.html Max Planck Graduate School] (MPGS) at MPI for Chemistry offers a PhD program in atmospheric chemistry and physics, environmental physics and geophysics. The program should enable the PhD students to widen their knowledge and skills beyond the research topic of the doctoral project by visiting different lectures, workshops, soft skill courses, an annual PhD Symposium and summer schools. It was established by the Max Planck Society in January 2003. The Graduate School is in close cooperation with the [[University of Mainz]] (Institute for Physics of the Atmosphere), the [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]] (Institute for Environmental Physics), [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] (Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences).

The '''Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro''' (in [[English language|English]], '''Rio de Janeiro Museum of Image and Sound''') was inaugurated on September 3, 1965, as part of celebrations of the fourth centenary of the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The '''MIS''' is a museum of the Secretary of Culture of the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] dedicated to ''[[carioca]]'' culture.

The institution has launched a pioneering gender audiovisual museum, which would be followed in other Brazilian cities. In addition to having qualified as music and picture documentation center, it was also a cultural center of avant-garde in the 1960s and 1970s, a place of meetings and launching new ideas and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museusdorio.com.br/joomla/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=144:funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o-museu-da-imagem-e-do-som-do-rio-de-janeiro|title=Fundação Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro

== History ==
In addition to the safekeeping and preservation of the collections, the MIS produces its own collection by collecting testimonies for posterity, project conceived in 1966 as a way to legitimize the action of the museum in the cultural milieu of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Currently, the museum has a collection of more than 900 interviews with approximately four thousand hours of recording covering the various segments of culture. The MIS is not restricted to guard remaining objects from the past, but it is up to date with the present and facing the future. Records and preserves the memory by making use of technologies available each season. The museum, which currently has its collections split between two locations – one in Praça XV (Centro) and the other in [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]] – is seen as an important part of Rio’s cultural heritage.

== New Museu da Imagem e do Som ==
[[File:Novo Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro (2014).jpg|thumb|250px|Facade of the new museum in June 2014.]]
The plans for the new MIS are ambitious and building costs are said to be in the region of [[R$]]70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1453733-5606,00.html|title=Museu da Imagem e do Som terá boate no lugar da Help
|publisher=[[Globo.com]]|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]], of [[New York City]], the new building is “a reproduction of the famous [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana]] sidewalk folded into a vertical boulevard and will become a new icon in Rio’s cultural scene.”

The new headquarters of the Museum of Image and Sound will celebrate the culture and musical history of [[Rio de Janeiro]] throughout its eight floors. The first floor of the building will be dedicated to humor and irreverence Rio, while the second floor will tell the history of music in the city, including [[samba]] and [[choro]].

'''Nadcap''' (formerly '''NADCAP''', the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program) is a global cooperative accreditation program for [[aerospace engineering]], [[defense contractor|defense]] and related industries. 

==History of Nadcap==
The Nadcap program is administered by the Performance Review Institute (PRI). Nadcap was established in 1990 by [[SAE International]]. Nadcap's membership consists of "Prime Contractors" who coordinate with aerospace accredited Suppliers to develop industry-wide audit criteria for special processes and products. Through PRI, Nadcap provides independent certification of manufacturing processes for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pri-network.org/nadcap/ PRI Official Site], Nadcap Home Page, Correct as of 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; PRI has its headquarters in [[Warrendale, Pennsylvania]] with branch offices for Nadcap located in [[London]], [[Beijing]], and Nagoya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pri-network.org/about-pri/contact-us/ PRI Official Site], Contact Us Page, Correct as of 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of Nadcap activities==
The Nadcap program provides accreditation for special processes in the aerospace and defense industry. 

These include:
*Aerospace Quality Systems (AQS)
*Aero Structure Assembly (ASA)
*Chemical Processing (CP)
*[[Coating]]s (CT)
*[[Composite material|Composites]] (COMP)
*Conventional [[Machining]] as a Special Process (CMSP)
*Elastomer Seals (SEAL)
*[[Electronics]] (ETG)
*Fluids Distribution (FLU)
*[[Heat treating|Heat Treating]] (HT)
*Materials Testing Laboratories (MTL)
*Measurement &amp; Inspection (M&amp;I)
*Metallic Materials Manufacturing (MMM)
*Nonconventional Machining and Surface Enhancement (NMSE)
*[[Non-destructive testing|Nondestructive Testing]] (NDT)
*Non Metallic Materials Manufacturing (NMMM)
*Non Metallic Materials Testing (NMMT)
*[[Sealants]] (SLT)
*[[Welding]] (WLD)

==The Nadcap program and industry==
PRI schedules an audit and assigns an industry approved auditor who will conduct the audit using an industry agreed checklist. At the end of the audit, any non-conformity issues will be raised through a non-conformance report. PRI will administer and close out the non-conformance reports with the Supplier. Upon completion PRI will present the audit pack to a 'special process Task Group’ made up of members from industry who will review it and vote on its acceptability for approval.

'''Programs'''
* Advanced Study Program (ASP)
* Integrated Science Program (ISP)

NCAR's service to the universities and larger geosciences community is reinforced by the offerings of UCAR's [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|community programs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucp.ucar.edu/ UCAR Community Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=highlights&gt;[https://www2.ucar.edu/highlights UCAR Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding and management ==
NCAR is managed by the nonprofit [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] and is one of the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]'s [[Federally Funded Research and Development Center]]s, with approximately 95% of its funding coming from the federal government. However, it is not a federal agency and its employees are not part of the federal personnel system.&lt;ref name=quickfacts/&gt; NCAR employs about 761 staff. Its annual expenditures in fiscal year 2015 were $167.8 million.&lt;ref name=quickfacts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ncar.ucar.edu/budget-and-planning/public NCAR Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

Obesity is a [[disease|medical condition]] in which excess [[adipose tissue|body fat]] has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000 p.6"&gt;WHO 2000 p.6&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined by [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]] and further evaluated in terms of fat distribution via the [[waist–hip ratio]] and total cardiovascular risk factors.&lt;ref name=Sweet2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sweeting HN | title = Measurement and definitions of obesity in childhood and adolescence: a field guide for the uninitiated | journal = Nutrition Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 32 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17963490 | pmc = 2164947 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2891-6-32 | url = http://www.nutritionj.com/content/6/1/32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NHLBI p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  BMI is closely related to both [[Body fat percentage|percentage body fat]] and total body fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gray DS, Fujioka K | title = Use of relative weight and Body Mass Index for the determination of adiposity | journal = Journal of Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 545–50 | year = 1991 | pmid = 2037859 | doi = 10.1016/0895-4356(91)90218-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In children, a healthy weight varies with age and sex. Obesity in children and adolescents is defined not as an absolute number but in relation to a historical normal group, such that obesity is a BMI greater than the 95th&amp;nbsp;[[percentile]].&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/about_childrens_BMI.htm |title=Healthy Weight: Assessing Your Weight: BMI: About BMI for Children and Teens |publisher=[[Center for disease control and prevention]] |access-date=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reference data on which these percentiles were based date from 1963 to 1994, and thus have not been affected by the recent increases in weight.&lt;ref name="Flegal KM, Ogden CL, Wei R, Kuczmarski RL, Johnson CL 2001 1086–93"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flegal KM, Ogden CL, Wei R, Kuczmarski RL, Johnson CL | title = Prevalence of overweight in US children: comparison of US growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with other reference values for body mass index | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 73 | issue = 6 | pages = 1086–93 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11382664 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/73.6.1086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BMI is defined as the subject's weight divided by the square of their height and is calculated as follows.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BMI}= \frac{m}{h^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

:where ''m'' and ''h'' are the subject's weight and height respectively.

BMI is usually expressed in kilograms of weight per metre squared of height. To convert from pounds per inch squared multiply by {{nowrap|703 (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(lb/sq in)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{nowrap|1 (lb/sq in)}} is more precisely {{nowrap|703.06957964 (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly used definitions, established by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 1997 and published in 2000, provide the values listed in the table.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000 p.9"&gt;WHO 2000 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nikcevic|first1=Ana V.|last2=Kuczmierczyk|first2=Andrzej R.|last3=Bruch|first3=Michael | name-list-format = vanc | title = Formulation and Treatment in Clinical Health Psychology|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135452087|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apCNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Any BMI ≥ 35 or 40&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is ''severe obesity''.
* A BMI of ≥ 35&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and experiencing obesity-related health conditions or ≥40–44.9&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is ''morbid obesity''.

===Morbidity===
{{Main|Obesity-associated morbidity}}
Obesity increases the risk of many physical and mental conditions. These comorbidities are most commonly shown in [[metabolic syndrome]],&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;  a combination of medical disorders which includes: [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[hypercholesterolemia|high blood cholesterol]], and [[hypertriglyceridemia|high triglyceride levels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grundy SM | title = Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 2595–600 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15181029 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2004-0372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications are either directly caused by obesity or indirectly related through mechanisms sharing a common cause such as a poor diet or a [[sedentary lifestyle]]. The strength of the link between obesity and specific conditions varies. One of the strongest is the link with [[type 2 diabetes]]. Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women.&lt;ref&gt;Seidell 2005 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Health consequences fall into two broad categories: those attributable to the effects of increased fat mass (such as [[osteoarthritis]], [[obstructive sleep apnea]], social stigmatization) and those due to the increased number of [[fat cells]] ([[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]]).&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bray2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bray GA | title = Medical consequences of obesity | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 2583–9 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15181027 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2004-0535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increases in body fat alter the body's response to insulin, potentially leading to [[insulin resistance]].

===Survival paradox===
{{See also|Obesity paradox}}
Although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox.&lt;ref name=Schmidt2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt DS, Salahudeen AK | title = Obesity-survival paradox-still a controversy? | journal = Seminars in Dialysis | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 486–92 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17991192 | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-139X.2007.00349.x | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis,&lt;ref name=Schmidt2007/&gt; and has subsequently been found in those with [[heart failure]] and [[Peripheral vascular disease|peripheral artery disease]] (PAD).&lt;ref name=paradox2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |title=Behavioral counseling in primary care to promote a healthy diet: recommendations and rationale |journal=American Family Physician |volume=67 |issue=12 |pages=2573–6 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12825847 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In people with heart failure, those with a BMI between 30.0 and 34.9 had lower mortality than those with a normal weight.

==Causes==
At an individual level, a combination of excessive [[food energy]] intake and a lack of [[physical activity]] is thought to explain most cases of obesity.&lt;ref name=CADG2006/&gt; A limited number of cases are due primarily to genetics, medical reasons, or psychiatric illness.&lt;ref name=Ble2008/&gt; In contrast, increasing rates of obesity at a societal level are felt to be due to an easily accessible and palatable diet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drewnowski A, Specter SE | title = Poverty and obesity: the role of energy density and energy costs | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–16 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14684391 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/79.1.6 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; increased [[Effects of the car on societies|reliance on cars]], and mechanized manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nestle M, Jacobson MF | title = Halting the obesity epidemic: a public health policy approach | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 115 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–24 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10968581 | pmc = 1308552 | doi = 10.1093/phr/115.1.12 | type = Research Support }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=James2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = James WP | title = The fundamental drivers of the obesity epidemic | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 9 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 6–13 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18307693 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00432.x | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 review identified ten other possible contributors to the recent increase of obesity: (1) [[sleep debt|insufficient sleep]], (2) [[endocrine disruptor]]s (environmental [[pollutant]]s that interfere with lipid metabolism), (3) decreased variability in ambient temperature, (4) decreased rates of [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], because smoking suppresses appetite, (5) increased use of medications that can cause weight gain (e.g., [[atypical antipsychotics]]), (6) proportional increases in ethnic and age groups that tend to be heavier, (7) pregnancy at a later age (which may cause susceptibility to obesity in children), (8) [[epigenetic]] risk factors passed on generationally, (9) [[natural selection]] for higher BMI, and (10) [[assortative mating]] leading to increased concentration of obesity risk factors (this would  increase the number of obese people by increasing population variance in weight).&lt;ref name="pmid16801930"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keith SW, Redden DT, Katzmarzyk PT, Boggiano MM, Hanlon EC, Benca RM, Ruden D, Pietrobelli A, Barger JL, Fontaine KR, Wang C, Aronne LJ, Wright SM, Baskin M, Dhurandhar NV, Lijoi MC, Grilo CM, DeLuca M, Westfall AO, Allison DB | title = Putative contributors to the secular increase in obesity: exploring the roads less traveled | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 30 | issue = 11 | pages = 1585–94 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 16801930 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0803326 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is evidence supporting the influence of these mechanisms on the increased prevalence of obesity, the evidence is still inconclusive, and the authors state that these are probably less influential than the ones discussed in the previous paragraph.

Obesity is a major feature in several syndromes, such as [[Prader–Willi syndrome]], [[Bardet–Biedl syndrome]], [[Cohen syndrome]], and [[MOMO syndrome]].

The [[thrifty gene hypothesis]] postulates that, due to dietary scarcity during human evolution, people are prone to obesity. Their ability to take advantage of rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves would be more likely to survive [[famine]]. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakravarthy MV, Booth FW | title = Eating, exercise, and "thrifty" genotypes: connecting the dots toward an evolutionary understanding of modern chronic diseases | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–10 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14660491 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00757.2003 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has received various criticisms, and other evolutionarily-based theories such as the [[drifty gene hypothesis]] and the [[thrifty phenotype|thrifty phenotype hypothesis]] have also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells JC | title = Thrift: a guide to thrifty genes, thrifty phenotypes and thrifty norms | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 33 | issue = 12 | pages = 1331–8 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19752875 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2009.175 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells JC | title = The thrifty phenotype: An adaptation in growth or metabolism? | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–75 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21082685 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.21100 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other illnesses===
Certain physical and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) as well as some congenital or acquired conditions: [[hypothyroidism]], [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[growth hormone deficiency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosén T, Bosaeus I, Tölli J, Lindstedt G, Bengtsson BA | title = Increased body fat mass and decreased extracellular fluid volume in adults with growth hormone deficiency | journal = Clinical Endocrinology | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–71 | date = January 1993 | pmid = 8435887 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2265.1993.tb00974.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[eating disorder]]s: [[binge eating disorder]] and [[night eating syndrome]].&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt; However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IVR]] as a psychiatric illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zametkin AJ, Zoon CK, Klein HW, Munson S | title = Psychiatric aspects of child and adolescent obesity: a review of the past 10 years | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–50 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14726719 | doi = 10.1097/00004583-200402000-00008 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chiles C, van Wattum PJ |title=Psychiatric aspects of the obesity crisis |journal=Psychiatr Times |year=2010 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain medications may cause weight gain or changes in [[body composition]]; these include [[insulin]], [[sulfonylurea]]s, [[thiazolidinedione]]s, [[atypical antipsychotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[glucocorticoids|steroids]], certain [[anticonvulsant]]s ([[phenytoin]] and [[valproate]]), [[pizotifen]], and some forms of [[hormonal contraception]].&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;

===Social determinants===
{{Main|Social determinants of obesity}}
[[File:Yamai no Soshi - Obesity.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The disease scroll (Yamai no soshi, late 12th century) depicts a woman moneylender with obesity, considered a disease of the rich.]]
While genetic influences are important to understanding obesity, they cannot explain the current dramatic increase seen within specific countries or globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yach D, Stuckler D, Brownell KD | title = Epidemiologic and economic consequences of the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 62–6 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16397571 | doi = 10.1038/nm0106-62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is accepted that energy consumption in excess of energy expenditure leads to obesity on an individual basis, the cause of the shifts in these two factors on the societal scale is much debated. There are a number of theories as to the cause but most believe it is a combination of various factors.

The correlation between [[social class]] and BMI varies globally. A review in 1989 found that in developed countries women of a high social class were less likely to be obese. No significant differences were seen among men of different social classes. In the developing world, women, men, and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sobal J, Stunkard AJ | title = Socioeconomic status and obesity: a review of the literature | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | pages = 260–75 | date = March 1989 | pmid = 2648443 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.105.2.260 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; An update of this review carried out in 2007 found the same relationships, but they were weaker. The decrease in strength of correlation was felt to be due to the effects of [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=McLaren2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McLaren L | title = Socioeconomic status and obesity | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 29 | issue =  | pages = 29–48 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17478442 | doi = 10.1093/epirev/mxm001 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among developed countries, levels of adult obesity, and percentage of teenage children who are overweight, are correlated with [[economic inequality|income inequality]].  A similar relationship is seen among US states: more adults, even in higher social classes, are obese in more unequal states.&lt;ref name="spirit"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard G.

Many explanations have been put forth for associations between BMI and social class. It is thought that in developed countries, the wealthy are able to afford more nutritious food, they are under greater social pressure to remain slim, and have more opportunities along with greater expectations for [[physical fitness]]. In [[undeveloped countries]] the ability to afford food, high energy expenditure with physical labor, and cultural values favoring a larger body size are believed to contribute to the observed patterns.&lt;ref name=McLaren2007/&gt; Attitudes toward body weight held by people in one's life may also play a role in obesity. A correlation in BMI changes over time has been found among friends, siblings, and spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christakis NA, Fowler JH | title = The spread of obesity in a large social network over 32 years | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–9 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17652652 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMsa066082 | type = Research Support | citeseerx = 10.1.1.581.4893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stress and perceived low social status appear to increase risk of obesity.&lt;ref name="spirit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Björntorp P | title = Do stress reactions cause abdominal obesity and comorbidities? | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 73–86 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 12119665 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-789x.2001.00027.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman E, Adler NE, Daniels SR, Morrison JA, Slap GB, Dolan LM | title = Impact of objective and subjective social status on obesity in a biracial cohort of adolescents | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1018–26 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12917508 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2003.140 | type = Research Support }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking has a significant effect on an individual's weight. Those who quit smoking gain an average of 4.4&amp;nbsp;kilograms (9.7&amp;nbsp;lb) for men and 5.0&amp;nbsp;kilograms (11.0&amp;nbsp;lb) for women over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flegal KM, Troiano RP, Pamuk ER, Kuczmarski RJ, Campbell SM | title = The influence of smoking cessation on the prevalence of overweight in the United States | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 333 | issue = 18 | pages = 1165–70 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7565970 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199511023331801 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/333/18/1165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, changing rates of smoking have had little effect on the overall rates of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiolero A, Faeh D, Paccaud F, Cornuz J | title = Consequences of smoking for body weight, body fat distribution, and insulin resistance | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 801–9 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18400700 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/87.4.801 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the number of children a person has is related to their risk of obesity. A woman's risk increases by 7% per child, while a man's risk increases by 4% per child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weng HH, Bastian LA, Taylor DH, Moser BK, Ostbye T | title = Number of children associated with obesity in middle-aged women and men: results from the health and retirement study | journal = Journal of Women's Health | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–91 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15006281 | doi = 10.1089/154099904322836492 | type = Comparative Study }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This could be partly explained by the fact that having dependent children decreases physical activity in Western parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellows-Riecken KH, Rhodes RE | title = A birth of inactivity?

In the developing world urbanization is playing a role in increasing rate of obesity.  In China overall rates of obesity are below 5%; however, in some cities rates of obesity are greater than 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/media/en/gsfs_obesity.pdf |title=Obesity and Overweight |format=PDF |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |access-date=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malnutrition]] in early life is believed to play a role in the rising rates of obesity in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name=DC2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caballero B | title = Introduction.

===Gut bacteria===
{{See also|Infectobesity}}
The study of the effect of infectious agents on metabolism is still in its early stages.  [[Gut flora]] has been shown to differ between lean and obese humans. There is an indication that gut flora in obese and lean individuals can affect the metabolic potential. This apparent alteration of the metabolic potential is believed to confer a greater capacity to harvest energy contributing to obesity. Whether these differences are the direct cause or the result of obesity has yet to be determined unequivocally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DiBaise JK, Zhang H, Crowell MD, Krajmalnik-Brown R, Decker GA, Rittmann BE | title = Gut microbiota and its possible relationship with obesity | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 460–9 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18380992 | doi = 10.4065/83.4.460 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[antibiotics]] among children has also been associated with obesity later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Antibiotics: repeated treatments before the age of two could be a factor in obesity |journal=Prescrire International |date=2018 |url=http://english.prescrire.org/en/(X(1))/81/168/55076/0/2018/ArchiveNewsDetails.aspx?page=1 |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Pathophysiology of obesity}}
There are many possible [[pathophysiology|pathophysiological]] mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of obesity.&lt;ref name="flier"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flier JS | title = Obesity wars: molecular progress confronts an expanding epidemic | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | pages = 337–50 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14744442 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)01081-X | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of research had been almost unapproached until the [[leptin]] gene was discovered in 1994 by J.

In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the [[hypothalamus]], a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the [[melanocortin]] pathway being the most well understood.&lt;ref name="flier"/&gt; The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the [[arcuate nucleus]], that has outputs to the [[lateral hypothalamus]] (LH) and [[ventromedial hypothalamus]] (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Boulpaep, Emile L. |author2=Boron, Walter F. |title=Medical physiology: A cellular and molecular approach |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |page=1227 |isbn=978-0-7216-3256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arcuate nucleus contains two distinct groups of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name="flier"/&gt; The first group coexpresses [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY) and [[agouti-related peptide]] (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses [[pro-opiomelanocortin]] (POMC) and [[cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript]] (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated in part by leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.&lt;ref name="flier"/&gt;

In earlier historical periods obesity was rare, and achievable only by a small elite, although already recognised as a problem for health. But as prosperity increased in the [[Early Modern period]], it affected increasingly larger groups of the population.&lt;ref name=Haslam2007/&gt;

In 1997 the WHO formally recognized obesity as a global epidemic.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt; As of 2008 the WHO estimates that at least 500&amp;nbsp;million adults (greater than 10%) are obese, with higher rates among women than men.&lt;ref name=WHO2009a&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/index.html |title=Obesity and overweight |website=World Health Organization |access-date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of adults affected in the United States as of 2015–2016 is about 39.6% overall (37.9% of males and 41.1% of females).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hales CM, Carroll MD, Fryar CD, Ogden CL | title = Prevalence of Obesity Among Adults and Youth: United States, 2015–2016 | journal = NCHS Data Brief | issue = 288 | pages = 1–8 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29155689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of obesity also increases with age at least up to 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;years old&lt;ref&gt;Seidell 2005 p.5&lt;/ref&gt; and severe obesity in the United States, Australia, and Canada is increasing faster than the overall rate of obesity.&lt;ref name=morbid2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24351678"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howard NJ, Taylor AW, Gill TK, Chittleborough CR | title = Severe obesity: Investigating the socio-demographics within the extremes of body mass index | journal = Obesity Research &amp; Clinical Practice | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = I–II | date = March 2008 | pmid = 24351678 | doi = 10.1016/j.orcp.2008.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tjepkema2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Tjepkema M |chapter=Measured Obesity–Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight |title=Nutrition: Findings from the Canadian Community Health Survey |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=6 July 2005 |location=Ottawa, Ontario |chapter-url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-620-m/2005001/article/adults-adultes/8060-eng.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OECD]] has projected an increase in obesity rates until at least 2030, especially in the United States, Mexico and England with rates reaching 47%, 39% and 35% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Obesity-Update-2017.pdf |title=Obesity Update 2017 |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |format=PDF |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Etymology===
''Obesity'' is from the [[Latin]] ''obesitas'', which means "stout, fat, or plump".  ''Ēsus'' is the past participle of ''edere'' (to eat), with ''ob'' (over) added to it.&lt;ref name=etymol&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=obesity |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: Obesity |website=Douglas Harper |access-date=31 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' documents its first usage in 1611 by [[Randle Cotgrave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Obesity, n |website=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2008 |access-date=21 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111125659/http://www.oed.com/ |archive-date=11 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venus von Willendorf 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=A carved stone miniature figurine depicted an obese female.|''[[Venus of Willendorf]]'' created 24,000–22,000 BC]]
[[Ancient Greek medicine]] recognizes obesity as a medical disorder, and records that the Ancient Egyptians saw it in the same way.&lt;ref name=Haslam2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haslam D | title = Obesity: a medical history | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 8 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = 31–6 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17316298 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00314.x | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]] wrote that "Corpulence is not only a disease itself, but the harbinger of others".&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt; The Indian surgeon [[Sushruta]] (6th century BCE) related obesity to diabetes and heart disorders.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi&amp;Dwivedi07/&gt; He recommended physical work to help cure it and its side effects.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi&amp;Dwivedi07&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf |format=PDF |title=History of Medicine: Sushruta – the Clinician – Teacher par Excellence |access-date=19 September 2008 |website=Dwivedi, Girish &amp; Dwivedi, Shridhar |publisher= |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010045900/http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of human history mankind struggled with food scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theodore Mazzone |author2=Giamila Fantuzzi |title=Adipose Tissue And Adipokines in Health And Disease (Nutrition and Health) |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2006 |page=222 |isbn=978-1-58829-721-1 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obesity has thus historically been viewed as a sign of wealth and prosperity. It was common among high officials in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref name=Zach2003/&gt; as well as in Ancient East Asian civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Keller p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, English medical author [[Tobias Venner]] is credited with being one of the first to refer to the term as a societal disease in a published English language book.&lt;ref name=Haslam2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ShdaOI8TmBAC&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=tobias%20venner%20obesity&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=tobias%20venner%20obesity&amp;f=false|title=Fat Boys: A Slim Book|first=Sander L|last=Gilman|page=18|publisher= University of Nebraska Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0803221833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] it was realized that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt; Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range played a significant role in the development of industrialized societies.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt; Height and weight thus both increased through the 19th&amp;nbsp;century in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt; In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.&lt;ref name=Caballero/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Breslow L | title = Public health aspects of weight control | journal = American Journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health | volume = 42 | issue = 9 | pages = 1116–20 | date = September 1952 | pmid = 12976585 | pmc = 1526346 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.42.9.1116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this time period, insurance companies realized the connection between weight and life expectancy and increased premiums for the obese.&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;

Many cultures throughout history have viewed obesity as the result of a character flaw. The ''obesus'' or fat character in [[Ancient Greek comedy]] was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times the food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]] and [[lust]].&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt; In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.&lt;ref name=Bias2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl R, Brownell KD | title = Bias, discrimination, and obesity | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = 788–805 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11743063 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2001.108 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public perceptions in Western society regarding healthy body weight differ from those regarding the weight that is considered ideal &amp;nbsp;– and both have changed since the beginning of the 20th century. The weight that is viewed as an ideal has become lower since the 1920s. This is illustrated by the fact that the average height of Miss America pageant winners increased by 2% from 1922 to 1999, while their average weight decreased by 12%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rubinstein S, Caballero B | title = Is Miss America an undernourished role model? | journal = JAMA | volume = 283 | issue = 12 | pages = 1569 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10735392 | doi = 10.1001/jama.283.12.1569 | type = Letter }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, people's views concerning healthy weight have changed in the opposite direction. In Britain, the weight at which people considered themselves to be overweight was significantly higher in 2007 than in 1999.&lt;ref name=John2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson F, Cooke L, Croker H, Wardle J | title = Changing perceptions of weight in Great Britain: comparison of two population surveys | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | issue =  | pages = a494 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18617488 | pmc = 2500200 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a494 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/jul10_1/a494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These changes are believed to be due to increasing rates of adiposity leading to increased acceptance of extra body fat as being normal.&lt;ref name=John2008/&gt;

Obesity is still seen as a sign of wealth and well-being in many parts of Africa. This has become particularly common since the [[HIV]] epidemic began.&lt;ref name=HaslamJames/&gt;

===The arts===
The first sculptural representations of the human body 20,000–35,000&amp;nbsp;years ago depict obese females. Some attribute the [[Venus figurines]] to the tendency to emphasize fertility while others feel they represent "fatness" in the people of the time.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt; Corpulence is, however, absent in both Greek and Roman art, probably in keeping with their ideals regarding moderation. This continued through much of Christian European history, with only those of low socioeconomic status being depicted as obese.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]] some of the upper class began flaunting their large size, as can be seen in portraits of [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Alessandro dal Borro]].&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] (1577–1640) regularly depicted full-bodied women in his pictures, from which derives the term [[Peter Paul Rubens#Art|Rubenesque]]. These women, however, still maintained the "hourglass" shape with its relationship to fertility.&lt;ref name=Fumento&gt;{{cite book|author=Fumento, Michael |title=The Fat of the Land: Our Health Crisis and How Overweight Americans Can Help Themselves |publisher=Penguin (Non-Classics) |year=1997 |page=126 |isbn=978-0-14-026144-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, views on obesity changed in the Western world. After centuries of obesity being synonymous with wealth and social status, slimness began to be seen as the desirable standard.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse/&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Economic impact===
In addition to its health impacts, obesity leads to many problems including disadvantages in employment&lt;ref name="Puhl R. p.29"&gt;Puhl R., Henderson K., and Brownell K. 2005 p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansson E, Böckerman P, Kiiskinen U, Heliövaara M | title = Obesity and labour market success in Finland: the difference between having a high BMI and being fat | journal = Economics and Human Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–45 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19249259 | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2009.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased business costs.  These effects are felt by all levels of society from individuals, to corporations, to governments.

Obesity prevention programs have been found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity may improve the public's health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Baal PH, Polder JJ, de Wit GA, Hoogenveen RT, Feenstra TL, Boshuizen HC, Engelfriet PM, Brouwer WB | title = Lifetime medical costs of obesity: prevention no cure for increasing health expenditure | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e29 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18254654 | pmc = 2225430 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050029 | type = Comparative Study }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal goal of the fat acceptance movement is to decrease discrimination against people who are overweight and obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnaafa.org/whatisnaafa.html |title=What is NAAFA |website=[[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]] |access-date=17 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312001218/http://www.capitalnaafa.org/whatisnaafa.html |archive-date=12 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.size-acceptance.org/mission.html |title=ISAA Mission Statement |website=[[International Size Acceptance Association]] |access-date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some in the movement are also attempting to challenge the established relationship between obesity and negative health outcomes.&lt;ref name=Pulver2007&gt;{{cite book|author=Pulver, Adam |title=An Imperfect Fit: Obesity, Public Health, and Disability Anti-Discrimination Law |publisher=Social Science Electronic Publishing |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |ssrn=1316106 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of organizations exist that promote the acceptance of obesity. They have increased in prominence in the latter half of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neumark-Sztainer D | title = The weight dilemma: a range of philosophical perspectives | journal = International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders | volume = 23 Suppl 2 | issue =  | pages = S31–7 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10340803 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0800857 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US-based [[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]] (NAAFA) was formed in 1969 and describes itself as a civil rights organization dedicated to ending size discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance |url=http://www.naafaonline.com/dev2/ |title=We come in all sizes |publisher=NAAFA |year=2008 |access-date=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Size Acceptance Association]] (ISAA) is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) which was founded in 1997. It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weight-based discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.size-acceptance.org/ |title=International Size Acceptance Association – ISAA |website=International Size Acceptance Association |access-date=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US [[Americans With Disabilities Act]] (ADA). The American legal system, however, has decided that the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this anti-discrimination law to cover obesity.&lt;ref name=Pulver2007/&gt;

===Industry influence on research===
In 2015 the ''New York Times'' published an article on the [[Global Energy Balance Network]], a nonprofit founded in 2014 that advocated for people to focus on increasing exercise rather than reducing calorie intake to avoid obesity and to be healthy. The organization was founded with at least $1.5M in funding from the [[Coca-Cola Company]], and the company has provided $4M in research funding to the two founding scientists Gregory A. Hand and Steven N. Blair since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O’Connor|first1=Anahad|title=Coca-Cola Funds Scientists Who Shift Blame for Obesity Away From Bad Diets|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/?login=email&amp;mtrref=www.nytimes.com|work=New York Times|date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NesleJAMA&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nestle M | title = Food Industry Funding of Nutrition Research: The Relevance of History for Current Debates | journal = JAMA Internal Medicine | volume = 176 | issue = 11 | pages = 1685–1686 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27618496 | doi = 10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.5400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood obesity==
{{Main|Childhood obesity}}
The healthy BMI range varies with the age and sex of the child. Obesity in children and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95th&amp;nbsp;[[percentile]].&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt; The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity.&lt;ref name="Flegal KM, Ogden CL, Wei R, Kuczmarski RL, Johnson CL 2001 1086–93"/&gt; Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.&lt;ref name=flynn2006/&gt;

As with obesity in adults, many factors contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity are believed to be the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dollman J, Norton K, Norton L | title = Evidence for secular trends in children's physical activity behaviour | journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 39 | issue = 12 | pages = 892–7; discussion 897 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16306494 | pmc = 1725088 | doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2004.016675 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]], [[hyperlipidemia]], and [[fatty liver]].&lt;ref name=CADG2006/&gt; Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success.&lt;ref name="pmid23044984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Metcalf B, Henley W, Wilkin T | title = Effectiveness of intervention on physical activity of children: systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials with objectively measured outcomes (EarlyBird 54) | journal = BMJ | volume = 345 | issue =  | pages = e5888 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23044984 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e5888 | type = Review, Meta-analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group.&lt;ref name=flynn2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flynn MA, McNeil DA, Maloff B, Mutasingwa D, Wu M, Ford C, Tough SC | title = Reducing obesity and related chronic disease risk in children and youth: a synthesis of evidence with 'best practice' recommendations | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 7 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = 7–66 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16371076 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-789X.2006.00242.x | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mead E, Brown T, Rees K, Azevedo LB, Whittaker V, Jones D, Olajide J, Mainardi GM, Corpeleijn E, O'Malley C, Beardsmore E, Al-Khudairy L, Baur L, Metzendorf MI, Demaio A, Ells LJ | title = Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese children from the age of 6 to 11 years | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 6 | pages = CD012651 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28639319 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012651 | url = http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/87566/7/WRAP-diet-physical-activity-behavioural-interventions-Mead-2017.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Optimality Theory''' (frequently abbreviated '''OT'''; the term is normally capitalized by convention) is a linguistic model proposing that the observed forms of [[language]] arise from the optimal satisfaction of conflicting constraints. OT differs from other approaches to phonological analysis, such as [[autosegmental phonology]] and [[linear phonology]] (SPE), which typically use rules rather than constraints. OT models grammars as systems that provide mappings from inputs to outputs; typically, the inputs are conceived of as [[underlying representation]]s, and the outputs as their surface realizations.

In linguistics, Optimality Theory has its origin in a talk given by [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;"Optimality". Proceedings of the talk given at Arizona Phonology
Conference, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later developed in an article by the same authors in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan, and Smolensky, Paul (1993) "Optimality Theory: Constraint interaction in generative grammar." Technical Report CU-CS-696-93, Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado at Boulder.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
There are three basic components of the theory:

* Generator ({{sc1|Gen}}) takes an input, and generates the list of possible outputs, or candidates,
* Constraint component ({{sc1|Con}}) provides the criteria, in the form of strictly ranked violable constraints, used to decide between candidates, and
* Evaluator ({{sc1|Eval}}) chooses the optimal candidate based on the constraints, and this candidate is the output.

Optimality Theory assumes that these components are universal. Differences in grammars reflect different rankings of the universal constraint set, {{sc1|Con}}. Part of [[language acquisition]] can then be described as the process of adjusting the ranking of these constraints.

Optimality Theory as applied to language was originally proposed by the linguists [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991, and later expanded by Prince and [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]. Although much of the interest in Optimality Theory has been associated with its use in [[phonology]], the area to which Optimality Theory was first applied, the theory is also applicable to other subfields of [[linguistics]] (e.g. [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]).

Optimality Theory is like other theories of [[generative grammar]] in its focus on the investigation of [[linguistic universal|universal principles]], [[linguistic typology]] and [[language acquisition]].

Optimality Theory also has roots in [[neural network]] research. It arose in part as an alternative to the [[connectionist]] theory of [[Harmonic Grammar]], developed in 1990 by [[Géraldine Legendre]], [[Yoshiro Miyata]] and [[Paul Smolensky]]. Variants of Optimality Theory with connectionist-like weighted constraints continue to be pursued in more recent work (Pater 2009).

==Input and {{sc1|Gen}}: the candidate set==
Optimality Theory supposes that there are no language-specific restrictions on the input. This is called ''richness of the base''. Every grammar can handle every possible input. For example, a language without [[Consonant cluster|complex clusters]] must be able to deal with an input such as {{IPA|/flask/}}. Languages without complex clusters differ on how they will resolve this problem; some will [[epenthesis|epenthesize]] (e.g. {{IPA|[falasak]}}, or {{IPA|[falasaka]}} if all codas are banned) and some will [[Elision|delete]] (e.g. {{IPA|[fas], [fak], [las], [lak]}}).

{{sc1|Gen}} is free to generate any number of output candidates, however much they deviate from the input. This is called ''freedom of analysis''. The grammar (ranking of constraints) of the language determines which of the candidates will be assessed as optimal by {{sc1|Eval}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|p=20}}

=={{sc1|Con}}: the constraint set==
In Optimality Theory, every constraint is universal. {{sc1|Con}} is the same in every language. There are two basic types of constraints:

* Faithfulness constraints require that the observed surface form (the output) match the underlying or lexical form (the input) in some particular way; that is, these constraints require identity between input and output forms.
* Markedness constraints impose requirements on the structural [[well-formedness]] of the output.

Each plays a crucial role in the theory. Markedness constraints motivate changes from the underlying form, and faithfulness constraints prevent every input from being realized as some completely unmarked form (such as {{IPA|[ba]}}).

The universal nature of {{sc1|Con}} makes some immediate predictions about language typology. If grammars differ only by having different rankings of {{sc1|Con}}, then the set of possible human languages is determined by the constraints that exist. Optimality Theory predicts that there cannot be more grammars than there are permutations of the ranking of {{sc1|Con}}. The number of possible rankings is equal to the [[factorial]] of the total number of constraints, thus giving rise to the term ''factorial typology''. However, it may not be possible to distinguish all of these potential grammars, since not every constraint is guaranteed to have an observable effect in every language. Two total orders on the constraints of {{sc1|Con}} could generate the same range of input–output mappings, but differ in the relative ranking of two constraints which do not conflict with each other. Since there is no way to distinguish these two rankings they are said to belong to the same grammar. A grammar in OT is equivalent to an [[antimatroid]] (Merchant &amp; Riggle 2016). If rankings with ties are allowed, then the number of possibilities is an [[ordered Bell number]] rather than a factorial, allowing a significantly larger number of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: The Best of All Possible Words (review of ''Optimality Theory: An Overview'', Archangeli, Diana &amp; Langendoen, D. Terence, eds., Blackwell, 1997)|first1=T. Mark|last1=Ellison|first2=Ewan|last2=Klein|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=127–143|jstor=4176645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faithfulness constraints===
McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) propose three basic families of faithfulness constraints:

* {{sc1|Max}} prohibits [[elision|deletion]] (from "maximal").
* {{sc1|Dep}} prohibits [[epenthesis]] (from "dependent").
* {{sc1|Ident}}(F) prohibits alteration to the value of feature F (from "identical").

Each of the constraints' names may be suffixed with "-IO" or "-BR", standing for ''input/output'' and ''base/reduplicant'', respectively—the latter of which is used in analysis of [[reduplication]]—if desired. ''F'' in {{sc1|Ident}}(F) is substituted by the name of a [[distinctive feature]], as in {{sc1|Ident-IO}}(voice).

{{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}} replace {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} proposed by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993), which stated "underlying segments must be parsed into syllable structure" and "syllable positions must be filled with underlying segments", respectively.{{sfnp|Prince|Smolensky|1993|p=94}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}} {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} serve essentially the same functions as {{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}}, but differ in that they evaluate only the output and not the relation between the input and output, which is rather characteristic of markedness constraints.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=209}} This stems from the model adopted by Prince &amp; Smolensky known as ''containment theory'', which assumes the input segments unrealized by the output are not removed but rather "left unparsed" by a syllable.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=99–100}} The model put forth by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995, 1999), known as ''correspondence theory'', has since replaced it as the standard framework.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}}

McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) also propose:

* {{sc1|I-Contig}}, violated when a word- or morpheme-internal segment is deleted (from "input-contiguity");
* {{sc1|O-Contig}}, violated when a segment is inserted word- or morpheme-internally (from "output-contiguity");
* {{sc1|Linearity}}, violated when the order of some segments is changed (i.e. prohibits [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]);
* {{sc1|Uniformity}}, violated when two or more segments are realized as one (i.e. prohibits [[fusion (linguistics)|fusion]]); and
* {{sc1|Integrity}}, violated when a segment is realized as multiple segments (i.e. prohibits [[unpacking]] or [[vowel breaking]]—opposite of {{sc1|Uniformity}}).

===Markedness constraints===
Markedness constraints introduced by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993) include:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name
! Statement
! Other names
|-
| {{sc1|Nuc}}
| Syllables must have nuclei.
|
|-
| {{sc1|&amp;minus;Coda}}
| Syllables must have no codas.
| {{sc1|NoCoda}}
|-
| {{sc1|Ons}}
| Syllables must have onsets.
| {{sc1|Onset}}
|-
| {{sc1|HNuc}}
| A nuclear segment must be more [[Sonority hierarchy|sonorous]] than another (from "harmonic nucleus").
|
|-
| {{sc1|*Complex}}
| A syllable must be V, CV or VC.
|
|-
| {{sc1|CodaCond}}
| Coda consonants cannot have place features that are not shared by an onset consonant.
| {{sc1|CodaCondition}}
|-
| {{sc1|NonFinality}}
| A word-final syllable (or [[foot (prosody)|foot]]) must not bear stress.
| {{sc1|NonFin}}
|-
| {{sc1|FtBin}}
| A foot must be two syllables (or [[Mora  (linguistics)|moras]]).
| {{sc1|FootBinarity}}
|-
| {{sc1|Pk-Prom}}
| Light syllables must not be stressed.
| {{sc1|PeakProminence}}
|-
| WSP
| Heavy syllables must be stressed (from "weight-to-stress principle").
| {{sc1|Weight-to-Stress}}
|}

Precise definitions in literature vary. Some constraints are sometimes used as a "cover constraint", standing in for a set of constraints that are not fully known or important.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=224}}

Some markedness constraints are context-free and others are context-sensitive. For example, *V&lt;sub&gt;nasal&lt;/sub&gt; states that vowels must not be nasal in any position and is thus context-free, whereas *V&lt;sub&gt;oral&lt;/sub&gt;N states that vowels must not be oral when preceding a tautosyllabic nasal and is thus context-sensitive.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=29–30}}

===Alignment constraints===
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}

===Local conjunctions===
Two constraints may be conjoined as a single constraint, called a ''local conjunction'', which gives only one violation each time both constraints are violated within a given domain, such as a segment, syllable or word. For example, [{{sc1|NoCoda &amp; VOP}}]&lt;sub&gt;segment&lt;/sub&gt; is violated once per voiced [[obstruent]] in a coda ("VOP" stands for "voiced obstruent prohibition"), and may be equivalently written as {{sc1|*VoicedCoda}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|pp=214–20}} Local conjunctions are used as a way of circumventing the problem of [[phonological opacity]] that arises when analyzing [[chain shift]]s.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}

=={{sc1|Eval}}: definition of optimality==
Given two candidates, A and B, A is better, or more "harmonic", than B on a constraint if A incurs fewer violations than B. Candidate A is more harmonic than B on an entire constraint hierarchy if A incurs fewer violations of the highest-ranked constraint distinguishing A and B. A is "optimal" in its candidate set if it is better on the constraint hierarchy than all other candidates.

For example, given the constraints C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which dominates C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), A is optimal if it does better than B on the highest ranking constraint which assigns them a different number of violations. If A and B tie on C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but A does better than B on C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A is optimal, even if A has however many more violations of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than B does. This comparison is often illustrated with a tableau. The [[index (typography)|pointing finger]] marks the optimal candidate, and each cell displays an asterisk for each violation for a given candidate and constraint. Once a candidate does worse than another candidate on the highest ranking constraint distinguishing them, it incurs a fatal violation (marked in the tableau by an exclamation mark and by shaded cells for the lower-ranked constraints). Once a candidate incurs a fatal violation, it cannot be optimal, even if it outperforms the other candidates on the rest of {{sc1|Con}}.

Other notational conventions include dotted lines separating columns of unranked or equally ranked constraints, a check mark ✔ in place of a finger in tentatively ranked tableaux (denoting harmonic but not conclusively optimal), and a circled asterisk ⊛ denoting a violation by a winner; in output candidates, the angle brackets {{angle bracket|&amp;nbsp;}} denote segments elided in phonetic realization, and □ and □́ denote an epenthetic consonant and vowel, respectively.{{sfnp|Tesar|Smloensky|1998|pp=230–1, 239}} The "much greater than" sign ≫ (sometimes the nested ⪢) denotes the domination of a constraint over another ("C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" = "C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;") while the "succeeds" operator ≻ denotes superior harmony in comparison of output candidates ("A ≻ B" = "A is more harmonic than B").{{sfnp|McCarthy|2001|p=247}}

Constraints are ranked in a hierarchy of strict domination. The ''strictness of strict domination'' means that a candidate which violates only a high-ranked constraint does worse on the hierarchy than one that does not, even if the second candidate fared worse on every other lower-ranked constraint. This also means that constraints are violable; the winning (i.e. the most harmonic) candidate need not satisfy all constraints, as long as for any rival candidate that does better than the winner on some constraint, there is a higher-ranked constraint on which the winner does better than that rival. Within a language, a constraint may be ranked high enough that it is always obeyed; it may be ranked low enough that it has no observable effects; or, it may have some intermediate ranking. The term ''the emergence of the unmarked'' describes situations in which a markedness constraint has an intermediate ranking, so that it is violated in some forms, but nonetheless has observable effects when higher-ranked constraints are irrelevant.

An early example proposed by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1994) is the constraint {{sc1|NoCoda}}, which prohibits syllables from ending in consonants. In [[Balangao]], {{sc1|NoCoda}} is not ranked high enough to be always obeyed, as witnessed in roots like ''taynan'' (faithfulness to the input prevents deletion of the final {{IPA|/n/}}). But, in the [[reduplication|reduplicated]] form ''ma-tayna-taynan'' 'repeatedly be left behind', the final {{IPA|/n/}} is not copied. Under McCarthy &amp; Prince's analysis, this is because faithfulness to the input does not apply to reduplicated material, and {{sc1|NoCoda}} is thus free to prefer ''ma-tayna-taynan'' over hypothetical ''ma-taynan-taynan'' (which has an additional violation of {{sc1|NoCoda}}).

Some optimality theorists prefer the use of comparative tableaux, as described in Prince (2002b). Comparative tableaux display the same information as the classic or "flyspeck" tableaux, but the information is presented in such a way that it highlights the most crucial information. For instance, the tableau above would be rendered in the following way.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Comparative tableau
! !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 1 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 2 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 3
|-
! A ~ B
| e || W || L
|}

Each row in a comparative tableau represents a winner–loser pair, rather than an individual candidate. In the cells where the constraints assess the winner–loser pairs, "W" is placed if the constraint in that column prefers the winner, "L" if the constraint prefers the loser, and "e" if the constraint does not differentiate between the pair. Presenting the data in this way makes it easier to make generalizations. For instance, in order to have a consistent ranking ''some'' W must dominate ''all'' L's. Brasoveanu and Prince (2005) describe a process known as fusion and the various ways of presenting data in a comparative tableau in order to achieve the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given argument.

==Example==
As a simplified example, consider the manifestation of the English plural:

* {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/ → [dɒɡz]}} (''dogs'')
* {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/ → [kæts]}} (''cats'')
* {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/ → [dɪʃɪz]}} (''dishes'')

Also consider the following constraint set, in descending order of domination:

{| class="wikitable"

No matter how the constraints are re-ordered, the allomorph {{IPA|[ɪs]}} will always lose to {{IPA|[ɪz]}}. This is called ''harmonic bounding''. The violations incurred by the candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡɪz]}} are a subset of the violations incurred by {{IPA|[dɒɡɪs]}}; specifically, if you epenthesize a vowel, changing the voicing of the morpheme is a gratuitous violation of constraints. In the {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}} tableau, there is a candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} which incurs no violations whatsoever. Within the constraint set of the problem, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} harmonically bounds all other possible candidates. This shows that a candidate does not need to be a winner in order to harmonically bound another candidate.

The tableaux from above are repeated below using the comparative tableaux format.

From the comparative tableau for {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}}, it can be observed that any ranking of these constraints will produce the observed output {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}}. Because there are no loser-preferring comparisons, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} wins under any ranking of these constraints; this means that no ranking can be established on the basis of this input.

The tableau for {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} contains rows with a single W and a single L. This shows that {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, and {{sc1|Dep}} must all dominate {{sc1|Ident}}; however, no ranking can be established between those constraints on the basis of this input. Based on this tableau, the following ranking has been established
: {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}.

The tableau for {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/}} shows that several more rankings are necessary in order to predict the desired outcome. The first row says nothing; there is no loser-preferring comparison in the first row. The second row reveals that either *SS or {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, based on the comparison between {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} and {{IPA|[dɪʃz]}}. The third row shows that {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. The final row shows that either *SS or {{sc1|Ident}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. From the {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} tableau, it was established that {{sc1|Dep}} dominates {{sc1|Ident}}; this means that *SS must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}.

So far, the following rankings have been shown to be necessary:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

While it is possible that {{sc1|Agree}} can dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, it is not necessary; the ranking given above is sufficient for the observed for {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} to emerge.

When the rankings from the tableaux are combined, the following ranking summary can be given:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}
::or
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Agree}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

There are two possible places to put {{sc1|Agree}} when writing out rankings linearly; neither is truly accurate. The first implies that *SS and {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Agree}}, and the second implies that {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. Neither of these are truthful, which is a failing of writing out rankings in a linear fashion like this. These sorts of problems are the reason why most linguists utilize a [[Lattice (order)|lattice graph]] to represent necessary and sufficient rankings, as shown below.

[[File:Lattice 2.jpg|Lattice graph of necessary and sufficient rankings]]

A diagram that represents the necessary rankings of constraints in this style is a [[Hasse diagram]].

==Criticism==
Optimality Theory has attracted substantial amounts of criticism, most of which is directed at its application to phonology (rather than syntax or other fields).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dresher (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale &amp; Reiss (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halle (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that Optimality Theory cannot account for [[phonological opacity]] (see Idsardi 2000, for example). In derivational phonology, effects that are inexplicable at the surface level but are explainable through "opaque" rule ordering may be seen; but in Optimality Theory, which has no intermediate levels for rules to operate on, these effects are difficult to explain.

For example, in [[Quebec French]], high front vowels triggered affrication of {{IPA|/t/}}, (e.g. {{IPA|/tipik/ → [tˢpɪk]}}), but the loss of high vowels (visible at the surface level) has left the affrication with no apparent source. Derivational phonology can explain this by stating that vowel [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] (the loss of the vowel) "counterbled" affrication—that is, instead of vowel syncope occurring and "[[bleeding order|bleeding]]" (i.e. preventing) affrication, it says that affrication applies before vowel syncope, so that the high vowel is removed and the environment destroyed which had triggered affrication. Such counterbleeding rule orderings are therefore termed ''opaque'' (as opposed to ''transparent''), because their effects are not visible at the surface level.

The opacity of such phenomena finds no straightforward explanation in Optimality Theory, since intermediate forms are not accessible (constraints refer only to the surface form and/or the underlying form). There have been a number of proposals designed to account for it, but most of the proposals significantly alter Optimality Theory's basic architecture and therefore tend to be highly controversial. Frequently, such alterations add new types of constraints (which are not universal faithfulness or markedness constraints), or change the properties of {{sc1|Gen}} (such as allowing for serial derivations) or {{sc1|Eval}}. Examples of these include [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]'s sympathy theory and candidate chains theory, among many others.

A relevant issue is the existence of circular [[chain shift]]s, i.e. cases where input {{IPA|/X/}} maps to output {{IPA|[Y]}}, but input {{IPA|/Y/}} maps to output {{IPA|[X]}}. Many versions of Optimality Theory predict this to be impossible (see Moreton 2004, Prince 2007).

Optimality Theory is also criticized as being an impossible model of speech production/perception: computing and comparing an infinite number of possible candidates would take an infinitely long time to process. Idsardi (2006) argues this position, though other linguists dispute this claim on the grounds that Idsardi makes unreasonable assumptions about the constraint set and candidates, and that more moderate instantiations of Optimality Theory do not present such significant [[computational problem]]s (see Kornai (2006) and Heinz, Kobele &amp; Riggle (2009)). Another common rebuttal to this criticism of Optimality Theory is that the framework is purely representational. In this view, Optimality Theory is taken to be a model of [[linguistic competence]] and is therefore not intended to explain the specifics of [[linguistic performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kager, René (1999). Optimality Theory. Section 1.4.4: Fear of infinity, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan and Paul Smolensky. (2004): ''Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar''. Section 10.1.1: Fear of Optimization, pp. 215–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to Optimality Theory is that it is not technically a theory, in that it does not make falsifiable predictions. The source of this issue may be in terminology: the term ''theory'' is used differently here than in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. Specific instantiations of Optimality Theory may make falsifiable predictions, in the same way specific proposals within other linguistic frameworks can. What predictions are made, and whether they are testable, depends on the specifics of individual proposals (most commonly, this is a matter of the definitions of the constraints used in an analysis). Thus, Optimality Theory as a framework is best described{{according to whom|date=June 2018}} as a [[scientific paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;de Lacy (editor). (2007). ''The Cambridge Handbook of Phonology'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories within Optimality Theory==
In practice, implementations of Optimality Theory often assume other related concepts, such as the [[syllable]], the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]], or [[feature geometry]]. Completely distinct from these, there are sub-theories which have been proposed entirely within Optimality Theory, such as [[positional faithfulness theory]], correspondence theory (McCarthy &amp; Prince 1995), sympathy theory, and a number of theories of learnability, most notably by [[Bruce Tesar]].
There are also a range of theories specifically about Optimality Theory. These are concerned with issues like the possible formulations of constraints, and constraint interactions other than strict domination.

==Use outside of phonology==
Optimality Theory is most commonly associated with the field of [[phonology]], but has also been applied to other areas of linguistics. [[Jane Grimshaw]], [[Geraldine Legendre]] and [[Joan Bresnan]] have developed instantiations of the theory within [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, John (2001). A Thematic Guide to Optimality Theory, Chapter 4: Connections of Optimality Theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legendre, Grimshaw &amp; Vikner (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Optimality theoretic approaches are also relatively prominent in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (and the morphology–phonology interface in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Trommer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Polymer Science and Technology'' is a consortium of research groups, formed in 1989 from the Universities of [http://www.dur.ac.uk Durham], [http://www.leeds.ac.uk Leeds] and [http://www.bradford.ac.uk Bradford], all of whom are involved research in polymer science and technology.  The University of [http://www.sheffield.ac.uk Sheffield] joined in 2004. The Polymer IRC has complementary expertise in [[polymer chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[Chemical process|processing]] with research programmes covering a wide range of multi-disciplinary polymer science and technology.

Research programmes in the Polymer IRC are funded by grants from government bodies, in particular the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and [[industry]]. 

From 2011 the Polymer IRC has been centred at the extensive polymer engineering laboratories at the University of Bradford, [http://www.polyeng.com Polymer IRC] with further interdisciplinary research in polymers with pharmaceuticals, and, since 2015, materials chemistry.  From 2009, a substantial Science Bridges China programme in Advanced Materials for Healthcare with leading Chinese universities began, which has led to three joint international research laboratories and many early career researcher exchanges [http://www.ukchina-amri.com Science Bridges China].

According to the [[Context-based model of minimal counterintuiveness]], postdictable counterintuitive concepts are minimally counterintuitive and are remembered well.  Those counterintuitive concepts that are not postdictable in a given context are considered to be maximally counterintuitive and are not remembered well by people. Thus the concept of a flying elephant is postdictable (and thus minimally counterintuitive) when set up in the context of [[Operation Dumbo Drop]] because it can be justified in that context.  The concept of a "square triangle that only exists on Wednesdays and eats cats" however does not make any sense and is therefore not postdictable.

'''ProLiteracy''', also known as '''ProLiteracy Worldwide''', is an international [[nonprofit]] organization based in [[Syracuse, N.Y.]], that supports programs that help adults learn to read and write. It is the largest adult literacy and basic education membership organization in the United States. ProLiteracy has over 800 member programs in the U.S. and is active in 20 developing countries&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy: Get Involved. [https://www.proliteracy.org/Get-Involved/Become-a-Member/ProLiteracy-Member-Organizations "ProLiteracy Member Organizations"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy: What We Do.

==History==
[[File:George W. Bush and Ruth Johnson Colvin.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Ruth Johnson Colvin with President [[George W. Bush]] receiving the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] on Friday, Dec. 15, 2006]]

ProLiteracy was formed when Laubach Literacy International and Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. merged in 2002.

Laubach Literacy International’s history began in 1930, when [[Frank Laubach|Dr. Frank C. Laubach]] was a [[missionary]] among the [[Maranao]] people of the [[Philippines]]. His concern about their poor living conditions led him to conclude that the ability to read and write was essential for them to begin to solve their problems. As the Maranaos learned to read, they would, in turn, teach other adults on a one-to-one basis that became known as “Each One Teach One.” From 1935 to 1967, Dr. Laubach visited 105 countries answering calls for literacy help and created reading lessons in 315 languages. He founded Laubach Literacy International in Syracuse, N.Y. in 1955.

For years, [[literacy]] as a global mission interested [[Ruth Johnson Colvin]]. She had heard Dr. Laubach speak about [[literacy|illiteracy]] in faraway countries, but she didn’t consider it a problem in [[United States|America]]. So she was shocked when she read a 1961 Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper article that stated there were over 11,000 people in her county who could not read or write well (based on 1960 U.S. Census figures). She began speaking with local [[social service]] agencies, community leaders, and church groups about the problem. With the help of reading experts, she developed a means to train volunteers to tutor adults. In 1962, she started Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc.&lt;ref name="proliteracy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proliteracy.org/NetCommunity/Document.Doc?id=3 |year=2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |title=Ruth J.

== Mission==
ProLiteracy believes every adult has a right to literacy. ProLiteracy develops and promotes adult literacy learning, content, programs and advocacy to help adult learners.

==Overview==
ProLiteracy’s Programs division works in the U.S. and around the world. ProLiteracy has [[grassroots]] partner programs in developing countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Latin America]], and the [[Middle East]]. ProLiteracy provides training, technical assistance, and targeted local grants to support tailored programs that combine literacy with economic self-reliance, [[health]], [[education]], [[peace]], [[human rights]], and [[environmental sustainability]] projects.

In the U.S., ProLiteracy represents over 800 community-based [[Volunteering|volunteer]] and adult basic education affiliates in 49 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. ProLiteracy accredits programs and supports them with technical assistance and program and professional development services online, in regional trainings, and at a biennial conference. ProLiteracy also serves as an advocate for issues related to adult literacy and lifelong learning.

New Readers Press, ProLiteracy’s publishing house, generates $7 million in revenue annually through the sale of materials used in teaching adults and older teens. Proceeds from these sales support the services that ProLiteracy offers to literacy practitioners. News for You, published by New Readers Press, is a weekly online and print news source for English language learners and basic literacy students.

==Programs==
The National Book Fund (NBF) gives grants of New Readers Press books and materials directly to local literacy service providers. The NBF provides books for family literacy programs that work with parents and children, English-as-a-second-language ([[ESL]]) programs, adult basic education initiatives, and women-focused programming.

ProLiteracy began its Women In Literacy (WIL) initiative in 1991 in response to the particular needs of women. Cultural traditions and local laws often favor men, allowing them access to education, property, employment, health care, and participation in government that is denied to women. ProLiteracy's Women in Literacy initiative gives women the literacy skills they need to understand and change their daily lives. Women hold key leadership positions in more than 80 percent of WIL partner programs.

==Funding==
About 60 percent of ProLiteracy’s funding comes from sales of its educational materials. About 35 percent comes from private sources, including individuals, corporations, and foundations. The remainder comes from affiliate dues and investment income.

In 2011, more than 81 percent of donor contributions were allocated to program expenses.

==Accountability Standards==
A 2017 report by the [[Better Business Bureau|Better Business Bureau's]] [[Wise Giving Alliance]] (WGA) found that ProLiteracy met all of its standards for charity accountability. The WGA found that ProLiteracy is truthful in its representations of how money is spent, does not allocate an excessive part of its budget for fundraising or administrative expenses, and makes its financial statements readily available to the public.

==Financial Turmoil, Downsizing, and Recovery==
From 2009 to 2013, under then-President and CEO David C. Harvey, ProLiteracy faced severe financial issues, with a $1.8 million shortfall and a $1.7 million loss in net assets in 2012&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy (05 Sep 2015). About Us: Finances. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150905054957/http://www.proliteracy.org/about-us/finances "Form 990, 2013"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Moving their headquarters to a revitalized warehouse and investing in the local [[Syracuse NY|Syracuse, NY]] community were contributing factors in the shortfall, including its newly-opened Ruth J. Colvin Center for Innovation and Excellence in Adult Literacy, a public computer lab designed to teach adults computer literacy&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Maureen (28 May 2012). Syracuse.com. [http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/proliteracy_moves_into_new_dig.html "ProLiteracy moves into new digs on Syracuse's Near West Side"]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Six months after the move to ProLiteracy's new headquarters, Harvey resigned as President and CEO. Kevin J. Morgan, Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2009, stated that Harvey "went on to pursue other opportunities in the Washington, D.C., area, and let's leave it at that"&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Ellis (30 Nov 2012). Syracuse.com. [http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/proliteracy_ceo_resigns_chairm.html "ProLiteracy CEO leaves; chairman of the board named interim director"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite likely being a significant contributing factor to the financial mismanagement leading to the crisis, Harvey himself purported to have "Led a turn-around operation for a $9 million international organization" during said pursuit of "other opportunities in the Washington, D.C., area"&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David C. (28 May 2013). Blogspot.com. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140210231628/http://davidharveyproliteracy.blogspot.com "David C. Harvey: Seeking Interim Executive Positions, Consultancies"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Harvey has been the Executive Director of the National Coalition of STD Directors since 2016&lt;ref&gt;National Coalition of STD Directors (2018). [http://www.ncsddc.org/about/our-staff/ "Our Staff"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Morgan, who received his graduate degree in marketing from [[DeVry University]], was appointed Interim President and CEO, dividing his time between ProLiteracy and Full Suspension Marketing, a small, Utah-based startup and marketing agency he founded in 2007&lt;ref&gt;LinkedIn (2018). [https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-morgan-280b28/ "Kevin Morgan, President and CEO at ProLiteracy Worldwide"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UtahDB. [https://utahdb.com/company/6468908-0142/full-suspension-marketing-inc.html "Full Suspension Marketing"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Utah's Right to Know. [http://www.utahsright.com/employers.php?county=summit&amp;order=Industry&amp;oType=ASC&amp;page=28 "Utah's Largest Employers"]&lt;/ref&gt;. The ProLiteracy Board of Directors then "formed a search committee for a new president and CEO," said Morgan, concluding that "sometimes it happens quickly, other times it may take some time, depending on who you talk to"&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Ellis (30 Nov 2012). ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Despite raising over $1 million in charitable donations to refurbish ProLiteracy's new headquarters in the midst of the crisis, it faced yet another shortfall of $1.2 million in 2013, receiving a 1-star rating on [[Charity Navigator]] following nearly a decade of fluctuating between 1- and 2-stars, prompting Harvey's 2010 public criticism of the charity watchdog as an "imperfect way to assess" &lt;ref&gt;Salt District (11 Jul 2012). [http://www.saltdistrict.com/2012/07/wcny/ "ProLiteracy Moves to Case Supply"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charity Navigator (2018). [https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.history&amp;orgid=4007 "Historical Records for ProLiteracy"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David C. (31 Oct 2010). Syracuse Post-Standard. [http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2010/10/new_york_post-standard_endorse.html "New York, Post-Standard endorsements, United Way, Charity Navigator, ProLiteracy"]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

During the following fiscal year, ProLiteracy downsized considerably, laying off the majority of its full-time staff and shutting down budding investments into the local [[Syracuse NY|Syracuse, NY]] community&lt;ref&gt;LinkedIn (2018). [https://www.linkedin.com/company/proliteracy-worldwide/ "ProLiteracy Worldwide"]&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, ProLiteracy significantly reduced its international involvement from 30 to 20 countries&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David C. (01 Apr 2012). Syracuse Post-Standard. [http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2012/04/ubuntu_on_the_near_west_side_l.html "Ubuntu on the Near West Side: 'Literacy for Social Change' comes home to Syracuse"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy: What We Do. [https://www.proliteracy.org/What-We-Do/Programs-Projects/International "International Programs"]&lt;/ref&gt;. In effect, ProLiteracy ended its 2014 fiscal year with $3 million in revenues less expenses and nearly double their net assets, from $3.3 to $6.3 million&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy (05 Sep 2015). About Us: Finances. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150905054957/http://www.proliteracy.org/about-us/finances "Form 990, 2013"]&lt;/ref&gt;. The search committee dissolved, as did Morgan's marketing agency, and he remains President and CEO to this day&lt;ref&gt;ProLiteracy (2018). [https://proliteracy.org/About-Us/Leadership/Staff "About Us: Leadership"]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, ProLiteracy was awarded its first 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, a composite of a 3-star rating in financial health and 4-star rating in accountability and transparency&lt;ref&gt;Charity Navigator (2018). [https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=4007 "Rating for ProLiteracy"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[electronics]] and [[electrical engineering]], a '''ramp generator''' is a circuit that creates a linear rising or falling output with respect to time. The output variable is usually voltage, although current ramps can be created.
Linear ramp generators are also known as sweep generators

Ramp generator produces a Sawtooth wave form, Suppose a 3V is applied to input of a comparator of X terminal and ramp generator at Y terminal. the ramp generator starts increasing its voltage but, still lower than input X terminal of the comparator the output shall be 1, As soon as the ramp voltage is equal to or more than X, comparator output goes low.
   
==Applications==
Voltage and current linear ramp generator find wide application in instrumentation and communication systems. 
Ramp generators used in [[electrical generator]]s or [[electric motor]]s to avoid transients when changing a load.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3892">A '''range-finder painting''', sometimes called '''range-finding painting''',&lt;ref name=walter-bloom/&gt; is a large [[landscape painting]] produced as a training device to help gunners improve their accuracy. Historically, the best-documented use of such paintings was in the United States during [[World War I]].

==History==
During World War I, some military gunnery training was carried out indoors.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; While it is relatively simple to train gunners in [[Rangefinder|range-finding]] (that is, estimating the correct distance for their shots) outdoors, it is difficult to train them in long-range gunnery indoors.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; To solve this problem, the British&lt;ref name=walter-bloom/&gt; and U.S. militaries tested the use of large landscape paintings showing distant sites for range-finding and target-sighting in indoor gun ranges.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; These so-called range-finder paintings proved so successful that a program was organized in the United States to produce them in larger numbers.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; They were also used to teach soldiers how to draw military maps in the field and how to identify points of military importance such as zones of good cover.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

In 1918, the [[Salmagundi Club]] in New York spearheaded the effort to produce range-finder paintings for the U.S. military, providing canvas and painting materials.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; The program resulted in dozens of landscape paintings of various French and Belgian sites that were roughly {{convert|50|x|70|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=hassrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; Most showed towns and villages in the near or middle distance, along with other militarily important features such as roads, bridges, canals, fields, forests, and hills.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; 

The painter [[Ernest L. Blumenschein]] helped to draft and organize artists across the United States for this effort, especially in his home town of [[Taos, New Mexico]], and nearby [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].&lt;ref name=hassrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; In Taos alone, 15 such range-finder paintings of landscapes in France were produced in 1918.&lt;ref name=hassrick/&gt; Some of these were sent to [[Camp Cody (military camp)|Camp Cody]] in southern New Mexico and to [[Camp Funston]] in Kansas.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

Artists who participated besides Blumenschein included [[Gustave Baumann]], [[O.E. Berninghaus]], [[Harriet Blackstone]], [[Paul Burlin]], Ethel Coe, [[E. Irving Couse]], [[W. Herbert Dunton]], [[Leon Gaspard]], Burt Harwood, Lee Hersch, J.T. Hunter, Sheldon Parsons, [[Bert Geer Phillips]], J.H. Sharp, [[Walter Ufer]], [[Cordelia Wilson]], and Jay Young-Hunter.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;

The '''Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive''' 2002/95/EC, '''(RoHS 1)''', short for '''Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment''', was adopted in February 2003 by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:037:0019:0023:EN:PDF |format=PDF |title=DIRECTIVE 2002/95/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RoHS 1 [[European Union directive|directive]] took effect on 1 July 2006, and is required to be enforced and became a law in each member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assentcompliance.com/rohs/ |title=Turnkey RoHS &amp; RoHS II Module |website=''assentcompliance.com'' |access-date=17 May 2016 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528201136/http://www.assentcompliance.com/rohs/ |archive-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This directive restricts (with [[#Restriction Exemptions|exceptions]]) the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment. It is closely linked with the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE) 2002/96/EC which sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods and is part of a legislative initiative to solve the problem of huge amounts of toxic [[electronic waste]]. In speech, RoHS is often spelled out, or pronounced {{IPAc-en|r|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|r|ɒ|ʃ}}, {{IPAc-en|r|oʊ|z}}, or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|h|ɒ|z}}, and refers to the EU standard, unless otherwise qualified.

== Details ==
Each European Union member state will adopt its own enforcement and implementation policies using the directive as a guide.

'''RoHS''' is often referred to as the "lead-free directive", but it restricts the use of the following ten substances:
# Lead (Pb)
# [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] (Hg)
# [[Cadmium]] (Cd)
# [[Hexavalent chromium]] (Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;)
# [[Polybrominated biphenyls]] (PBB)
# [[PBDE|Polybrominated diphenyl ether]] (PBDE)
# [[DEHP|Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]] (DEHP)
# [[Benzyl butyl phthalate|Butyl benzyl phthalate]] (BBP)
# [[Dibutyl phthalate]] (DBP)
# [[Diisobutyl phthalate]] (DIBP)

DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP were added as part of DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/863 which was published on 31 March 2015.&lt;ref name="Eur-lex.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2015_137_R_0003 |title=EURLex – 32015L0863 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=1 February 2016 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209151244/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2015_137_R_0003 |archive-date=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PBB and PBDE are [[flame retardant]]s used in several plastics. Hexavalent chromium is used in chrome plating, chromate coatings and primers, and in chromic acid.

The maximum permitted concentrations in non-[[#Restriction Exemptions|exempt products]] are 0.1% or 1000 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (except for cadmium, which is limited to 0.01% or 100 ppm) by weight. The restrictions are on each  ''homogeneous material'' in the product, which means that the limits do not apply to the weight of the finished product, or even to a component, but to any single substance that could (theoretically) be separated mechanically—for example, the sheath on a cable or the tinning on a component lead.

As an example, a radio is composed of a case, screws, washers, a circuit board, speakers, etc. The screws, washers, and case may each be made of homogenous materials, but the other components comprise multiple sub-components of many different types of material. For instance, a circuit board is composed of a bare [[Printed circuit board|PCB]], [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s, resistors, capacitors, switches, etc. A switch is composed of a case, a lever, a spring, contacts, pins, etc., each of which may be made of different materials. A contact might be composed of a copper strip with a surface coating. A speaker is composed of a permanent magnet, copper wire, paper, etc.

Everything that can be identified as a homogeneous material must meet the limit. So if it turns out that the case was made of plastic with 2,300 ppm (0.23%) PBB used as a flame retardant, then the entire radio would fail the requirements of the directive.

In an effort to close RoHS 1 loopholes, in May 2006 the European Commission was asked to review two currently excluded product categories (monitoring and control equipment, and medical devices) for future inclusion in the products that must fall into RoHS compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edn.com/article/CA6333546.html?partner=enews]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174054/http://www.edn.com/article/CA6333546.html?partner=enews|date=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the commission entertains requests for deadline extensions or for exclusions by substance categories, substance location or weight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reed-electronics.com/semiconductor/article/CA6333371?spacedesc=news&amp;industryid=3026&amp;nid=2301]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704234124/http://www.reed-electronics.com/semiconductor/article/CA6333371?spacedesc=news&amp;industryid=3026&amp;nid=2301|date=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New legislation was published in the official journal in July 2011 which supersedes this exemption.

Note that batteries are not included within the scope of RoHS. However, in Europe, batteries are under the European Commission's 1991 Battery Directive (91/157/EEC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0157:EN:NOT |title=EURLex – 31991L0157 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which was recently increased in scope and approved in the form of the new [[battery directive]], version 2003/0282 COD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0066:EN:NOT |title=EURLex – 32006L0066 – EN – EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date=26 September 2006 |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will be official when submitted to and published in the EU's Official Journal. While the first Battery Directive addressed possible trade barrier issues brought about by disparate European member states' implementation, the new directive more explicitly highlights improving and protecting the environment from the negative effects of the waste contained in batteries. It also contains a programme for more ambitious recycling of industrial, automotive, and consumer batteries, gradually increasing the rate of manufacturer-provided collection sites to 45% by 2016. It also sets limits of 5 ppm mercury and 20 ppm cadmium to batteries except those used in medical, emergency, or portable power-tool devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conformity.com/artman/publish/printer_25.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302101640/http://www.conformity.com/artman/publish/printer_25.shtml|date=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not setting quantitative limits on quantities of lead, lead-acid, nickel, and nickel-cadmium in batteries, it cites a need to restrict these substances and provide for recycling up to 75% of batteries with these substances. There are also provisions for marking the batteries with symbols in regard to metal content and recycling collection information.

The directive applies to equipment as defined by a section of the WEEE directive. The following numeric categories apply:
# Large household appliances.
# Small household appliances.
# IT &amp; Telecommunications equipment (although infrastructure equipment is exempt in some countries)
# Consumer equipment.
# Lighting equipment—including light bulbs.
# Electronic and electrical tools.
# Toys, leisure, and sports equipment.
# Medical devices (exemption removed in July 2011)
# Monitoring and control instruments (exemption removed in July 2011)
# Automatic dispensers.
# Semiconductor devices

It does not apply to fixed industrial plant and tools. Compliance is the responsibility of the company that puts the product on the market, as defined in the Directive; components and sub-assemblies are not responsible for product compliance. Of course, given the fact that the regulation is applied at the homogeneous material level, data on substance concentrations needs to be transferred through the supply chain to the final producer. An IPC standard has recently been developed and published to facilitate this data exchange, IPC-1752.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipc.org/ipc-175x]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315161952/http://www.ipc.org/ipc-175x|date=15 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is enabled through two PDF forms that are free to use.

RoHS applies to these products in the EU whether made within the EU or imported. Certain exemptions apply, and these are updated on occasion by the EU.

===Examples of product components containing restricted substances===
RoHS restricted substances have been used in a broad array of consumer electronics products. Examples of components that have contained lead include:
* paints and pigments
* PVC (vinyl) cables as a stabiliser (e.g., power cords, USB cables)
* [[solder]]s
* printed circuit board finishes, leads, internal and external interconnects
*glass in television and photographic products (e.g., CRT television screens and camera lenses)
* metal parts
* lamps and bulbs
* batteries
* [[integrated circuits]] or microchips

Cadmium is found in many of the components above; examples include plastic pigmentation, [[Nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries]] and [[Cadmium sulfide|CdS]] photocells (used in night lights). Mercury is used in lighting applications and automotive switches; examples include [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[Mercury switch|mercury tilt switches]] (these are rarely used nowadays). Hexavalent chromium is used for metal finishes to prevent corrosion. Polybrominated biphenyls and diphenyl Ethers/Oxides are used primarily as flame retardants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thor.inemi.org/webdownload/newsroom/Presentations/11.pdf |format=PDF |title=Elimination of RoHS Substances in Electronic Products |publisher=Thor.inemi.org |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003535/http://thor.inemi.org/webdownload/newsroom/Presentations/11.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hazardous materials and the high-tech waste problem ===
RoHS and other efforts to reduce hazardous materials in electronics are motivated in part to address the global issue of consumer electronics waste. As newer technology arrives at an ever-increasing rate, consumers are discarding their obsolete products sooner than ever. This waste ends up in landfills and in countries like China to be "recycled."&lt;ref name=es071873x/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the fashion-conscious mobile market, 98 million U.S. cell phones took their last call in 2005. All told, the EPA estimates that in the U.S. that year, between 1.5 and 1.9&amp;nbsp;million tons of computers, TVs, VCRs, monitors, cell phones, and other equipment were discarded. If all sources of electronic waste are tallied, it could total 50&amp;nbsp;million tons a year worldwide, according to the UN Environment Programme.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/high-tech-waste/carroll-text |title=High-Tech Waste – National Geographic Magazine |work=National Geographic |date=2013-04-25 |access-date=2015-07-03 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325045021/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/01/high-tech-waste/carroll-text |archive-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

American electronics sent offshore to countries like Ghana in West Africa under the guise of recycling may be doing more harm than good. Not only are adult and child workers in these jobs being poisoned by heavy metals, but these metals are returning to the U.S. "The U.S. right now is shipping large quantities of leaded materials to China, and China is the world's major manufacturing center," Dr. Jeffrey Weidenhamer says, a chemistry professor at Ashland University in Ohio. "It's not all that surprising things are coming full circle and now we're getting contaminated products back."&lt;ref name=es071873x&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es071873x |laysummary=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9919304-54.html |laysource=CNET |laydate=2008-04-15 |title=Heavy Metals Concentrations of Surface Dust from e-Waste Recycling and Its Human Health Implications in Southeast China |year=2008 |last1=Leung |first1=Anna O.

C. |last4=Wong |first4=Ming H. |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=2674–80 |pmid=18505015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing toxicity perceptions ===
In addition to the high-tech waste problem, RoHS reflects contemporary research over the past 50 years in biological toxicology that acknowledges the long-term effects of low-level chemical exposure on populations. New testing is capable of detecting much smaller concentrations of environmental toxicants. Researchers are associating these exposures with neurological, developmental, and reproductive changes.

RoHS and other environmental laws are in contrast to historical and contemporary law that seek to address only acute toxicology, that is direct exposure to large amounts of toxic substances causing severe injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rohswell.com/News/Genl037-New-Toxicity.php |title=Archive |publisher=Rohswell.com |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125233538/http://rohswell.com/News/Genl037-New-Toxicity.php |archive-date=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life-cycle impact assessment of lead-free solder ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has published a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the environmental impacts of lead-free and tin-lead [[solder]], as used in electronic products.&lt;ref name="EPALifecycle"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/dfe/pubs/solder/lca/index.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314205628/http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/dfe/pubs/solder/lca/index.htm|date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For bar solders, when only lead-free solders were considered, the tin/copper alternative had the lowest (best) scores. For paste solders, [[bismuth]]/[[tin]]/silver had the lowest impact scores among the lead-free alternatives in every category except [[non-renewable resource]] consumption. For both paste and bar solders, all of the lead-free solder alternatives had a lower (better) LCA score in toxicity categories than tin/lead solder. This is primarily due to the toxicity of lead, and the amount of lead that leaches from printed wiring board assemblies, as determined by the leachability study conducted by the partnership. The study results are providing the industry with an objective analysis of the life-cycle environmental effects of leading candidate alternative lead-free solders, allowing industry to consider environmental concerns along with the traditionally evaluated parameters of cost and performance. This assessment is also allowing industry to redirect efforts toward products and processes that reduce solders' environmental footprint, including energy consumption, releases of toxic chemicals, and potential risks to human health and the environment. Another life-cycle assessment by IKP, University of Stuttgart, shows similar results to those of the EPA study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leadfree.ipc.org/files/RoHS_15.pdf |format=PDF |title=IKP, Department of Life-Cycle Engineering |publisher=Leadfree.ipc.org |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225155540/http://leadfree.ipc.org/files/RoHS_15.pdf |archive-date=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life-cycle impact assessment of BFR-free plastics===
The ban on concentrations of [[brominated flame retardant]]s (BFR) above 0.1% in plastics has affected plastics recycling. As more and more products include recycled plastics, it has become critical to know the BFR concentration in these plastics, either by tracing the origins of the recycled plastics to establish the BFR concentrations, or by measuring the BFR concentrations from samples. Plastics with high BFR concentrations are costly to handle or to discard, whereas plastics with levels below 0.1% have value as recyclable materials.

There are a number of analytical techniques for the rapid measurement of BFR concentrations. [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]] can confirm the presence of bromine (Br), but it does not indicate the BFR concentration or specific molecule. [[Ion attachment mass spectrometry]] (IAMS) can be used to measure BFR concentrations in plastics. The BFR ban has significantly affected both upstream – plastic material selection – and downstream – plastic material recycling.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

=== {{anchor|RoHS 2}}2011/65/EU (RoHS 2) ===
The RoHS 2 directive (2011/65/EU) is an evolution of the original directive and became law on 21 July 2011 and took effect 2 January 2013. It addresses the same substances as the original directive while improving regulatory conditions and legal clarity. It requires periodic re-evaluations that facilitate gradual broadening of its requirements to cover additional electronic and electrical equipment, cables and spare parts.&lt;ref name="HP-RoHS2"&gt;{{cite web |author=&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;United States&amp;#160; |url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/environment/pdf/RoHS2Addendum.pdf |title=Living Progress &amp;#124; HP® Official Site |publisher=Hp.com |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917032105/http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/environment/pdf/RoHS2Addendum.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CE logo now indicates compliance and RoHS 2 declaration of conformity is now detailed (see below).{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 2012, a final report from the [[European Commission]] revealed that some EU Member States considered all toys under the scope of the primary RoHS 1 Directive 2002/95/EC, irrespective of whether their primary or secondary functions were using electric currents or electromagnetic fields. From the implementation of RoHS 2 or RoHS Recast Directive 2011/65/EU on, all the concerned Member States will have to comply with the new regulation.

The key difference in the recast is that it is now necessary to demonstrate conformity in a similar way to the LVD and EMC directives.  Not being able to show compliance in sufficiently detailed files, and not ensuring it is implemented in production is now a criminal offence.  Like the other CE marking directives it mandates production control and traceability to the technical files.  It describes 2 methods of achieving presumption of conformity (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 16.2), either technical files should include test data for all materials or a standard accepted in the official journal for the directive, is used.  Currently the only standard is EN50581, a risk based method to reduce the amount of test data required (Harmonised Standards list for RoHS2, OJEU C363/6).

One of the consequences of the requirement to demonstrate conformity is the requirement to know the exemption use of each component, otherwise it is not possible to know compliance when the product is placed on the market, the only point in time the product must be 'compliant'.  Many do not understand that 'compliance' varies depending on what exemptions are in force and it is quite possible to make a non-compliant product with 'compliant' components.  Compliance must be calculated on the day of placing on the market.  In reality this means knowing the exemption status of all components and using up stock of old status parts before the expire date of the exemptions (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 7.b referring to Decision 768/2008/EC Module A Internal production control).   Not having a system to manage this could be seen as a lack of diligence and a criminal prosecution could occur (UK Instrument 2012 N. 3032 section 39 Penalties).

RoHS 2 also has a more dynamic approach to exemptions, creating an automatic expiration if exemptions are not renewed by requests from industry.  Additionally new substances can be added to the controlled list, with 4 new substances expected to be controlled by 2019.  All these mean greater information control and update systems are required. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Other differences include new responsibilities for importers and distributors and markings to improve traceability to the technical files.  These are part of the NLF for directives and make the supply chain a more active part of the policing (Directive 2011/65/EU Articles 7, 9, 10).

There has been a recent additional amendment 2017/2012 to 2011/65

=== (EU) 2015/863 ===

The RoHS 2 directive (2011/65/EU) contains allowance to add new materials and 4 materials are highlighted for this attention in the original version, the amendment 2015/863 adds four additional substances to Annex II of 2011/65/EU (3/4 of the new restrictions are recommended for investigation in the original directive, ref Para 10 of preamble).   This is another reason that simple component RoHS compliance statements are not acceptable as compliance requirements vary depending on the date the product is placed on the market (ref EN50581:2012).   The additional four substances restriction and evidence requirements shall be applied for products placed on the market on or after 22 July 2019 except where exemptions permit as stated in Annex III.&lt;ref name="Eur-lex.europa.eu"/&gt;, although it should be noted that at the time of writing no exemptions exist or have been applied for, for these materials.   
The four additional substances are
# Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)
# Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)
# Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)
# Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)
The maximum permitted concentrations in non-exempt products are 0.1%.

The new substances are also listed under the Reach Candidate list, and DEHP is not authorised for manufacturing (use as a substance) in the EU under annexe XIV of Reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table |title=Candidate List of substances of very high concern for Authorisation – ECHA |publisher=Europa (web portal) |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712130156/https://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table |archive-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restriction exemptions==&lt;!--WARNING: Do not break internal links: Do not rename without renaming internal links to this section as well!--&gt;
{{anchor|Restriction Exemptions}}
There are over 80 exemptions, some of which are quite broad.  Exemptions will automatically expire after 5 or 7 years unless renewed.&lt;ref name="HP-RoHS2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/directive-decoder/exemptions/2-new-additions-to-the-rohs-ex-2011-09 |title=2 new additions to RoHS exemption list |publisher=Electronicsweekly.com|access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705160628/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/directive-decoder/exemptions/2-new-additions-to-the-rohs-ex-2011-09/ |archive-date=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hewlett Packard: "The European Union is gradually narrowing the scope of and expiring many of the current RoHS exemptions. In addition, it is likely that new substance restrictions will be introduced in the next several years."&lt;ref name="HP-RoHS2"/&gt;

Some exemptions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/10/pe00/pe00062.en10.pdf |title=Directive of the European Parliament and of the council on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (Recast) |publisher=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union |date=22 March 2011 |access-date=22 May 2013 |page=14 et. seq. |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224082534/http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/10/pe00/pe00062.en10.pdf |archive-date=2012-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labeling and documentation ==
[[Image:Conformité Européenne (logo).svg|thumb|right|50px|The CE logo]]
Products within scope of the RoHS 2 directive must display the [[CE mark]], the manufacturers name and address and a serial or batch number. Parties needing to know more detailed compliance information can find this on the EU Declaration of Conformity for the product as created by the manufacturer (Brand owner) responsible for the design or the EU representative. The regulation also requires most actors in the supply chain for the product (importer and distributors) to keep and check this document, as well as ensuring a conformance process has been followed and the correct language translation for instructions are provided. The manufacturer must keep certain documentation to demonstrate conformity, known as a technical file or technical records. The directive requires the manufacturer to demonstrate conformity by the use of test data for all materials or by following a harmonised standard (EN50581:2012 is the only standard at the time of writing). Regulators may request this file or, more likely, specific data from it as it will likely be very large&lt;ref&gt;2011/65/EU Article 16.2&lt;/ref&gt;.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== History ===
[[Image:RoHS-2.jpg|thumb|right|50px|A RoHS mark]]
RoHS did not require any specific product labelling, but many manufacturers have adopted their own compliance marks to reduce confusion. Visual indicators have included explicit "RoHS compliant" labels, green leaves, check marks, and "PB-Free" markings. Chinese RoHS labels, a lower case "e" within a circle with arrows, can also imply compliance.  

[[Image:WEEE 2.svg|thumb|right|50px|The WEEE directive logo]]
RoHS 2 attempts to address this issue by requiring the aforementioned CE mark whose use is policed by the Trading Standards enforcement agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2009/01/08/45225/rohs2-is-coming-will-it-work-better-than-rohs.htm |title=RoHS2 is coming – will it work better than RoHS? |work=Electronics Weekly |date=8 January 2009 |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208235745/http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2009/01/08/45225/rohs2-is-coming-will-it-work-better-than-rohs.htm |archive-date=2009-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that the ''only'' permitted indication of RoHS compliance is the CE mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/rohs_eee/pdf/faq.pdf |title=Official EU RoHS 2 FAQ |publisher=European Commission |page=24 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717074237/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/rohs_eee/pdf/faq.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The closely related WEEE ([[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]]), which became law simultaneously with RoHS, depicts a waste-can logo with an "X" through it and often accompanies the CE mark.

==Future possible additions==
New substance restrictions being considered for introduction in the next few years include phthalates, Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs), Chlorinated Flame Retardants (CFRs), and PVC.&lt;ref name="HP-RoHS2"/&gt;

Unlike EU RoHS, where products in specified categories are included unless specifically excluded, there will be a list of included products, known as the ''catalogue'' – see Article 18 of the regulation – which will be a subset of the total scope of Electronic Information Products, or EIPs, to which the regulations apply. Initially, products that fall under the covered scope must provide markings and disclosure as to the presence of certain substances, while the substances themselves are not (yet) prohibited. There are some products that are EIPs, which are not in scope for EU RoHS, ''e.g.'' radar systems, semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, photomasks, etc. The list of EIPs is available in Chinese and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinarohs.com |title=China ROHS Solutions by Design Chain Associates |publisher=Chinarohs.com |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marking and disclosure aspects of the regulation were intended to take effect on 1 July 2006, but were postponed twice to 1 March 2007. There is no timeline for the catalogue yet.
;Japan: Japan does not have any direct legislation dealing with the RoHS substances, but its recycling laws have spurred Japanese manufacturers to move to a lead-free process in accordance with RoHS guidelines. A [[Cabinet of Japan#Powers|ministerial ordinance]]  ''Japanese industrial standard for Marking of Specific Chemical Substances'' (J-MOSS), effective from 1 July 2006, directs that some electronic products exceeding a specified amount of the nominated toxic substances must carry a warning label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/recycle/main/english/law/promotion.html |title=METI Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry |publisher=Meti.go.jp |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730183122/http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/recycle/main/english/law/promotion.html |archive-date=2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
California has passed the [[California Electronic Waste Recycling Act|Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003]] (EWRA). This law prohibits the sale of electronic devices after 1 January 2007, that are prohibited from being sold under the EU RoHS directive, but across a much narrower scope that includes LCDs, CRTs, and the like and only covers the four heavy metals restricted by RoHS. EWRA also has a restricted material disclosure requirement.

Effective 1 January 2010, the California Lighting Efficiency and Toxics Reduction Act applies RoHS to general purpose lights, i.e. "lamps, bulbs, tubes, or other electric devices that provide functional illumination for indoor residential, indoor commercial, and outdoor use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hktdc.com/info/mi/a/psls/en/1X066HG5/1/Product-Safety-Laws-and-Standards/California-RoHS-Lighting-Requirements-to-Become-Effective-on-January-1--2010.htm |title=California RoHS Lighting Requirements to Become Effective on January 1, 2010 |publisher=HKTDC |date=27 August 2009 |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Compliance}} &lt;!--Previous section name --&gt;
In 2012 Sweden's Chemicals Agency (Kemi) and Electrical Safety Authority tested 63 consumer electronics products and found that 12 were out of compliance. Kemi claims that this is similar to testing results from prior years. "Eleven products contained prohibited levels of lead, and one of polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants. Details of seven companies have been passed to Swedish prosecutors. Kemi says that levels of non-compliance with RoHS are similar to previous years, and remain too high."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemicalwatch.com/14330/sweden-says-rohs-non-compliance-is-too-high |title=News Item &amp;#124; Sweden says RoHS non-compliance is too high |publisher=Chemicalwatch.com |date=3 April 2013 |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other standards ==
RoHS is not the only environmental standard of which electronic product developers should be aware. Manufacturers will find that it is cheaper to have only a single [[bill of materials]] for a product that is distributed worldwide, instead of customising the product to fit each country's specific environmental laws. Therefore, they develop their own standards, which allow only the strictest of all allowable substances.

For example, [[IBM]] forces each of their suppliers to complete a Product Content Declaration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/products/ecpquest.shtml |title=IBM and the Environment – Product Content Declaration for IBM Suppliers |publisher=Ibm.com |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704200951/http://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/products/ecpquest.shtml |archive-date=2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; form to document compliance to their environmental standard 'Baseline Environmental Requirements for Materials, Parts and Products for IBM Logo Hardware Products'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/products/especs.shtml |title=IBM Engineering Specification 46G3772: Baseline Environmental Requirements for Supplier Deliverables to IBM |publisher=Ibm.com |date=26 May 2015 |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704213955/http://www.ibm.com/ibm/environment/products/especs.shtml |archive-date=2015-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, IBM banned [[decabromodiphenyl ether|DecaBDE]], even though there was formerly a RoHS exemption for this material&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:271:0048:0050:EN:PDF |journal=Official Journal of the European Union |title=COMMISSION DECISION : 13 October 2005 : amending for the purposes of adapting to the technical progress the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment |access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (overturned by the European Court in 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709094120/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62006J0014:EN:HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, here is [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s environmental standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/environment/supplychain/gen_specifications.html |format=PDF |title=HP's General Specification for the environment (GSE) |publisher=Hp.com |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814145417/http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/environment/supplychain/gen_specifications.html |archive-date=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Adverse effects on product quality and reliability, plus high cost of compliance (especially to small business) are cited as criticisms of the directive, as well as early research indicating that the life cycle benefits of lead-free [[solder]] versus traditional solder materials are mixed.&lt;ref name="EPALifecycle"/&gt;

Criticism earlier on came from an industry resistant to change and a misunderstanding of solders and soldering processes. Deliberate misinformation was espoused to resist what was perceived as a "non-tariff barrier created by European bureaucrats." Many believe the industry is stronger now through this experience and has a better understanding of the science and technologies involved.&lt;ref name="Fact and fiction in lead-free soldering"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.solderrecovery.com/pdf/Lead%20Free%20Article%202.pdf |title=Fact and fiction in lead-free soldering |first1=Keith |last1=Sweatman |journal=Global SMT &amp; Packaging |date=April 2006 |pages=26–8 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107005500/http://www.solderrecovery.com/pdf/Lead%20Free%20Article%202.pdf |archive-date=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One criticism of RoHS is that the restriction of lead and cadmium does not address some of their most prolific applications, while being costly for the electronics industry to comply with. Specifically, the total lead used in electronics makes up only 2% of world lead consumption, while 90% of lead is used for batteries (covered by the battery directive, as mentioned above, which requires recycling and limits the use of mercury and cadmium, but does not restrict lead). Another criticism is that less than 4% of lead in landfills is due to electronic components or circuit boards, while approximately 36% is due to leaded glass in [[cathode ray tube]] monitors and televisions, which can contain up to 2&amp;nbsp;kg per screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epsma.org/pdf/Report%20on%20Lead%20free%20Electronics_June%2030%202003_summary%20article.pdf |publisher=European Power Supply Manufacturers Association |title=The Status of Lead-Free Electronics and its Impact on Power Electronics Summary |date=26 February 2003 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726033700/http://www.epsma.org/pdf/Report%20on%20Lead%20free%20Electronics_June%2030%202003_summary%20article.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more common lead-free solder systems have a higher melting point, e.g. a 30&amp;nbsp;°C typical difference for tin-silver-copper alloys, but wave soldering temperatures are approximately the same at ~255&amp;nbsp;°C;&lt;ref name="Fact and fiction in lead-free soldering"/&gt; however at this temperature most typical lead free solders have longer wetting times than [[eutectic]] Pb/Sn 37:63 solder.&lt;ref name="wet1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.solderconnection.co.uk/lead_free_tech_articles/C_A_Lead-Free.pdf |title=Temperature selection for wave soldering with Lead-Free alloys |journal=Circuits Assembly |date=May 2001 |first1=Al |last1=Schneider |first2=Sanju |last2=Arora |first3=Bin |last3=Mo |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=46–51 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311125906/http://www.solderconnection.co.uk/lead_free_tech_articles/C_A_Lead-Free.pdf |archive-date=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally wetting force is typically lower,&lt;ref name="wet1"/&gt; which can be disadvantageous (for hole filling), but advantageous in other situations (closely spaced components).

Care must be taken in selection of RoHS solders as some formulations are harder with less ductility, increasing the likelihood of [[Fracture|cracks]] instead of [[plastic deformation]], which is typical for lead-containing solders.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Cracks can occur due to thermal or mechanical forces acting on components or the circuit board, the former being more common during manufacturing and the latter in the field. RoHS solders exhibit advantages and disadvantages in these respects, dependent on packaging and formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.microrel.2006.09.034 |title=Thermal cycling reliability of SnAgCu and SnPb solder joints: A comparison for several IC-packages |year=2007 |last1=Vandevelde |first1=Bart |last2=Gonzalez |first2=Mario |last3=Limaye |first3=Paresh |last4=Ratchev |first4=Petar |last5=Beyne |first5=Eric |journal=Microelectronics Reliability |volume=47 |issue=2–3 |pages=259–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editor of Conformity Magazine wondered in 2005 if the transition to lead-free solder would affect long-term reliability of electronic devices and systems, especially in applications more mission-critical than in consumer products, citing possible breaches due to other environmental factors like oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.kentec.net/pdf/leadless/conformity.pdf |journal=Conformity Magazine |title=Removal of Lead Shakes Up the Manufacturing Chain |date=August 2005 |pages=28–35 |author=Premier Farnell plc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 Farnell/Newark InOne "''RoHS Legislation and Technical Manual''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newark.com/pdfs/RohsTechManual_v2.pdf |format=PDF |title=RoHS Legislation and technical Manual |publisher=Newark.com |year=2005 |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053749/http://www.newark.com/pdfs/RohsTechManual_v2.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; cites these and other "lead-free" solder issues, such as:

# Warping or delamination of printed circuit boards;
# Damage to through-holes, ICs and components on circuit boards; and,
# Added moisture sensitivity, all of which may compromise quality and reliability.

=== Effect on reliability ===
Potential reliability concerns were addressed in Annex item #7 of the RoHS directive, granting some specific exemptions from regulation until 2010. These issues were raised when the directive was first implemented in 2003 and reliability effects were less known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0095:EN:NOT |title=Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential problem that some lead-free, high tin-based solders may face is the growth of [[Whisker (metallurgy)|tin whiskers]]. These thin strands of tin can grow and make contact with an adjacent trace, developing a [[short circuit]]. Historically tin whiskers have been associated with a handful of failures, including a [[Millstone Nuclear Power Plant#Events|nuclear power plant shutdown]] and [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]] incident where pure tin plating was used. However, these failures pre-date RoHS. They also do not involve consumer electronics, and therefore may employ RoHS-restricted substances if desired. To help mitigate potential problems, lead-free manufacturers are using a variety of approaches such as tin-zinc formulations that produce non-conducting whiskers or formulations that reduce growth, although they do not halt growth completely in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=New Sn-Zn Solder Bonds at Under 200 Celsius |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/NEA/archive/200211/214612/ |date=November 2002 |first1=Taiki |last1=Itoh |first2=Yasuo |last2=Tanokura |journal=Nikkei Electronics Asia |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505085142/http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/NEA/archive/200211/214612/ |archive-date=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, experience thus far suggests deployed instances of RoHS compliant products are not failing due to whisker growth. Dr. Ronald Lasky of Dartmouth College reports: "RoHS has been in force for more than 15 months now, and ~$400B RoHS-compliant products have been produced. With all of these products in the field, no significant numbers of tin whisker-related failures have been reported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frome One Engineer to Another – RoHS|url=http://blogs.indium.com/blog/rohs |publisher=Blogs.indium.com |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110706144229/http://blogs.indium.com/blog/rohs |archive-date=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=March 2013}} Whisker growth occurs slowly over time, is unpredictable, and not fully understood, so time may be the only true test of these efforts. Whisker growth is even observable for lead-based solders, albeit on a much smaller scale.

Some countries have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure products from the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Digital Control Systems, Inc. meets the European Union's RoHS Directive |publisher=Digital Control Systems |url=http://www.dcs-inc.net/RoHS.htm |access-date=12 March 2013 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028173729/http://www.dcs-inc.net/RoHS.htm |archive-date=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this may be a moot point, since as electronic component manufacturers convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with [[Eutectic point|eutectic]] tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components' compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. [[Leadframe]]-based components, such as [[Quad Flat Package]]s (QFP), [[Small Outline Integrated Circuit]]s (SOIC), and [[Small outline package]]s (SOP) with [[gull wing lead]]s, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as [[Ball grid array]]s (BGA) which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/an/10791.pdf|title=Wayback Machine |date=6 September 2008 |website=''archive.org'' |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906110900/http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/an/10791.pdf |archive-date=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic effect ===
There are no ''[[de minimis]]'' exemptions, e.g., for micro-businesses. This economic effect was anticipated and at least some attempts at mitigating the effect were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://application.doeni.gov.uk/doe_foi/document.asp?doc=6353 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929202448/http://application.doeni.gov.uk/doe_foi/document.asp?doc=6353 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-29 |title=Part VII – RoHS RIA : July 2004 : PARTIAL REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF THE DRAFT STATUTORY INSTRUMENT TO IMPLEMENT THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE ON THE RESTRICTION OF THE USE OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT |access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of economic effect is the cost of product failures during the switch to RoHS compliance. For example, tin whiskers were responsible for a 5% failure rate in certain components of Swiss Swatch watches in 2006, prior to the July implementation of RoHS, reportedly triggering a US$1&amp;nbsp;billion recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/03/research.engineering |title=Within a whisker of failure |work=The Guardian |date=3 April 2008 |first1=Kurt |last1=Jacobsen |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022130830/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/03/research.engineering |archive-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://nepp.nasa.gov/whisker/reference/tech_papers/2008-Brusse-Japan-Metal%20Whiskers.pdf |title=Metal Whiskers: Failure Modes and Mitigation Strategies |first1=Jay |last1=Brusse |first2=Henning |last2=Leidecker |first3=Lyudmyla |last3=Panashchenko |date=24 April 2008 |publisher=NASA |conference=2nd International Symposium on Tin Whiskers |page=9 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218100014/http://nepp.nasa.gov/whisker/reference/tech_papers/2008-Brusse-Japan-Metal%20Whiskers.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swatch responded to this by applying for an exemption to RoHS compliance, but this was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/rohs_report.pdf |title=Adaptation to scientific and technical progress under Directive 2002/95/EC |date=28 July 2006 |page=83 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221123707/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/rohs_report.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orgalime.org/issues/RoHS_EU%20Overview%20Exemption_Jan07.pdf |title=Overview on Exemptions and Pending Requests at EU Level |publisher=Orgalime |date=23 January 2007 |page=8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727152837/http://www.orgalime.org/issues/RoHS_EU%20Overview%20Exemption_Jan07.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
===Health benefits===
RoHS helps reduce damage to people and the environment in third-world countries where much of today's "high-tech waste" ends up.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenemeier |first=Larry |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=laws-waste-epa-waste&amp;print=true |title=Laws Fail to Keep up with Mounting E-Trash – Scientific American |publisher=Sciam.com |date=29 November 2007 |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2007/12/20/technologys-morning-after.html |title=Technology's Morning After |publisher=US News |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625004234/http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2007/12/20/technologys-morning-after.html |archive-date=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of lead-free solders and components reduces risks to electronics industry workers in prototype and manufacturing operations. Contact with solder paste no longer represents the same health hazard as it used to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11837-007-0082-8 |title=Public health and environmental benefits of adopting lead-free solders |year=2007 |last1=Ogunseitan |first1=Oladele A. |journal=JOM |volume=59 |issue=7 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability concerns unfounded===
Contrary to the predictions of widespread component failure and reduced reliability, RoHS's first anniversary (July 2007) passed with little fanfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lasky |first=Ron |url=http://www.ventureoutsource.com/contract-manufacturing/benchmarks-best-practices/rohs-environment/rohs-one-year-later-the-good-news-is-the-bad-news-was-wrong |title=RoHS one year later: The good news is…the bad news was wrong; Contract Electronics Services Directory Listings |publisher=Ventureoutsource.com |access-date=12 January 2018 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020233/https://www.ventureoutsource.com/contract-manufacturing/benchmarks-best-practices/rohs-environment/rohs-one-year-later-the-good-news-is-the-bad-news-was-wrong |archive-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most contemporary consumer electronics are RoHS compliant. As of 2013, millions of compliant products are in use worldwide.

Many electronics companies keep "RoHS status" pages on their corporate websites. For example, the AMD website states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although lead containing solder cannot be completely eliminated from all applications today, AMD engineers have developed effective technical solutions to reduce lead content in microprocessors and chipsets to ensure RoHS compliance while minimizing costs and maintaining product features. There is no change to fit, functional, electrical or performance specifications. Quality and reliability standards for RoHS compliant products are expected to be identical compared to current packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amd.com/us-en/0,,3715_13530_4040,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611053209/http://www.amd.com/us-en/0%2C%2C3715_13530_4040%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-06-11 |title=RoHS Compliance |access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

RoHS printed circuit board finishing technologies are surpassing traditional formulations in fabrication thermal shock, solder paste printability, contact resistance, and aluminium wire bonding performance and nearing their performance in other attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstone.com/pcb-capabilities/lead-free-rohs/material-comparison.aspx |title=Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive in PCBs &amp;#124; RoHS – Sunstone Circuits |publisher=Sunstone.com |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830090559/http://www.sunstone.com/pcb-capabilities/lead-free-rohs/material-comparison.aspx |archive-date=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The properties of lead-free solder, such as its high temperature resilience, has been used to prevent failures under harsh field conditions. These conditions include [[operating temperature]]s with test cycles in the range of −40&amp;nbsp;°C to +150&amp;nbsp;°C with severe vibration and shock requirements. Automobile manufacturers are turning to RoHS solutions now as electronics move into the engine bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/rohs_report.pdf |title=Adaptation to scientific and technical progress under Directive 2002/95/EC |date=28 July 2006 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221123707/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/rohs_report.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-21}}{{Page needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow properties and assembly===
One of the major differences between lead-containing and lead-free solder pastes is the "flow" of the solder in its liquid state. Lead-containing solder has a lower surface tension, and tends to move slightly to attach itself to exposed metal surfaces that touch any part of the liquid solder. Lead-free solder conversely tends to stay in place where it is in its liquid state, and attaches itself to exposed metal surfaces only where the liquid solder touches it.

This lack of "flow" – while typically seen as a disadvantage because it can lead to lower quality electrical connections – can be used to place components more tightly than they used to be placed due to the properties of lead-containing solders.

For example, Motorola reports that their new RoHS wireless device assembly techniques are "...enabling a smaller, thinner, lighter unit." Their Motorola Q phone would not have been possible without the new solder. The lead-free solder allows for tighter pad spacing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indium.com/blog/an-interview-with-the-professor/motorola-q-not-possible-without-lead-free-assembly |title=Motorola Q: Not Possible without Lead-free Assembly &amp;#124; Indium Corporation Blogs |publisher=Blogs.indium.com |date=24 August 2006 |access-date=3 July 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150705034044/http://blogs.indium.com/blog/an-interview-with-the-professor/motorola-q-not-possible-without-lead-free-assembly |archive-date=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some exempt products achieve compliance===
Research into new alloys and technologies is allowing companies to release RoHS products that are currently exempt from compliance, ''e.g.'' computer servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/environment/en/rohs?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192430/http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/environment/en/rohs?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-02-13 |title=Dell RoHS |date=13 February 2008 |access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM has announced a RoHS solution for high lead solder joints once thought to remain a permanent exemption. The lead-free packaging technology "...offers economical advantages in relation to traditional bumping processes, such as solder waste reduction, use of bulk alloys, quicker time-to-market for products and a much lower chemical usage rate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edn.com/article/CA6461863.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012180401/http://www.edn.com/article/CA6461863.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-10-12 |title=IBM launches production of lead-free packaging technology |access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indium.com/drlasky/entry.php?id=618|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424032736/http://www.indium.com/drlasky/entry.php?id=618 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-24 |title=IBM Announces Shipment of Lead-Free C4 Joints – Dr. Lasky's Blog |date=23 July 2007 |access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test and measurement vendors, such as [[National Instruments]], have also started to produce RoHS-compliant products, despite devices in this category being exempt from the RoHS directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tmworld.com/article/CA6346229.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304025318/http://www.tmworld.com/article/CA6346229.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-03-04 |title=NI premiers RoHS-compliant products |access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roslin Institute''' is an [[animal sciences]] research institute at Easter Bush, [[Midlothian]], [[Scotland]], part of the [[University of Edinburgh]], and is funded by the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk/ |title=The Roslin Institute (University of Edinburgh) - Home Page |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2017, Professor Eleanor Riley became the Director of the Roslin Institute and Dean of Research at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies of the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eid.ed.ac.uk/news/eleanor-riley-be-new-director-roslin-institute|title=Eleanor Riley to be new Director of the Roslin Institute {{!}} Edinburgh Infectious Diseases|website=www.eid.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; to replace [[Professor]] [[David Hume (scientist)|David Hume]]. 

==History==

The Roslin Institute was established in 1993 as an entirely owned but then as an independent institute of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. However, its former are closely associated to animal genetics research unit at the University of Edinburgh in 1919.

==Honors==

The Institute won international fame in 1996, when [[Ian Wilmut]], [[Keith Campbell (biologist)|Keith Campbell]] and their colleagues created [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]], the first [[mammal]] to be [[cloning|cloned]] from an adult cell, at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = K.

Roslin has made many other contributions to animal sciences, especially in the area of livestock improvement and welfare through applications of Quantitative Genetics.  In 2007 a Roslin team developed genetically modified chickens capable of laying eggs containing proteins needed to make cancer-fighting drugs.

==Aims and objectives==

The Roslin Institute aims to enhance the lives of animals and humans through world class research in animal biology.  The principal objectives are to:

* Enhance animal health and welfare through knowledge of genetic factors affecting resistance to disease.
* Enhance sustainability and productivity of livestock systems and food supply chains through understanding of reproductive and developmental biology.
* Enhance food safety by understanding interactions between disease causing organisms and animals.
* Enhance human health through an understanding of basic mechanisms of health and disease and comparative biology of animal species.
* Identify new and emerging zoonoses and understand how pathogens might cross from animals to humans.
* Enhance quality of life for animals by studying the mechanisms and behaviours associated with optimising their environment and life experiences.

==Research==

The Roslin Institute are categorized by four Scientific Divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/research|title=Research at Roslin Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Developmental biology
* Genetics and genomics
* Infection and immunity
* Clinical sciences

==New building==

In April 2007, The Roslin Institute was joined by the Neuropathogenesis Unit of the [[Institute for Animal Health]], well known for its role in deciphering the biology of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (mad cow disease, scrapie, CJD). In 2008, the Institute was incorporated with the [[Royal School of Veterinary Studies]] within the College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine of The University of Edinburgh. There are currently more than 500 staff and students.

In March 2011, The Roslin Institute moved from its previous home in [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]], a village in [[Midlothian]], to a £60.6M building on the [[University of Edinburgh]]'s Veterinary Campus at Easter Bush, across the road from the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies' new teaching building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| pages = 34–34 
| year = 2011 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building was designed by global architecture firm, [[HDR, Inc.]]

The Roslin Institute and Vet School are part of a formal consortium, the Easter Bush Research Consortium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebrc.ac.uk/ ebrc.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Moredun Research Institute]] and the [[Scottish Agricultural College]].

'''Sexualization''' (or '''sexualisation''') is to make something [[Human sexuality|sexual]] in character or quality, or to become aware of sexuality,&lt;ref name="Sexualization"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualization (definition) | publisher= ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''| accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sexualization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexualize"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Sexualize | publisher = ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' | accessdate = 30 September 2013 | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/sexualize}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in relation to men and women. Sexualization is linked to [[sexual objectification]]. According to the [[American Psychological Association]], sexualization occurs when "individuals are regarded as sex objects and evaluated in terms of their physical characteristics and sexiness."&lt;ref name=Dewar&gt;{{cite web | last = Dewar | first = Gwen | title = The sexualization of girls: Is the popular culture harming our kids? | url = http://www.parentingscience.com/sexualization-of-girls.html | website = parentingscience.com | publisher = Parenting Science | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "In study after study, findings have indicated that women more often than men are portrayed in a sexual manner (e.g., dressed in revealing clothing, with bodily postures or facial expressions that imply sexual readiness) and are objectified (e.g., used as a decorative object, or as body parts rather than a whole person).

Reports have found that sexualization of younger children is becoming increasingly more common in advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Donohue | first1 = William | last2 = Gold | first2 = Steven R. | last3 = McKay | first3 = J.

Medical and social science researchers generally deployed "sexualization" to refer to a liminal zone between sexual abuse and normal family life, in which the child's relationship with their parents was characterized by an "excessive", improper sexuality, though without recognizable forms of abuse having occurred.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite book | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 | oclc = 123130352 }} [http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; American Psychological Association also argues that the sexualization of young girls contributes to sexist attitudes within society, and a societal tolerance of sexual violence.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, "sexualization" began to ascend to the status of an issue in the public eye. The cause of this rise was that it became positioned by a number of discursive actors as a feminist issue. This is not to say that a single "feminist perspective on sexualization" emerged in this period; among discursive actors mobilizing feminist discourses, or identifying themselves explicitly with feminism, there were a host of different views. Yet a particular, relatively cohesive position emerged after 2003 among a number of media discourses: these discourses tended to emphasize that, in the context of a commercialized and sexist culture, young women are unable to exercise meaningful choice even when they experience themselves as doing so. These media actors, in their problematization of sexualization, positioned themselves as the true heirs to the feminist tradition and its critical insights, in contrast to contemporary youth.

[[Consumerism]] and [[globalization]] has led to sexualization of girls occurring across all [[advanced economies]], in media and advertisements, to clothing and toys marketed for young girls.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "sexualization" itself only emerged in Anglophone discourse in recent decades. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the term was infrequently drawn upon by English writers to refer the assignation of a gendered frame to a particular object, such as the gendering of nouns (e.g., de Quincey [1839]1909, 195).&lt;ref name="de Quincey"&gt;{{citation | author-last = de Quincey | author-first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas De Quincey | contribution = Style and language | editor-last1 = de Quincey | editor-first1 = Thomas | editor-last2 = Darbishire | editor-first2 = Helen | editor-link1 = Thomas De Quincey | editor-link2 = Helen Darbishire | title = De Quincey's literary criticism | pages = 181&amp;ndash;196 | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Digital Library | location = New York, NY | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781411457836 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term "asexualization" saw greater use, as a synonym for sterilization in eugenics discourse from around the turn of the twentieth century (e.g., Lydston 1904).&lt;ref name="Lydston"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lydston | first = G.

== Effects on children ==

In 2006, an Australian report called ''Corporate paedophilia: sexualisation of children in Australia''&lt;ref name=Australia /&gt; was published. The Australian report summarises its conclusion as follows:

:Images of sexualised children are becoming increasingly common in advertising and marketing material. Children who appear aged 12 years and under are dressed, posed and made up in the same way as sexy adult models. Children that appear on magazines are seen older than they really are because of the sexualised clothes they are given to pose in.  "Corporate paedophilia" is a metaphor used to describe advertising and marketing that sexualises children in these ways.

In 2007, the [[American Psychological Association]] published a report titled ''Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls'', discussed below.

In 2010, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an additional report titled " Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls", which performed a study where college students were asked to try on and evaluate either a swimsuit or a sweater. While they waited for 10 minutes wearing the garment, they completed a math test. The results revealed that young women in swimsuits performed significantly worse on the math problems than did those wearing sweaters.The hypothesis is that individuals about to try on the sweaters had less pressure to look beautiful because they were not wearing revealing clothing therefore they performed better.

In 2012, an American study found that self-sexualization was common among 6–9-year old girls. Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non-sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular. However other factors, such as how often mothers talked to their children about what is going on in TV shows and maternal religiosity, reduced those odds. Surprisingly, the mere quantity of girls' [[media consumption]] (TV and movies) was unrelated to their self-sexualization for the most part; rather, maternal self-objectification and maternal religiosity moderated its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Starr | first1 = Christine | last2 = Ferguson | first2 = Gail | title = Sexy dolls, sexy grade-schoolers?

However, in 2010 the [[Scottish Executive]] released a report titled ''External research on sexualised goods aimed at children''.&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; The report considers the drawbacks of the United States and Australian reviews, concluding:

{{Quote|[T]here is no indication [in the APA report] that the media might contain any positive images about human relationships, or that children might critically evaluate what they see.}}

The Scottish review also notes that:

{{Quote|[s]uch accounts often present the sexualisation of children as a relatively recent development, but it is by no means a new issue …  While the public visibility of the issue, and the terms in which it is defined, may have changed, sexualised representations of children cannot be seen merely as a consequence of contemporary consumerism.}}

It also notes that previous coverage "rests on moral assumptions … that are not adequately explained or justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mayo | first1 = Ed | last2 = Nairn | first2 = Agnes | author-link1 = Ed Mayo | title = Consumer kids: how big business is grooming our children for profit | publisher = Constable | location = London | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781845298807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letting Children be Children: Report of an Independent Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood (UK)'''
The report 'Letting Children Be Children',&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; also known as the Bailey Report, is a report commissioned by the UK government on the subject of the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood. The report was published in June 2011 and was commissioned as a result of concerns raised as to whether children's lives are negatively affected by the effects of commercialisation and sexualisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=NSPCC | author-link1 =NSPCC |title= Premature sexualisation: understanding the risks: outcomes of the NSPCC's expert seminar series |date= 2011 | publisher= NSPCC | location= London }} [https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/information-service/seminars-premature-sexualisation-understanding-risks.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailey Report is so-called as it was researched and compiled by Reg Bailey, the Chief Executive of the Mothers' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.mothersunion.org/ | website = mothersunion.org | publisher = Mothers' Union | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "charity supporting parents and children in 83 countries in the world".&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt; The report asked for contributions from parents; children; organisations; businesses and the general public in order to consider their views and inform their recommendations and identified four themes that were of particular concern to parents and the wider public. These themes were:
*1) the "wallpaper" of children's lives
*2) clothing, products and services for children
*3) children as consumers
*4) making parents' voices heard

The report returned recommendations based on the research from interested parties, on each of the key themes, in the form of "what we would like to see". On the theme of "the wallpaper of children's lives" it said that it would like to see that sexualised images used in public places should be more in line with what parents find acceptable, to ensure that images in public spaces becomes more child friendly. On theme two "clothing, products and services for children" the Bailey report said that it would like to see retailers no longer selling or marketing inappropriate clothing, products or services for children. What they would like to see on theme three "children as consumers" is comprehensive regulation protecting children from excessive commercial pressures across all media in-line with parental expectations; that marketers are ethical and do not attempt to exploit gaps in the market to influence children into becoming consumers and to ensure that parents and children have an awareness of marketing techniques and regulations. Finally in terms of "making parents voices heard" it would like to see parents finding it easier to voice their concerns to, and be listened to by, businesses and regulators.&lt;ref name=BaileyR /&gt;

There is a motion for a [[European Parliament]] resolution going through which gives the following definition of sexualization: {{Quotation|[S]exualization consists of an instrumental approach to a person by perceiving that person as an object for sexual use disregarding the person's dignity and personality traits, with the person's worth being measured in terms of the level of sexual attractiveness; sexualization also involves the imposition of the sexuality of adult persons on girls, who are emotionally, psychologically and physically unprepared for this at their particular stage of development; sexualization&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As opposed to its meaning in relation to [[human sexuality]].&lt;/ref&gt;  not being the normal, healthy, biological development of the sexuality of a person, conditioned by the individual process of development and taking place at the appropriate time for each particular individual.&lt;ref name=draft&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skrzydlewska|first=Joanna|authorlink=Joanna Skrzydlewska|title=Draft report on the sexualization of girls (2012/2047 (INI)) | journal = European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.

== Effects on women of color ==
The sexualization of women of color is different than the sexualization of white women.  The media plays a significant role in this sexualization.

=== Black women ===
In an NPR interview with Professor Herbert Samuels at LaGuardia Community College in New York and Mireille Miller-Young a professor at UC Santa Barbara they talk about sexual stereotypes of black bodies in America and how even in sex work, already a dangerous job, black women are treated much worse than their counterparts due to the effects of their oversexualization and objectification in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Farai Chideya]] (host/producer), Herbert Samuels (guest) and Mireille Miller-Young (guest) |date= 7 May 2007 |title= Sex stereotypes of African Americans have long history |medium= Radio program |series= [[NPR|NPR news]] |language= English |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 |access-date= 9 December 2015 |publisher= [[NPR]] }} [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10057104 Transcript.]&lt;/ref&gt; Black women's bodies are either invisible or hypervisible. In the 1800s, a South African woman named [[Sarah Baartman]] was known as "Hottentot Venus" and her body was paraded around in London and Paris where they looked at her exotic features such as large breasts and behind. Her features were deemed lesser and oversexual. There is also the ''Jezebel'' stereotype that portrays black women as "hypersexual, manipulative, animalistic and promiscuous females who cannot be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mowatt | first1 = Rasul A. | title = Black/female/body hypervisibility and invisibility: a Black feminist augmentation of feminist leisure research | journal = Journal of Leisure Research, Special Issue: Feminist Leisure Research in the Contemporary Era | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 644–660 | doi = 10.18666/JLR-2013-V45-I5-4367 | date = 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican Women ===
In the Dominican Republic, women are frequently stereotyped as sultry and sexual as the reputation of Dominican sex workers grows.&lt;ref name="Race_class"&gt;Brennan, Denise (2004), "[https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/brennan_selling-sex-for-visas.pdf Selling sex for visas: sex tourism as a stepping-stone to international migration]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Andersen | editor-first1 = Margaret L. | editor-last2 = Hill Collins | editor-first2 = Pauline | editor-link2 = Patricia Hill Collins | title = Race, class, and gender: an anthology | pages = 243&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = Wadsworth/Thomson Learning | location = Belmont, California | edition = 9th | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780534609030 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many poor women have resorted to sex work because the demand is high and the hours and pay are often dictated by the workers themselves.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; White European and American men "exoticize dark-skinned 'native' bodies" because "they can buy sex for cut-rate prices".&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; This overgeneralizing of the sexuality of Dominican women can also carries back to the women's homes.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; Even "women who...worked in Europe have become suspect..." even if they had a legal job.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt; They have become "exports" instead of people because of their sexualization.&lt;ref name="Race_class" /&gt;

=== Asian women ===
The image of Asian women in Hollywood cinema is directly linked to sexuality as essential to any imagining about the roles they play as well as her actual appearance in popular culture. Asian female fatale's hypersexualized subjection is derived from her sexual behaviour that is considered as natural to her particular race and culture. Two types of Asian stereotypes that are commonly found in media are the Lotus Flower and the Dragon Lady. The Lotus Flower archetype is the "self-sacrificing, servile, and suicidal Asian women." The dragon lady archetype is the opposite of the lotus flower, a "self-abnegating Asian woman…[who] uses her 'Oriental' femininity, associated with seduction and danger to trap white men on behalf of conniving Asian males." According to film-maker and film scholar, Celine Shimizu, "The figure of the Asian American femme fatale signifies a particular deathly seduction. She attracts with her soft, unthreatening, and servile femininity while concealing her hard, dangerous, and domineering nature."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Native American women ===
Starting from the time of white colonization of Native American land, some Native American women have been referred to as "squaw," an Algonquin word for vagina. "The 'squaw' [stereotype] is the dirty, subservient, and abused tribal female who is also haggard, violent, and eager to torture tribal captives."  Another stereotype is the beautiful Indian princess who leaves her tribe and culture behind to marry a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mihesuah | first = Devon Abbott | contribution = Finding a modern American indigenous female identity | editor-last = Mihesuah | editor-first = Devon Abbott | title = Indigenous American women: decolonization, empowerment, activism | page = 102 | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] | location = Lincoln, Nebraska and London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780803282865 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the hot Latina stereotype lies three categories of representation: the Cantina Girl, the Faithful, self-sacrificing señorita, and the vamp. The Cantina Girl markers are "'great sexual allure,' teasing, dancing, and 'behaving in an alluring fashion.'" The faithful, self-sacrificing Señorita starts out as a good girl and turns bad by the end. The Señorita, in an attempt to save her Anglo love interest, utilizes her body to protect him from violence.

== American Psychological Association view ==

=== Definition ===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in its 2007 Report looked at the cognitive and emotional consequences of sexualization and the consequences for mental and physical health, and impact on development of a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt; The report considers that a person is sexualized in the following situations:
*a person's value comes only from his or her [[Sexual attraction|sexual appeal]] or [[Human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], to the exclusion of other characteristics;
*a person is held to a standard that equates [[physical attractiveness]] (narrowly defined) with being sexy;
*a person is [[sexual objectification|sexually objectified]]—that is, made into a thing for others' sexual use, rather than seen as a person with the capacity for independent action and decision making; and/or
*sexuality is inappropriately imposed upon a person.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

=== Children ===
Some [[cultural critic]]s have postulated that over recent decades children have evidenced a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behaviour inappropriate for their age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaeser | first = Fred | title = Towards a better understanding of children's sexual behavior | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/74965/towardsabetterunderstandingofchildrenssexualbehavior.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = NYU Child Study Center | date = 30 October 2001 | quote = We know that exposure to sexualized messages, particularly those that are incomprehensible, can have several effects on children. }} ''Fred Kaeser Ed.D. is the Director of Health Services for Community School District Two, NYC.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chambers | first = Suzanna | title = Outrage as Argos sells G-strings for children | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=109621&amp;in_page_id=1770) | work = [[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]] | publisher = [[DMG Media]] | date = 14 April 2002 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = High Street chain Argos has been branded irresponsible for promoting a range of sexually provocative lingerie designed for primary schoolgirls. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of parental oversight and [[discipline]]; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school [[sex education]] programs.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamb_Therapy&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Sharon | author-link1 = Sharon Lamb | title = Sex, therapy, and kids: addressing their concerns through talk and play | publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Co | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780393704792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For girls and young women in particular, the APA reports that studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their "[[self-image]] and healthy development".&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

The APA cites the following as advertising techniques that contribute to the sexualization of girls:&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;
*Including girls in ads with sexualized women wearing matching clothing or posed seductively.
*Dressing girls up to look like adult women.
*Dressing women down to look like young girls.
*The employment of youthful celebrity adolescents in highly sexual ways to promote or endorse products.
The APA additionally further references the teen magazine market by citing a study by [[Donald F. Roberts|Roberts]] ''et al'' that found that "47% of 8- to 18-year-old [girls] reported having read at least 5 minutes of a magazine the previous day."&lt;ref name="APA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1= Roberts |first1= Donald F. |last2= Foehr |first2= Ulla G. |last3= Rideout |first3= Victoria | author-link1 = Donald F.

==== Cognitive and emotional consequences ====
Studies have found that thinking about the body and comparing it to sexualized cultural ideals may disrupt a girl's mental concentration, and a girl's sexualization or objectification may undermine her confidence in and comfort with her own body, leading to emotional and self-image problems, such as shame and anxiety.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research has linked sexualization with three of the most common mental health problems diagnosed in girls and women: eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

Research suggests that the sexualization of girls has negative consequences on girls' ability to develop a healthy sexual self-image.&lt;ref name=APA /&gt;

A result of the sexualization of girls in the media is that young girls are "learning how to view themselves as sex objects".&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; When girls fail to meet the [[thin ideal]] and dominant culture's standard of beauty they can develop anxieties.&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt; Sexualization is problematic for young children who are developing their sexual identity as they may think that turning themselves into sex objects is empowering and related to having sexual agency.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

== Products for children ==

Some commercial products seen as promoting the sexualization of children have drawn considerable media attention:
* ''[[Bratz]] Baby'' Dolls marketed at 6-year-old girls that feature sexualized clothing, like fishnet stockings, feather boas, and miniskirts&lt;ref name=Dewar /&gt;   
* Highly sexualized and gendered Halloween costumes marketed at young girls, such as the "sexy firefighter", a costume that consists of a tight fitted mini dress and high heeled boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Delisle | first = Riana | title = Halloween costumes are sexualizing our youngest trick-or-treaters | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/raina-delisle/halloween-costumes-sexy-inappropriate_b_6006922.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | publisher = [[AOL]] | location = Canada | date = 18 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Girls aged 10 and 11 wearing thongs in primary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Pupils warned not to wear thongs | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2943874.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = [[BBC]] | location = UK | date = 28 May 2003 | accessdate = 22 February 2007 | quote = Parents have been urged by a head teacher to stop their daughters wearing thongs to a primary school. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Clothing such T-shirts being marketed for young children in preschool and elementary school with printed slogans like "So Many Boys So Little Time"&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; 
* Padded bras on bikinis aimed at seven-year-old girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barr | first = Robert (in London) | title = Outrage at girls' padded bikinis | url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/outrage-at-girls-padded-bikinis-20100415-shjf.html | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people regard [[training bra]]s similarly. However, there is also evidence that with the mean age of puberty declining in Western cultures, functional brassieres are required by a higher percentage of preteen girls than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aksglaede | first1 = Lise | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Kaspar | last3 = Petersen | first3 = Jørgen H. | last4 = Skakkebæk | first4 = Niels E. | last5 = Juul | first5 = Anders | title = Recent decline in age at breast development: the Copenhagen Puberty Study | journal = [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume = 123 | issue = 5 | pages = e932–e939 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2008-2491 | pmid = 19403485 | date = May 2009| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Executive]] report&lt;ref name=Scot /&gt; surveyed 32 High street UK retailers and found that many of the larger chains, including [[Tesco]], Debenhams, JJ Sports, and [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] did not offer sexualized goods aimed at children. The report noted that overall prevalence was limited but this was based on a very narrow research brief. Whilst this shows that not all High street retailers were aiming products deemed sexualized by the researchers, the research cannot be taken out of context and used to say that there is not an issue of sexualization.{{original research inline|date=September 2015}}

== Culture and media ==
{{For2|more on the mainstreaming of sex in media and culture|[[pornographication]]}}
Sexualization has also been a subject of debate for academics who work in media and [[cultural studies]]. Here, the term has not been used to simply to label what is seen as a social problem, but to indicate the much broader and varied set of ways in which sex has become more visible in media and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Attenborough | first1 = Frederick T. | author-link1 = Frederick T.

the growth of sexual media of all kinds; for example, erotica, slash fiction, sexual self-help books and the many genres of pornography; 
the emergence of new forms of sexual experience, for example instant message or avatar sex made possible by developments in technology; 
a public concern with the breakdown of consensus about regulations for defining and dealing with obscenity; 
the prevalence of scandals, controversies and panics around sex in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Attwood | first = Feona | title = Sexed up: theorizing the sexualization of culture | journal = [[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 77–94 | doi = 10.1177/1363460706053336 | date = February 2006 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.452.7825 }} [http://shura.shu.ac.uk/50/1/fulltext.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Attwood | first = Feona | title = Mainstreaming sex the sexualization of Western culture | publisher = I.B.

The terms "[[pornographication|pornification]]" and "[[pornographication]]" have also been used to describe the way that aesthetics that were previously associated with pornography have become part of popular culture, and that mainstream media texts and other cultural practices "citing pornographic styles, gestures and aesthetics" have become more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paasonen | first1 = Susanna | last2 = Nikunen | first2 = Kaarina |last3 = Saarenmaa | first3 = Laura | authorlink1 = Susanna Paasonen | title = Pornification: sex and sexuality in media culture | publisher = Berg | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781845207045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which Brian McNair has described as a "pornographication of the mainstream".&lt;ref name=McNair&gt;{{cite book | last = McNair | first = Brian | title = Striptease culture sex, media and the democratization of desire | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415237345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has developed alongside an expansion of the cultural realm of pornography or "pornosphere" which itself has become more accessible to a much wider variety of audiences. According to McNair, both developments can be set in the context of a wider shift towards a "striptease culture" which has disrupted the boundaries between public and private discourse in late modern Western culture, and which is evident more generally in cultural trends which privilege lifestyle, reality, interactivity, self-revelation and public intimacy.&lt;ref name=McNair /&gt;

Children and adolescents spend more time engaging with media than any other age group. This is a time in their life that they are more susceptible to information that they receive. Children are getting sex education from the media, little kids are exposed to sexualized images and more information than ever before in human history but are not able to process the information, they are not developmentally ready to process it, and this impacts their development and behavior.&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

Sexualization of young girls in the media and infantilization of women creates an environment where it becomes more acceptable to view children as "seductive and sexy".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt; It makes having healthy sexual relationships more difficult for people and creates sexist attitudes. Sexualization also contributes to sexual violence and childhood sexual abuse "where 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused during childhood".&lt;ref name=Kilbourne /&gt;

The Australian writers, [[Catharine Lumby]] and Kath Albury (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lumby | first1 = Catharine | last2 = Albury | first2 = Kath | title = Introduction: children, young people, sexuality and the media | journal = Media International Australia | volume = 135 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–60 | doi = 10.1177/1329878X1013500108 | date = May 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that sexualization is "a debate that has been simmering for almost a decade" and concerns about sex and the media are far from new.

The sexualization of women being influenced by society is a problem that should be avoided due to its impact on how women value and present themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52398">'''Situated cognition''' is a theory that posits that knowing is inseparable from doing&lt;ref&gt;[[John Seely Brown]], Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Greeno, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; by arguing that all knowledge is situated in activity bound to social, cultural and physical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Greeno &amp; Moore, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this assumption, which requires an [[epistemological]] shift from empiricism, situativity theorists suggest a model of knowledge and learning that requires thinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of conceptual knowledge. In essence, cognition cannot be separated from the context. Instead knowing exists, ''in situ'', inseparable from context, activity, people, culture, and language. Therefore, learning is seen in terms of an individual's increasingly effective performance across situations rather than in terms of an accumulation of knowledge, since what is known is co-determined by the agent and the context. This perspective rejects [[mind–body dualism]], being conceptually similar to [[functional contextualism]], and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[behavior analysis]].

==History==
While situated cognition gained recognition in the field of [[educational psychology]] in the late twentieth century,&lt;ref name="Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989"&gt;Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; it shares many principles with older fields such as [[critical theory]], (Frankfurt School, 1930; Freire, 1968) [[anthropology]] ([[Jean Lave]] &amp; Wenger, 1991), philosophy ([[Martin Heidegger]], 1968), [[critical discourse analysis]] (Fairclough, 1989), and [[sociolinguistics]] theories ([[Bakhtin]], 1981) that rejected the notion of truly objective knowledge and the principles of Kantian [[empiricism]].

Lucy Suchman's work on situated action at Xerox Labs&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plans and situated actions: The problem of human-machine communication|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780521337397|location=Cambridge MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in popularizing the idea that an actor's understanding of how to perform work results from reflecting on interactions with the social and material (e.g. technology-mediated) situation in which she or he acts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|date=January 1993|title=Response to Vera and Simon's Situated Action: A Symbolic Interpretation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.1993.17.issue-1/issuetoc|journal=COGNITIVE SCIENCE|volume=17|pages=71–75|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent perspectives of situated cognition have focused on and draw from the concept of identity formation &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; as people negotiate meaning through interactions within communities of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Duguid, 2000; Clancey, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Situated cognition perspectives have been adopted in education,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; instructional design,&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; online communities and artificial intelligence (see Brooks, Clancey). Grounded Cognition, concerned with the role of simulations and embodiment in cognition, encompasses Cognitive Linguistics, Situated Action, Simulation and Social Simulation theories. Research has contributed to the understanding of embodied language, memory, and the representation of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Barsalou, L. Grounded Cognition (2008) Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2008. 59:617–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated cognition draws a variety of perspectives, from an anthropological study of human behavior in the context of technology-mediated work,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or within [[communities of practice]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  to the [[ecological psychology]] of the perception-action cycle&lt;ref&gt;[[James J. Gibson]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and intentional dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Kadar, Sim &amp; Reppenger, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and even research on robotics with work on [[autonomous agent]]s at NASA and elsewhere (e.g., work by W. J. Clancey). Early attempts to define situated cognition focused on contrasting the emerging theory with information processing theories dominant in cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Bredo, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently theorists have recognized a natural affinity between situated cognition, New Literacy Studies and [[new literacies]] research (Gee, 2010). This connection is made by understanding that situated cognition maintains that individuals learn through experiences. It could be stated that these experiences, and more importantly the mediators that affect attention during these experiences is affected by the tools, technologies and languages used by a socio-cultural group and the meanings given to these by the collective group. New literacies research examines the context and contingencies that language and tool use by individuals and how this changes as the Internet and other communication technologies affect literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Leu et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key principles==
===Affordances/effectivities===
[[James J. Gibson]] introduced the idea of [[affordance]]s as part of a relational account of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Perception should not be considered solely as the encoding of environmental features into the perceiver's mind, but as an element of an individual's interaction with her environment (Gibson, 1977). Central to his proposal of an ecological psychology was the notion of affordances. Gibson proposed that in any interaction between an agent and the environment, inherent conditions or qualities of the environment allow the agent to perform certain actions with the environment.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"&gt;Greeno, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the term as properties in the environment that presented possibilities for action and were available for an agent to perceive directly and act upon.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1979/1986"&gt;Gibson 1979/1986&lt;/ref&gt;
Gibson focused on the affordances of physical objects, such as doorknobs and chairs, and suggested that these affordances were directly perceived by an individual instead of mediated by mental representations such as mental models. It is important to note that Gibson's notion of direct perception as an unmediated process of noticing, perceiving, and encoding specific attributes from the environment, has long been challenged by proponents of a more category-based model of perception.

This focus on agent-situation interactions in ecological psychology was consistent with the situated cognition program of researchers such as James G. Greeno (1994, 1998), who appreciated Gibson's apparent rejection of the factoring assumptions underlying experimental psychology. The situated cognition perspective focused on "perception-action instead of memory and retrieval…A perceiving/acting agent is coupled with a developing/adapting environment and what matters is how the two interact".&lt;ref&gt;Young, Kulikowich, &amp; Barab, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;139&lt;/ref&gt; Greeno (1994) also suggested that affordances are "preconditions for activity," and that while they do not determine behavior, they increase the likelihood that a certain action or behavior will occur.

Shaw, Turvey, &amp; Mace (as cited by Greeno, 1994) later introduced the term effectivities, the abilities of the agent that determined what the agent could do, and consequently, the interaction that could take place. Perception and action were co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which acted 'in the moment' together.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 1979/1986; Greeno, 1994; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the agent directly perceived and interacted with the environment, determining what affordances could be picked up, based on his effectivities. This view is consistent with Norman's (1988) theory of "perceived affordances," which emphasizes the agent's perception of an object's utility as opposed to focusing on the object itself.

An interesting question is the relationship between affordances and mental representations as set forth in a more cognitivist perspective. While Greeno (1998) argues that attunements to affordances are superior to constructs such as [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] and mental models, Glenberg &amp; Robertson (1999) suggested that affordances are the building blocks of mental models.

===Perception (variance/invariance)===
The work of Gibson (1986) in the field of visual [[perception]] greatly influences situated cognition.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"/&gt; Gibson argued that visual perception is not a matter of the eye translating inputs into symbolic representation in the brain. Instead the viewer perceives and picks up on the infinite amount of information available in the environment. Specifically, an agent perceives affordances by discovering the variants, what changes, and more importantly the invariants, what does not change across different situations. Given a specific intention (or intentional set),{{clarify|date=October 2011}} perceptions of invariants are co-determined by the agent and the affordances of the environment, and are then built upon over time.{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

===Memory===
Situated cognition and ecological psychology perspectives emphasize perception and propose that [[memory]] plays a significantly diminished role in the learning process. Rather, focus is on the continuous tuning of perceptions and actions across situations based on the affordances of the environment and the interaction of the agent within that environment (Greeno, 1994). Representations are not stored and checked against past knowledge, but are created and interpreted in activity (Clancey, 1990).

Situated cognition understands memory as an interaction with the world, bounded by meaningful situations, that brings an agent toward a specified goal (intention). Thus, perception and action are co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which act 'in the moment' together.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 1979/1986; Greeno, 1994; Young Kulikowich, &amp; Barab, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the agent directly perceives and interacts with the environment, determining what affordances can be picked up, based on his effectivities, and does not simply recall stored symbolic representations.

===Knowing===
Situativity theorists recast knowledge not as an entity, thing, or noun, but as knowing as an action or verb.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"/&gt; It is not an entity which can be collected as in knowledge acquisition models. Instead knowing is reciprocally co-determined between the agent and environment.&lt;ref name="br2006"&gt;Barab &amp; Roth, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This reciprocal interaction can not be separated from the context and its cultural and historical constructions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Therefore, knowing isn't a matter of arriving at any single truth but instead it is a particular stance that emerges from the agent-environment interaction.&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt;

Knowing emerges as individuals develop intentions&lt;ref&gt;Young, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; through goal-directed activities within cultural contexts which may in turn have larger goals and claims of truth. The adoption of intentions relates to the direction of the agent's attention to the detection of affordances in the environment that will lead to accomplishment of desired goals. Knowing is expressed in the agent's ability to act as an increasingly competent participant in a community of practice. As agents participate more fully within specific communities of practice, what constitutes knowing continuously evolves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, a novice environmentalist may not look at water quality by examining oxygen levels but may consider the color and smell.&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt; Through participation and enculturation within different communities, agents express knowing through action.

===Learning===
Since knowing is rooted in action and can not be decontextualized from individual, social, and historical goals&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt; teaching approaches that focus on conveying facts and rules separately from the contexts within which they are meaningful in real-life do not allow for [[learning]] that is based on the detection of invariants. They are therefore considered to be impoverished methods that are unlikely to lead to transfer. Learning must involve more than the transmission of knowledge but must instead encourage the expression of effectivities and the development of attention and intention&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004b&lt;/ref&gt; through rich contexts&lt;ref&gt;Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; that reflect real life learning processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Learning, more specifically literacy learning is affected by the Internet and other communication technologies as also evidenced in other segments of society. As a result of this youth are recently using affordances provided by these tools to become experts in a variety of domains.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"&gt;Gee, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These practices by youth are viewed as them becoming "pro-ams" and becoming experts in whatever they have developed a passion for.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 2006; Leadbeater &amp; Miller, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Individuals don't just read or write texts, they interact with them, and often these interactions involve others in various socio-cultural contexts. Since [[language]] is often the basis for monitoring and tracking learning gains in comprehension, content knowledge and tool use in and out of school the role of situated cognition in language learning activities is important. Membership and interaction in social and cultural groups is often determined by tools, technologies and [[discourse]] use for full participation. Language learning or literacy in various social and cultural groups must include how the groups work with and interact with these texts.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"/&gt; Language instruction in the context of situated cognition also involves the skilled or novice use of language by members of the group, and instruction of not only the elements of language, but what is needed to bring a student to the level of expert.

According to [[Jean Lave]] and Wenger (1991) [[legitimate peripheral participation]] (LPP) provides a framework to describe how individuals ('newcomers') become part of a community of learners. Legitimate peripheral participation was central to Lave and Wenger's take on situated cognition (referred to as "situated activity") because it introduced socio-cultural and historical realizations of power and access to the way thinking and knowing are legitimated. They stated, "Hegemony over resources for learning and alienation from full participation are inherent in the shaping of the legitimacy and peripherality of participation in its historical realizations" (p.&amp;nbsp;42). Lave and Wenger's (1991) research on the phenomenon of apprenticeship in communities of practice not only provided a unit of analysis for locating an individual's multiple, changing levels and ways of participation, but also implied that all participants, through increased involvement, have access to, acquire, and use resources available to their particular community.

To illustrate the role of LPP in situated activity, Lave and Wenger (1991) examined five apprenticeship scenarios (Yucatec midwives, Vai and Gola tailors, naval quartermasters, meat cutters, and non-drinking alcoholics involved in AA). Their analysis of apprenticeship across five different communities of learners lead them to several conclusions about the situatedness of LPP and its relationship to successful learning. Key to newcomers' success included:

* access to all that community membership entails,
* involvement in productive activity,
* learning the discourse(s) of the community including "talking about and talking within a practice," (p.&amp;nbsp;109), and
* willingness of the community to capitalize on the inexperience of newcomers, "Insofar as this continual interaction of new perspectives is sanctioned, everyone's participation is legitimately peripheral in some respect. In other words, everyone can to some degree be considered a 'newcomer' to the future of a changing community" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Planning vs. action ===
Suchman's book, ''Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human-machine Communication'' (1987), provided a novel approach to the study of [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction (HCI)]]. By adopting an anthropological approach to sensemaking and interpretation, Suchman was able to demonstrate how both action and planning were situated in the context of a flow of socially- and materially-mediated activities - an idea that stimulated many of the later conceptualizations of situated cognition. Her studies contrasted the deterministic approach to planning assumed by technology designers with the situated nature of planning as people make sense of the status of their workflow and adjust their course of action accordingly. For example, a photocopier will instruct its user to reload all pages in the original order after a jam, whereas the user understands that they only need to copy the last page again.  By arguing that plans were the result of ongoing processes of prospective/retrospective sense making, Suchman identified the limits of technology system access to relevant social and material resources as a major cause of limitations in how technology supports human work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This position led to a major debate with Vera and Simon (1993), who argued that cognition is based on symbolic representations and that planning must therefore be deterministic, based on a pre-determined repertoire of learned response. Most organizational theorists would now see this debate as reflecting individual/cognitive vs. socially-situated levels of analysis (requiring a similar need for paradigmatic co-existence as [[Wave–particle duality]]). Suchman (1993) argues that planning in the context of work-activity is similar to navigating a canoe through rapids: you know what point on the river you are aiming for, but you constantly adjust your course as you interact with rocks, swells, and currents on the way. As a result many organizational theorists argue that plans can only be viewed as post-hoc justifications of action, while Suchman herself views appears to view plans and actions as interrelated in the moment of action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Representation, symbols, and schemata===
In situated theories, the term "[[Mental representation|representation]]" refers to external forms in the environment that are created through social interactions to express meaning (language, art, gestures, etc.) and are perceived and acted upon in the first person sense. "Representing" in the first person sense is conceived as an act of re-experiencing in the imagination that involves the dialectic of ongoing perceiving and acting in coordination with the activation of neural structures and processes. This form of reflective representation is considered to be a secondary type of learning, while the primary form of learning is found in the "adaptive recoordination that occurs with every behavior".&lt;ref name="clancey1993"&gt;Clancey, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptualizing is considered to be a "prelinguistic" act, while "knowing" involves creative interaction with [[symbol]]s in both their interpretation and use for expression. "Schema" develop as neural connections become biased through repeated activations to reactivate in situations that are perceived and conceived as temporally and compositionally similar to previous generalized situations.&lt;ref name="clancey1993" /&gt;

===Goals, intention, and attention===
[[File:PS Dynamics.jpg|thumb|left|Young-Barab Model (1997)]]The Young-Barab Model (1997) pictured to the left, illustrates the dynamics of intentions and intentional dynamics involved in the agent’s interaction with his environment when problem solving.

Dynamics of Intentions:&lt;ref name=ksy&gt;Kugler et al., 1991; Shaw et al., 1992; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; goal (intention) adoption from among all possible goals (ontological descent). This describes how the learner decides whether or not to adopt a particular goal when presented with a problem. Once a goal is adopted, the learner proceeds by interacting with their environment through intentional dynamics. There are many levels of intentions, but at the moment of a particular occasion, the agent has just one intention, and that intention constrains his behavior until it is fulfilled or annihilated.

Intentional Dynamics:&lt;ref name=ksy /&gt; dynamics that unfold when the agent has only one intention (goal) and begins to act towards it, perceiving and acting.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1979/1986"/&gt; It is a trajectory towards the achievement of a solution or goal, the process of tuning one’s perception (attention). Each intention is meaningfully bounded, where the dynamics of that intention inform the agent of whether or not he is getting closer to achieving his goal. If the agent is not getting closer to his goal, he will take corrective action, and then continue forward. This is the agent’s intentional dynamics, and continues on until he achieves his goal.

===Transfer===
There are various definition of transfer found within the situated cognition umbrella. Researchers interested in social practice often define transfer as increased participation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ecological psychology perspectives define transfer as the detection of invariance across different situations.&lt;ref&gt;Young &amp; McNeese, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, transfer can only "occur when there is a confluence of an individual's goals and objectives, their acquired abilities to act, and a set of affordances for action".&lt;ref&gt;Young et al., 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied cognition===
{{main|Embodied cognition}}
The traditional cognition approach assumes that perception and motor systems are merely peripheral input and output devices.&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, 2007; Wilson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[embodied cognition]] posits that the mind and body interact 'on the fly' as a single entity. An example of embodied cognition is seen in the area of robotics, where movements are not based on internal representations, rather, they are based on the robot’s direct and immediate interaction with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, research has shown that embodied facial expressions influence judgments,&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and arm movements are related to a person’s evaluation of a word or concept.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, &amp; Brendl, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter example, the individual would pull or push a lever towards his name at a faster rate for positive words, than for negative words. These results appeal to the embodied nature of situated cognition, where knowledge is the achievement of the whole body in its interaction with the world.

==Externalism==
As to the mind, by and large, situated cognition paves the way to various form of [[externalism]]. The issue is whether the situated aspect of cognition has only a practical value or it is somehow constitutive of cognition and perhaps of consciousness itself. As to the latter possibility, there are different positions. David Chalmers and Andy Clark, who developed the hugely debated model of the extended mind, explicitly rejected the externalization of consciousness.&lt;ref name="clark2008"&gt;Clark, A., (2008), ''Supersizing the Mind'', Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For them, only cognition is extended. On the other hand, others, like Riccardo Manzotti&lt;ref name=clark2008 /&gt; or Teed Rockwell,&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, 2005 #1561&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly considered the possibility to situate conscious experience in the environment.

==Pedagogical implications==
Since situated cognition views knowing as an action within specific contexts and views [[direct instruction]] models of knowledge transmission as impoverished, there are significant implications for pedagogical practices. First, curriculum requires instructional design that draws on apprenticeship models common in real life.&lt;ref name="Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989"/&gt; Second, curricular design should rely on contextual narratives that situate concepts in practice. Classroom practices such as [[project-based learning]] and [[problem-based learning]] would qualify as consistent with the [[situated learning]] perspective, as would techniques such as Case Base Learning, [[Anchored Instruction]], and [[cognitive apprenticeship]].

===Cognitive apprenticeship===
Cognitive apprenticeships were one of the earliest pedagogical designs to incorporate the theories of situated cognition (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship uses four dimensions (e.g., content, methods, sequence, sociology) to embed learning in activity and make deliberate the use of the social and physical contexts present in the classroom (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship includes the enculturation of students into authentic practices through activity and social interaction (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). The technique draws on the principles of Legitimate Peripheral Participation (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and reciprocal teaching (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984; 1989) in that a more knowledgeable other, i.e. a teacher, engages in a task with a more novice other, i.e. a learner, by describing their own thoughts as they work on the task, providing "just in time" scaffolding, modeling expert behaviors, and encouraging reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1985; Scardamalia, Bereiter. &amp; Steinbach, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The reflection process includes having students alternate between novice and expert strategies in a problem-solving context, sensitizing them to specifics of an expert performance, and adjustments that may be made to their own performance to get them to the expert level (Collins &amp; Brown, 1988; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Thus, the function of reflection indicates "co-investigation" and/or abstracted replay by students.&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1983; Collins &amp; Brown, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989) emphasized six critical features of a cognitive apprenticeship that included observation, coaching, [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], modeling, fading, and reflection. Using these critical features, expert(s) guided students on their journey to acquire the cognitive and metacognitive processes and skills necessary to handle a variety of tasks, in a range of situations&lt;ref&gt;Collins et al.,1989&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocal teaching, a form of cognitive apprenticeship, involves the modeling and coaching of various comprehension skills as teacher and students take turns in assuming the role of instructor.

===Anchored instruction===
Anchored instruction is grounded in a story or narrative that presents a realistic (but fictional) situation and raises an overarching question or problem (compare with an essential question posed by a teacher). This approach is designed to 1) engage the learner with a problem or series of related problems, 2) require the learner to develop goals and discover subgoals related to solving the problem(s), and 3) provide the learner with extensive and diverse opportunities to explore the problem(s) in a shared context with classmates. For example, a Spanish teacher uses a video drama series focused on the murder of a main character. Students work in small groups to summarize parts of the story, to create hypotheses about the murderer and motive, and to create a presentation of their solution to the class. Stories are often paired so that across the set students can detect the invariant structure of the underlying knowledge (so 2 episodes about distance-rate-time, one about boats and one about planes, so students can perceive how the distance-rate-time relationship holds across differences in vehicles). The ideal smallest set of instances needed provide students the opportunity to detect invariant structure has been referred to as a "generator set" of situations.

The goal of anchored instruction is the engagement of intention and attention. Through authentic tasks across multiple domains, educators present situations that require students to create or adopt meaningful goals (intentions). One of the educator’s objectives can be to set a goal through the use of an anchor problem.&lt;ref&gt;Barab &amp; Roth, 2006; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of anchored instruction is the Jasper series.&lt;ref&gt;The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990; Young et al., 1997; Young &amp; McNeese, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Jasper series includes a variety of videodisc adventures focused on problem formulation and problem solving. Each videodisc used a visual narrative to present an authentic, realistic everyday problem. The objective was for students to adopt specific goals (intentions) after viewing the story and defining a problem. These newly adopted goals guided students through the collaborative process of problem formulation and problem solving.

===Perceiving and acting in avatar-based virtual worlds===
[[Virtual world]]s provide unique affordances for embodied learning, i.e. hands on, interactive, spatially oriented, that ground learning in experience. Here "embodied" means acting in a virtual world enabled by an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]].

Contextual affordances of online games and virtual environments allow learners to engage in goal-driven activity, authentic interactions, and collaborative problem-solving – all considered in situated theories of learning to be features of optimal learning. In terms of situated assessment, virtual worlds have the advantage of facilitating dynamic feedback that directs the perceiving/acting agent, through an avatar, to continually improve performance.

==Research methodologies==
The situative perspective is focused on interactive systems in which individuals interact with one another and physical and representational systems. Research takes place ''in situ'' and in real-world settings, reflecting assumptions that knowledge is constructed within specific contexts which have specific situational affordances. Mixed methods and qualitative methodologies are the most prominently used by researchers.

In qualitative studies, methods used are varied but the focus is often on the increased participation in specific communities of practice, the affordances of the environment that are acted upon by the agent, and the distributed nature of knowing in specific communities. A major feature of quantitative methods used in situated cognition is the absence of outcome measures. Quantitative variables used in mixed methods often focus on process over product. For example, trace nodes, dribble files, and hyperlink pathways are often used to track how students interact in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Effken, Fajen, Garret &amp; Morris, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of situativity==
In "Situated Action: A Symbolic Interpretation" Vera and Simon wrote: " ... the systems usually regarded as exemplifying Situated Action are thoroughly symbolic (and representational), and, to the extent that they are limited in these respects, have doubtful prospects for extension to complex tasks"&lt;ref&gt;Vera &amp; Simon, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Vera and Simon (1993) also claimed that the [[information processing]] view is supported by many years of research in which symbol systems simulated "broad areas of human cognition" and that there is no evidence of cognition without representation.

Anderson, Reder and Simon (1996) summarized what they considered to be the four claims of situated learning and argued against each claim from a [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] perspective. The claims and their arguments were:
# Claim: Activity and learning are bound to the specific situations in which they occur. Argument: Whether learning is bound to context or not depends on both the kind of learning and the way that it is learned.
# Claim: Knowledge does not transfer between tasks. Argument: There is ample evidence of successful transfer between tasks in the literature. Transfer depends on initial practice and the degree to which a successive task has similar cognitive elements to a prior task.
# Claim: Teaching abstractions is ineffective. Argument: Abstract instruction can be made effective by combining of abstract concepts and concrete examples.
# Claim: Instruction must happen in complex social contexts. Argument: Research shows value in individual learning and on focusing individually on specific skills in a skill set.

Anderson, Reder and Simons summarize their concerns when they say:
"What is needed to improve learning and teaching is to continue to deepen our research into the circumstances that determine when narrower or broader contexts are required and when attention to narrower or broader skills are optimal for effective and efficient learning" (p.&amp;nbsp;10).

===Considerations===
However, it is important to remember that a theory is neither wrong nor right but provides affordances for certain aspects of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sfard | first1 = A | year = 1998 | title = On two metaphors for learning and the dangers of choosing just one | url = | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 4–13 | doi=10.3102/0013189x027002004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lave and Wenger recognized this in their ironic comment, "How can we purport to be working out a theoretical conception of learning without engaging in the project of abstraction [decontextualized knowledge] rejected above?" (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

The '''State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry''' ('''SUNY-ESF''', or '''ESF''') is an American, specialized, doctoral-granting institution based in [[Syracuse, New York]]. It is immediately adjacent to [[Syracuse University]], within which it was founded, and with whom it maintains a special relationship. ESF is a part of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system. ESF also operates facilities in the [[Adirondack Park]] (including the [[SUNY-ESF Ranger School|Ranger School]] in [[Wanakena, New York|Wanakena]]), the [[Thousand Islands]], elsewhere in central New York, and [[Costa Rica]]. The College's curricula focus on the understanding, [[natural resource management|management]] and [[sustainability]] of the environment and natural resources. ESF is considered by [[Peterson's]] to be the premier college in the U.S. for the study of environmental and natural sciences, design, engineering, policy and management of natural resources and the environment.&lt;ref name="petersons.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petersons.com/college-search/state-university-of-new-york-college-of-environmental-science-and-forestry-000_10000544.aspx|title=State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|publisher=Peterson's|accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college has expanded its initial emphasis on forestry to include professional education in environmental science, landscape architecture, environmental studies, and engineering in addition to distinguished programs in the biological and physical sciences.&lt;ref name="petersons.com"/&gt; ESF is ranked at 43rd in the 2017 ''US News &amp; World Report'' rankings of the top public national universities.&lt;ref name=usnwr2019 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/suny-environmental-science-and-forestry-2851|title=SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry - SUNY Environmental Science and Forestry - Best College - US News|publisher=|accessdate=13 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commemorated its centennial in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.edu/centennial/ |title=SUNY-ESF Centennial Celebration |publisher=Esf.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|History of the New York State College of Forestry}}

=== Founding ===

The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was established in 1911 through a bill signed by [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[John Alden Dix]]. The previous year, Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes|Hughes]] had vetoed a bill authorizing such a college.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, A.D. ''Liberty Hyde Bailey: A Story of American Plant Sciences''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Both bills followed the state's defunding, in 1903, of the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |title=Department of Natural Resources - History |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archivedate=October 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cornell_Roots-of-American-Forestry-Education.pdf |format=PDF |title=Roots of American Forestry Education |website=Foresthistory.org |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a unit of [[Syracuse University]], in 1913, the College was made a separate, legal entity.

Syracuse native and constitutional lawyer [[Louis Marshall]], with a summer residence at [[Knollwood Club]] on Saranac Lake and a prime mover for the establishment of the Adirondack and Catskill [[Forest Preserve (New York)]], became a Syracuse University Trustee in 1910. He confided in Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James R. Day]] his desire to have an agricultural and forestry school at the University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" - 1900-1919 |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315135440/http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1911 his efforts resulted in a New York State bill to fund the project: the aforementioned appropriation bill signed by Governor Dix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Herbert Alpert| title = Louis Marshall: 1856-1929| date = 2008-11-03| isbn = 978-0-595-48230-6| page = 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall was elected president of the college's Board of Trustees at its first meeting, in 1911; at the time of his death, eighteen years later, he was still president of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Marshall,"Champion of Liberty", selected papers and addresses(in 2 volumes), edited by Charles Reznikoff,1957. Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first dean of the College was [[William L. Bray]], a Ph.D., graduate from the University of Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/ecology/aepsp3.html |title=American Environmental Photographs, 1891-1936 - Ecology and the American Environment (American Memory from the Library of Congress) |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; botanist, plant ecologist, biogeographer and Professor of Botany at Syracuse University. In 1907 he was made head of the botany department at Syracuse, and in 1908 he started teaching a forestry course in the basement of Lyman Hall. Bray was an associate of [[Gifford Pinchot]], who was the first Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = William L.

April 4, 2008. Volume 61 Issue 9. Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, in addition to assuming the deanship of forestry, Bray organized the Agricultural Division at Syracuse University. He remained at Syracuse until 1943 as chair of botany and Dean of the Syracuse Graduate School.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/BRAY1865.htm Chrono-Biographical Sketch: William Bray]". A Biographical History of Biogeography by Charles H. Smith, Ph.D., Joshua Woleben, and Carubie Rodgers/ Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, the same year that Dr. Bray published ''The Development of the Vegetation of New York State'', he became one of the founding members, along with [[Raphael Zon]] and [[Yale School of Forestry]]'s second dean, James W. Toumey, of the [[Ecological Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.org/history/ |title=The Ecological Society of America's History and Records – by the ESA Historical Records Committee |publisher=Esa.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the 1917 "activist wing" of that Society formed today's [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art25679.html |title=New York Nature Conservation, Environment Issues &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2012-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325075148/http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art25679.html# |archive-date=2010-03-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/pressroom/ip/press/forests.html |title=Conservation &amp; Green News &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the professors, in the early years of the College of Forestry at Syracuse and the Department of Forestry at Cornell's [[New York State College of Agriculture]] were educated in forestry at the [[Yale School of Forestry]]. The forestry students at Syracuse but not at Cornell were referred to as "stumpies" by their classmates.

Fifty-two students were enrolled in the school's first year, the first 11 graduating two years later, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;SUNY-ESF. 2008. ''Alumni Directory. 100th Anniversary Edition''. Syracuse, NY, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the hallmarks of the College, its research, dates back to 1912, beginning with a study on what firms were using lumber in the state of New York as well as the wood species and quantities.

=== Expansion ===

In 1912, the College opened its [[SUNY-ESF Ranger School|Ranger School]] in [[Wanakena, New York]], in the [[Adirondacks]]. The College began enrolling women as early as 1915, but the first women to complete their degrees—one majoring in landscape engineering and two in pulp and paper—graduated in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/history.htm A History of ESF]". SUNY-ESF website. Retrieved on October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1930, Governor [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], recommending an allocation of $600,000 towards construction of the college's second building, in honor of Louis Marshall, recently deceased, noted that: "under [Marshall's] leadership and the leadership of its late dean, [[F. Franklin Moon|Franklin Moon]], the School of Forestry made giant strides until it became recognized as the premier institution of its kind in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Cyrus, "Louis Marshall: A Biographical Sketch", American Jewish Year Book, 1930-31, pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of Louis Marshall Memorial Hall was laid in 1931 by former Governor and presidential candidate [[Alfred E. Smith]] who was elected to assume the presidency of the college's Board of Trustees.

=== Affiliation with SUNY ===

With the formation of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) in 1948, the College became recognized as a specialized college within the SUNY system, and its name was changed to State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. In 1972, the College's name was changed yet again to State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Unlike other state-supported degree-granting institutions which had been created at private institutions in New York State, the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was an autonomous institution not administratively part of Syracuse University. In 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF's "primacy" among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esf.edu/es/documents/GuidelinesforConsidofnewugDegreePgms6302000.pdf | title=Guidelines for Consideration of New Undergraduate Degree Programs in Environmental Science/Studies| accessdate=2009-07-09| author=Peter D.

ESF's main campus, located in [[Syracuse, New York]], is where most academic and administrative activity takes place. The campus is made up of nine main buildings:

* '''Baker Laboratory''': Named after [[Hugh P. Baker]], Dean of the College from 1912–1920 and again 1930-33. The building is the location of several [[computer cluster]]s and auditorium-style classrooms. It is home to the Department of Environmental Resources Engineering and the Division of Environmental Science. The building underwent a $37 million overhaul in the early 2000s, providing updated space for the Tropical Timber Information Center and the [[Nelson C. Brown]] Center for Ultrastructure Studies. Baker Lab is the site of ESF's NASA-affiliated Research Center. Baker Laboratory houses two multimedia lecture halls, a "smart" classroom outfitted for computer use and distance learning, and two construction management and planning studios. It also has a full-scale laboratory for materials science testing, including a modern dry kiln, a wood identification laboratory, shop facilities (including portable sawmill) and wood preservation laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.esf.edu/communications/news/2000/03.29.baker.htm ESF's Baker Laboratory Revamped for Engineering]". ESF Office of Communications. Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bray Hall''': The building is the oldest on campus, completed in 1917, the largest building devoted to Forestry at the time. It is named after [[William L. Bray]], a founder of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University and its first dean, 1911-12. It is the location of most administrative offices and the Department of Forest and Natural Resources Management. The [[New York State University Police|State University Police]] department is located in the basement.
* '''Gateway Center''': The campus' newest building, opened in March 2013, "sets a new standard for LEED buildings, producing more renewable energy than it consumes," according to [[Cornelius B. Murphy, Jr.]] The building is "designed to achieve LEED Platinum Certification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=415 |title=SUNY-ESF Breaks Ground for Gateway Building |publisher=Esf.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm "Gateway Building" (with webcam), SUNY-ESF.] Accessed: June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The ESF College Bookstore, Trailhead Cafe, and Office of Admissions are located in the Gateway Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm "The Gateway Center"], ESF website. Accessed: October 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Illick Hall''': The building was completed in 1968, and is home to the Department of Environmental and Forest Biology. It is named after [[Joseph S. Illick]], a dean of the State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. There is a large lecture hall (Illick 5) on the ground floor. Several greenhouses are located on the fifth floor. The Roosevelt Wildlife Museum is also located in the building.
* '''Jahn Laboratory''': Named after [[Edwin C. Jahn]], former head of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. The building was completed in 1997. Home to the Department of Chemistry.
* '''Marshall Hall''': Named after [[Louis Marshall]], one of the founders of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. Home to the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Studies departments. The Alumni ([[Eustace B. Nifkin|Nifkin]]) Lounge, Tree House (snack bar) and Marshall Auditorium are located within. Twin brass plaques in the entryway commemorate the contributions of Marshall and his son, alumnus [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]].
* '''Moon Library''': Dedicated to [[F. Franklin Moon]], an early dean of the College. Completed in 1968, along with Illick Hall. A computer cluster and student lounge are located in the basement.
* '''Walters Hall''': Named after [[J. Henry Walters]], who served on the College's Board of Trustees. Completed in 1969. Home to the Department of Paper and Bioprocess Engineering. The pilot plant in the building includes two paper machines and wood-to-ethanol processing equipment.
*'''Centennial Hall''': ESF's on-campus student [[dormitory]], named in commemoration of the college's 100th anniversary. The facility is capable of accommodating 280-300 freshman (in double or triple studio rooms with private bath), 116 upperclassmen (in single bedroom suits with private bath), and an additional 56 upperclassmen (in 4-bedroom, 2-bath apartments). A $31 million project, Centennial Hall opened in fall 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centennial Hall|url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/centennial.htm|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bray Hall, Marshall Hall, Illick Hall, and Moon Library border the quad. Other buildings on the Syracuse campus include one for maintenance and operations, a garage, and a greenhouse converted to office space. Among planned new buildings is a research support facility.

The historic Robin Hood Oak (photo below) is located behind Bray Hall. The tree is said to have grown from an acorn brought back by a faculty member from the Sherwood Forest in England. It was the first tree listed on the National Registrar of Historic Trees in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Many students identify themselves as a "Stumpy" (or "Stumpie"). The nickname was given to students by their neighbors at Syracuse University, probably in the 1920s, and most-likely refers to forestry "stump jumpers". Although originally used as an insult, today, most students embrace the nickname with pride.

Students at the Syracuse campus enjoy many activities on and off campus. There are a number of student clubs and organizations at ESF, including the Undergraduate Student Association, Graduate Student Association, Woodsmen Team, [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]] Club, Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/org/axs/ "Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,"] SUNY-ESF website. Accessed: August 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Soccer Team, [[Sigma Lambda Alpha (honor society)|Sigma Lambda Alpha]], ''The Knothole'' (weekly newspaper), Papyrus Club, ''The Empire Forester'' (yearbook), Landscape Architecture Club (formally the Mollet Club), Forest Engineers Club, Environmental Studies Student Organization, [[Habitat for Humanity]], ''Ecologue'' (yearly journal), the Bioethics Society, Green Campus Initiative, Baobab Society, and the Sustainable Energy Club. Wanakena students have their own woodsmen and ice hockey teams. A number of professional organizations are also open to student membership, including the [[Society of American Foresters]], [[The Wildlife Society]], [[Conservation biology|Conservation Biology]] club, American Fisheries Association, and the (currently defunct) American Water Resources Association.

ESF has an agreement with adjacent [[Syracuse University]] that allows ESF students to enjoy many amenities offered by SU. ESF students take courses at their sister institution, can apply for admission to concurrent degree and joint certificate programs, and may join any SU organization except for NCAA sports teams. SU students are also welcome to enroll in ESF classes. Because of this, students feel a certain degree of integration with the Syracuse University community. Every May, ESF holds a joint commencement ceremony with Syracuse University in the [[Carrier Dome]]. ESF's baccalaureate diplomas bear the seals of both the State University of New York and Syracuse University.

Students also enjoy a variety of shops, restaurants, museums, and theaters in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and nearby [[Marshall Street, Syracuse|Marshall Street]] and [[Westcott, Syracuse|Westcott Street]].

== Gateway Center ==
ESF has launched several programs, both within the confines of campus and other locations to reduce its [[carbon emission]]s. The Gateway Center utilizes sustainable energy resources to generate power and heat utilized across the campus. The building includes a state-of-the-art, combined heat-and-power (CHP) system, producing 65% of campus heating needs along with 20% of its electrical needs. The CHP system uses [[biomass]] to drive a [[steam turbine]] and produce electricity, while natural gas is used for steam heating along with additional electricity. It has been estimated this building alone is responsible for reducing ESF's carbon footprint by 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gateway Center|url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ESF-Gateway-Green-Roof-2014.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Gateway Center's [[green roof|green roof/ garden]] (foreground)]]

Increased global awareness of global warming and reduced nonrenewable resources has driven ESF to invest in biomass.  Biomass is a renewable resource that draws light energy, carbon dioxide, and water from the environment; in return oxygen is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Shijie|author2=Abrahamson, L. |author3=Scott, G. |title=Biorefinery: Ensuring biomass as a sustainable renewable source of chemicals, materials, and energy|journal=Biomass and Bioenergy|year=2012|volume=39|issue=April|pages=1–4|doi=10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.12.042}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be harvested without negatively affecting the environment.  For this reason, SUNY-ESF has launched a program to grow its own biomass, known as the ''[[Willow Biomass Project]]''. Benefits of woody willow include, high yields and fast growth times, quick re-sprouting, and high heat energy is produced when burned. Woody willow also increases habitat diversity significantly contributes to carbon neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Willow Biomass Project|url=http://www.esf.edu/pubprog/brochure/willow/willow.htm|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gateway Center was one of the final stages in the school's ''Climate Action Plan'', that encompasses the vision of [[carbon neutrality]] and reduced [[fossil fuel]] dependence by 2015. Currently, the school rests in Phase III of the program and is on track to reach its goal. Included in Phase III is the opening of The Gateway Center, retrofits to Illick Hall, and rooftop greenhouse replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heavey|first=Justin|title=Climate Action Plan for SUNY ESF|year=2009|publisher=Department of Renewable Energy Systems|page=6,21|author2=Kelleher, Michael |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other advancement towards carbon neutrality can be seen on top of the campus's buildings. [[Green roof|Rooftop gardens]] provide reduced [[energy consumption]] and water runoff. Shrubbery, soil thickness, and moisture content all can contribute to increased [[energy conservation|energy savings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=N.

=== Athletics history ===

In one notable part of the College's history, [[Laurie D. Cox]], professor of [[Landscape architecture|Landscape Architecture]], was responsible for establishing [[Syracuse University]]'s renowned [[Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse|lacrosse program]] in 1916, including players from the New York State College of Forestry.&lt;ref name =father&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118716843.html|title=Cox began lacrosse legacy at Syracuse|last=Herron|first=Frank|date=June 27, 2004|publisher=The Post-Standard (Syracuse, NY)|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliation with Syracuse University==
ESF was founded in 1911 as the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee [[Louis Marshall]], with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed several years after the cessation of state funding to the earlier [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University, 1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 161, Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from Syracuse University, while some resources, facilities and infrastructure are shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206063046/http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |archivedate=2013-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students may take courses at both institutions, and baccalaureate diplomas from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with that of the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools. ESF receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has somewhat similar financial and working relationships with five [[statutory college]]s that are at [[Alfred University]] and [[Cornell University]], although unlike ESF, these statutory institutions are legally and technically part of their respective host institutions and are administered by them as well.

ESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from Syracuse University (SU) in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August and combined commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to library resources, recreational facilities, student clubs, and activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate athletics teams, affiliated with the USCAA and NCAA, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/esfsu.htm |title=The ESF-SU Relationship |publisher=State University of New York|accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
The best known tradition among ESF students is that walking across the quad is shunned. The tradition, which dates back to at least the early 1960s, is intended to inhibit tracks from being worn into the lawn. Hecklers have been known to yell and even tackle people walking across the quad. However, other activities such as [[frisbee]] and soccer playing are encouraged on the Quad.

Eustace B. Nifkin, ESF's previous mascot, is an unofficial student. He first appeared in the 1940s after a group of students summering in the Adirondacks thought him up. Ever since, he has appeared on class rosters, written articles for ''The Knothole'', and sent mail to the College from around the world. He has a girlfriend, the lesser-known Elsa S. Freeborn. SUNY granted him a bachelor's degree in 1972. The Alumni Lounge in Marshall Hall is dedicated to Nifkin.

Another well known legend is that of Chainer or Chainsaw who supposedly graduated in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11212">'''Strategic environmental assessment''' ('''SEA''') is a systematic [[decision support]] process, aiming to ensure that environmental and possibly other sustainability aspects are considered effectively in policy, plan and program making. In this context, following Fischer (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, T. B. (2007). Theory and Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; SEA may be seen as:

*a structured, rigorous, participative, open and transparent [[environmental impact]] assessment (EIA) based process, applied particularly to plans and programmes, prepared by public planning [[authorities]] and at times private bodies,
*a participative, open and transparent, possibly non-EIA-based process, applied in a more flexible manner to policies, prepared by public planning authorities and at times private bodies,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kulsum; Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto. 2008. Strategic Environmental Assessment for Policies : An Instrument for Good Governance. © Washington, DC : World Bank. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6461&lt;/ref&gt;
*a flexible non-EIA based process, applied to legislative proposals and other policies, plans and programmes in political/cabinet decision-making.

Effective SEA works within a structured and tiered decision framework, aiming to support more effective and efficient decision-making for sustainable development and improved governance by providing for a substantive focus regarding questions, issues and alternatives to be considered in policy, plan and programme (PPP) making.

SEA is an [[evidence-based]] instrument, aiming to add scientific rigour to PPP making, by using suitable assessment methods and techniques. Ahmed and Sanchez Triana (2008) developed an approach to the design and implementation of public policies that follows a continuous process rather than as a discrete intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kulsum; Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto. 2008.

==History==
The [[European Union Directive on Environmental Impact Assessments]] (85/337/EEC, known as the ''[[Environmental impact assessment|EIA]] Directive'') only applied to certain projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0337:EN:HTML Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the Assessment of the Effects of Certain Public and Private Projects on the Environment] (1985-06-27) from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex]&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as deficient as it only dealt with specific effects at the local level whereas many environmentally damaging decisions had already been made at a more strategic level (for example the fact that new infrastructure may generate an increased demand for travel).

The concept of strategic assessments originated from regional development / land use planning in the developed world. In 1981 the ''U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department'' published the ''Area-wide Impact Assessment Guidebook''. In Europe the  ''[[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]]'' the so-called ''[[Espoo]] Convention'' laid the foundations for the introduction of SEA in 1991. In 2003, the Espoo Convention was supplemented by a [[Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment]].

The [[European SEA Directive 2001/42/EC]] required that all member states of the [[European Union]] should have ratified the Directive into their own country's law by 21 July 2004.&lt;ref name=Directive&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council] (2001-06-27) from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex]&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries of the EU started implementing the land use aspects of SEA first, some took longer to adopt the directive than others, but the implementation of the directive can now be seen as completed. Many EU nations have a longer history of strong Environmental Appraisal including [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. The newer member states to the EU have hurried in implementing the directive.

==Relationship with environmental impact assessment==
For the most part, an SEA is conducted before a corresponding EIA is undertaken. This means that information on the environmental impact of a plan can cascade down through the tiers of decision making and can be used in an EIA at a later stage. This should reduce the amount of work that needs to be undertaken. A handover procedure is foreseen.

==Aims and structure==
The SEA Directive only applies to plans and programmes, not policies, although policies within plans are likely to be assessed and SEA can be applied to policies if needed and in the UK certainly, very often is.

The structure of SEA (under the Directive) is based on the following phases:
* "Screening", investigation of whether the plan or programme falls under the SEA legislation,
* "Scoping", defining the boundaries of investigation, assessment and assumptions required,
* "Documentation of the state of the environment", effectively a ''baseline'' on which to base judgments,
* "Determination of the likely (non-marginal) environmental impacts", usually in terms of Direction of Change rather than firm figures,
* Informing and consulting the public,
* Influencing "Decision taking" based on the assessment and,
* Monitoring of the effects of plans and programmes after their implementation.

The EU directive also includes other impacts besides the environmental, such as material assets and archaeological sites. In most western European states this has been broadened further to include economic and social aspects of [[sustainability]].

SEA should ensure that plans and programmes take into consideration the environmental effects they cause. If those environmental effects are part of the overall decision taking it is called ''Strategic Impact Assessment''.

==In the European Union==
SEA is a legally enforced assessment procedure required by Directive 2001/42/EC (known as the SEA Directive).&lt;ref name=Directive/&gt; The SEA Directive aims at introducing systematic assessment of the environmental effects of strategic land use related plans and programs. It typically applies to regional and local, development, waste and transport plans, within the European Union. Some plans, such as finance and budget plans or civil defence plans are exempt from the SEA Directive, it also only applies to plans that are required by law, which excludes national government's plans and programs, as their plans are 'voluntary', whereas local and regional governments are usually required to prepare theirs.

===United Kingdom===
SEA within the UK is complicated by different Regulations, guidance and practice between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In particular the SEA Legislation in Scotland (and in Northern Ireland, which specifically refers to the Regional Development Strategy) contains an expectation that SEA will apply to strategies as well as plans and programmes. In the UK, SEA is inseparable from the term '[[sustainability]]', and an SEA is expected to be carried out as part of a wider [[Sustainability Appraisal]] (SA), which was already a requirement for many types of plan before the SEA directive and includes social, and economic factors in addition to environmental. Essentially an SA is intended to better inform decision makers on the sustainability aspects of the plan and ensure the full impact of the plan on sustainability is understood.

The United Kingdom in its strategy for sustainable development, ''A Better Quality of Life'' (May 1999), explained sustainable development in terms of four objectives. These are:

*social progress which recognises the needs of everyone
*effective protection of the environment
*prudent use of natural resources
*maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth and employment.

These headline objectives are usually used and applied to local situations in order to assess the impact of the plan or program.

==Internationally==

===The pan-European region===
The [[Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment]] was negotiated by the member States of the [[UNECE]] (in this instance Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia). It required ratification by 16 States to come into force, which it did in July 2010. It is now open to all [[UN]] Member States. Besides its potentially broader geographical application (global), the Protocol differs from the corresponding European Union Directive in its non-mandatory application to policies and legislation – not just plans and programmes. The Protocol also places a strong emphasis on the consideration of health, and there are other more subtle differences between the two instruments.

===New Zealand===
SEA in New Zealand is part of an integrated planning and assessment process and unlike the US is not used in the manner of [[Environmental impact assessment]].  The [[Resource Management Act 1991]] has, as a principal objective, the aim of sustainable management. SEA is increasingly being considered for transportation projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/rma/roading-delays-feb03.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
===The OECD DAC – SEA in development co-operation===
[[Development assistance]] is increasingly being provided through strategic-level interventions, aimed to make aid more effective. SEA meets the need to ensure environmental considerations are taken into account in this new aid context. Applying SEA to development co-operation provides the environmental evidence to support more informed decision making, and to identify new opportunities by encouraging a systematic and thorough examination of development options.

The [[OECD]] [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) Task Team on SEA has developed [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/21/37353858.pdf guidance] on how to apply SEA to development co-operation. The document explains the benefits of using SEA in development co-operation and sets out key steps for its application, based on recent experiences.

A '''synthetic radioisotope''' is a [[radionuclide]] that is not found in nature: no natural process or mechanism exists which produces it, or it is so unstable that it decays away in a very short period of time. Examples include [[technetium]]-95 and [[promethium]]-146. Many of these are found in, and harvested from, [[spent nuclear fuel]] assemblies. Some must be manufactured in [[particle accelerator]]s.

==Production==
Some synthetic radioisotopes are extracted from spent [[nuclear reactor]] fuel rods, which contain various [[fission products]]. For example, it is estimated that up to 1994, about 49,000 [[Becquerel|terabecquerels ]] (78 [[tonne|metric ton]]) of [[technetium]] was produced in nuclear reactors, which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoshihara|first1=K|editor1-last=Yoshihara|editor1-first=K|editor2-last=Omori|editor2-first=T|title=Technetium and Rhenium Their Chemistry and Its Applications|date=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-59469-7|chapter=Technetium in the environment|series=Topics in Current Chemistry|volume=176|doi=10.1007/3-540-59469-8_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some synthetic isotopes are produced in significant quantities by fission but are not yet being reclaimed.  Other isotopes are manufactured by [[neutron]] irradiation of parent isotopes in a nuclear reactor (for example, Tc-97 can be made by neutron irradiation of Ru-96) or by bombarding parent isotopes with high energy particles from a particle accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radioisotope Production|url=http://www.bnl.gov/medical/Isotope_Distribution/Isodistoff.htm|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106040156/http://www.bnl.gov/medical/Isotope_Distribution/Isodistoff.htm|archivedate=6 January 2010|date=2009|deadurl=bot: unknown|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual for reactor produced radioisotopes.|date=2003|publisher=IAEA|location=Vienna|isbn=92-0-101103-2|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/IAEABooks/6407/Manual-for-Reactor-Produced-Radioisotopes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many isotopes are produced in [[cyclotron]]s, for example [[fluorine-18]] and [[oxygen-15]] which are widely used for [[positron emission tomography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyclotron Produced Radionuclides: Physical Characteristics and Production Methods|date=2009|publisher=IAEA|location=Vienna|isbn=978-92-0-106908-5|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/iaeabooks/7892/Cyclotron-Produced-Radionuclides-Physical-Characteristics-and-Production-Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Most synthetic radioisotopes have a short [[half-life]]. Though a health hazard, radioactive materials have many medical and industrial uses.

===Nuclear medicine===
The field of [[nuclear medicine]] covers use of radioisotopes for diagnosis or treatment.

====Diagnosis====
Radioactive tracer compounds, [[radiopharmaceutical]]s, are used to observe the function of various organs and body systems. These compounds use a chemical tracer which is attracted to or concentrated by the activity which is being studied. That chemical tracer incorporates a short lived radioactive isotope, usually one which emits a [[gamma ray]] which is energetic enough to travel through the body and be captured outside by a [[gamma camera]] to map the concentrations. [[Gamma camera]]s and other similar detectors are highly efficient, and the tracer compounds are generally very effective at concentrating at the areas of interest, so the total amounts of radioactive material needed are very small.

The metastable [[nuclear isomer]] Tc-99m is a [[gamma-ray]] emitter widely used for medical diagnostics because it has a short half-life of 6 hours, but can be easily made in the hospital using a [[technetium-99m generator]]. Weekly global demand for the parent isotope [[molybdenum-99]] was {{convert|12000|Ci|TBq|lk=out|order=flip|abbr=on}} in 2010, overwhelmingly provided by fission of [[uranium-235]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production and Supply of Molybdenum-99|url=https://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC54/GC54InfDocuments/English/gc54inf-3-att7_en.pdf|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Several radioisotopes and compounds are used for [[Unsealed source radiotherapy|medical treatment]], usually by bringing the radioactive isotope to a high concentration in the body near a particular organ. For example, [[iodine]]-131 is used for treating some disorders and tumors of the [[thyroid]] gland.

===Industrial radiation sources===
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}
[[Alpha particle]], [[beta particle]], and [[gamma ray]] radioactive emissions are industrially useful. Most sources of these are synthetic radioisotopes. Areas of use include the [[Uses of radioactivity in oil and gas wells|petroleum industry]], [[industrial radiography]], [[homeland security]], [[process control]] and [[food irradiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenblatt|first1=Jack A.|title=Stable and Radioactive Isotopes: Industry &amp; Trade Summary|url=https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/ITS-1.pdf|website=Office of Industries|publisher=United States International Trade Commission|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rivard|first1=Mark J.|last2=Bobek|first2=Leo M.|last3=Butler|first3=Ralph A.|last4=Garland|first4=Marc A.|last5=Hill|first5=David J.|last6=Krieger|first6=Jeanne K.|last7=Muckerheide|first7=James B.|last8=Patton|first8=Brad D.|last9=Silberstein|first9=Edward B.|title=The US national isotope program: Current status and strategy for future success|journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes|date=August 2005|volume=63|issue=2|pages=157–178|doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2005.03.004|url=https://www.isotopes.gov/outreach/reports/Rivard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=Doug|title=Radioactive Isotopes in Process Measurement|url=https://www.controlglobal.com/assets/12WPpdf/121105-vega-isotopes-measurement.pdf|publisher=VEGA Controls|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:F-Stecker und Kabel.jpg|thumb|One of the most common types of transmission line, [[coaxial cable]]. ]]

In [[Telecommunications engineering|communications]] and [[electronic engineering]], a '''transmission line''' is a specialized cable or other structure designed to conduct [[alternating current]] of [[radio frequency]], that is, currents with a [[frequency]] high enough that their [[wave]] nature must be taken into account. Transmission lines are used for purposes such as connecting [[Transmitter|radio transmitters]] and [[Radio receiver|receivers]] with their [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] (they are then called [[feed line]]s or feeders), distributing [[cable television]] signals, [[trunking|trunklines]] routing calls between telephone switching centres, computer network connections and high speed computer [[Bus (computing)|data buses]].

This article covers two-conductor transmission line such as parallel line ([[ladder line]]), [[coaxial cable]], [[stripline]], and [[microstrip]].  Some sources also refer to [[waveguide]], [[dielectric waveguide]], and even [[optical fiber|optical fibre]] as transmission line, however these lines require different analytical techniques and so are not covered by this article; see [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)]].

==Overview==
Ordinary electrical cables suffice to carry low frequency [[alternating current]] (AC), such as [[mains power]], which reverses direction 100 to 120 times per second, and [[audio signal]]s.  However, they cannot be used to carry currents in the [[radio frequency]] range,&lt;ref name="Jackman"&gt;{{cite book

Radio frequency currents also tend to reflect from discontinuities in the cable such as [[electrical connector|connectors]] and joints, and travel back down the cable toward the source.&lt;ref name="Jackman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oklobdzija"&gt;{{cite book

Transmission lines use specialized construction, and [[impedance matching]], to carry electromagnetic signals with minimal reflections and power losses.  The distinguishing feature of most transmission lines is that they have uniform cross sectional dimensions along their length, giving them a uniform ''[[Electrical impedance|impedance]]'', called the [[characteristic impedance]],&lt;ref name="Oklobdzija" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guru"&gt;{{cite book

Transmission lines become necessary when the transmitted frequency's wavelength is sufficiently short that the length of the cable becomes a significant part of a wavelength.

At [[microwave]] frequencies and above, power losses in transmission lines become excessive, and [[waveguide]]s are used instead,&lt;ref name="Jackman" /&gt; which function as "pipes" to confine and guide the electromagnetic waves.&lt;ref name="Raisanen" /&gt;  Some sources define waveguides as a type of transmission line;&lt;ref name="Raisanen" /&gt; however, this article will not include them.  At even higher frequencies, in the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]], [[infrared]] and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] ranges, waveguides in turn become lossy, and [[optics|optical]] methods, (such as lenses and mirrors), are used to guide electromagnetic waves.&lt;ref name="Raisanen" /&gt;

The theory of [[sound wave]] propagation is very similar mathematically to that of electromagnetic waves, so techniques from transmission line theory are also used to build structures to conduct acoustic waves; and these are called [[acoustic transmission line]]s.

==History==

Mathematical analysis of the behaviour of electrical transmission lines grew out of the work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Lord Kelvin]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]].  In 1855 Lord Kelvin formulated a diffusion model of the current in a submarine cable.  The model correctly predicted the poor performance of the 1858 trans-Atlantic [[Submarine communications cable|submarine telegraph cable]].  In 1885 Heaviside published the first papers that described his analysis of propagation in cables and the modern form of the [[telegrapher's equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Weber and Frederik Nebeker, ''The Evolution of Electrical Engineering'', IEEE Press, Piscataway, New Jersey USA, 1994  {{ISBN|0-7803-1066-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==

In many [[electric circuit]]s, the length of the wires connecting the components can for the most part be ignored. That is, the voltage on the wire at a given time can be assumed to be the same at all points. However, when the voltage changes in a time interval comparable to the time it takes for the signal to travel down the wire, the length becomes important and the wire must be treated as a transmission line. Stated another way, the length of the wire is important when the signal includes [[Harmonic analysis|frequency components]] with corresponding [[wavelength]]s comparable to or less than the length of the wire.

A common rule of thumb is that the cable or wire should be treated as a transmission line if the length is greater than 1/10 of the wavelength. At this length the phase delay and the interference of any reflections on the line become important and can lead to unpredictable behaviour in systems which have not been carefully designed using transmission line theory.

==The four terminal model==

[[Image:Transmission line symbols.svg|thumb|Variations on the [[electronic schematic|schematic]] [[electronic symbol]] for a transmission line.]]

For the purposes of analysis, an electrical transmission line can be modelled as a [[two-port network]] (also called a quadripole), as follows:

[[Image:Transmission line 4 port.svg]]

In the simplest case, the network is assumed to be linear (i.e. the [[complex number|complex]] voltage across either port is proportional to the complex current flowing into it when there are no reflections), and the two ports are assumed to be interchangeable.  If the transmission line is uniform along its length, then its behaviour is largely described by a single parameter called the ''[[characteristic impedance]]'', symbol Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This is the ratio of the complex voltage of a given wave to the complex current of the same wave at any point on the line. Typical values of Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are 50 or 75 [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s for a [[coaxial cable]], about 100 ohms for a twisted pair of wires, and about 300 ohms for a common type of untwisted pair used in radio transmission.

When sending power down a transmission line, it is usually desirable that as much power as possible will be absorbed by the load and as little as possible will be reflected back to the source.  This can be ensured by making the load impedance equal to Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, in which case the transmission line is said to be ''[[impedance matching|matched]]''.

[[File:TransmissionLineDefinitions.svg|thumb|310px|A transmission line is drawn as two black wires. At a distance ''x'' into the line, there is current ''I(x)'' travelling through each wire, and there is a voltage difference ''V(x)'' between the wires. If the current and voltage come from a single wave (with no reflection), then ''V''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''I''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''[[characteristic impedance]]'' of the line.]]

Some of the power that is fed into a transmission line is lost because of its resistance.  This effect is called ''ohmic'' or ''resistive'' loss (see [[ohmic heating]]).  At high frequencies, another effect called ''dielectric loss'' becomes significant, adding to the losses caused by resistance.  Dielectric loss is caused when the insulating material inside the transmission line absorbs energy from the alternating electric field and converts it to [[heat]] (see [[dielectric heating]]). The transmission line is modelled with a resistance (R) and inductance (L) in series with a capacitance (C) and conductance (G) in parallel. The resistance and conductance contribute to the loss in a transmission line.

The total loss of power in a transmission line is often specified in [[decibels]] per [[metre]] (dB/m), and usually depends on the frequency of the signal.  The manufacturer often supplies a chart showing the loss in dB/m at a range of frequencies.  A loss of 3&amp;nbsp;dB corresponds approximately to a halving of the power.

High-frequency transmission lines can be defined as those designed to carry electromagnetic waves whose [[wavelength]]s are shorter than or comparable to the length of the line.  Under these conditions, the approximations useful for calculations at lower frequencies are no longer accurate.  This often occurs with [[radio]], [[microwave]] and [[light|optical]] signals, [[metal mesh optical filters]], and with the signals found in high-speed [[digital circuit]]s.

==Telegrapher's equations==
{{Main|Telegrapher's equations}}
{{See also|Reflections on copper lines}}

The '''telegrapher's equations''' (or just '''telegraph equations''') are a pair of linear differential equations which describe the [[voltage]] (&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) and [[Electric current|current]] (&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;) on an electrical transmission line with distance and time. They were developed by [[Oliver Heaviside]] who created the ''transmission line model'', and are based on [[Maxwell's Equations]].

[[Image:Transmission line element.svg|thumb|right|250px|Schematic representation of the elementary component of a transmission line.]]
The transmission line model is an example of the [[distributed element model]]. It represents the transmission line as an infinite series of two-port elementary components, each representing an infinitesimally short segment of the transmission line:

* The distributed resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the conductors is represented by a series resistor (expressed in [[ohm]]s per unit length).
* The distributed inductance &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (due to the [[magnetic field]] around the wires, [[self-inductance]], etc.) is represented by a series [[inductor]] (in [[Henry (unit)|henries]] per unit length).
* The capacitance &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; between the two conductors is represented by a [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] [[capacitor]] (in [[farad]]s per unit length).
* The [[Electric conductance|conductance]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of the dielectric material separating the two conductors is represented by a shunt resistor between the signal wire and the return wire (in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per unit length).

The model consists of an ''infinite series'' of the elements shown in the figure, and the values of the components are specified ''per unit length'' so the picture of the component can be misleading. &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; may also be functions of frequency. An alternative notation is to use &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; to emphasize that the values are derivatives with respect to length.  These quantities can also be known as the [[primary line constants]] to distinguish from the secondary line constants derived from them, these being the [[propagation constant]], [[attenuation constant]] and [[phase constant]].

The line voltage &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the current &lt;math&gt;I(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the frequency domain as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x} = -(R + j\,\omega\,L)\,I(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial I(x)}{\partial x} = -(G + j\,\omega\,C)\,V(x) ~\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Special case of a lossless line===
When the elements &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are negligibly small the transmission line is considered as a lossless structure. In this hypothetical case, the model depends only on the &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; elements which greatly simplifies the analysis. For a lossless transmission line, the second order steady-state Telegrapher's equations are:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 V(x)}{\partial x^2}+ \omega^2 L\,C\,V(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 I(x)}{\partial x^2} + \omega^2 L\,C\,I(x) = 0 ~\,.&lt;/math&gt;

These are [[wave equation]]s which have [[plane wave]]s with equal propagation speed in the forward and reverse directions as solutions. The physical significance of this is that electromagnetic waves propagate down transmission lines and in general, there is a reflected component that interferes with the original signal. These equations are fundamental to transmission line theory.

===General case of a line with losses===
In the general case the loss terms, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, are both included, and the full form of the Telegrapher's equations become:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 V(x)}{\partial x^2} = \gamma^2 V(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 I(x)}{\partial x^2} = \gamma^2 I(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the ([[complex number|complex]]) [[propagation constant]]. These equations are fundamental to transmission line theory. They are also [[wave equation]]s, and have solutions similar to the special case, but which are a mixture of sines and cosines with exponential decay factors. Solving for the propagation constant &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the primary parameters &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \sqrt{(R + j\,\omega\,L)(G + j\,\omega\,C)\,}&lt;/math&gt;

and the characteristic impedance can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{R + j\,\omega\,L}{G + j\,\omega\,C}\,} ~\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions for &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I(x)&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt;V(x) = V_{(+)} e^{-\gamma\,x} + V_{(-)} e^{+\gamma\,x} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I(x) = \frac{1}{Z_0}\,\left( V_{(+)} e^{-\gamma\,x} - V_{(-)} e^{+\gamma\,x} \right) ~\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The constants &lt;math&gt;V_{(\pm)}&lt;/math&gt; must be determined from boundary conditions. For a voltage pulse &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{in}}(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;, starting at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; and moving in the positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;direction, then the transmitted pulse &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{out}}(x,t) \,&lt;/math&gt; at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by computing the Fourier Transform, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{in}}(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;, attenuating each frequency component by &lt;math&gt;e^{-\operatorname{Re}(\gamma)\,x} \,&lt;/math&gt;, advancing its phase by &lt;math&gt;-\operatorname{Im}(\gamma)\,x\,&lt;/math&gt;, and taking the [[Fourier inversion theorem|inverse Fourier Transform]]. The real and imaginary parts of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(\gamma) = \alpha = (a^2 + b^2)^{1/4} \cos(\psi ) \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}(\gamma) = \beta = (a^2 + b^2)^{1/4} \sin(\psi) \,&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;a ~ \equiv ~ R\, G\, - \omega^2 L\,C\ ~ = ~ \omega^2 L\,C\,\left[ \left( \frac{R}{\omega L} \right) \left( \frac{G}{\omega C} \right) - 1 \right] &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;b ~ \equiv ~ \omega\,C\,R + \omega\,L\,G ~ = ~ \omega^2 L\,C\,\left( \frac{R}{\omega\,L} + \frac{G}{\omega\,C} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

the right-hand expressions holding when neither &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, nor  &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, nor &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is zero, and with

:&lt;math&gt;\psi ~ \equiv ~ \tfrac{1}{2}\operatorname{atan2}(b,a)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where [[atan2]] is the everywhere-defined form of two-parameter arctangent function, with arbitrary value zero when both arguments are zero.

===Special, low loss case===
For small losses and high frequencies, the general equations can be simplified: If &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{R}{\omega\,L} \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{G}{\omega\,C} \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Re}(\gamma) = \alpha \approx \tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{L\,C\,}\,\left( \frac{R}{L} + \frac{G}{C} \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}(\gamma) = \beta \approx \omega\,\sqrt{L\,C\,} ~.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that an advance in phase by &lt;math&gt;- \omega\,\delta&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a time delay by &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V_{out}(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be simply computed as

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{out}}(x,t) \approx V_{\mathrm{in}}(t - \sqrt{L\,C\,}\,x)\,e^{- \tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{L\,C\,}\,\left( \frac{R}{L} + \frac{G}{C} \right)\,x }. \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Heaviside condition===
The [[Heaviside condition]] is a special case where the wave travels down the line without any [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] distortion.  The condition for this to take place is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {G}{C} = \frac {R}{L} &lt;/math&gt;

==Input impedance of transmission line==
[[File:SmithChartLineLength.svg|thumb|350px|Looking towards a load through a length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; of lossless transmission line, the impedance changes as &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; increases, following the blue circle on this [[Smith chart|impedance Smith chart]]. (This impedance is characterized by its [[reflection coefficient]], which is the reflected voltage divided by the incident voltage.) The blue circle, centred within the chart, is sometimes called an ''SWR circle'' (short for ''constant [[standing wave ratio]]'').]]

The [[characteristic impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of a transmission line is the ratio of the amplitude of a ''single'' voltage wave to its current wave. Since most transmission lines also have a reflected wave, the characteristic impedance is generally not the impedance that is measured on the line.

The impedance measured at a given distance &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; from the load impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{in}\left(\ell\right)=\frac{V(\ell)}{I(\ell)} = Z_0 \frac{1 + \mathit{\Gamma}_\mathrm{L} e^{-2 \gamma \ell}}{1 - \mathit{\Gamma}_\mathrm{L} e^{-2 \gamma \ell}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the propagation constant and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{\Gamma}_\mathrm{L} = \frac{\,Z_\mathrm{L} - Z_0\,}{Z_\mathrm{L} + Z_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage [[reflection coefficient]] measured at the load end of the transmission line. Alternatively, the above formula can be rearranged to express the input impedance in terms of the load impedance rather than the load voltage reflection coefficient:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{in}(\ell) = Z_0\,\frac{Z_\mathrm{L} + Z_0 \tanh\left(\gamma \ell\right)}{Z_0 + Z_\mathrm{L}\,\tanh\left(\gamma \ell \right)}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Input impedance of lossless transmission line===
For a lossless transmission line, the propagation constant is purely imaginary, &lt;math&gt;\gamma = j\,\beta&lt;/math&gt;, so the above formulas can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;
Z_\mathrm{in}(\ell) = Z_0 \frac{Z_\mathrm{L} + j\,Z_0\,\tan(\beta \ell)}{Z_0 + j\,Z_\mathrm{L}\tan(\beta \ell)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{\,2 \pi\,}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavenumber]].

In calculating &lt;math&gt;\beta,&lt;/math&gt; the wavelength is generally different ''inside'' the transmission line to what it would be in free-space. Consequently, the velocity constant of the material the transmission line is made of needs to be taken into account when doing such a calculation.

===Special cases of lossless transmission lines===
====Half wave length====
For the special case where &lt;math&gt;\beta\,\ell= n\,\pi&lt;/math&gt; where n is an integer (meaning that the length of the line is a multiple of half a wavelength), the expression reduces to the load impedance so that
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{in} = Z_\mathrm{L} \,&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;n\,.&lt;/math&gt; This includes the case when &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that the length of the transmission line is negligibly small compared to the wavelength. The physical significance of this is that the transmission line can be ignored (i.e. treated as a wire) in either case.

====Quarter wave length====
{{Main|quarter wave impedance transformer}}
For the case where the length of the line is one quarter wavelength long, or an odd multiple of a quarter wavelength long, the input impedance becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
Z_\mathrm{in}=\frac{Z_0^2}{Z_\mathrm{L}} ~\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

====Matched load====
Another special case is when the load impedance is equal to the characteristic impedance of the line (i.e. the line is ''matched''), in which case the impedance reduces to the characteristic impedance of the line so that
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{in}=Z_\mathrm{L}=Z_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

====Short====
[[File:Transmission line animation open short2.gif|thumb|right|300px|[[Standing wave]]s on a transmission line with an open-circuit load (top), and a short-circuit load (bottom). Black dots represent electrons, and the arrows show the electric field.]]
{{main|stub (electronics)#Short circuited stub|l1=stub}}
For the case of a shorted load (i.e. &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{L} = 0&lt;/math&gt;), the input impedance is purely imaginary and a periodic function of position and wavelength (frequency)

:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{in}(\ell) = j\,Z_0\,\tan(\beta \ell). \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Open====
{{main|stub (electronics)#Open_circuited_stub|l1=stub}}
For the case of an open load (i.e. &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{L} = \infty&lt;/math&gt;), the input impedance is once again imaginary and periodic

:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{in}(\ell) = -j\,Z_0 \cot(\beta \ell). \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Stepped transmission line===
[[Image:Segments.jpg|thumb|left|A simple example of stepped transmission line consisting of three segments.]]A stepped transmission line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.jmr.2009.04.005 |title=Journal of Magnetic Resonance – Impedance matching with an adjustable segmented transmission line | volume=199 |journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance |pages=104–110|bibcode=2009JMagR.199..104Q }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for broad range [[impedance matching]]. It can be considered as multiple transmission line segments connected in series, with the characteristic impedance of each individual element to be &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{0,i}&lt;/math&gt;. The input impedance can be obtained from the successive application of the chain relation

:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{i+1} = Z_\mathrm{0,i}\,\frac{\,Z_\mathrm{i} + j\,Z_\mathrm{0,i}\,\tan(\beta_\mathrm{i} \ell_\mathrm{i})\,}{Z_\mathrm{0,i} + j\,Z_\mathrm{i}\,\tan(\beta_\mathrm{i} \ell_\mathrm{i})}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta_\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave number of the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt;-th transmission line segment and &lt;math&gt;\ell_\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the length of this segment, and &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the front-end impedance that loads the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt;-th segment.

[[Image:PolarSmith.jpg|thumb|The impedance transformation circle along a transmission line whose characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{0,i}&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than that of the input cable &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;. And as a result, the impedance curve is off-centred towards the &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt; axis. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{0,i} &gt; Z_0&lt;/math&gt;, the impedance curve should be off-centred towards the &lt;math&gt;+x&lt;/math&gt; axis.]]
Because the characteristic impedance of each transmission line segment &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{0,i}&lt;/math&gt; is often different from that of the input cable &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;, the impedance transformation circle is off-centred along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis of the [[Smith Chart]] whose impedance representation is usually normalized against &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The stepped transmission line is an example of a [[distributed element circuit]]. A large variety of other circuits can also be constructed with transmission lines including [[distributed element filter|filters]], [[power dividers and directional couplers]].

==Practical types==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Wikipedia:Proposed mergers]] --&gt;

===Coaxial cable===
{{Main|coaxial cable}}
Coaxial lines confine virtually all of the electromagnetic wave to the area inside the cable. Coaxial lines can therefore be bent and twisted (subject to limits) without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents in them.
In radio-frequency applications up to a few gigahertz, the wave propagates in the [[transverse wave|transverse]] electric and magnetic mode (TEM) only, which means that the electric and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to the direction of propagation (the electric field is radial, and the magnetic field is circumferential). However, at frequencies for which the wavelength (in the dielectric) is significantly shorter than the circumference of the cable other [[transverse mode]]s can propagate. These modes are classified into two groups, transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) [[waveguide]] modes. When more than one mode can exist, bends and other irregularities in the cable geometry can cause power to be transferred from one mode to another.

The most common use for coaxial cables is for television and other signals with bandwidth of multiple megahertz. In the middle 20th&amp;nbsp;century they carried [[long distance telephone]] connections.

===Planar lines===
{{main|Planar transmission line}}

====Microstrip====
[[Image:Solec Kujawski longwave antenna feeder.jpg|thumb|right|A type of transmission line called a ''cage line'', used for high power, low frequency applications. It functions similarly to a large coaxial cable. This example is the antenna [[feed line]] for a [[longwave]] radio transmitter in [[Poland]], which operates at a frequency of 225&amp;nbsp;kHz and a power of 1200&amp;nbsp;kW.]]
{{Main|microstrip}}
A microstrip circuit uses a thin flat conductor which is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to a [[ground plane]]. Microstrip can be made by having a strip of copper on one side of a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) or ceramic substrate while the other side is a continuous ground plane. The width of the strip, the thickness of the insulating layer (PCB or ceramic) and the [[dielectric constant]] of the insulating layer determine the characteristic impedance. Microstrip is an open structure whereas coaxial cable is a closed structure.

====Stripline====
{{main|Stripline}}
A stripline circuit uses a flat strip of metal which is sandwiched between two parallel ground planes. The insulating material of the substrate forms a dielectric. The width of the strip, the thickness of the substrate and the relative permittivity of the substrate determine the characteristic impedance of the strip which is a transmission line.

====Coplanar waveguide====
{{main|Coplanar waveguide}}
A coplanar waveguide consists of a center strip and two adjacent outer conductors, all three of them flat structures that are deposited onto the same insulating substrate and thus are located in the same plane ("coplanar"). The width of the center conductor, the distance between inner and outer conductors, and the relative permittivity of the substrate determine the characteristic impedance of the coplanar transmission line.

===Balanced lines===
{{Main|Balanced line}}
A balanced line is a transmission line consisting of two conductors of the same type, and equal impedance to ground and other circuits.  There are many formats of balanced lines, amongst the most common are twisted pair, star quad and twin-lead.

====Twisted pair====
{{Main|Twisted pair}}
Twisted pairs are commonly used for terrestrial [[telephone]] communications.  In such cables, many pairs are grouped together in a single cable, from two to several thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Syed V. Ahamed, Victor B. Lawrence, ''Design and engineering of intelligent communication systems'', pp.130–131, Springer, 1997 {{ISBN|0-7923-9870-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The format is also used for data network distribution inside buildings, but the cable is more expensive because the transmission line parameters are tightly controlled.

====Star quad====
{{Main|Star quad cable}}
Star quad is a four-conductor cable in which all four conductors are twisted together around the cable axis.  It is sometimes used for two circuits, such as [[4-wire]] telephony and other telecommunications applications.  In this configuration each pair uses two non-adjacent conductors.  Other times it is used for a single, [[balanced line]], such as audio applications and [[2-wire]] telephony.  In this configuration two non-adjacent conductors are terminated together at both ends of the cable, and the other two conductors are also terminated together.

When used for two circuits, crosstalk is reduced relative to cables with two separate twisted pairs.

When used for a single, [[balanced line]], magnetic interference picked up by the cable arrives as a virtually perfect common mode signal, which is easily removed by coupling transformers.

The combined benefits of twisting, balanced signalling, and quadrupole pattern give outstanding noise immunity, especially advantageous for low signal level applications such as microphone cables, even when installed very close to a power cable.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://benchmarkmedia.com/blogs/application_notes/116637511-the-importance-of-star-quad-microphone-cable The Importance of Star-Quad Microphone Cable]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.canare.com/UploadedDocuments/A%20Technical%20Paper%20-%20Evaluating%20Microphone%20Cable%20Perfrmance%20and%20Specifications.pdf Evaluating Microphone Cable Performance &amp; Specifications]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.canare.com/UploadedDocuments/Cat11_p35.pdf The Star Quad Story]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov09/articles/qa1109_4.htm What's Special About Star-Quad Cable?]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.belden.com/blog/broadcastav/How-Starquad-Works.cfm How Starquad Works]''&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantage is that star quad, in combining two conductors, typically has double the capacitance of similar two-conductor twisted and shielded audio cable. High capacitance causes increasing distortion and greater loss of high frequencies as distance increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lampen|first=Stephen H.|title=Audio/Video Cable Installer's Pocket Guide|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0071386211|pages=32, 110, 112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Ray|title=Eargle's The Microphone Book: From Mono to Stereo to Surround – A Guide to Microphone Design and Application|edition=3|year=2011|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=0240820754|pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twin-lead====
{{Main|Twin-lead}}
Twin-lead consists of a pair of conductors held apart by a continuous insulator.  By holding the conductors a known distance apart, the geometry is fixed and the line characteristics are reliably consistent.  It is lower loss than coaxial cable because the wave propagates mostly in air rather than the thin dielectric.  However, it is more susceptible to interference.

====Lecher lines====
{{Main|Lecher lines}}
Lecher lines are a form of parallel conductor that can be used at [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] for creating resonant circuits.  They are a convenient practical format that fills the gap between [[Lumped element model|lumped]] components (used at [[High frequency|HF]]/[[VHF]]) and [[Resonant cavity|resonant cavities]] (used at [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]/[[Super high frequency|SHF]]).

===Single-wire line===
[[Unbalanced line]]s were formerly much used for telegraph transmission, but this form of communication has now fallen into disuse.  Cables are similar to twisted pair in that many cores are bundled into the same cable but only one conductor is provided per circuit and there is no twisting.  All the circuits on the same route use a common path for the return current (earth return).  There is a [[Electric power transmission|power transmission]] version of [[single-wire earth return]] in use in many locations.

==General applications==

===Signal transfer===

Electrical transmission lines are very widely used to transmit high frequency signals over long or short distances with minimum power loss.  One familiar example is the [[down lead]] from a TV or radio [[Antenna (radio)|aerial]] to the receiver.

===Pulse generation===

Transmission lines are also used as pulse generators. By charging the transmission line and then discharging it into a [[resistive]] load, a rectangular pulse equal in length to twice the [[electrical length]] of the line can be obtained, although with half the voltage. A [[Blumlein transmission line]] is a related pulse forming device that overcomes this limitation. These are sometimes used as the [[pulsed power]] sources for [[radar]] [[transmitters]] and other devices.

===Stub filters===
{{see also|Distributed element filter#Stub band-pass filters}}
If a short-circuited or open-circuited transmission line is wired in parallel with a line used to transfer signals from point A to point B, then it will function as a filter. The method for making stubs is similar to the method for using Lecher lines for crude frequency measurement, but it is 'working backwards'. One method recommended in the [[Radio Society of Great Britain|RSGB]]'s radiocommunication handbook is to take an open-circuited length of transmission line wired in parallel with the [[feed line|feeder]] delivering signals from an aerial. By cutting the free end of the transmission line, a minimum in the strength of the signal observed at a receiver can be found. At this stage the stub filter will reject this frequency and the odd harmonics, but if the free end of the stub is shorted then the stub will become a filter rejecting the even harmonics.

==Acoustic transmission lines==
{{Main|Acoustic transmission line}}

An [[acoustics|acoustic]] transmission line is the acoustic [[analogy|analogue]] of the electrical transmission line as a waveguide. It is typically imagined as a rigid-walled tube that is long and thin relative to the wavelength of sound present in it.

'''Enno Friedrich Wichard Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff''' (22 December 1848 &amp;ndash; 25 September 1931) was a German [[Classical philology|classical philologist]]. Wilamowitz, as he is known in scholarly circles, was a renowned authority on [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|its literature]].

== Life ==

=== Youth ===
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff was born in [[Markowice, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Markowitz (Markowice)]], a small village near [[Inowrocław|Hohensalza (Inowrocław)]], in the then [[Province of Posen]] (now part of the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]]), to a [[Germanization|Germanized]] family of distant [[Poles|Polish]] ancestry. His father, a [[Prussian Junker]], was Arnold Wilamowitz, of [[Szlachta]] origin and using the [[Ogończyk coat of arms]], while his mother was Ulrika, née Calbo. The couple settled in a small manor confiscated from a local noble in 1836. The Prussian part of their name, von Moellendorf, was acquired in 1813, when Prussian field marshal [[Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf]] adopted Ulrich's ancestors. Wilamowitz, a third child, grew up in [[East Prussia]].

In 1867 Wilamowitz passed his ''[[Abitur]]'' at the renowned boarding school at [[Schulpforta]].

=== Studies ===
Until 1869 Wilamowitz studied [[Classical Philology]] at the [[University of Bonn]]. His teachers, [[Otto Jahn]] and [[Hermann Usener]], had a formative influence on him. Willamowitz's relationship with Usener was strained. He developed a lifelong rivalry with his fellow student [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and a close friendship with his contemporary [[Hermann Diels]]. Together with Diels, he moved to [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] in 1869, where he graduated as a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] [[cum laude]] in 1870. After voluntary service in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he embarked on a study tour to Italy and Greece.

=== Conflict with Nietzsche and Wagner ===
Even before he gained a professorial title, Wilamowitz was a member of a scholarly dispute about Nietzsche's ''[[Birth of Tragedy]]'' that attracted much attention. In 1872–73, he published two unusually aggressive polemics ([[German language|German]]: ''"Zukunftsphilologie"'', i.e. ''"Philology of the future"''), which strongly attacked Nietzsche (then Professor at the [[University of Basel]]) and Professor [[Erwin Rohde]] ([[University of Kiel]]). [[Richard Wagner]], whose views on art had influenced Nietzsche and Rohde, reacted by publishing an [[open letter]] and Rohde wrote a damning response. The issue at stake was the deprecation of [[Euripides]], on whom Nietzsche blamed the destruction of [[Greek tragedy]]. Wilamowitz saw the methods of his adversaries as an attack on the basic tenets of scientific thought, unmasking them as enemies of the [[scientific method]]. His polemic was considered as Classical philology's reply to Nietzsche's challenge.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Silk &amp; [[J. P. Stern]], ''Nietzsche on Tragedy'', Cambridge University Press, 1981 pp.90-106&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 80 when Wilamowitz wrote his memoirs, he saw the conflict with Nietzsche less passionately, but did not retract the essential points of his critique. He stated that he had not fully realised at the time that Nietzsche was not interested in scientific understanding but rather in Wagner's musical drama, but also that he was nevertheless right to take his position against Nietzsche's "rape of historical facts and all [[historical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wilt Aden Schröder: "Fünf Briefe des Verlegers Eduard Eggers an Wilamowitz, betreffend die Zukunftsphilologie! und die Analecta Euripidea", in: ''Eikasmos'' '''12''' (2001:367-383) p. 373f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greifswald ===
[[File:Wilamowitz Young.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wilamowitz in Greifswald (1878)]]
In 1875, he gained a professorial title for his study ''Analecta Euripidea''. In the same year he gave his first public academic lecture in Berlin. In 1876, he was employed as ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) for Classical Philology at [[University of Greifswald|Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität]] at [[Greifswald]]. During this period, he also married Marie Mommsen, the eldest daughter of [[Theodor Mommsen]], and published ''Homeric Studies'' (''Homerische Studien'').

=== Göttingen ===
In 1883, he took a further professorial position at [[Göttingen University|Georg-August-Universität]] in [[Göttingen]]. Here, he continued to teach Classical Philology but also gave replacement lectures in [[Ancient History]]. His influence ensured the employment of his Greifswald colleague, [[Julius Wellhausen]], in Göttingen. In 1891, he became vice-chancellor of the university, and he was appointed a member of Göttingen's Royal Academy of Sciences one year later. When Wilamowitz left Göttingen, he was succeeded by [[Georg Kaibel]], a close associate from his student days and his successor at Greifswald.

=== Berlin ===
In 1897, with the support of his friend Diels, Wilamowitz was offered a position at the Royal [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] at Berlin, as successor to [[Ernst Curtius]]. He stayed until his retirement in 1921. In 1915, he was appointed chancellor of the university for one year. Together with Diels, he founded the Berlin Institute for Ancient Studies (''Institut für Altertumskunde'') in 1897. His public lectures on subjects of [[Classical antiquity]], which took place twice a week, attracted large audiences.

=== Teaching activities and memberships ===
In 1891, Wilamowitz was elected a corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and he was a full member from 1899. In 1902 he took the academy's presidency. As a member of the Göttingen academy, he strongly encouraged the publication of the ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Latinae]]''. From 1897 he also worked as a member to the academy's Commission for [[Patristics]]. In 1894 he was elected full member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]]. He also was editor of the series ''Philologische Untersuchungen'' from 1880 to 1925.

Further, Wilamowitz taught as a guest lecturer in [[Oxford]] (1908) and [[Uppsala]] (1912), was a corresponding member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] (1909) and the Scientific Society of [[Lund]] (1921).

===''Inscriptiones Graecae''===
During his presidency of the Prussian Academy, Wilamowitz oversaw the continuation of [[August Böckh]]'s and [[Adolf Kirchhoff]]'s publication series, the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]''. Wilamowitz had a formative influence on the further development of that project, which he directed until his death.

=== World War I ===
Wilamowitz was an initiator of the memorandum ''Erklärung der Hochschullehrer des Deutschen Reiches'' ("Declaration by the University Teachers of the German Reich"), in which 3,016 signatories supported German participation in the First World War. Shortly after, he also signed the ''[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]]'', from which he distanced himself later. In 1914, his son, Tycho von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, who was also active as a classical philologist, fell in the battle of [[Dęblin|Ivangorod]]. The memorandum appeared a few days later.

=== Family ===
In 1878 he married Maria Mommsen, the eldest daughter of the famous [[ancient historian]], [[Theodor Mommsen]], whom he actively assisted in the completion of his ''Roman History''.

Wilamowitz spent his last years in seclusion, suffering from severe kidney problems. He died in Berlin on 25 September 1931, having been in a coma for a short time. He is buried in his native village, along with his wife, Maria (1855–1936), and their only son, Tycho. He also had a daughter, Dorothea Freifrau Hiller von Gaertringen, wife of archaeologist [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]], who died on 24 March 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UGv24_aqFs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#PPA92,M1 Greek Literature: Greek literature in the classical period]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
Wilamowitz is one of the central figures of 19th and 20th century Classical philology. As a great authority of the literature and history of [[Ancient Greece]], Wilamowitz took a stance against traditional methodology and [[textual criticism]]. As a representative of Postclassicism, he concentrated less on [[literary history]] but rather aimed to extract biographical information on the respective authors from the preserved texts. Thus, he employed historical perspectives to serve philology. Apart from his seminal general works (''Greek Literature from Antiquity'', ''Hellenistic Poetry''), he published numerous detailed studies of [[Euripides]], [[Homer]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Pindar]] and [[Aristotle]]. As a scientific organiser, he was also responsible for the publication of important standard-setting source material publications, such as ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]''.

He also passionately supported the preservation of Classical education in the German school system.

Notable pupils of his include [[Felix Jacoby]], [[Karl Mittelhaus]], [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]], [[Eduard Fraenkel]], [[Werner Jaeger]], [[Johannes Geffcken]], [[Paul Maas (classical scholar)|Paul Maas]], [[Eduard Schwartz]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[Paul Friedländer (philologist)|Paul Friedländer]], [[Friedrich Solmsen]] and [[Johannes Sykutris]].

In recent decades, the American scholar [[William M. Calder III]] has been publishing a series of important documents about and by Wilamowitz, including much of his correspondence with Diels, [[Eduard Norden]], [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], [[Paul Wendland]], and others.

The '''''Westmorland''''' or '''''Westmoreland'''''&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes referred to as [[His Majesty's Ship|HMS]] Westmoreland/Westmorland.  However, according to ''[[Ships of the Royal Navy]]'', like most other privateers she was never actually [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a 26-gun British [[privateer]] [[frigate]], operating in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] against French shipping in retaliation for France's opposition to Great Britain in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

==Service history==

The most notable incident in the life of the ''Westmorland'' occurred shortly after she sailed for Britain from [[Livorno]] under Captain Michael Wallace late in 1778, carrying a large monetary payment for her inbound cargo of salt cod from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (Livorno was a trade hub for this commodity), food goods,&lt;ref&gt;These included almost 4000 barrels of anchovies, 129 pounds of silk, 150 crates of manna and oil, thirty-four bales of hemp, thirty-two Parmesan cheeses, twenty-two barrels of Tartar salt and medicines and five crates of artificial flowers.&lt;/ref&gt; and 57 crates of artistic objects collected by [[Grand Tour]]ists such as the [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Duke of Gloucester]], [[Sir John Henderson, 5th Baronet|Sir John Henderson]] and the [[Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Including Batoni's portrait of Charles Cecil Roberts and a second portrait called An English Gentleman; sculptures by [[Albacini]] and [[Christopher Hewetson]]; a marble chimney originally destined for the Duke of Gloucester; musical scores, violins, violin strings, hats (two barrels), ornamental fans, expensive books; [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] sketches; specimens of lava from [[Mount Vesuvius]] sent by [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]]; relics; paintings by [[Pompeo Batoni]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], [[Carlo Maratta]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Guercino]], among others; modern copies of [[Raphael]]'s paintings; drawings by artists working in Rome, including [[John Robert Cozens]]; 23 crates of ancient Roman marble statues and fragments, plus modern plaster casts; other carved marble mantelpieces, slabs of coloured marble for table-tops, full-sized Piranesi-like "vasi candelabri", 84 rolls of deluxe blank Genoa paper, a crate of flowering onion bulbs and seeds; boxes of pomade, sweetmeats and citrus-blossom water, four barrels of Madeira, and a double-barreled rifle.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1779,&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez-Jáuregui and Wilcox. ''The English Prize: The Capture of the Westmorland, An Episode of the Grand Tour.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; she was given chase by four French ships, comprising two men-of-war, the [[French ship Caton (1778)|''Caton'']] (64) and the [[French ship Destin (1778)|''Destin'']] (74), and two smaller vessels.  Wallace attempted to outsail them but, outgunned as he was, soon felt he had little option but to allow the French to board his ship. She was then allowed by Spain (then friendly with France though not yet&amp;nbsp;— in formal terms at least&amp;nbsp;— at war with Britain) to continue to [[Málaga]].

[[File:Mengs, Perseus befreit Andromeda.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Perseus And Andromeda'' by Mengs, another painting captured from the ''Westmorland'' ([[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]])]]
At Málaga her artistic contents were passed on from the French government to two trading companies with links to Ireland, despite Wallace's protests that the ship was full of "extremely precious goods" (the French had already seized her cash cargo), and the Spanish king was informed by his prime minister, the [[Count of Floridablanca]], of the arrival of the art works. Upon Spain's formal declaration of war, king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] secretly bought the art from a syndicate of Madrid merchants for 360,000 silver [[Spanish real|reales]] (a discount on their original asking price of 600,000 gold [[doubloon]]s, but still a considerable sum) and had it brought by cart to the capital. The portraits of Basset and [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Lewisham]], meanwhile, were acquired by the Spanish Prime Minister.

Although the British consul at [[Cadiz]] had initially informed the [[British Admiralty]] that the ''Westmorland'' and her cargo had been seized as legitimate [[prize ship|prizes]], demands followed from the British ambassador, firmly backed at cabinet level, for the repatriation of the art and (in a prisoner exchange for French and Spanish prisoners taken by the [[Royal Navy]]) the crew of the ''Westmorland''. Yet to this day, all these coveted artistic treasures remain the possession of the [[Prado Museum]], the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Real Academia]], and other Spanish national collections. There were only a few, very limited exceptions: a package of Catholic relics intended for the Duke of Norfolk (which the Spanish returned unopened to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]); and Sir Watkin Williams Wynn's ''Perseus and Andromeda'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs|Mengs]], which ended up in the collection of [[Catherine the Great]] at the [[Hermitage Museum]].

In 1784, the £100,000 for which the art had been insured at Livorno were paid out in London.  The ''Westmorland'', for its part, was renamed, re-commissioned into the Spanish fleet, but eventually re-taken in the [[Caribbean]] by the British.

In 2012 an exhibition of many of the art works captured was held at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford University]] and then traveled to the [[Yale Center for British Art]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|title=Revealed: Grand Tour loot of the Presa Inglesa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/nov/20/grand-tour-loot-presa-inglesa|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vickery|first=Amanda|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/04/cargo-culture-grand-tour-unpacked |title=The captured cargo that unpacks the spirit of the grand tour|accessdate=4 August 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez-Jáuregui and Wilcox.

'''Wound contracture''' is a process that may occur during [[wound healing]] when an excess of [[wound contraction]], a normal healing process, leads to physical deformity characterized by skin constriction and functional limitations.&lt;ref name="Sabiston2012"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sabiston | first1 = David C. | last2 = Townsend | first2 = Courtney M. | title = Sabiston textbook of surgery : the biological basis of modern surgical practi | date = 2012 | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | location = Philadelphia, PA | isbn = 978-1-4377-1560-6 | pages = 163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins2010"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Robbins | first1 = Stanley L.
